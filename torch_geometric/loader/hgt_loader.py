class HGTLoader(NodeLoader):
    r"""The Heterogeneous Graph Sampler from the `"Heterogeneous Graph
    Transformer" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01332>`_ paper.
    This loader allows for mini-batch training of GNNs on large-scale graphs
    where full-batch training is not feasible.

    :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HGTLoader` tries to (1) keep a similar
    number of nodes and edges for each type and (2) keep the sampled sub-graph
    dense to minimize the information loss and reduce the sample variance.

    Methodically, :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HGTLoader` keeps track of a
    node budget for each node type, which is then used to determine the
    sampling probability of a node.
    In particular, the probability of sampling a node is determined by the
    number of connections to already sampled nodes and their node degrees.
    With this, :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HGTLoader` will sample a fixed
    amount of neighbors for each node type in each iteration, as given by the
    :obj:`num_samples` argument.

    Sampled nodes are sorted based on the order in which they were sampled.
    In particular, the first :obj:`batch_size` nodes represent the set of
    original mini-batch nodes.

    Args:
        data (Any): A :class:`~torch_geometric.data.Data`,
            :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HeteroData`, or
            (:class:`~torch_geometric.data.FeatureStore`,
            :class:`~torch_geometric.data.GraphStore`) data object.
        num_samples (List[int] or Dict[str, List[int]]): The number of nodes to
            sample in each iteration and for each node type.
            If given as a list, will sample the same amount of nodes for each
            node type.
        input_nodes (str or Tuple[str, torch.Tensor]): The indices of nodes for
            which neighbors are sampled to create mini-batches.
            Needs to be passed as a tuple that holds the node type and
            corresponding node indices.
            Node indices need to be either given as a :obj:`torch.LongTensor`
            or :obj:`torch.BoolTensor`.
            If node indices are set to :obj:`None`, all nodes of this specific
            type will be considered.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            an a sampled mini-batch and returns a transformed version.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        transform_sampler_output (callable, optional): A function/transform
            that takes in a :class:`torch_geometric.sampler.SamplerOutput` and
            returns a transformed version. (default: :obj:`None`)
        is_sorted (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, assumes that
            :obj:`edge_index` is sorted by column. This avoids internal
            re-sorting of the data and can improve runtime and memory
            efficiency. (default: :obj:`False`)
        filter_per_worker (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, will filter
            the returned data in each worker's subprocess.
            If set to :obj:`False`, will filter the returned data in the main
            process.
            If set to :obj:`None`, will automatically infer the decision based
            on whether data partially lives on the GPU
            (:obj:`filter_per_worker=True`) or entirely on the CPU
            (:obj:`filter_per_worker=False`).
            There exist different trade-offs for setting this option.
            Specifically, setting this option to :obj:`True` for in-memory
            datasets will move all features to shared memory, which may result
            in too many open file handles. (default: :obj:`None`)
        **kwargs (optional): Additional arguments of
            :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, such as :obj:`batch_size`,
            :obj:`shuffle`, :obj:`drop_last` or :obj:`num_workers`.
