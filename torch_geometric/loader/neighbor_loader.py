class NeighborLoader(NodeLoader):
    r"""A data loader that performs neighbor sampling as introduced in the
    `"Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216>`_ paper.
    This loader allows for mini-batch training of GNNs on large-scale graphs
    where full-batch training is not feasible.

    More specifically, :obj:`num_neighbors` denotes how much neighbors are
    sampled for each node in each iteration.
    :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` takes in this list of
    :obj:`num_neighbors` and iteratively samples :obj:`num_neighbors[i]` for
    each node involved in iteration :obj:`i - 1`.

    Sampled nodes are sorted based on the order in which they were sampled.
    In particular, the first :obj:`batch_size` nodes represent the set of
    original mini-batch nodes.

    .. code-block:: python

        from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid
        from torch_geometric.loader import NeighborLoader

        data = Planetoid(path, name='Cora')[0]

        loader = NeighborLoader(
            data,
            # Sample 30 neighbors for each node for 2 iterations
            num_neighbors=[30] * 2,
            # Use a batch size of 128 for sampling training nodes
            batch_size=128,
            input_nodes=data.train_mask,
        )

        sampled_data = next(iter(loader))
        print(sampled_data.batch_size)
        >>> 128

    By default, the data loader will only include the edges that were
    originally sampled (:obj:`directed = True`).
    This option should only be used in case the number of hops is equivalent to
    the number of GNN layers.
    In case the number of GNN layers is greater than the number of hops,
    consider setting :obj:`directed = False`, which will include all edges
    between all sampled nodes (but is slightly slower as a result).

    Furthermore, :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` works for both
    **homogeneous** graphs stored via :class:`~torch_geometric.data.Data` as
    well as **heterogeneous** graphs stored via
    :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HeteroData`.
    When operating in heterogeneous graphs, up to :obj:`num_neighbors`
    neighbors will be sampled for each :obj:`edge_type`.
    However, more fine-grained control over
    the amount of sampled neighbors of individual edge types is possible:

    .. code-block:: python

        from torch_geometric.datasets import OGB_MAG
        from torch_geometric.loader import NeighborLoader

        hetero_data = OGB_MAG(path)[0]

        loader = NeighborLoader(
            hetero_data,
            # Sample 30 neighbors for each node and edge type for 2 iterations
            num_neighbors={key: [30] * 2 for key in hetero_data.edge_types},
            # Use a batch size of 128 for sampling training nodes of type paper
            batch_size=128,
            input_nodes=('paper', hetero_data['paper'].train_mask),
        )

        sampled_hetero_data = next(iter(loader))
        print(sampled_hetero_data['paper'].batch_size)
        >>> 128

    .. note::

        For an example of using
        :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader`, see
        `examples/hetero/to_hetero_mag.py <https://github.com/pyg-team/
        pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/hetero/to_hetero_mag.py>`_.

    The :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` will return subgraphs
    where global node indices are mapped to local indices corresponding to this
    specific subgraph. However, often times it is desired to map the nodes of
    the current subgraph back to the global node indices. A simple trick to
    achieve this is to include this mapping as part of the :obj:`data` object:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Assign each node its global node index:
        data.n_id = torch.arange(data.num_nodes)

        loader = NeighborLoader(data, ...)
        sampled_data = next(iter(loader))
        print(sampled_data.n_id)

    Args:
        data (torch_geometric.data.Data or torch_geometric.data.HeteroData):
            The :class:`~torch_geometric.data.Data` or
            :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HeteroData` graph object.
        num_neighbors (List[int] or Dict[Tuple[str, str, str], List[int]]): The
            number of neighbors to sample for each node in each iteration.
            In heterogeneous graphs, may also take in a dictionary denoting
            the amount of neighbors to sample for each individual edge type.
            If an entry is set to :obj:`-1`, all neighbors will be included.
        input_nodes (torch.Tensor or str or Tuple[str, torch.Tensor]): The
            indices of nodes for which neighbors are sampled to create
            mini-batches.
            Needs to be either given as a :obj:`torch.LongTensor` or
            :obj:`torch.BoolTensor`.
            If set to :obj:`None`, all nodes will be considered.
            In heterogeneous graphs, needs to be passed as a tuple that holds
            the node type and node indices. (default: :obj:`None`)
        input_time (torch.Tensor, optional): Optional values to override the
            timestamp for the input nodes given in :obj:`input_nodes`. If not
            set, will use the timestamps in :obj:`time_attr` as default (if
            present). The :obj:`time_attr` needs to be set for this to work.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        replace (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, will sample with
            replacement. (default: :obj:`False`)
        directed (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`False`, will include all
            edges between all sampled nodes. (default: :obj:`True`)
        temporal_strategy (string, optional): The sampling strategy when using
            temporal sampling (:obj:`"uniform"`, :obj:`"last"`).
            If set to :obj:`"uniform"`, will sample uniformly across neighbors
            that fulfill temporal constraints.
            If set to :obj:`"last"`, will sample the last `num_neighbors` that
            fulfill temporal constraints.
            (default: :obj:`"uniform"`)
        time_attr (str, optional): The name of the attribute that denotes
            timestamps for the nodes in the graph.
            If set, temporal sampling will be used such that neighbors are
            guaranteed to fulfill temporal constraints, *i.e.* neighbors have
            an earlier timestamp than the center node. (default: :obj:`None`)
        transform (Callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            a sampled mini-batch and returns a transformed version.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        is_sorted (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, assumes that
            :obj:`edge_index` is sorted by column.
            If :obj:`time_attr` is set, additionally requires that rows are
            sorted according to time within individual neighborhoods.
            This avoids internal re-sorting of the data and can improve
            runtime and memory efficiency. (default: :obj:`False`)
        filter_per_worker (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, will filter
            the returning data in each worker's subprocess rather than in the
            main process.
            Setting this to :obj:`True` is generally not recommended:
            (1) it may result in too many open file handles,
            (2) it may slown down data loading,
            (3) it requires operating on CPU tensors.
            (default: :obj:`False`)
        **kwargs (optional): Additional arguments of
            :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, such as :obj:`batch_size`,
            :obj:`shuffle`, :obj:`drop_last` or :obj:`num_workers`.
