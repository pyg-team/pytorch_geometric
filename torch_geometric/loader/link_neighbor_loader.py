class LinkNeighborLoader(LinkLoader):
    r"""A link-based data loader derived as an extension of the node-based
    :class:`torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader`.
    This loader allows for mini-batch training of GNNs on large-scale graphs
    where full-batch training is not feasible.

    More specifically, this loader first selects a sample of edges from the
    set of input edges :obj:`edge_label_index` (which may or not be edges in
    the original graph) and then constructs a subgraph from all the nodes
    present in this list by sampling :obj:`num_neighbors` neighbors in each
    iteration.

    .. code-block:: python

        from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid
        from torch_geometric.loader import LinkNeighborLoader

        data = Planetoid(path, name='Cora')[0]

        loader = LinkNeighborLoader(
            data,
            # Sample 30 neighbors for each node for 2 iterations
            num_neighbors=[30] * 2,
            # Use a batch size of 128 for sampling training nodes
            batch_size=128,
            edge_label_index=data.edge_index,
        )

        sampled_data = next(iter(loader))
        print(sampled_data)
        >>> Data(x=[1368, 1433], edge_index=[2, 3103], y=[1368],
                 train_mask=[1368], val_mask=[1368], test_mask=[1368],
                 edge_label_index=[2, 128])

    It is additionally possible to provide edge labels for sampled edges, which
    are then added to the batch:

    .. code-block:: python

        loader = LinkNeighborLoader(
            data,
            num_neighbors=[30] * 2,
            batch_size=128,
            edge_label_index=data.edge_index,
            edge_label=torch.ones(data.edge_index.size(1))
        )

        sampled_data = next(iter(loader))
        print(sampled_data)
        >>> Data(x=[1368, 1433], edge_index=[2, 3103], y=[1368],
                 train_mask=[1368], val_mask=[1368], test_mask=[1368],
                 edge_label_index=[2, 128], edge_label=[128])

    The rest of the functionality mirrors that of
    :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader`, including support for
    heterogenous graphs.

    .. note::
        Negative sampling is currently implemented in an approximate
        way, *i.e.* negative edges may contain false negatives.

    Args:
        data (Any): A :class:`~torch_geometric.data.Data`,
            :class:`~torch_geometric.data.HeteroData`, or
            (:class:`~torch_geometric.data.FeatureStore`,
            :class:`~torch_geometric.data.GraphStore`) data object.
        num_neighbors (List[int] or Dict[Tuple[str, str, str], List[int]]): The
            number of neighbors to sample for each node in each iteration.
            In heterogeneous graphs, may also take in a dictionary denoting
            the amount of neighbors to sample for each individual edge type.
            If an entry is set to :obj:`-1`, all neighbors will be included.
        edge_label_index (Tensor or EdgeType or Tuple[EdgeType, Tensor]):
            The edge indices for which neighbors are sampled to create
            mini-batches.
            If set to :obj:`None`, all edges will be considered.
            In heterogeneous graphs, needs to be passed as a tuple that holds
            the edge type and corresponding edge indices.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        edge_label (Tensor, optional): The labels of edge indices for
            which neighbors are sampled. Must be the same length as
            the :obj:`edge_label_index`. If set to :obj:`None` its set to
            `torch.zeros(...)` internally. (default: :obj:`None`)
        edge_label_time (Tensor, optional): The timestamps for edge indices
            for which neighbors are sampled. Must be the same length as
            :obj:`edge_label_index`. If set, temporal sampling will be
            used such that neighbors are guaranteed to fulfill temporal
            constraints, *i.e.*, neighbors have an earlier timestamp than
            the ouput edge. The :obj:`time_attr` needs to be set for this
            to work. (default: :obj:`None`)
        replace (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, will sample with
            replacement. (default: :obj:`False`)
        directed (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`False`, will include all
            edges between all sampled nodes. (default: :obj:`True`)
        disjoint (bool, optional): If set to :obj: `True`, each seed node will
            create its own disjoint subgraph.
            If set to :obj:`True`, mini-batch outputs will have a :obj:`batch`
            vector holding the mapping of nodes to their respective subgraph.
            Will get automatically set to :obj:`True` in case of temporal
            sampling. (default: :obj:`False`)
        temporal_strategy (string, optional): The sampling strategy when using
            temporal sampling (:obj:`"uniform"`, :obj:`"last"`).
            If set to :obj:`"uniform"`, will sample uniformly across neighbors
            that fulfill temporal constraints.
            If set to :obj:`"last"`, will sample the last `num_neighbors` that
            fulfill temporal constraints.
            (default: :obj:`"uniform"`)
        neg_sampling (NegativeSampling, optional): The negative sampling
            configuration.
            For negative sampling mode :obj:`"binary"`, samples can be accessed
            via the attributes :obj:`edge_label_index` and :obj:`edge_label` in
            the respective edge type of the returned mini-batch.
            In case :obj:`edge_label` does not exist, it will be automatically
            created and represents a binary classification task (:obj:`0` =
            negative edge, :obj:`1` = positive edge).
            In case :obj:`edge_label` does exist, it has to be a categorical
            label from :obj:`0` to :obj:`num_classes - 1`.
            After negative sampling, label :obj:`0` represents negative edges,
            and labels :obj:`1` to :obj:`num_classes` represent the labels of
            positive edges.
            Note that returned labels are of type :obj:`torch.float` for binary
            classification (to facilitate the ease-of-use of
            :meth:`F.binary_cross_entropy`) and of type
            :obj:`torch.long` for multi-class classification (to facilitate the
            ease-of-use of :meth:`F.cross_entropy`).
            For negative sampling mode :obj:`"triplet"`, samples can be
            accessed via the attributes :obj:`src_index`, :obj:`dst_pos_index`
            and :obj:`dst_neg_index` in the respective node types of the
            returned mini-batch.
            :obj:`edge_label` needs to be :obj:`None` for :obj:`"triplet"`
            negative sampling mode.
            If set to :obj:`None`, no negative sampling strategy is applied.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        neg_sampling_ratio (int or float, optional): The ratio of sampled
            negative edges to the number of positive edges.
            Deprecated in favor of the :obj:`neg_sampling` argument.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        time_attr (str, optional): The name of the attribute that denotes
            timestamps for the nodes in the graph. Only used if
            :obj:`edge_label_time` is set. (default: :obj:`None`)
        transform (Callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            a sampled mini-batch and returns a transformed version.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        transform_sampler_output (Callable, optional): A function/transform
            that takes in a :class:`torch_geometric.sampler.SamplerOutput` and
            returns a transformed version. (default: :obj:`None`)
        is_sorted (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, assumes that
            :obj:`edge_index` is sorted by column.
            If :obj:`time_attr` is set, additionally requires that rows are
            sorted according to time within individual neighborhoods.
            This avoids internal re-sorting of the data and can improve
            runtime and memory efficiency. (default: :obj:`False`)
        filter_per_worker (bool, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, will filter
            the returning data in each worker's subprocess rather than in the
            main process.
            Setting this to :obj:`True` for in-memory datasets is generally not
            recommended:
            (1) it may result in too many open file handles,
            (2) it may slown down data loading,
            (3) it requires operating on CPU tensors.
            (default: :obj:`False`)
        **kwargs (optional): Additional arguments of
            :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, such as :obj:`batch_size`,
            :obj:`shuffle`, :obj:`drop_last` or :obj:`num_workers`.
