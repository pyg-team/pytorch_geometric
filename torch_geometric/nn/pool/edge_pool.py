class EdgePooling(torch.nn.Module):
    r"""The edge pooling operator from the `"Towards Graph Pooling by Edge
    Contraction" <https://graphreason.github.io/papers/17.pdf>`_ and
    `"Edge Contraction Pooling for Graph Neural Networks"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10990>`_ papers.

    In short, a score is computed for each edge.
    Edges are contracted iteratively according to that score unless one of
    their nodes has already been part of a contracted edge.

    To duplicate the configuration from the "Towards Graph Pooling by Edge
    Contraction" paper, use either
    :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_softmax`
    or :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_tanh`, and set
    :obj:`add_to_edge_score` to :obj:`0`.

    To duplicate the configuration from the "Edge Contraction Pooling for
    Graph Neural Networks" paper, set :obj:`dropout` to :obj:`0.2`.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Size of each input sample.
        edge_score_method (function, optional): The function to apply
            to compute the edge score from raw edge scores. By default,
            this is the softmax over all incoming edges for each node.
            This function takes in a :obj:`raw_edge_score` tensor of shape
            :obj:`[num_nodes]`, an :obj:`edge_index` tensor and the number of
            nodes :obj:`num_nodes`, and produces a new tensor of the same size
            as :obj:`raw_edge_score` describing normalized edge scores.
            Included functions are
            :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_softmax`,
            :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_tanh`, and
            :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_sigmoid`.
            (default: :func:`EdgePooling.compute_edge_score_softmax`)
        dropout (float, optional): The probability with
            which to drop edge scores during training. (default: :obj:`0`)
        add_to_edge_score (float, optional): This is added to each
            computed edge score. Adding this greatly helps with unpool
            stability. (default: :obj:`0.5`)
