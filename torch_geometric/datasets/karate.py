    r"""Zachary's karate club network from the `"An Information Flow Model for
    Conflict and Fission in Small Groups"
    <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/jar.33.4.3629752>`_
    paper, containing 34 nodes,
    connected by 156 (undirected and unweighted) edges.
    Every node is labeled by one of four classes obtained via modularity-based
    clustering, following the `"Semi-supervised Classification with Graph
    Convolutional Networks" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907>`_ paper.
    Training is based on a single labeled example per class, *i.e.* a total
    number of 4 labeled nodes.

    Args:
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in an
            :obj:`torch_geometric.data.Data` object and returns a transformed
            version. The data object will be transformed before every access.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
