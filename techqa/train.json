Quick steps to work around the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors during development are provided in the 'Resolving the problem' section, as well as considerations for implementing security in production environments. A summary is also provided of behavior for outbound scenarios with container-managed and component-managed security, as well as inbound behavior for listener ports and activiation specifications \n\nSYMPTOM\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED')\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe two most likely reasons why the connection is refused by MQ are as follows: \n\n 1. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is not known on the server where the MQ queue manager is running, is not authorised to connect to MQ, or is longer than 12 characters and has been truncated.\n    We discuss how this user identifier is obtained and passed over the connection in more detail below.\n    For queue managers running on Windows, the following error might be seen in the MQ error logs for this scenario:\n    AMQ8075: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'wasuser' cannot be obtained.\n    For UNIX no entry in the MQ error logs would be seen by default.\n    See technote MQS_REPORT_NOAUTH environment variable can be used to better diagnose return code 2035 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg21299319] for details of enabling error log entries on all platforms. \n 2. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is a member of the 'mqm' group on the server hosting the MQ queue manager, and a Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) exists that blocks administrative access to the queue manager. WebSphere MQ configures a CHLAUTH record by default in WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 and later that blocks all MQ admins from connecting as a client to the queue manager.\n    The following error in the MQ error logs would be seen for this scenario:\n    AMQ9777: Channel was blocked\n\nSee the Error logs on Windows, UNIX and Linux systems [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r5\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.tro.doc\/q039560_.htm] section of the MQ Information Center for the location of the MQ error logs. \nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo understand the cause of the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED reason code, you need to understand what username (and password) is being used by MQ to authorise the application server. \n\nPlease note that WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier does not provide any out-of-the box password authentication system for client connections.\nPassword authentication is provided out of the box in IBM MQ V8.0. More details on the new IBM MQ V8.0 security features are available in this presentation [https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MoragHughson\/websphere-mq-v8-security-deep-dive]. \n\nFor WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier, this means that while the understanding provided in this technote over how usernames\/passwords are passed from the application server to MQ is helpful for development environments, solving the security requirements of production environments usually also requires one of the following approaches: \n\n * Mutual SSL\/TLS authentication.\n   MQ provides out-of-the-box features to authenticate a remotely attaching client using the digital certificate they provide for SSL\/TLS transport security. For example by configuring an SSLPEER rule on the SVRCONN channel to match the Distinguished Name in the certificate of the WebSphere Application Server, and establishing trust in the issuer of that certificate. \n * A custom, or 3rd party supplied, WebSphere MQ Security Exit\n   A security exit can be written for MQ that performs username and password authentication against a repository, such as the local operating system on the MQ server, or an LDAP repository.\n   When using a security exit for authentication it is important that SSL\/TLS transport security is still configured, to ensure passwords are not sent in plain text.\n\n\nMCA user ID (MCAUSER) configured on the Server Connection (SVRCONN) channel If an MCAUSER is configured on the SVRCONN channel that the application server is using to connect, and no security exit or mapping Channel Authentication Record is installed, then this overrides the username provided by the application server. \n\nIt is common practice for many customers to set an MCAUSER on every SVRCONN channel, and use mutual SSL\/TLS authentication exclusively for authentication. \n\nDefault behaviour when no credentials are supplied in the application server \n\nIf no credentials are supplied by the application on the createConnection call, and neither of the component managed or container managed security systems described below are configured, then WebSphere Application Server provides a blank username to MQ. This causes MQ to authorise the client based on the userid that the MQ listener is running under. In the majority of cases this is 'mqm' on UNIX\/Linux systems and 'MUSR_MQADMIN' on Windows. \n\nAs these are administrative MQ users, they will be blocked by default in WebSphere MQ V7.1 and higher, with a AMQ9777 error logged in the error logs of the queue manager. \n\nContainer-managed security for outbound connections \n\nThe recommended way to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server for outbound connections, is to use container-managed security. Outbound connections are those created using a Connection Factory, rather than a Listener Port or Activation Specification. \n\nUsernames of 12 characters or less are passed to MQ by the appliaction server. Usernames longer than 12 characters in length will be truncated, either during authorisation (on UNIX), or in the MQMD of messages that are sent. \n\nContainer-managed security means that the deployment descriptor, or EJB 3.0 annotations, of the application declare a resource reference with authentication type set to Container. \n\nThen when the application looks up the Connection Factory in JNDI, it does so indirectly via the resource reference. For example an EJB 2.1 application would perform a JNDI lookup as follows, where \"jms\/MyResourceRef\" has been declared as a resource reference in the deployment descriptor: \n\nConnectionFactory myCF = (ConnectionFactory)ctx.lookup(\"java:comp\/env\/jms\/MyResourceRef\") \n\nAn EJB 3.0 application might declare an annotated object property on the bean as follows:\n@Resource(name = \"jms\/MyResourceRef\", \nauthenticationType = AuthenticationType.CONTAINER)\nprivate javax.jms.ConnectionFactory myCF; \n\nWhen the application is deployed by an administrator, they bind this authentication alias to an actual Connection Factory that has been created in JNDI, and assign it a J2C authentication alias on deployment. \n\nIt is the username and password contained in this authentication alias that is then passed to MQ\/JMS by the application server when the application connects. This approach puts the administrator in control of which username and password is used by each application, and prevents a different application from looking up the connection factory in JNDI directly to connect with the same username and password. \n\nA default container-managed authentication alias can be supplied on the configuration panels in the administrative console for MQ connection factories. This default will only be used in the case that an application uses a resource reference configured for container-managed security, but the administrator has not bound it to an authentication alias during deployment. A screen shot is provided below:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] \n\nDefault component-managed authentication alias for outbound connections \n\nFor cases where it is impractical to change the application to use container-managed security, or to change it to supply a username and password directly on the createConnection call, it is possible to supply a default. \n\nThis default is called the \"component-managed authentication alias\" and cannot be configured via the administrative console (since WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 when it was removed from the panels MQ connection factories). The below scripting samples show how to configure it using wsadmin: \n\n * JACL:\n   wsadmin>set cell [ $AdminConfig getid \"\/Cell:mycell\" ]\n   \n   mycell(cells\/mycell|cell.xml#Cell_1)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask listWMQConnectionFactories $cell\n   \n   MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask modifyWMQConnectionFactory MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) { -componentAuthAlias myalias }\n   \n   MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) \n * Jython:\n   wsadmin>cell = AdminConfig.getid(\"\/Cell:mycell\")\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.listWMQConnectionFactories(cell)\n   \n   'MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.modifyWMQConnectionFactory('MyCF(cells\/mycell|resos urces.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)', \"-componentAuthAlias myalias\")\n   \n   'MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n\n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using an activation specification For inbound connections using an activation specification an authentication alias can be specified by the administrator when deploying the application, or a default authentication alias can be specified on the activation specification via the administrative console. \n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using a listener port \n\nFor inbound connections using a listener port, the value specified in the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" setting of the connection factory (seen in the above screenshot) is used. \n\nOn zOS, first the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used if set, then the \"Component-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used it set.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: \n\n 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. \n 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:\n    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) \n 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is provided as follows:\n    ALTER CHL('WAS.CLIENTS') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('myuser')\n\n\nThe following additional considerations are important for production environments: For all production environments where transport security is required, SSL\/TLS security must be configured between the application server and MQ. \n\nIn order to configure SSL\/TLS transport security, you must establish the appropriate trust between the MQ queue manager and WebSphere Application Server. The application server, who initiates the SSL\/TLS handshake, must always be configured to trust the certificate provided by the MQ queue manager . If the application server is configured to send a certificate to the MQ queue manager, then the queue manager must also be configured to trust it. \n\nIf trust is not correctly configured on both sides, you will encounter 2393 MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR reason codes after enabling SSL\/TLS on the connection. \n\nIf you do not have a security exit that performs username and password authentication, then you should configure mutual SSL\/TLS authentication on your Server Connection channel to cause the queue manager to require a trusted certificate is provided by the application server. To do this you set \"SSL Authentication\" to \"Required\" in the MQ Explorer or SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) via MQSC. \n\nIf you do have a security exit that performs username and password authentication installed in your MQ server, then configure your application to supply a username and password for validation by that security exit. The details of how to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server are described above in the \"Diagnosing the problem\" section. \n\nAll Server Connection channels that do not have SSL\/TLS security applied should be disabled. Example MQSC commands to disable the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel are provided as follows (these assume no user exists on the MQ server called 'NOAUTH'):\nALTER CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('NOAUTH')\nSTOP CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) \n\nDetails of how to configure the private certificate and trust of a MQ queue manager, and to enable SSL security on a Server Connection channel, see the following locations in the MQ information center: \n\n * To configure the certificates and trust of the MQ queue manager see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL on queue managers [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.explorer.doc%2Fe_ssl_channels.htm] \n * To configure the Server Connection channel, used by applications running in the application server to connect to MQ, see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL channels [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl_channels.htm]\n\n\nDetails of how you configure trust within WebSphere Application Server, and whether the application server sends a certificate to MQ for authentication, are in the following locations in the WebSphere Application Server information center:  * To create or modify an SSL Configuration containing the appropriate SSL\/TLS configuration for connecting to MQ, see the following topic:\n   SSL configurations [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-base-dist&topic=csec_sslconfigs]\n   Note that MQ requires you specify a matching Cipher Suite \/ Cipher Spec on both sides of the connection, as it checks the negotiated Cipher Suite matches the SSLCIPH setting on the channel after the handshake is complete. As a result the WebSphere Application Server SSL Configuration should be configured to contain only the Cipher Suite that matches the SSLCIPH setting on the Server Connection channel.

","answer":"WebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21648497.txt","text":"Title: IBM Insufficient ulimit Value Causes Native OutOfMemory - United States\n\nText:\n TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n An out of memory may be observed on a system running WebSphere Application Server on Linux or AIX that is due to ulimit restrictions on number of process\/threads per user. Further investigation may reveal a \"Failed to create a thread:\" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java\/lang\/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads\/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q013","question":"Can I apply a TIP 2.2 fix pack directly to a TIP 2.1 installation?\n\nCan I apply a TIP 2.2 fix pack directly to a TIP 2.1 installation?

message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci<\/PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06<\/Version>\n\n<Release>22<\/Release>\n\n<Mod>04<\/Mod>\n\n<Level>000<\/Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci<\/PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06<\/Version>\n\n<Release>30<\/Release>\n\n<Mod>05<\/Mod>\n\n<Level>000<\/Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>\/ITMfVE_Agents\/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). \nThe quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. \nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. \nSo the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.\n\nYou need to proceed as follow:\n\na) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.\nb) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1]

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps \/ Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"\/etc\/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the \/etc\/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file \/etc\/security\/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the \/etc\/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the \/etc\/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and\/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and\/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/en\/SSAW57_8.0.0\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the \/etc\/security\/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( \/etc\/security\/limits.d\/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash\/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an \/etc\/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the \/etc\/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in \/etc\/security\/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21377724]\nAIX - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/java7sdk\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.aix.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]\nLinux - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/java7sdk\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.lnx.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q017","question":"Does Portal 6.1.x support Oracle 12c?\n\n\n\nWe are running Portal Server v6.1.0.6 and I need to know what the newest version of Oracle that is supported with the WPS 6.1.0.6?\n\nSpecifically, if Oracle 12c is not supported, what version of Oracle 11g is?","answer":"Oracle 11gR2 V11.2.0.1 (including RAC)","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg27019359.txt","text":"Title: IBM WebSphere Portal V6.1.0.5 and V6.1.5.2 hardware and software requirements - AIX - United States\n\nText:\nDSRdoc; SystemRequirementsDocument; prereq; coreq; installation prerequisites; 6105eGA 6152eGA V6105 V6.1.0.5 6.1.0.5 6105 6152 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n IBM WebSphere Portal V6.1.0.5 and 6.1.5.2 hardware and software requirements on an AIX operating system.

I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z\/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor\/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression\/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http:\/\/ss64.com\/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z\/OS and z\/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.messages\/diag\/appendixes\/messages\/j9gc\/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor\/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_6.0.0\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer\/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression\/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/tools\/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem.

If a symbolic link is used as part of the path for any of these directories or binaries, the symbolic link is replaced with its target value.\nSimilarly, when a product is installed with Installation Manager, the values for the installation location and shared resources directory are stored internally as absolute paths with all symbolic links resolved. \n\nIf the symbolic links change their values, the absolute path names for directories that are used by Installation Manager might change. When the Installation Manager starts, it will initialize itself using the data in the agent data location. However, the stored values for the paths to the agent data directory, Installation Manager binaries, or product installation locations do not point to the new locations. Installation Manager might fail to start, or might be unable to update or uninstall products that are installed.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWhen choosing locations for the agent data directory, the Installation Manager binaries, shared resources directory, and the installation directories for products, do not use paths that include symbolic links. \n\n\nIf Installation Manager is using paths that no longer exist, create the old paths manually and mount the affected file systems at the original locations that are used by Installation Manager.

For example, ITM normally installs in a directory named \/opt\/IBM\/ITM. Within that directory, it stores programs in subdirectory names like \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/bin and \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/classes. It also stores local data in subdirectory names like \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/config and \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/logs. This homogeneous design is a problem for installations that require an approach that keeps code in \/opt and stores data in the \/var file system.\n\nANSWER\nIntroduction \n\nUnder APAR IV67523, ITM added a new mechanism to move local data to a different file system. For example, data typically stored in \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/config and \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/logs can be redirected to \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/config and \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/logs. This new file system location is designated by the user at installation time, and it is referred to as CANDLEDATA. A conversion utility is provided to implement CANDLEDATA for existing installations. \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is available with ITM 6.30.05.00. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow CANDLEDATA Works \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is implemented primarily using symbolic links. This means most of the underlying code in ITM is unaware of CANDLEDATA. This also means the CANDLEDATA mechanism is limited to Linux and UNIX platforms. \n\nThe rest of this section shows examples of links where CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM and CANDLEDATA=\/var\/IBM\/ITM. You can define different locations for your own installation. \n\n \n\nBase Directory Links \n\nThe following local data directories are always linked from CANDLEHOME to CANDLEDATA:\n\n\n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/InstallITM -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/InstallITM\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/config -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/config\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/kt1v3depot -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/kt1v3depot\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/localconfig -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/localconfig\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/logs -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/logs\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/patchlogs -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/patchlogs\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/tables -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/tables\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/tmaitm6\/agentdepot -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/tmaitm6\/agentdepot\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/tmp -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/tmp\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA. \n\n \n\nGeneral Agent Directory Links \n\nIn addition to the base set of directory links, most agents have general links for TEMA data:\n\n\n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/ATTRLIB -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/ATTRLIB\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/<platform>\/<pc>\/tables\/ATTRLIB -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/ATTRLIB\/<pc>\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/EIFLIB -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/EIFLIB\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/<platform>\/<pc>\/tables\/EIFLIB -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/EIFLIB\/<pc>\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/hist -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/hist\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/<platform>\/<pc>\/hist -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/hist\/<pc>\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/psit -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/psit\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/<platform>\/<pc>\/psit -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/psit\/<pc>\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nSpecial Agent Directory Links \n\nSome agents have links that are specific to that agent. For example, the LZ and UX agents create the following link for the Watchdog component to store local data:\n\n\n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/kca -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/kca\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nCANDLEDATA <-> CANDLEHOME Directory Links \n\nThe CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories also have cross references to each other:\n\n\n * \/opt\/IBM\/IBM\/registry\/CANDLEDATA -> \/var\/IBM\/ITM\n * \n * \/opt\/IBM\/ITM <- \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/CANDLEHOME\n\n\nThese links are all automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nConfiguration Variables exploited by CANDLEDATA \n\nIn addition to symbolic links, some individual components have special configuration settings to redirect agent-specific data to CANDLEDATA. ITM redirects data using the following configuration variables:\n\n\n * CTIRA_SIT_PATH\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\/\n * <platform>\/<pc>\/psit\n * \n * \n * KCA_IP_DIR\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\/kca\n * \n * \n * KCAWD_WRITE_DIR \n * \n * CANDLEHOME\/kca\n * \n * \n\nNotes:  1. While the variables point to CANDLEHOME\/xxx, the directory links cause the local data to be written to the corresponding CANDLEDATA\/xxx. \n 2. If you use configuration overrides that set these configuration variables, you'll need to review how those overrides work in an environment configured to use CANDLEDATA. In most cases, you'll want to remove your overrides.\n\n\nConfiguration Variables affected by CANDLEDATA\nThe symbolic links established by ITM for CANDLEDATA assume standard agent configuration. If you've modified any of the following, data will be continue to be redirected to the location you specified instead of the CANDLEDATA directory:\n. \n\n * ATTRLIB\n * \n * CTIRA_HIST_DIR\n * \n * EIFLIB\n * \n * \n\nWhen converting an existing CANDLEHOME, ITM migrates any data in the original directories before linking them to CANDLEDATA. If you've modified any of the following, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_SIT_FILE\n * \n * \n\nBy default, all of the following configuration variables direct data to \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/localconfig. ITM migrates data from \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/localconfig to \/var\/IBM\/ITM\/localconfig and then links the two. If you've modified any of these, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_THRESHOLDS \n * \n * IRA_EVENT_EXPORT_SNMP_TRAP_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_LOCALCONFIG_DIR\n * \n * \n * IRA_PRIVATE_SITUATION_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_PAGE\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DIR\n * \n * \n * KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS \n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Restrictions\n\n\n 1.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is available only for ITM on Linux and UNIX. ITM on Windows continues to keep local data under CANDLEHOME. \n     . \n 2.  No facility is provided switch from a CANDLEHOME+CANDLEDATA implementation back to a unified CANDLEHOME implementation. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.\n     . \n 3.  No facility is provided to move CANDLEDATA from one directory to another. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.\n     . \n 4.  The CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA arrangement is a 1:1 relationship.  * Only one CANDLEHOME can use a given CANDLEDATA. This means a given CANDLEDATA cannot be shared with multiple CANDLEHOMEs. \n      * A given CANDLEHOME can only use one CANDLEDATA. This means components cannot be split amongst multiple CANDLEDATAs.\n        .\n     \n     \n 5.  The monitoring server and portal server cannot exploit CANDLEDATA.  * The conversion utility will not convert an existing CANDLEHOME if it contains the monitoring server or portal server. \n      * The installer warns if CANDLEDATA is specified and the install image contains the monitoring server or portal server. However, the installer does not prevent monitoring server or portal server from being installed. \n      * ITM does not allow the monitoring server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n      * ITM does not allow the portal server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented.\n        .\n     \n     \n 6.  Not all agents have been verified to work with CANDLEDATA. Before using CANDLEDATA, check with the support group for each of the agents you intend to install.\n     . \n 7.  System Monitor Agents (SMA) can exploit CANDLEDATA. However, the SMA installer does not create CANDLEDATA. These agents must be converted to use CANDLEDATA after they are installed.\n     . \n 8.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is intended only for current agents. If the agent media contains installer 6.30.00.00 or above, it should be ok to use with CANDLEDATA. \n     \n     Some older or discontinued agents such as the Universal Agent (UM) and UNIX Logs agent (UL) cannot use CANDLEDATA reliably. ITM does not prevent older or discontinued agents from being installed into a new CANDLEHOME with CANDLEDATA implemented. \n     . \n 9.  When CANDLEDATA is in use, ITM implements internal overrides for the following configuration variables: CTIRA_SIT_PATH, KCA_IP_DIR, and KCAWD_WRITE_DIR.  * If you've already overridden any of these configuration variables, you must remove the overrides before converting a given component. \n      * If you've overridden these with CANDLEHOME\/config\/xx.environment, the conversion utility will detect and warn about them. Your overrides will win, so you must remove them. \n      * If you've overridden these with the old method of sourcing a script into CANDLEHOME\/config\/xx.ini, the conversion utility cannot detect them. However, the CANDLEDATA overrides will win.\n        .\n     \n     \n 10. The prerequisite scanner does not know about CANDLEDATA. It continues to assume everything is stored in CANDLEHOME. This means:  * No space checking is performed for CANDLEDATA. \n      * Results are somewhat inflated for CANDLEHOME.\n        .\n     \n     \n 11. The conversion utility does not check for space when converting an existing new CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. Make sure there is enough space in CANDLEDATA before starting the conversion process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgents Verified with CANDLEDATA\n\nThe following agents have been verified to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented:\n\n\n * LO\n * \n * \n * LZ\n * \n * \n * UD\n * \n * \n * UX\n * \n * \n\nFor other agents, contact the corresponding support team.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up a New Local Installation with CANDLEDATA\n\nFor new installations, you can define the location for local data at installation time.\n\nLocal install (interactive):\n\n\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * \n * \n * # .\/install.sh\n * \n * INSTALL\n * \n * \n * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory.\n * \n * [ default = \/opt\/IBM\/ITM ]:\n * \n * \"\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\" does not exist\n * \n * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; \"1\" is default ]?\n * \n * Creating directory \"\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\"...\n * \n * \n * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring local data directory.\n * \n * [ default = \/opt\/IBM\/ITM ]: \/var\/IBM\/ITM\n * \n * \"\/var\/IBM\/ITM\" does not exist\n * \n * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; \"1\" is default ]?\n * \n * Creating directory \"\/var\/IBM\/ITM\"...\n * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh: Installation directory \"\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\" successfully converted to use data directory \"\/var\/IBM\/ITM\".\n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n\n\nLocal install (silent): \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * install.sh \n   [-l \n * CANDLEDATA\n * ] \n *  \n   Where:  * -l\n    * \n    * CANDLEHOME\n    * \n   \n   \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * install.sh\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * install.sh\n * \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting an agent for the first time with CANDLEDATA \n\nWhen you specify CANDLEDATA at install time, ITM establishes the base directory links. All agent-specific conversion is handled the first time a given agent is started. When this happens, an extra message is included in the agent start output: Here is an example:\n\n# itmcmd agent start ux\nProcessing. Please wait...\nitmCANDLEDATA.sh: Component ux successfully converted to use data directory \"\/var\/IBM\/ITM\".\nStarting Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS ...\nMonitoring Agent for UNIX OS started \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting an existing installation or new agents to use CANDLEDATA \n\nFor existing installations, ITM provides a utility to convert a CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. You can also use this utility to convert a newly installed agent before it is started. Under the covers, the installer runs this same utility. \n\nitmCANDLEDATA.sh\n[-b yes|no] \n[-h CANDLEHOME] \n[-l CANDLEDATA] \n[-f no|yes] \n[-p PC|*]\n[-r no|yes] \n\nWhere: \n\n * \n * -b\n * \n * yes\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * no\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * -h\n * \n * \n * \n * -l\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * -f\n * \n * no\n * \n * yes\n * \n * \n * \n * -p\n * \n * *\n * \n * \n * \n * -r\n * \n * no\n * \n * yes\n * \n\n\nIf you set the CANDLEHOME or CANDLEDATA environment variables before launching the installer, then those values are used as though they had been passed with the command options. If both the command option is used and the environment variable is defined before the conversion utility is started, the command option takes precedence. \n\nExample 1: Conversion of a typical CANDLEHOME can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l \/var\/IBM\/ITM -b yes -p \"*\" -r yes\n\n\nExample 2: Conversion of a newly installed agent to a CANDLEHOME where CANDLEDATA is already implemented can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -b no -p \"ux\" -r yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing CANDLEDATA with Remote Deploy\n\nYou can define the location for local data remotely:\n\ntacmd createnode (new installations):\n\n\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * tacmd createnode ... -o ENV_CANDLEDATA=\n * data_directory\n * ...\n * \n * \n * \n * install.sh\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n\ntacmd executecommand + itmCANDLEDATA.sh (existing installations): \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * tacmd updateagent\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * tacmd executecommand\n * \n * \n * \n * tacmd executecommand ... -c \"\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/bin\/itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l \/var\/IBM\/ITM -p \\\"*\\\" -b yes -r yes > \/tmp\/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1 &\"\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Launches the conversion utility on the agent (\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/bin\/itmCANDLEDATA.sh). Specifies the local data directory (-l \/var\/IBM\/ITM). Specifies all agents are to be converted (-p \\\"*\\\"). Note that the quotes are escaped because the entire command string is quoted. Specifies the CANDLEDATA directory is to be built (-b yes). Specifies the agents are to be restarted (-r yes). Redirects STDOUT and STDERR to a log file (> \/tmp\/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1). Note that the standard -o\/-e\/-d\/-v options for tacmd executecommand don't function properly because of the agent restart. Note also that \/tmp is used instead of \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/logs; the latter is moved during the conversion process and therefore must be inactive. Launches the command in the background (trailing &). tacmd executecommand waits for the commands to complete, and this is signaled by a communication from the agent. However, since the agent is restarted by the command, it will never reply to tacmd executecommand. Running the command in the background allows tacmd executecommand to complete normally. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Implications \n\nThe following general ITM utilities have been updated to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented: \n\n * cinfo - The output heading indicates the location of CANDLEDATA if it implemented. \n * itmcmd agent start - Agent configurations are automatically updated if CANDLEDATA is implemented. Also, the portal server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n * itmcmd server start - The monitoring server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n * secureMain - Permissions and ownership in CANDLEDATA are maintained just as in CANDLEHOME. If secureMain was run before CANDLEDATA is implemented, the conversion utility automatically runs secureMain again as part of the conversion process. However, if you run the conversion utility as a nonroot user (not recommended), you must run secureMain manually after conversion is complete. \n * tacmd pdcollect and pdcollect - Data is gathered from CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME. \n * uninstall.sh - Relevant data is removed from in CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME. For uninstall.sh REMOVE EVERYTHING, both the CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories are removed."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q047","question":"Help with Security Bulletin: Malicious File Download vulnerability in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) - CVE-2016-9693\n\nWhere can I find information for Security bulletin: Malicious File Download vulnerability in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) - CVE-2016-9693?

Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression\/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http:\/\/ss64.com\/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z\/OS and z\/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.messages\/diag\/appendixes\/messages\/j9gc\/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor\/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_6.0.0\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer\/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression\/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/tools\/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Linux\/Windows - Thanks for the memory [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/]\nAIX - Thanks for the Memory [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-aix\/]\nIntroducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf]\nCompressed references [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html]\nIBM Java Compressed References and Native OOMs [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/blogs\/kevgrig\/entry\/ibm_java_compressed_references_and_native_ooms]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q055","question":"P8 CPE 5.2.1 error:  FNRCC0110E - ERROR FixedContentProviderCache.getProvider failed to init provider\n\n\n\nNew P8 CPE 5.2.1 install does not see the Centera Fixed Storage.

This is related to IV60331.\n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following trace:\n\"ERROR (UNIT:kumpfile ALL) (UNIT:kum0fdp0 ALL)\" enabled, the\nagent RAS1 log\n<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log\nshows trace points similar to the following: \n- - - \n... \n...:kum0fdp0.c,76,\"KUM0_FileClose\") IOE 5619070 file handle\n7C3AB428 File close successful\n...:kum0fdp0.c,111,\"KUM0_FileClose\") SEptr 5613548 local file \nD:\/Log\/WAS\/AppSrv01\/nodeagent\/SystemOut.log IOptr 5619070 \n7C3AB428 closed unsuccessfully\n...:kum0fdp0.c,82,\"KUM0_FileClose\") File close failed for IOE \n@5619070, status code -1, errno 0 'No error'\n...:kum0fdp0.c,111,\"KUM0_FileClose\") SEptr 5613548 local file \nD:\/Log\/WAS\/AppSrv01\/nodeagent\/SystemOut.log IOptr 5619070 \n7C3AB428 closed unsuccessfully \n... \n- - - \n\nAPAR: IV95005\nAbstract: \"DETECTED CODEPAGE CP943, USING CP932 INSTEAD TO MAP \nBACKSLASH TO U+005C, NOT U+00A5 (YEN SYMBOL)\" LOGGED ON\nEVERY READ\nAdditional information: With a locale of Ja_JP (Shift-JIS) and\nERROR level trace, when the data is in the local code page,\nthe following message appears in agent RAS1 log for each\nmonitored event processed: \n\"Detected codepage CP943, using CP932 instead to map\nbackslash to U+005C, no U+00A5 (Yen symbol)\". \n\nThis occurs on the agent system, with only ERROR trace\nenabled.

The garbled characters are not in the\nevents themselves. \n\nSince these messages might occur when the agent is processing\na directory listing in order to determine the current file\nto monitor as a result of a wildcard character in the \nRegexLogSources parameter, if the <filename> that results \nin this error is a file that should be monitored, then events\nwould be lost as the file is not monitored. The <filename> \nis in the directory for RegexLogSources. The additional \ninvalid characters are not seen in the file listing on the\nsystem. \n\nThis was discovered on Log File Agent V6.3 and later on \nWindows, but also occurs on UNIX. \n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following \ntrace enabled: \"ERROR (UNIT:kum0regx ALL)\", the agent RAS1\nlog <hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log\nshows trace points similar to the following with some extra\ncharacters added \".lnk\": \n----- \n...:kum0regx.c,286,\"KUM0_IsRegExPatternMatch\") \n*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 failed for string \u00e4\u00ab\u00e4\u00a8\u00e4O\u00e4\u00e8\u00e4\u00ec\u00e4j\u00e4\u00ec - \n\u00e4n\u00e4f\u00e4\u00ee\u00e4n .lnk\u00d9l \u00d9s\u00d9w pRegEx @4D05810 status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND> \n--- \n\nAPAR: IV79204\nAbstract: LOGS RE-READ FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVING\nTIME (DST) ENDS\nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when daylight saving\ntime ends, log files might be re-read from the beginning\nresulting in old events being re-sent. This only occurs \nwhen time is set back. \n\nThe agent falsely detects that the configuration (.conf) \nand format (.fmt) file have changed when the system is\nconfigured to \"Automatically adjust clock for Daylight \nSaving time\" and the file timestamps automatically change \ntriggering an agent reset. When NumEventsToCatchUp is set\nto -1, this series of events causes the log file to be\nre-read from the beginning. This was seen with IF0003 and\nIF0004 when monitoring log files on Windows operating \nsystems, but not with the Windows Event log. This problem\ndid not occur on UNIX systems. \n\nTo resolve this issue you must install and use the Windows\nWIX64 (x86-64 bit) agent or specify NumEventsToCatchUp=-2\nin the configuration file as a work-around. \n\nAPAR: IV77403\nAbstract: WINDOWS EVENT LOG EVENTS ARRIVED DELAYED WHEN \nNUMEVENTSTOCATCHUP IS USED \nAdditional information: With a large input load (for example,\n8004 events on each of 4 threads), Windows Event Log events\narrive with a significant delay when NumEventsToCatchUp=-1\nis set in the conf file. The delay increases as the event\nbacklog grows. It can be in the order of 5 minutes depending\non CPU, etc. This is a result of the inherent overhead in\nmaintaing the position (bookmark) in the Windows Event Log\nwhen NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1 or n. \n\nThis is a follow-on to APAR IV63704. \n\nAPAR: IV76731\nAbstract: UNABLE TO RENAME FILE WHICH IS BEING MONITORED BY ITM\nLOG FILE AGENT \nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when the agent is\nmonitoring an application log, the log file cannot be \nrenamed because the file is open or in use. When new\nrecords are added to the log, the agent opens the log, \nreads the log and closes the log. However, when a large\nvolume of events are written to the log file, the log file\nmay remain open or in use due to operating system\nefficiencies. As a result, an attempt to rename the log \nfile may fail. This problem occurs more prevently with the\nWINNT 32-bit agent, when NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1.\n\nTo minimize occurrence of this issue, use the Windows (WIX64) \nx86-64 bit Log File agent. \n\nAPAR: IV60331\nAbstract: RESETTING OF MULTIPLE CONF\/FORMAT FILES CAUSES A CRASH\nAdditional information: Updating multiple configuration (.conf) \nor format (.fmt) files, usually via a script or a situation \nthat runs frequently, and causes the agent to reset might \nresult in a core or crash. This also might be more likely \nto occur with multiple subnodes to monitor a large number\nof files, for example, 100 files. The root cause of the\ncrash is closing a file which is already closed or no longer\nexists. \n\nThis has been seen, mainly on Linux, on agent start-up,\nshutdown or reset as a result of configuration file changes. \nThe problem was originally discovered in Log File Agent \nv6.2.3.1.\n\nThe <hostname>_lo_<#########>.log might contain information\nsimilar to the following: \n\n*** glibc detected *** \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/bin\/kloagent: \ndouble free \nor corruption (out): 0x00007f222d727030 *** \n======= Backtrace: ========= \n\/lib64\/libc.so.6[0x3c158760e6] \n\/lib64\/libc.so.6[0x3c15878c13] \n\/lib64\/libc.so.6(fclose+0x14d)[0x3c1586674d] \n\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/lib\/libkloudp.so(kum_fclose+0x97)[0x7f222 \n42a68db] \n\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/lib\/libkloudp.so(KUMP_ReleaseIOResources+ \n0x430)[0x7f2224275444] \n\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/lib\/libkloudp.so(KUMP_ReleaseSourceResour \nce+0xae1)[0x7f22242799d1] \n\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/lib\/libkloudp.so(KUMP_FileServer+0x7114)[ \n0x7f2224250f30] \n\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/lx8266\/lo\/lib\/libkloudp.so(+0xb9b56)[0x7f222427fb56 \n] \n\/lib64\/libpthread.so.0[0x3c16007851] \n\/lib64\/libc.so.6(clone+0x6d)[0x3c158e890d] \n. . . \n\n2.2 Defects\n--------------\nNone.\n\n2.3 Enhancements \n----------------------\nEnhancement: IV77403, IV76731\nAbstract: Add Support for Windows x86-64 bit (WIX64) Agent\nAdditional Information: Support was added for Windows x86-64 bit\n(WIX64) agent.

The backslash character (0x5c) is translated to\nUTF-8 0xC2A5, and when it is translated back to the native\ncode page, it is incorrectly translated to 0x1A which may\nshow as a blank space or unprintable character. As a result\nof IV68698, code page 932 is used to translate the event to\nUTF-8, however code page 943 is still being used to translate\nthe event from UTF-8 back to the native code page Shift-JIS.\n\nExample: \nLog File Agent v6.3 GA <cache file> \n70203_Base;msg='Tivoli [message]\\[message]' \n\nLog File Agent v6.3 and 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0004\n<cache file> \n70203_Base;msg='Tivoli [message] [message]' \n\nAPAR: IV75336\nAbstract: LFA ASSOCIATED WITH LOG ANALYSIS IS DROPPING EVENTS\nAdditional information: The agent when associated with Log\nAnalysis is dropping events.

Please refer to this matrix for the latest \ncertification information.\nPlease refer to the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)\nfor the latest operating system certification information:\nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/prodguid\/v1r0\/clarity\/index.html [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/prodguid\/v1r0\/clarity\/index.html]\n\n3.1 Prerequisites for this fix\n--------------------------------\nThe prerequisite level for this fix is as follows:\n- IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2: Fix Pack 02 or higher\n(6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0002)\n\nThis fix pack is a complete install image and as such, can be \ninstalled on a pristine system. This fix is also cumulative, and can \nbe installed on any fix level for this version, release, and mod \nlevel above the prerequisite. \n\nFor details, see the Troubleshooting Wiki:\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/mydeveloperworks\/wikis\/home?lang=en#\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Monitoring\/page\/Log%20File%20Agent [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/mydeveloperworks\/wikis\/home?lang=en#\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Monitoring\/page\/Log%20File%20Agent]\n\n4.0 Image directory contents\n===================\nThis fix image contains the following files:\n\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.README\n\n5.0 Installation instructions \n==================\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-------------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites\nfor this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment \nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME \n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n- NOTE: Before installing the LO x86-64 bit agent, you must\nun-install the WINNT 32-bit version of the agent and the 32\/64 \nbit compatibility package.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\nFor installation instructions, see the Log File Agent User's Guide\nv6.3.0: \nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/logfile\/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/logfile\/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en]\n\nNote: \n1. The PowerPC little-endian installation image is located in the\nPPC_LE directory of the installation image. Invoke .\/install.sh\nfrom this directory.\n\n2. On Windows systems, when the installation completes, the \nReadme.txt displays \"Welcome to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Fix\nPack 5.\" This is the installer level and Readme and is not an \nerror.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the archive file 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz to a\ntemporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer system. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>\nrepresents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On\nWindows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or\nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nNote: \n1. The prerequisite Log File Agent bundles must also be in the\ndepot, to ensure successful completion of the remote agent update.\n2. The 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP000<n> bundles must be removed from the\ndepot, using the \"tacmd removeBundles\" command. \nFor example: tacmd removeBundles -t lo -v 06300000<n>\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>\/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands.

If you have\nalready installed these updates, there are no additional installation \nsteps. Otherwise, install the updates to the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Desktop. For more information about installing \napplication support, see Installing and enabling application support\nin the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide.\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or any\nof the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are\nrequired.\n\n6.2 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version. \n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t LO\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t LO \n\nNote: The component (-t) for the \"tacmd listSystems\" command is\nspecified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is: \n06.30.02.00.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.30.02.00. \n\n2. To verify the agent you are running contains the updates from the\nfix, see the following lines in the agent log \n<hostname>_lo_<instance>_kloagent_<timestamp>.log located in\n$CANDLEHOME\/logs on UNIX systems and\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\tmaitm6\\logs on Windows systems:\n\n<timestamp> Component: ira\n<timestamp> Driver: agent_fac_63:201709131450\/4769716.3 \n<timestamp> Timestamp: Sep 13 2017 ...\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n=========================\nNone.\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n======================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information\n================================== \nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com\/legal\/copytrade.shtml [www.ibm.com\/legal\/copytrade.shtml].\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback.

If a transactional operation performed by RTS\/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS\/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. \n\n\nYou will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:\n...\n<context-param>\n<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)<\/description>\n<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout<\/param-name>\n<param-value>600<\/param-value>\n<\/context-param> \n... \n\nAnother place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations.

The Crypto profiles now have TLSv1.2 and 1.1 which will be enabled by default. This affects the protocol version included in the Client Hello when DataPower is acting as the SSL client. If TLSv1.2 is not supported, the server still negotiates to the most secure supported protocol (e.g. TLSv1.1, TLSv1.0, SSLv3) if enabled. \n\nSome legacy servers with non-compliant implementations of SSL may reject connection attempts when TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1 are used.

Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as \/MyRuleApp\/MyRuleset\/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as \/MyRuleApp\/2.0\/MyRuleset\/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: \n\n * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config\/config_ds_res_was8\/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] \n * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the \"About\" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor \n * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. \n * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. \n * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully \n * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. \n * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] \n * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251] \n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES \/ RES) Platform Independent 7.1.1, 7.1, 7.0.3, 7.0.2, 7.0.1, 7.0"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q074","question":"Is there a way to not use cache inside a HttpRequest node?\n\nIs there a way in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) to not use cache inside a HttpRequest node?

Similar to other \nupgrade software, the fix pack image also can be locally installed on a \ncomputer where the product software is not already installed.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\nWhen this fix pack image is downloaded from Passport Advantage, these rules \napply:\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that already hosts a \nlicensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that does not already host \na licensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix\n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites \nfor this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent \noy.ini file on UNIX system, this file should be backed up before the fix \ninstall. After this fix is installed, edit the latest oy.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this oy.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to a temporary \ndirectory on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. \nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully \nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2 \nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. After agent upgrade bitness of agent binary should be same as pre-upgrade on x86-64 \nbit windows. Agent do not support upgrade to 64 bit binary.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \na temporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \nsymbol <TEMP> represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems.\n\n3. To add the fix pack bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the tacmd addBundles command, see Appendix A. Commands reference\nof the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\/CNN25ML:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\/CNN25ML\/WINDOWS\/Deploy -t oy -f\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\/CNN25ML\/unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case or \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\/CNN25ML:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t oy -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case oy \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information on the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see Appendix A. Commands\nreference of the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t oy \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nOn a Windows system:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OY \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nIf there are not prior version koy agent on remote system .Then use \nbelow tacmd addSystem command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addSystem -t OY \n-n <Managed system name> \n-p INSTANCE=\"<Sybase instance name>\"\n\nNote:\n- The <Sybase instance name> is the Sybase agent instance name to be monitored on \nremote system.\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (oy), not three characters (koy).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n-Remote installation will fail if the MTEMS window is open on the agent machine.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop:\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \nthe IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\n6.1 Verifying the update\n-------------------------\n1.To verify whether the agent is updated correctly, use the tacmd command to\nview the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted. Ensure that\nyou log on to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion.\nFor example,\n\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory, the default location is \/opt\/IBM\/ITM.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is C:\\IBM\\ITM.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified as two\ncharacters (OY), not three characters (KOY).\n\nWhen the agent is updated, the agent version is changed to 06.20.02.00.\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify whether the\nagent was updated. For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n06.20.02.00.\n\n2.To verify whether the agent support files are updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux or UNIX\nsystems.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n$CANDLEHOME\/bin\/cinfo -i\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n----------------------------------------------------------\n[root@HJS-SYB-1 bin]# .\/cinfo\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:13 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: \/opt\/IBM0611\/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:15 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: \/opt\/IBM0611\/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nlx8266 Version: 06.30.06.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nlx8266 Version: 08.00.50.36\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nlx8266 Version: 07.09.01.00\n\noy Monitoring Agent for Sybase server\nlx8266 Version: 06.20.02.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\n\nOn Windows systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\kincinfo \u2013i\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nC:\\IBM\\ITM\\BIN>kincinfo -i\n********** Thursday, November 30, 2017 10:10:02 AM **********\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJ-IBMIBM6737 Installer : Ver: 063006000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\n\nIN Install INS\/Windows Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(32-bit) INS\/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(64-bit) INS\/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nAC KAC(64-bit) CMA\/32\/64 Bit Agent Compatibility Package\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nGL KGL(64-bit) CMA\/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGL KGL(32-bit) CMA\/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGS KGS(64-bit) GSK\/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWIX64 Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nGS KGS(32-bit) GSK\/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWINNT Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nJM KJM(32-bit) JVM\/Embedded JVM\nWINNT Version: 07.09.01.00 Build: 201506221629\n\nNT KNT(32-bit) CMA\/Monitoring Agent for Windows OS\nWINNT Version: 06.30.00.00 Build: 30321\n\nOY KOY(32-bit) CMA\/Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server\nWINNT Version: 06.20.02.00 Build: 72651\n\nUE KUE(32-bit) CMA\/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nUI KUI(32-bit) CLI\/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nProblem: Sybase agent configuration is not working using itmcmd manage \ncommand from GUI on Solaris 11\nWorkaround:\nFor Solaris 11:\nRun '.\/itmcmd config -A oy' present at location:<CandleHome>\/bin\n\nProblem: Prereqchecker which is integrated with the installer fails on \nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: \nFor Windows:\nRun on command prompt \u2018prereq_checker.bat KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\WINDOWS\\prereqchecker\n\nFor Unix:\nRun \u2018.\/prereq_checker.sh KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\unix\\prereqchecker\n\nProblem: Registry entries are not cleared when agent is uninstalled on 64 bit\nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: Delete registry entries manually from path:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Candle\\KOY\\610\\\n\nProblem: When running the verification step in the \"itmcmd config -A oy\"\nfunction on a Solaris 10 system, the following output from the verification\nprogram is produced: \"user needs read authority to\".\nWorkaround: Issue \"ps -ef | grep koyagent\" to locate the koyagent process and\nissue \"kill -9\" for that process. Check the Navigator tree in the Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal for an offline koyagent entry and clear the offline entry.\nThe Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server that was configured by \"itmcmd config\" \nis unaffected by this problem. \n\nProblem: When running multiple remote deploys and agent upgrades, a task\ntimeout occurs during either the remote deployment or the agent upgrade. \nWorkaround: Restart the OS Agent following the task timeout and before\nperforming the next remote deployment or agent upgrade.\n\nProblem: If you are installing this fix into a depot on a Windows computer, and\nWinZip(R) is used to extract this fix, text files in the depot might contain\nCTRL-Ms. When this fix is remotely deployed to a UNIX machine from the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server or depot on Windows, the installation fails. The\nCTRL-Ms are caused by extracting the fix using WinZip with \"TAR file smart\nCR\/LF conversion\" option enabled. This extraction causes WinZip to put CTRL-Ms\nin text files when they are extracted on UNIX through remote deployment. \nWorkaround: If you are using WinZip for the fix installation for the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server on Windows, disable the default \"TAR file smart\nCR\/LF conversion\" option. \n\nProblem: In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, the instance name is displayed\ninstead of the host name in the Navigation tree. \nFor example the Navigation tree might look like this,\nMySid\nSybase\nAlert Log\n...\ninstead of this,\nMyHost\nSybase - MySid\nAlert Log\n...\n\nThe problem is that the length of the managed node name, <SID>:<HOSTNAME>:SYB,\nexceeds the length supported by the portal. A possible cause is that the\nfully-qualified host name is being used. If 'uname -n' on the Monitoring Agent\nfor Sybase Server computer returns a fully-qualified host name, then this host\nname is the cause. \nWorkaround: Override the host name with an appropriate shorter name by adding\nthe following line to oy.config: \nexport COLL_HOSTNAME=<short name>\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information \n==================================\nSteps for enabling SDA (Self-describing agent)\nFor Windows:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring server is installed, in the Manage\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services application, right-click the agent and \nselect Advanced\u2192 Edit ENV file.\n2.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\nFor UNIX:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring agent is installed, change to the\n<Install_dir>\/config\/ directory.\n2.Open the coordinating file:\nFor single-instance agents: <pc>.ini \nFor multi-instance agents: <pc>_<instance>.ini file \nWhere pc is the two-character product code.\n3.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information \n========================================\nIBM, the IBM logo, and ibm.com are trademarks or registered trademarks of\nInternational Business Machines Corp., registered in many jurisdictions\nworldwide.

We have added the Sysinfo command that will display system CPU, memory, and storage information in command line interface (CLI).\n   Note: A complete list of CLI commands are located in the Command-line interface [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHLHV_5.3.1\/com.ibm.alps.doc\/references\/alps_command_line_interface.htm] section in the Knowledge Center.\n   \n * New to this release we have added a services mode within CLI. These commands will allow you to restart key services within the appliance. These services are listed below:  * Packet processing \n    * Packet Capture \n    * Local Management Interface (LMI) \n    * License and Update (LUM) \n    * SiteProtector Communication\n      \n   \n   \n * You can now view and search logs from the command line using the \"less\" and \"tail\" commands from within logs mode. Log files found using the less command are System, Webserver, Updates and Analysis logs. \n   \n * With the admin-sftp account you can now retrieve Snapshots, Packet Captures, and support files. This account uses the same password as the admin account. \n   Note: More details on admin-sftp can be found in the Downloading files with an SFTP client [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHLHV_5.3.1\/com.ibm.alps.doc\/tasks\/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]documentation on the Knowledge Center.

The network policy can use the XFF header along with the packet source to control network traffic.\n\n\nIPS Policy enhancements:  * You can now derive a new IPS object from an existing IPS object by right-clicking on an IPS object and left-clicking on Clone.\n   \n * When enabling network, transport-layer, and status events in a non-default IPS object, a warning message is shown. This will help to minimize what may be seen as a false negative.\n\n\nPerformance:  * Inspection throughput increase for XGS 7100 up to 25Gbps, FPL5 (25Gbps) added.\n\n\nMiscellaneous updates and implementation changes:  * Top 10 URLs and URL categories widget in the Local Management Interface have been disabled by default. Given the limited popularity of this feature, coupled with the performance impact in certain situations, we disabled the feature by default. You can re-enable it by using the advanced parameter tune.url.topten.tracking=true. \n   \n *  We have removed the MultiCast Domain Name System (mDNS), under some configurations it caused security risks within the appliance.\n   \n * Support for mutual certificate authentication for communication between the Network Security appliance and SiteProtector.\n\n\nKnown issues: \nYou can find a list of known issues for IBM Security Network Protection 5.3.1 in Technote 1715537: Known issues for IBM Security Network Protection version 5.3.1 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21715537]. \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=1] [https:\/\/ibm.biz\/BdHdZx] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=2] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/InfraSecForumTechnote] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=3] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/SecSuptUTube] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=4] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/InfraSecFixes] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=5] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/FlexLicLogin] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=6] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/MyNotification] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=7] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/ContactSecSupport] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n A Japanese translation is available [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21903740]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q083","question":"When click test connection, the older JDBC driver version shows in the SystemOut.log file\n\n\n\nWhen I click a test connection to a datasource, in the SystemOut.log file I can see the below information...\n\n     [8\/11\/16 5:31:28:494 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name  : Oracle JDBC driver  \n     [8\/11\/16 5:31:28:495 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version  : 9.2.0.1.0  \n     [8\/11\/16 5:31:28:496 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8025I: Successfully connected to DataSource.  \n     [8\/11\/16 5:31:28:608 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8203I: Database product name : Oracle  \n     [8\/11\/16 5:31:28:608 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8204I: Database product version : Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production With the Partitioning, Automatic Storage Management, OLAP, Advanced Analytics\n\nWhere is WAS getting this information from?\n\nWe are using WAS ND v8.5.5.0.

This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the \"Isolate this resource provider\" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. \n\n\nGo to the JDBC Provider and enable \"isolate the resource provider\".

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/install\/v1r6\/topic\/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc\/topics\/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp:\/\/ftp.software.ibm.com\/aix\/freeSoftware\/aixtoolbox\/ezinstall\/ppc\/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=\/opt\/freeware\/lib\/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q088","question":"Help with Action required for SOA Policy Gateway Pattern For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for the GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235)\n\nI need to understand details regarding \"Action required for SOA Policy Gateway Pattern For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for the GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235)\".

The memory for the third parameter was not handled properly.\nAnd accessing this parameter by other attribute group would result\ninto crash.\n\nAPAR: IJ00815\nAbstract: Device Detail attribute AUTOGROWTH behaviour not in sync\nwith SQL Server. \nAdditional Information: In case when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand max-size was set to unlimited, then the incorrect values were\ndisplayed for filegroup detail attribute(Max Growth Size) and device\ndetail attribute(Growth).\n\nAPAR: IJ01540\nAbstract: False alerts are being generated as default value \"Not\nCollected\" for \"Database Space Pct Used\" attribute is not correctly\nconverted before sending to TEPS.\nAdditional Information: Situations having default value\n[ Not Collected (-1 ) ] in formula were not getting evaluated correctly\nfor some database detail attributes. However, the data was shown\ncorrectly as \u2018Not Collected\u2019 on the portal.\n\nAPAR: IJ05451 \nAbstract: ITCAM SQL Server Agent's collector process crashes when using\nSQL Server Native Client 10.0 or SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Collector was not able to handle all possible values\nreturned by ODBC when using SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and SQL Server\nNative Client 11.0 causing it to crash.\n\n2.2 DEFECTS:\n-----------------\nDEFECT: 170986\nAbstract: Memory leak in Table Detail attribute group. \nAdditional Information: Memory leak observed in Table Detail attribute\ngroup because incorrect de-allocation handling. \n\nDEFECT: 170987\nAbstract: Crash observed in Availability group details attribute group\nand Table detail attribute group\nAdditional Information: Crash observed in Availability group details\nattribute group and in Table detail attribute group for the wrong\nusage of iterator after erase. Issue happened because an attempt to\nincrement the iterator was made after the iterator was deleted through\nerase function. \n\nDEFECT: 170993\nAbstract: intial size > max size gives incorrect values\nAdditional Information: If a database was created with restricted growth\nand then modifed the initial size of the database file to a value\ngreater than it's maxsize, then the value of maxsize was not updated\ncorrectly (ideally in this case maxsize should become equal to initial\nsize). As a result, query to SQL Server returned false value for\nmaxsize due to which incorrect values were getting displayed on portal\nfor attributes in Database Detail, Device Detail and Filegroup Detail\nattribute groups.\n\nDEFECT: 170994\nAbstract: Incorrect value displayed for Database Detail attributes\nwhen autogrowth disabled and data freespace > drive freespace.\nAdditional Information: In cases when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand data freespace was greater than device freespace then incorrect\nvalue were seen for some attributes(Data Freespace , Aggregate Database\nFreespace , Database Space pct used , Aggregate Database Freespace pct,\nDatabase max growth size). \n\nDEFECT: 171127\nAbstract: Add tolerance support for SQL Server 2017.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server 2017 version.\n\nDEFECT: 171244\nAbstract: Spelling mistake in agent configuration panel.\nAdditional Information: Few spelling mistakes in agent configuration\npanel were corrected.\n\nDEFECT: 171318\nAbstract: Usage of KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER variable in pre-req while making\nsql server connection.\nAdditional Information: During pre-requisite check, the value of\n\u2018Driver\u2019 was hardcoded to \u2018SQL Server\u2018. While later on, for collecting\ndata value for 'Driver\u2019 was picked from \u2018KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER\u2019 variable.\nDue to this, issue was seen during pre-requiste connection but later\non data was being collected successfully.\n\nDEFECT: 171379\nAbstract: High Severity vulnerabilities are resolved to avoid undefined\nbehaviour of the agent.\nAdditional Information: Removed the high severity errors in the code,\ndetected in CPPCheck tool.\n\nDEFECT: 171785\nAbstract: DBD_TEMP rename failed with error [32]\nAdditional Information: Renaming of DBD_TEMP to DBD_PREV files was\nfailing with Error 32 (The process cannot access the file because it\nis being used by another process)because DBD_TEMP file handle was\ntaking time to close. \n\nDEFECT: 171979\nAbstract: Incorrect value is being sent when query is failed in SRV1\ncursor.\nAdditional Information: Zero value was being sent when query fails in\nSRV1 cursor which was incorrect. Zero is a meaningful value which does\nnot indicate failure.\n\nDEFECT: 171981\nAbstract: Not Collected value is frequently sent since database\ndetail collection is not getting completed in 45 seconds.\nAdditional Information: When database detail collection took more\nthan 45 seconds for collection, Not collected values were sent which\nresulted into triggering of situation.\n\nDEFECT: 172173\nAbstract: Environment setting for COLL_DBCC_NO_LOCK was not taking\neffect. Similar issue was seen with COLL_MONITOR_ALL_DATABASES.\nAdditional Information: Values were getting overwritten for above two\nvariables, hence queries were running without NoLock hint and monitoring\nof all database setting was not working as expected.\n\nDEFECT: 173699\nAbstract: No data get collected for server summary attribute group.\nAdditional Information: SRV3,one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence no data was collected for server summary attribute group.\n\nDEFECT: 174076\nAbstract: MSSQLQA: Sometime server detail data is not getting displayed\non portal.\nAdditional Information: SRV3, one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence sometimes server detail data was not getting displayed\non portal.\n\nDEFECT: 174077\nAbstract: crypted SQL password in log file.\nAdditional Information: Encrypted password value in logfile is \nreplaced with fixed length string to avoid security breach.\n\nDEFECT: 174420\nAbstract: Last Statistics Query execution failing for table details\nattribute group.\nAdditional Information: Due to query failure,table detail data was\ncollected only for the first time. From second collection onwards,\nnew data was not collected & portal always showed the data collected\nduring first collection.\n\nDEFECT: 175117\nAbstract: Table detail attribute group query was failing for syntax error\nat where clause and returned null\nAdditional Information: The query which gets executed while include\/exclude\ndatabases is on, was containing two consecutive \"where\" and hence \nwas failing. This issue is seen with SQL Server 2014 and above versions. \n\nDEFECT: 175120\nAbstract: Data is not collected properly with the non default SQL\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Due to incorrect size calculated for some\ndata types, either query\u2019s result set processing was failing or the\ndata was getting truncated. As a result data was not getting collected\nproperly for some attributes.\n\n2.3 Enhancements:\n-----------------\nRFE: 50594\nAbstract: Support AlwaysOn feature for SQL developers edition.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server Developers\nEdition's AlwaysOn feature.\n\n2.4 Superseded fixes\n--------------------\nNone\n\n2.5 APARs and defects included from superseded fixes\n----------------------------------------------------\nNone\n\n3.0 Architecture and prerequisites\n==================================\nThis fix is supported on all operating systems listed in the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring: Microsoft SQL Server agent prerequisites Document,\nversion 6.3.1 or from the following link:\nhttp:\/\/www-969.ibm.com\/software\/reports\/compatibility\/clarity-reports\/report\/html\/softwareReqsForProductByComponent?deliverableId=A54AA300920511E292EE9F030925FE1B&duComponent=Server_A5707A80920511E292EE9F030925FE1 [http:\/\/www-969.ibm.com\/software\/reports\/compatibility\/clarity-reports\/report\/html\/softwareReqsForProductByComponent?deliverableId=A54AA300920511E292EE9F030925FE1B&duComponent=Server_A5707A80920511E292EE9F030925FE1]\n\n\nThe following link is for the Tivoli operating system and application\nsupport matrix.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment\nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example:\n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Refer to section 7.0 entitled \"Known problems and workarounds\"\nbefore installation.\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For\nthe purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for that agent\nplatform. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS\/INPROGRESS\/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus -g <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nServers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI).

The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.13.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.13.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.13.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the \nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed build date and installation date might not \nbe accurate. This is known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo -i\n\nOn Windows systems:\n-------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>kincinfo -i\n*********** Thursday, May 10, 2018 04:36:22 PM ************\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJS497-MSQL-T-1 Installer : Ver: 063007000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\nOQ TEMS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPB App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.00 Build: 71541\n\nOQ TEPD App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nAbstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade\nProblem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading\nagent fix pack.

Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx [https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al \/proc\/PID\/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n\/usr\/proc\/bin\/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q098","question":"Restore JazzSM DASH login page to default images\n\nWe've changed the JazzSM DASH login page images and want to restore them.

The TBSMAgent code was last\nupdated with TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n2.0 Hardware and software requirements\n----------------------------------\n\nFor information about hardware and software requirements, see the\nTivoli Business Service Manager Installation Guide on the IBM\nTivoli Business Service Manager Information Center (at IBM Knowledge Center):\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/welcome.htm [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/welcome.htm]\n\nTo apply this Fix Pack you will need 3 GB of disk space. Please check\nthe amount of space you have before you install, as the installation\nwill fail if you run out of space.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n3.0 Installation information\n------------------------\n\n3.1 Dependencies\n\nThis Fixpack must be installed on each server(s) that is running \nthe TBSM data server or TBSM dashboard server.\n\nThis Fixpack requires IBM Tivoli Business Service Manager \nVersion 6.1.1 to be installed.\n\n3.2 Prerequisites\n-------------\n\nTivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) has been certified. It\ncan be installed after installing this fix pack.\n\nIBM strongly recommends updating to TIP FP 2.2.0.15 v2, if support is\nrequired for FF ESR 31 and IE11. If the TBSM data server and dashboard \nserver are installed on different machines, the TIP Fix Pack needs to be \ninstalled only on the dashboard server. In case of a TIP HA environment, \nthe HA nodes need to be disjoined first before upgrading to TIP FP.\n\nSee Fix Central for availability:\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]\n\nPost installation of TIP 2.2.0.15 v2 requires a re-start of the\nDashboard server and clearing of all user's browser cache!\n\n3.3 Special considerations\n----------------------\n\nConsider this information before you install the Fix Pack:\n1. You will be prompted during the installation to specify a backup\ndirectory name. The installer backs up DE at this location.\n\n2. This Fixpack does not backup the entire application. It only\nbacks up the files that it has updated\/replaced. A backup copy of the\noriginal files can be retrieved from:\n[InstallDirectory]\/tipv2\/logs\/tbsm\/maintenance\/backup\/6.1.1.0\/FP0003\n\n3. The TBSM and TIP processes or services may remain running but, will \nbe re-started during the Fix Pack install process. If the processes\nor services are manually stopped, prior to the Fix Pack install,\nplease make sure both the OMNIbus Object server and DB2 processes or\nservices remain running!\n\nNOTE: The installer will start\/stop the TBSM and TIP services as\nneeded, during the install process.\n\nOn Linux\/Unix: perform the following\n\n1. To stop the TBSM Data server issue the following command:\n\n$TIP_HOME\/profiles\/TBSMProfile\/bin\/stopServer.sh server1 \n-username <adminuser> -password <adminpassword> \n\n2. To stop the TBSM Dashboard server, issue the following \ncommand:\n\n$TIP_HOME\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/bin\/stopServer.sh server1 \n-username <tipadminuser> -password <adminpassword> \n\nBy default, username is tipadmin and password is the \ntipadmin password.\n\n3. To stop the TBSM Discovery Library Toolkit issue the \nfollowing command:\n\n$TBSM_HOME\/XMLtoolkit\/bin\/tbsmrdr_stop.sh \n\nOn Windows:\n\n1. In the Start menu, click Settings -> Control Panel\n-> Administrative Tools -> Services.\n\nThe Services window opens. Depending on what services \nyou have installed, the available services are as follows: \n\nTivoli Business Service Manager - TBSMProfile_Port_17310. \nThis is the Data server. \nTivoli Integrated Portal - V2.2_TIPProfile_Port_16310.\nThis is the Dashboard server. \nTivoli BSM Discovery Library toolkit \nEIF probe \nThis service appears only if the EIF probe was installed \nas a Windows service. \n\n2. Right-click the service that you want to stop and click Stop.\n\n\n4. All non-vital programs should be closed prior to installation of \nthe Fixpack. \n\n\n3.4 Superceded Fixes\n----------------\n\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0001 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0002 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0003 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0004 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0002 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n\n\n3.5 Extracting Fix Pack files\n-------------------------\n\n3.5.1 Extracting on Linux, Solaris, Linux for System z, and AIX \nplatforms\n\n1. Copy the file 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>.tar to a temporary\nlocation on your TBSM Server.\n\n2. Unpack the file on each host where you need to install the Fix\nPack using these commands:\n\ntar -xvf 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003.<ARCH>.tar\n\n\n3.5.2 Extracting on Windows platforms\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Copy the 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-windows.zip file to a temporary\nlocation on your TBSM server host.\n\n2. Unzip the file on each server where you need to install the Fix Pack.\n\n\n3.5.3 Fix pack directories\n--------------------\n\nWhen you extract the file, these directories are created: \n\nTBSM -TBSM data server and dashboard server and TIP updates.\n\nDiscoveryLibrary -Discovery Library Toolkit updates\n\n<ARCH>\/Reports\n\nSamples\n\n\n3.6 Maintenance upgrade strategy\n----------------------------\n\nBefore you install the Fix Pack, you need to plan how and when you will\nupgrade each TBSM server in your environment. \n\n\n3.6.1 Example maintenance scenario\n----------------------------\n\nIn this example, the maintenance is staged into two phases to\nreduce the time required for the TBSM maintenance window.\n\nIn this example environment, there are four servers: \n* primary data server\n* backup data server\n* two dashboard servers set up for load balancing called: dash1\nand dash2\n\nFollow this sequence:\n\nBefore you start the maintenance window: \n1. Upgrade backup data server\n2. Upgrade one dashboard server (for example dash2)\n3. Use the primary data server and dash1 for regular production\nactivities\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade the two secondary servers, start\nthe maintenance window down time for the production servers.\n1. Upgrade primary data server\n2. Upgrade dash1\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade for all the servers: \n1. Start primary data server\n2. Start backup data server\n3. Wait until TBSM completes the server synchronization.\n4. Start the dashboard servers. \n\n\n3.7 Installation\n------------\n\n\n3.7.1 Installing the Fix Pack\n-----------------------\n\n[Fix Pack] Refers to the directory where you extracted the Fix\nPack files from the zip\/tar file.\n\nAttention: Install the Fix Pack with the same user that was\nused to install TBSM 6.1.1 GA\n\n\nNOTE: If you have deployed the Service Level Objectives (SLO) \nReporting Function, you must do the following before\ninstalling the Fix Pack:\n\n- Stop all Impact services that are running policies that\ncall the SLO functions to record data in the SLORPRT\ndatabase. If you have the service set to start at\nserver startup, then turn this option off before\ninstalling the fixpack, as the server is restarted\nduring the fixpack install.\n\nRunning the install without DE backup:\n\nIf you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can\nrun the install with the following parameter.\n\n-DNO_BACKUP=true\n\n(for Silent Install, uncomment the \"NO_BACKUP=true\" \nparm on the setupFP.rsp response file)\n\nIf you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.\nAnd restore the original system using your backup\/restore\nprocedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).\n\nFollow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:\n\n1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the\n[Fix Pack]\/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.\n2. Run the installation using one the following commands:\n* setup-windows.exe - Windows.\n* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.\n\nInstallation command options:\n\nGUI mode No options, for example: \nWindows: setup-windows.exe\n\nor\n\nUNIX\u00ae : .\/setup-<unixplatform>.bin \n\nConsole mode\nUse the -i console option. \nFor example -\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -i console\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae : .\/setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console\n\nSilent Mode\n\na. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted\nFix Pack file ([Fix Pack]\/TBSM) to a location it can be\nedited (\/tmp).\nb. Update the file to match your environment.\nc. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line\nand setting the parm to \"true\":\n#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false\nd. Run:\n\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\\tmp\\setupFP.rsp\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f \/tmp\/setupFP.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified\npath.\n\n3. During the install you will be asked to to verify\npath names to the TIP install.\n\n4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes\/services\n\n5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run\nthe script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data\nServer under $TBSM_HOME\/bin. This script loads the new\/updated\npolicies.\n\nNOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary\/\nbackup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to\nbe run on the primary data server.\n\nOn Windows:\n\nApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin\n\nOn Linux\/Unix:\n\n.\/ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - .\/ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin \n\nNOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are\ncorrect otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.\n\nIf incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id\nand password.\n\n6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files\nonto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,\nwhen TBSM was first setup).\n\nfrom: [Fix Pack]\/TBSM\/TBSMDBChecker\nto: [InstallDirectory]\/tbsmdb\/bin\n\nTBSM_Check_DB.bat\nTBSM_Check_DB.sh\ntbsmDatabaseChecker.xml\nTBSMDBChecker.props\n\nNOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use\nthe TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the\ndisplay of the requested user password.\n\n7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their\nbrowser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid\nany issues on the client side.\n\n8. If the Impact \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\"\nfunction was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional\npost Fix Pack installation required actions.\n\n9. Please refer to section 4.0 \"Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS\"\nfor additional post install actions.\n\n\n3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit\n-------------------------\n\n1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.\n\n2. To install Fixpack 3, \n\nIf you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt: \n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe\n\nIf you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt:\n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\".\n\nNote: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery \nLibrary Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and \nthat it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being \ninstalled with. If these are both okay, then set the environment\nvariable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and \nrestart the toolkit installer. For example: \nWindows:\nset TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\XMLtoolkit\nUNIX:\nexport TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tbsm\/XMLtoolkit\n\n3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.\n\n\n4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:\n\na) After installation is complete, you may remove\n[fixpack] to save space.\n\n5. Restart the toolkit.\n\n\n3.8 TBSM agent\n----------\n\nInstalling the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):\n\nThe following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent\ndirectory on the support download site:\n\n* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) \n\n* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)\n\n* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)\n\n* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)\n\n* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)\n\n\nTo install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:\n1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.\n2. Untar or unzip the file.\n3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM\nInstallation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM\nagent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.\n\nFor instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]\n\n\n3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack\n-------------------------\n\nBefore uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be\nSTOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before \nthe uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).\n\nAttention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to\ninstall TBSM 6.1.1 GA.\n\nSilent mode and uninstall\n\n\nIf silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will\ndefault to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response\nfile or the uninstall will fail.\n\nFor silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file\nfrom the Fix Pack image to the directory:\n\n<installDir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\n\nand update the file with the correct information. Then launch\nthe installer specifying the file. For example:\n\nuninstall(.exe) -f \/tmp\/setup_uninstall.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.\n\nOn the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:\n\n1. Change to the directory: \n<installDir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\n\n2. Run the uninstall command:\n\nUNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\/uninstall\n\n\nWindows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\\uninstall.exe\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\"\n\n3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear\nthe server cache.\n\nLinux\/AIX: <TIP_HOME>\/bin\/clearClassCache.sh\n\nSolaris: java -Xshare:dump\n\nWindows: <TIP_HOME>\\bin\\clearClassCache.bat\n\n\n\n4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35\n\nNOTE: On a \"Data server only\" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix\nPack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS\n7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at\na future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is\nnecessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. \n\nThese steps DO NOT apply to a \"Dashboard sever only\"\nenvironment or a \"Single server\" environment, where both the\nData and Dashboard are installed together.\n\nAgain, these steps are only needed on a \"Data server only\"\nenvironment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent\nthe re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!\n\na). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location\nThe uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:\n<installdir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\/plan\/install\/MachinePlan_localhost\/00002_WASFP\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Unix:\n\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\/plan\/install\/MachinePlan_localhost\/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Windows:\nC:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\_uninst\\TBSM611_FP3\\plan\\install\\MachinePlan_localhost\\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nOr from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>\\TBSM\\COI\\PackageSteps\\WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nb). Edit the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt (on the temporary location)\n\nc). locate this line: -W product.location=\"@IAGLOBAL_WAS_HOME@\"\n\nd). Replace above line with: -W product.location=\"<installdir>\/tipv2\"\n\nWhere <installdir> is the fully qualified directory where tipv2 located:\n\nfor example (Unix): -W product.location=\"\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tipv2\"\n\nfor example (Windows): -W product.location=\"C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\"\n\ne). Save the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file (on the temporary location)\n\nf). Execute the following command:\nOn Unix:\n<installdir>\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.sh -options <templocation>\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor example: \/opt\/IBM\/tivoli_root\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.sh -options \/tmp\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nOn Windows:\n<installdir>\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.exe -options <templocation>\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor exampe: C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\\update.exe -options C:\\Temp\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\n5. Restart the Data Server and Dashboard Server.\n\n\n\nDiscovery Library Toolkit\n===================================================\n\nThe Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\nA backup copy of the original files can be retrieved from:\n\n[InstallDirectory]\/tbsm\/\nXMLtoolkit\/log\/install\/maintenance\/backup\/611FP0003\n\n\n\n3.10 Recovering from a failed Fix Pack install\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf the install fails, try to uninstall in which case, it goes back to\nthe previous version. If there is no uninstall file under \n_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3, then nothing really got installed and you can delete\nthe TBSM611_FP3 file and reinstall.\n\n\n3.11 Restoring failed DE upgrade from backup\n---------------------------------------\n\nTo recover a failed Deployment Engine upgrade in TBSM 6.1.1, see the\nTBSM Installation Guide at: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html]\n\n\n3.12 \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\" function\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe information in this section applies only if you have deployed\nthe Impact Solution called \"Service Level Objectives (SLO)\nReporting\". The SLO function is enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:\n\n* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA\ndefinitions\n\n* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads\nfrom a TBSM Metric History database\n\n* Bug fixes and improved documentation\n\nFor this function, See the 'SLO Reporting' topic under Impact\n6.1.1 at the following url:\n\nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc\/solution\/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc\/solution\/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html]\n\nIf you have NOT deployed this solution, then you can skip this\nsection!\n\n\nAfter installing the Fixpack, but BEFORE restarting any SLO services:\n\n1) Update the SLORPRT database schema\n\na) You will need access to the machine where the SLORPRT\ndatabase was installed. If this database has not been\ninstalled, then the SLO solution has not been deployed\nand there is no need to continue this update to the\nschema.\n\nb) If necessary, copy files add_timezone.sql and\nupdate_views_timezone.sql from \n[InstallDirectory]\/impact\/add-ons\/slo\/db\nto a location accessible from the system you will use\nto update the database schema in the next step.\n\nc) Open a DB2 command window on a system with access to\nthe SLORPRT database and run the following commands:\n\ndb2 connect to SLORPRT user dbuser using dbpassword\n( replace dbuser and dbpassword with the\nuser\/password specified in datasource\nSLOReportDatasource )\n\ndb2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>\/add_timezone.sql\n\ndb2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>\/update_views_timezone.sql\n\ndb2 connect reset\n\nWhere <slo_sql_dir> would be \n[InstallDirectory]\/impact\/add-ons\/slo\/db if on the \nsame machine as the Impact Data server, or the directory\nwhere you copied the files in step b if the SLORPRT\ndatabase is on a different machine\n\n\n2) Once the Fixpack is installed and the SLORPRT database\nschema has been updated, you should start any Impact\nservices configured for SLO processing. Remember to check\nthe option to start the service when the server starts,\nif that is how you originally configured the service.\n\n=======================================================================\n4.0 Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS:\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following APARs fixed in this service delivery require additional\naction by users. If your environment uses or is experiencing the\nsymptoms described, use the instructions provided to complete the fix.\n\n4.1 IV30875 - ERROR CTGBC0053E WHEN SELECTING SERVICE IN A CANVAS\nCustomers are now allowed to persist their log file settings \nwithout manually editing the server.xml file. Currently, customers\nuse the setTraceLevel script to set the maximum number of log files\nand the size of these of files using the following method:\n\n$TBSM_HOME\/bin\/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data\/dashboard -setTraceOutputToFile 30 40\n\nNow they will be able to persist these sizes by using the following\ncommand.\n\n$TBSM_HOME\/bin\/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data\/dashboard -setstartup\n\nBefore this change, the call would only persist changes to the trace\nlevel. Now it persists changes to the trace level as well as the log\nfile configurations.\n\n\n4.2 IV65545 - TBSMEVENTREADER STOPS BECAUSE EVENT PROCESSOR BLOCKING ON\nRADEVENTSTORE\n\nThe following SQL statements needs to be run after FP install, against \nthe TBSM DB2 Database:\n\nCREATE INDEX RADEVENTSTORE_IDX1 ON TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE(RADSERIAL) COLLECT STATISTICS\n\nThe above SQL statement can be found on the following file:\n\n.\/tipv2\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/installedApps\/TIPCell\/isc.ear\/sla.war\/install\/AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql\n\nPlease provide the above file to the TBSM DB2 Database Administrator, \nalong with the following Notes:\n\nNotes: \n1) Use\ncat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2\nto run the SQL. The command must be run against all DB2 databases\nused for TBSM. The command does not require a server stop\/start.\n\n2) The ; delimiter is not used in the AddRADEventStore.sql file\n- whether the delimiter is required or not depends on the\nconnection settings (-t option).\n\n3) Typical output from the SQL: cat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2\ndb2 => db2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.\n\n4) Typical output from the SQL (if the index already exists)\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => SQL0605W The index was not created because an index\n\"TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE_IDX\" with a matching definition already exists.\nSQLSTATE=01550\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.\n\n5) Other warning:\nSQL2314W Some statistics are in an inconsistent state. The newly\ncollected \"INDEX\" statistics are inconsistent with the existing \n\"TABLE\" statistics. SQLSTATE=01650\n\nTo address the message above, RUNSTATS Is Run after the index is\ncreated. \n\nAs well as the changes in the index there are 2 \nconfigurations changed required for this APAR\n\na) Increase the number of allowed connections for the TBSMDatabase \nData Source.\n\nThis can be done via the Impact GUI screen (Data Model) or via\nthe file tbsm\\etc\\TBSM_TBSMDatabase.ds\n\nIncrease the number from default 15 to 50 (or to limit \nrecommended by DB2 Admin)\n\nTBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=15\nto\nTBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=50\n\nIf changing via file, then a Data Server restart is required.\n\n\nb) Set the LOCKTIMEOUT in DB2 to 30 seconds. The default is -1, \nwhich mean no timeout - If you set this parameter to -1, lock \ntimeout detection is turned off. Setting to 30 seconds means \nsessions will only wait for 30 seconds for a lock. Again, this \nchange should be made in consultation with local DB2 \nAdministrator.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n5.0 List of APARs\n-------------\n\n5.1 TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 APARs\n---------------------------\n\nThe following TBSM APARs are delivered with Fix Pack 3:\nIV60619 DATA SERVER RESTART REQUIRED TO GET A WORKING DATA FETCHER AFTER DELETION OF DEPENDENT RULE\nIV61278 RULE FILTER WITH 'NOT LIKE' ON SUMMARY FIELD MALFUNCTIONS\nIV64797 SETDBSCHEMA -F A COMMAND SHOULD ALSO RESET THE RESENRICHREADER SERVICE. : 611\nIV65695 FO_CONFIG SCRIPT DOES NOT CONFIGURE SET TBSM_B_IMPACTDB.DS DATA SOURCE PARAMETERS IN A FAILOVER ENVIRONMENT. : 611\nIV65825 XMLToolkit: Single Quotes not Encoded on IDML file generation: 611\nIV65947 ACCESSING CLOB DATATYPES IN TBSM DATABASE CAUSES DB2 ERROR, SQL0270N : 611\nIV65949 ACCESSING TBSM DATABASE VIEWS WITH IN TBSM CAUSES DB2 ERROR : 611\nIV65958 TBSM DATABASE QUERIES THAT USE MAX, MIN, DISTINCT, VIEWS CAUSES DB2 ERROR, SQL0243N : 611\nIV66535 TOOLKIT ISSUE RELATED TO STATEMENT RTERMINATION CHARACTERS: 611\nIV66950 TBSMEVENTREADER STOPS : THE REAL FIX FOR IV65545 IS TO FIX THE TXN CODE : 611\nIV71255 SELECT STATEMENTS USED FOR LOGGING PURPOSES IN DB-CLEANUP.SQL SCRIPT NEED TO BE COMMENTED OUT. : 611\nIV72005 IMPACT SLO FUNCTION\n\n5.2 TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 2 APARs\n---------------------------\n\nIV62456 OOM DUE TO CIRCULAR REFERENCES\nIV62548 SAME SESSION CONTEXT USED FOR ALL RADSHELL SESSIONS, TRIGGERED FROM POLICIES\nIV60168 MODIFIED 'TBSM_NUMERICATTRIBUTEFUNCTIONS' POLICY DOESN'T GET EXPORTED\nIV56853 RADSHELL IMPORT FAILS DUE TO ORPHANED CHILD SERVICE\nIV63608 AFTER FIX FOR APAR IV32754 SEE SQLSTATE=42704 EXCEPTION FOR TBSMSCR.SCCP_COMPCLASS IN TOOLKIT LOGS\nIV65503 ESDA DOES NOT CLEAN OLD SERVICE IDENTIFICATION FIELDS\nIV65786 TBSM CIRCULAR REFERENCES ISSUE\nIV59886 TBSM DOES NOT RE-READ EVENT READER PROPS FILES AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU CONFIGURE\/ENABLE EVENT ENRICHMENT\nIV61880 INFINITE LOOP IN DATA SERVER CAUSED BY MALFORMED OFFLINE TASK\nIV64950 DB2 ERROR DB2 SQL ERROR: SQLCODE=-805\nIV60750 NUMERICAL RULES NOT CALCULATED ON TBSM RESTART\nIV60961 CONCURRENTMODIFICATIONEXCEPTION THROWN WHEN YOU SELECT THE GUI FIND INSTANCE FUNCTION IN THE SERVICE AVILABILITY PORTLET\nIV61199 TBSM SLAM EVENTS ONLY GENERATED IF THE RULE OUPOUT CHANGES\nIV62273 CONCURRENTMODIFICATIONEXCEPTION ERRORS IN DASHBOARD LOG\nIV62294 NUMERIC AGGRIGATION RULE CHANGES NOT SAVED\nIV62246 DATA SOURCE FAILOVER SETTINGS CLASH BETWEEN TBSM AND IMPACT\nIV64933 [NetcoolTimeoutException] Log file exceptions when persisting ESDA instances\nIV65545 TBSMEVENTREADER STOPS BECAUSE EVENT PROCESSOR BLOCKING ON RADEVENTSTORE\nIV66210 NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION DISPLAYED ON SYSTEM STATUS ON FAILBACK\nIV65484 TBSM: DISPLAY NAME IN PERSISTENT SERVICE MODEL NOT BEING UPDATED\nIV68113 DELTA IMPORTS NOT WORKING FOR BUSINESS APPLICATIONS WITH IMPORTING FROM TADDM 7.3 TO TBSM 6.1.1 FP1\nIV60842 QUERY CONCATENATION PROBLEM WHEN THE PROPERTY 'DL_LIFECYCLESTATE_FILTER' IS ENABLED\nIV56450 NULL POINTER EXCEPTION AFTER CLICKING ON 'FIND INSTANCE'\nIV65991 DOCS ABOUT CONFIGURING FOR HTTP ACCESS INCORRECT\n\n\n\n5.3 TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 1 APARs\n---------------------------\n\nThe following TBSM APARs are delivered with Fix Pack 1:\n\nIV21679 MODEL CLEANUP NEEDED AFTER ALIAS CHANGES\nIV30875 ERROR CTGBC0053E WHEN SELCTING SERVICE IN A CANVAS\nIV33717 ADVANCED THRESHOLD LOOKS CORRUPTED WHEN IT CONTAINS SINGLE SPACE CHARACTERS\nIV36878 Dont create rules with ' character'\nIV38053 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE IS NOT WORKING\nIV38471 ADD LONGPARENTSERVICENAME TO THE TBSM REPORTING DATA MODEL.\nIV38574 SERVICE TREE COLUMNS DO NOT RESIZE TO FIT WHEN PORTLET RESIZES SMALLER.\nIV39167 NEED ABILITY TO LOGIN USING UID AND HAVE CN IN TIP BANNER\nIV39517 ESDA RULE DIALOG DOES NOT ALLOW PARENT TEMPLATE CHOICE\nIV39796 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE WITH ADJACENT TIME WINDOWS CAUSING LOOP\nIV42339 CUSTOMER TRY SETTING THE PARM TO 'NULL' TURNS OUT THE DATASOURCE FILE WE SHIP FOR OUR OBJECT SERVER\nIV42657 SERVICE STATUS INCORRECT\nIV42941 COMPONENT COMPOSITES NAME TOO LONG IMPORTED FROM TADDM\nIV43098 SERVICE TREE REFRESH UPON CLICKING OR EXPANDING \nIV43165 INSTANCE PROPAGATION IN PLACE FOR SERVICES IMPORTED FROM TADDM BECAUSE OF RULE ON SCR_RETRIEVEDEPENDENTOBJECTSTEMPLATE\nIV43469 TBSM HANGS DURING AUTOPOP -

This will mean 2 MSS associated\n# with objects.\n# \n# When setting a string for the alias, use the primary taddm \n# hostname.\n#\nDL_AliasForMSS = PrimaryTaddmHostname\n#\n# Note: Launch in Context uses the MSS hostname to build the \n# sourceContactInfo value, which is used to contact the TADDM \n# server. For this reason, when TADDM is configured in Failover, \n# a front end server (load balancer) is required, to route Launch\n# In Context requests to the active server. This will ensure \n# requests are routed to the secondary TADDM server, when the \n# primary is down.\n\nIV65503 ESDA DOES NOT CLEAN OLD SERVICE IDENTIFICATION FIELDS\nThe property \"UseESDAIdentifiersOnly\" can be added, as an\nadditional parameter to the child Template, which will allow\nusers to select if they want previous event identifiers on a\nservice to be kept or erased with each invalidation. \n\nWhen set to \"true\", all previous event identifiers will be \nerased from TBSM memory model at each invalidation and the\nservice will only accept identifiers from ESDA policies or via\nSCR API. When set to \"false\", all event identifiers, old or\nnewly added will be preserved for the service. User must\nmanually delete event identifiers that they do not wish to\nkeep. This is TBSM's default behaviour. \n\nIV65786 TBSM CIRCULAR REFERENCES ISSUE\nThere will be two new properties added in TBSM_sla.props file\nthat governs the check:\n\nProperty name: impact.sla.servicetreedepthlimit\nDescription: When the data is imported from TADDM, a depth\nlimit check will be done to the corresponding service tree \nduring invalidation to ensure that the service tree has normal\nrelationship data. This property governs the depth limit for\nthe service tree. If the system detects a service tree with\ndepth level larger than the value set by this property, a \nwarning service instance will be created to warn the user to\nreview their data relationship.\n\nDefault value: 20\n\nProperty name: impact.sla.disableimportalldescendantslimitcheck\nDescription: When set to \"true\", the service tree depth limit\nwill not be checked during invalidation.\n\nDefault value: false\n\nIV62246 DATA SOURCE FAILOVER SETTINGS CLASH BETWEEN TBSM AND IMPACT\nThe APAR handles the issue of TBSM Failover settings for Data\nSources. Impact back-end java code handled whether or not\nfailover (or failback) is initiated in times of Data Source\nfailure. This back-end Impact code only uses the \nFAILOVERPOLICY settings in the .ds files\n\nThe APAR change has been in the TBSM interfaces to setting up\nData Source. There are 2 interfaces 1) GUI screen (as above)\nand 2 radshell (createDataSource and export functions). \n\n1) TBSM GUI: The TBSM GUI will now set the FAILOVERPOLICY\nsetting in the .ds file. When editing existing files, if\nno valid FAILOVERPOLICY exists, then the current\nDISABLEFAILOVER setting will be used to determine a new\nFAILOVERPOLICY setting, i.e. if no valid FAILOVERPOLICY\nexists, then if DISABLEFAILOVER is true, FAILOVERPOLICY \nwill be set to DISABLED. If DISABLEFAILOVER is false,\nFAILOVERPOLICY will be set to FAILOVER\n\nTake good note of the above. It means that existing data\nsources will have a new FAILOVERPOLICY set, when they are\nfirst saved via the GUI. Previously if FAILOVERPOLICY was\nnot valid, Impact assumed FAILOVER. But if you edit a data\nsource, and the data source has DISABLEFAILOVER = true,\nand no valid policy set, then the new value for\nFAILOVERPOLICY is DISABLED. This is correct behaviour, but\ndifferent to before. The best was to avoid any confusion,\nit to check each .ds file and ensure that a valid\nFAILOVERPOLICY is set. Do this either by editing the files\n(in which case a Data Server restart is required) or by\nopening each data source in the GUI. Not all Data Sources\nwill appear in the GUI (as some are built in). For these,\ncheck the files. If editing files, ensure no spaces at the\nend of settings. The only valid values for FAILOVERPOLICY\nare DISABLED, FAILOVER and FAILBACK.\n\n2) radshell: The Radshell interface also changes. The export()\nfunction will now export the failover policy, and the\ncreateDataSource takes a policy parameter (in place of the\nboolean disablefailover parameter), Also, the old\ncreateDataSource radshell function, will still work (for\nbackward compatibility with old exports). Note: Data Sources \nexported with IV62246 in place, will NOT work on old\nsystems-as the generated radshell command will contain a\npolicy string. \n\nThe following IMPACT APARs are delivered with

See Fix Central for availability:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all]\n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n6.0 New support and features\n------------------------\n\n6.1 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 3\n--------------------\nFix Pack 3 includes the following enhancements:\n\n1) Template Editor: sort items in \"Rules\" table\n\nAdjusting the logic that handles the order of the rules displayed in\nthe table on the Rules tab. The following are the new rules each\nof the columns will adhere to:\n\nType column\n> use the same icon as the toolbar action that created the rule\n> tooltips describe the rule's type\n\nRule Name column\n> all rule names are now sorted A-Z \n> A-Z ordering maintained as rules are created and\/or deleted \n> tooltips describe the rule's type; same as Type column\n> the display order will not be customer configurable\n\nRule Settings column\n> minor styling tweaks to assist readability\n\nThe above enhancement is specific to the TBSM console\n\n2) Tree Template datasets: enable use of internal status attributes in\n\"Tree Template Editor\"\n\nExtended the capability of the Tree Template datasets by allowing\nTBSM internal status attributes to be selected on the editor UI's\nTemplate Rule Mapping section.\n\nWhen Tree Template Viewed in TIP-based Service Tree\n\nWithout processing by the customization policy, these new status\nattributes will display as the standard TBSM status values: \n0.0, 3.0, or 5.0. \n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n3) Datasets need a parameter to optionally exclude \"starting\" or\n\"container\" services.\n\nWith the addition of the Tree Template datasets in TBSM 6.1.1\nFixpack 1, we now have more situations where the administrator may\nwish to exclude the starting or container service from a view.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n4) Support parameter to filter datasets in TBSM_Services datasource\nby template\n\nThe parameter would be available on the datasets in the \nTBSM_Services datasource, which includes the \"All_TBSM_Services\"\nand \"TBSM_Urgent_Services\" datasets\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n5) \"UrgentServices\" dataset added\n\nThis new dataset makes the service model data that was displayed\nin the legacy Urgent Services portlet available for display using\nthe List and Table widgets.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n6) Managing Dataset Dynamic Updates\n\nAll datasets available from the TBSM UI Data Provider automatically\nsend updates when the content changes. This is the recommended usage\nof the TBSM datasets, but there may be scenarios where the user\nwould like to turn off the dynamic updating.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\nMore information can be found in the new \"Dynamic Updating and the\nTBSM UI Data Provider\" document on the TBSM Advanced Topics page at\nthe TBSM developersWorks site\n\n7) Tivoli Netcool\/Impact provides new property to ascertain which Data\nProvider field is used, when retrieving ITM data from the REST\nService\n\n8) Enhancements to the Impact Solution called \n\"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\". The SLO function\nis enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:\n\n* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA\ndefinitions\n\n* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads from\na TBSM Metric History database\n\n* Bug fixes and improved documentation\n\n\nSee the Advanced Topics at the TBSM developerWorks site for new and\nupdated information:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1\/page\/Advanced%20Topics [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1\/page\/Advanced%20Topics] \n\n\n6.2 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 2\n--------------------\n\n1) NUMERICAL RULES NOT CALCULATED ON TBSM RESTART\nNumerical Aggregation rules are triggered by a child metric rule\nchange, i.e. OverallAttribute. When the status of a child changes, the\nOverallAttribute metric rule's value will change and any Numerical \nAggregation rules, based on OverallAttribute, will be recalculated. \nWhen TBSM is restarted, only services which have related existing \nevents will have their status recalculated. Therefore not all Numerical\nAggregation rules (based on OverallAttribute) will be recalculated on \nTBSM restart, as some services will be green. \n\nThis may not be the desired outcome. On restart, it may be required\nthat all Numerical Aggregation rules are restarted. New functionality \nhas been provided for such a scenario, by forcing a bubble up of state \nnodes. The code can be triggered from a policy, for leaf nodes\nonly, or for all, as shown here: \n\nUSE_SHARED_SCOPE;\n\nType=\"StateModel\";\nFilter = \"RECALCSTATENODESLEAF\";\nlog(\"Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Start.\" );\nGetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); \nlog(\"Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Finish.\" );\n}\n\n\nUSE_SHARED_SCOPE;\n\nType=\"StateModel\";\nFilter = \"RECALCSTATENODESALL\";\nlog(\"Recalc All Nodes. Policy Start.\" );\nGetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); \nlog(\"Recalc All Nodes. Policy Finish.\" );\n}\n\nThe above policy code needs to be scheduled from Impact Services on\nstartup.\n\n\n\n2) TBSM SLAM EVENTS ONLY GENERATED IF THE RULE OUTPUT CHANGES\nIf a client wants SLAM event text for a Numerical rule, to update\n(even if it's value does not change), the following parm needs to be\nun-commented and set to \"true\"\n\n#If true then send SLAM events, even when the value of a Metric rule does NOT change.\n#Default is false.\n#Omnibus de-duplication will handle the rest.\n#impact.sla.sendslameventsformetricrulealways=true\n\n\n\n6.3 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1\n--------------------\n\n1) The BSM_Templates.radsh defines service templates for common TBSM services.\nIt was executed when you installed the TBSM GA release(not during the fixpack \ninstall). It's default template rules propagate child status to the parent \nservice based on child template changes. The script has been updated to set \nthe propagation type to instance propagation. When the child service status \nchanges, it will propagate the change to the parent service regardless of\nwhich child template rule caused the status change. See the Service \nConfiguration publication for more information about the aggregation rule \noption.\n\nTo update the rules with the instance propagation option in your current \ninstallation, you can invoke the \n$TBSM_HOME\/install\/BSM_Templates_updatepropation.radsh script.\n\nIf you re-execute the $TBSM_HOME\/install\/BSM_Templates.radsh script \nto re-create the templates, the rules will be configured with \nthe instance propagation option.\n\n\n2) The recommended version of JRE plugin is Sun JRE 1.7.0_51 or 1.8 for \nInternet Explorer and Firefox.\n\n3) Additional toolkit customization has been made. To pick up these\nchanges, run the following commands on the Data Server:\n\nWindows:\n\ncd %TBSM_HOME%\\install\ntype BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | %TBSM_HOME%\\bin\\rad_radshell\n\nUNIX:\n\ncd $TBSM_HOME\/install\ncat BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | $TBSM_HOME\/bin\/rad_radshell\n\n4) As noted in the following Technote, When configuring pages in DASH \n(JazzSM) for TBSM datasets, it is often desirable to create them\nin a development environment and then later move them to\nproduction, perhaps via a test environment. With this Fix Pack and\nin conjunction with JazzSM 1.1 Fix Pack 2, there is no need to create\ntwo connections any longer.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077]\n\n5) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 will support the use of a rich hover function in\nDASH (JazzSM). The TBSM UI data provider will now send the information\nneeded in order for a DASH user to configure a widget for rich hover \nsupport. To enable the rich hover in DASH you must:\n\nConfigure TBSM 6.1.1 to collect the registry information required to\nsupport the rich hover in TBSM 6.1.1. This configuration is documented\nat http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/customization\/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/customization\/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html].\nThe rich hover option will not be available in DASH for widgets\nconfigured with a TBSM dataset if the oslcconfig has not been run.\n\nConfigure DASH (UI Services) for access to JazzSM Registry Services.\nConfiguration of the required property is described at \nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3\/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3\/tip_original\/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3\/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3\/tip_original\/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html].\n\nNote that if enabled in DASH, rich hover will be shown for the same\nservices that support the rich hover in the TBSM 6.1.1 console. If \nconfigured for a widget, and there is no rich hover information, \nthen the flyover on the DASH widget will show nothing. Also note \nthat the DASH environment requires Single Sign On be configured \nbetween the various components required to gather the preview \ninformation (DASH, TADDM, ITM, etc.)\n\n6) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 adds a new UI data provider data source that\nprovides new datasets corresponding to the customer's tree templates.\nThis allows the same data to be visualized in the legacy Service Tree\nas well as on a JazzSM\/DASH page.\n\n\n6.4 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 3\n\nNone!\n\n6.5 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 2\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTBSM 6.1.1 supports FF ESR 10 and FF17 with Fix Pack 1 on TIP 2.2.0.11 (or below).\n\nThis Fix pack supports Internet Explorer 9(IE9) in \n\"Internet Explorer 9\" browser mode which is the default mode, not \nin \"Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View\" browser mode.\nThe document mode is automatically set by TIP and should remain\n'IE7 standards'.\n\nIBM strongly recommends updating to TIP 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) if\nsupport is required for FF ESR 24\/31 and\/or IE10\/11\n\nSee Fix Central for availability:\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm\/Tivoli\/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]\n\n\n\n6.6 eWAS Fixes and Upgrades\n-----------------------\n\nPlease Note: The TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack will upgrade WebSphere (eWAS) on the Data\nserver automatically, to version 7.0 Fix Pack 35 (7.0.0.35) but, only if the Dashboard\nserver is not installed on that environment. If the Dashboard server is installed on the\nsame server (in the case of a single server environment), the eWAS will not be upgraded.\n\neWAS upgrade, on the TBSM Dashboard server and on \"Single server\" environments, will\ntake place when TIP 2.2.0.15 is applied.\n\nIf un-installing TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack, refer to section 3.9 \"Uninstalling the Fix Pack\"\nto manually remove eWAS 7.0.0.35 (on Data server only environments!).\n\n\n6.7 OMNIbus 8.1\n-----------\nTBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 1 supports the use of OMNIbus 8.1. But, please note that\nOMNIbus 8.1 is a separate install, requiring additional configuration changes to\nmake it work with TBSM. Refer to \"IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus Considerations\" section\nof the \"Exploring TBSM\" Guide:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html]\n\nIf using OMNIbus 8.1, IBM recommends upgrading to the latest 8.1\nmaintenance level (at the moment, Fix Pack 2).\n\nIf using JazzSM\/DASH to display TBSM resources, the Event Viewer and\/or AEL may fail to display the appropriate\nTBSM events if (1) a Data Source is not setup to point to TBSM's OMNIbus and (2) the custom TBSM filters and views are\nnot defined to WebGUI. To setup the WebGUI views, it will be required to copy the following file from\nthe TBSM Dashboard server to a temporary location on the JazzSM server:\n\n<installdir>\/tipv2\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/installedApps\/TIPCell\/isc.ear\/sla.war\/install\/webtopcore\/create_tbsm_views.xml\n\nIn addition to copying the file to the JazzSM server, it is necessary to execute the runwaapi command, to load filters\/views\nthe WebGUI. On the JazzSM\/DASH server, execute the following command:\n\n<installdir>\/netcool\/omnibus_webgui\/waapi\/bin\/runwaapi -file create_tbsm_views.xml -user <admin> -password <password>\n\nPlease refer to the integration document found in \"Advanced Topics\"\nat the TBSM developerWorks site, for this and other topics:\n\nTBSM developerWorks Advanced Topics: https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1\/page\/Advanced%20Topics [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1\/page\/Advanced%20Topics]\nIntegration document: https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/groups\/service\/html\/communityview?communityUuid=7d5ebce8-2dd8-449c-a58e-4676134e3eb8#fullpageWidgetId=Wea1cb2531f10_4ccd_99d7_6ab0334cb21f&file=c6d51b71-362e-44be-8aa2-650da0918ac7 [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/groups\/service\/html\/communityview?communityUuid=7d5ebce8-2dd8-449c-a58e-4676134e3eb8#fullpageWidgetId=Wea1cb2531f10_4ccd_99d7_6ab0334cb21f&file=c6d51b71-362e-44be-8aa2-650da0918ac7]\n\n\n6.8 DB2 \n---\nStarting with TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 2, TBSM supports the use of DB2\nversion 10.5.3\n\n\n6.9 TADDM 7.3 Integration\n---------------------\nFor import of Business Applications from TADDM 7.3 to TBSM 6.1.1, the\nproperty com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility\nmust be set to \"true\" in collation.properties file (located under\ntaddm\/dist\/etc). This will be true by default for upgraded TADDM 7.3\nservers. It is false by default for fresh TADDM 7.3 installs. \n\nNote: TADDM restart is required after property modification.\n\nIf com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility is \nflipped from false to true, then all Business Applications need to be \nre-build, to regenerate backward compatible Business Applications. This \ncan be done by either waiting for scheduler to process all Grouping \nPatterns (and recreate new and old Business Applications) or by manually \nexecuting (all or selected) Grouping Patterns from TADDM UI (or command\nline).\n\n\n=======================================================================\n7.0 Known issues - \n------------\n\n7.1 Some date options in TBSM Reports do not work\n\nWhen specifying the date parameters for reports, some options \nlike \"last 30 days\" do not work. However, one can get this data\nfor the reports by selecting the Date Range and choosing the \ndates from the calendar. Below is a link to the TBSM reports in\nour Service Configuration guide which outlines how to run reports.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/ServiceConfigurationGuide\/bsmu_rept_view_reports.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/ServiceConfigurationGuide\/bsmu_rept_view_reports.html]\n\n\n\n7.2 Issues creating wire between Service Tree and Active \nEvent List (AEL)\n\nIf the user creates a wire between the Service Tree and AEL\nwhen a page is first created, the wire does not work. The\nworkaround for this is to create a wire by editing the page\nafter the page has been created and saved. \n\n\n\n7.3 TBSM Agent Chart title differs from name in the \ndrop down list \n\nName displayed at the top of a TBSM Agent Chart differs from\nthe name of that chart in the drop down list. For eg,\nthe chart name in the drop down list is \"kr9_TBSM Service Status\" \nand the name shown at the top of the chart is \"Kr9:KR91003\". \nThe name at the top can be changed to display the same name \nas the drop down list by going to Preferences and changing \nthe chart name.\n\n\n\n7.4 Minimize-restore does not restore to correct size for\nService Navigation->Data\/Data Fetchers on Internet Explorer(IE)9 \n\nIn the Service Navigation->Data\/Data Fetchers portlet, after the \nminimize option has been exercised to minimize the portlet, the \nportlet is not resized correctly after using the 'restore' option.\nThe window resizes to a smaller size. This is an issue on\nInternet Explorer(IE) 9 but not on Firefox or on Internet \nExplorer(IE) 8. In order to go back to the original size, \nselect 'maximize' and 'restore'. \n\n\n\n7.5 Portlets covering content in a free form page\n\nWhen creating free form pages, the Service Viewer and Active Event \nList(AEL) portlets will always be on top of any content. This can \ninterfere with page layout and editing of portlet preferences. \nTo alleviate this issue, it is best to place these portlets \nonto the created page last to avoid having other content covered \nby them. If a page requires editing and contains Service Viewer \nor Active Event List portlets, it may be necessary to move \nthose portlets out of the way before editing preferences of \nother portlets.\n\n\n\n7.6 Creation and deletion of Services and Templates that contain\nspecial characters\n\nDue to new security additions the deletion of services and templates\nthat contain the characters '+', '&', '<','>','%',' \" ', is not\npermitted through the browser. Some of these characters are\npermitted on the creation of services, as services can still be\ncreated with these through auto population and importing. The \ndeletion of these services will now have to be carried out\nthrough the radshell command deleteServiceInstance. \n\nMore information on the command can be found here.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.0\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1\/adminguide\/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.0\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1\/adminguide\/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html]\n\n\n\n\n7.7 WEBSERVICES SECURITY NOT FUNCTIONAL\nIf using WebService Security when making a WebService call,\n(callProps.EnableWSS=true), the jar file \ntipv2\/plugin\/org.apache.axis2.jar must be replaced by the jar\nfile tbsm\/lib3p\/org.apache.axis2-woden.jar and the newly replaced\nfile must be renamed to org.apache.axis2.jar.\n\nRestart is required.\n\n7.8 If using WEBSERVICES SECURITY (WSS) user authentication, then the\nimpact\/dsa\/wsdsa\/wss\/conf\/wscb.properties needs to be altered to\nonly have one entry. If there is more than one entry in the file,\nonly the uid.1 and pwd.1 will be read\n\n7.9 Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.\nIE11 (supported only with TIP 2.2.0.15) may cause unexpected\nbehaviour in the Policy Editor, whereby the Policy List panel\ndisappears when the Project drop-down menu is selected. To\ncircumvent this, simply click on a different project in the Project\ndrop-down list and then click again on the desired project, to\nrestore the correct layout\n\n7.10 With certain Solaris installations the Event Summary portlet\n(Administration -> Service Administration -> Services) may fail to\nrender and cause an Out Of Memory (PermGen) exception (as seen in\nthe TIP trace log:\n\"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space exception\")\n\n\nSolution: \n1. Stop TBSM (kill the hung server if necessary).\n\n2. Goto the $TBSM_HOME\/tipv2\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/config\/cells\/TIPCell\/nodes\/TIPNode\/servers\/server1\ndirectory and make a backup of the server.xml file.\n\n3. Open the server.xml file for editing and in the jvmEntries xmi\ntag modify the genericJvmArguments attribute to read something\nlike this, where these two PermSize and MaxPermSize parms are\nbeing added (if other parms are already code, please preserve\nthose parms and just insert the two new ones): \n\ngenericJvmArguments=\" -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC\"\n\n4. Save the file and restart TBSM.\n\n\n7.11 TIP Portlet blank or does not load after TIP 2.2.0.15 installation\nRefer to the following Technote for resolution:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426]\n\nNOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)\n\n7.12 TIP chart portlet blank if TBSM Service Admin page is closed and \nre-opened\nRefer to the following Technote for resolution:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424]\n\nNOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)\n\n7.13 TBSM integration with ISM is no longer operational and will be\nremoved from the next TBSM version 6.1.1 Fix Pack. \nThis modification is due to changes in the supported versions of\nITCAM for Transaction \/ ISM.\n\n7.14 Java Security Warnings\nWith the ever changing security improvements to both the browsers\nJava Runtime Environment (JRE), clients are now more likely to see\nwarning messages about untrusted connections or invalid\ncertificates. To avoid those issues, clients can replace the IBM\nHTTP Server SSL certificate with an SSL certificate signed by a\nthird-party CA. For guidance on that task, refer to the following\nTechnote:\nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21424371 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21424371]\n\n=======================================================================\n8.0 Copyright and trademark information\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/legal\/copytrade.shtml [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/legal\/copytrade.shtml]\n\n8.1 Notices\n\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

If you have the service set to start at\nserver startup, then turn this option off before\ninstalling the fixpack, as the server is restarted\nduring the fixpack install.\n\nRunning the install without DE backup:\n\nIf you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can\nrun the install with the following parameter.\n\n-DNO_BACKUP=true\n\n(for Silent Install, uncomment the \"NO_BACKUP=true\" \nparm on the setupFP.rsp response file)\n\nIf you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.\nAnd restore the original system using your backup\/restore\nprocedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).\n\nFollow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:\n\n1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the\n[Fix Pack]\/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.\n2. Run the installation using one the following commands:\n* setup-windows.exe - Windows.\n* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.\n\nInstallation command options:\n\nGUI mode No options, for example: \nWindows: setup-windows.exe\n\nor\n\nUNIX\u00ae : .\/setup-<unixplatform>.bin \n\nConsole mode\nUse the -i console option. \nFor example -\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -i console\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae : .\/setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console\n\nSilent Mode\n\na. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted\nFix Pack file ([Fix Pack]\/TBSM) to a location it can be\nedited (\/tmp).\nb. Update the file to match your environment.\nc. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line\nand setting the parm to \"true\":\n#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false\nd. Run:\n\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\\tmp\\setupFP.rsp\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f \/tmp\/setupFP.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified\npath.\n\n3. During the install you will be asked to to verify\npath names to the TIP install.\n\n4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes\/services\n\n5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run\nthe script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data\nServer under $TBSM_HOME\/bin. This script loads the new\/updated\npolicies.\n\nNOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary\/\nbackup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to\nbe run on the primary data server.\n\nOn Windows:\n\nApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin\n\nOn Linux\/Unix:\n\n.\/ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - .\/ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin \n\nNOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are\ncorrect otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.\n\nIf incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id\nand password.\n\n6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files\nonto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,\nwhen TBSM was first setup).\n\nfrom: [Fix Pack]\/TBSM\/TBSMDBChecker\nto: [InstallDirectory]\/tbsmdb\/bin\n\nTBSM_Check_DB.bat\nTBSM_Check_DB.sh\ntbsmDatabaseChecker.xml\nTBSMDBChecker.props\n\nNOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use\nthe TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the\ndisplay of the requested user password.\n\n7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their\nbrowser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid\nany issues on the client side.\n\n8. If the Impact \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\"\nfunction was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional\npost Fix Pack installation required actions.\n\n9. Please refer to section 4.0 \"Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS\"\nfor additional post install actions.\n\n\n3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit\n-------------------------\n\n1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.\n\n2. To install Fixpack 3, \n\nIf you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt: \n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe\n\nIf you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt:\n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\".\n\nNote: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery \nLibrary Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and \nthat it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being \ninstalled with. If these are both okay, then set the environment\nvariable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and \nrestart the toolkit installer. For example: \nWindows:\nset TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\XMLtoolkit\nUNIX:\nexport TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tbsm\/XMLtoolkit\n\n3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.\n\n\n4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:\n\na) After installation is complete, you may remove\n[fixpack] to save space.\n\n5. Restart the toolkit.\n\n\n3.8 TBSM agent\n----------\n\nInstalling the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):\n\nThe following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent\ndirectory on the support download site:\n\n* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) \n\n* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)\n\n* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)\n\n* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)\n\n* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)\n\n\nTo install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:\n1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.\n2. Untar or unzip the file.\n3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM\nInstallation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM\nagent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.\n\nFor instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]\n\n\n3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack\n-------------------------\n\nBefore uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be\nSTOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before \nthe uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).\n\nAttention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to\ninstall TBSM 6.1.1 GA.\n\nSilent mode and uninstall\n\n\nIf silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will\ndefault to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response\nfile or the uninstall will fail.\n\nFor silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file\nfrom the Fix Pack image to the directory:\n\n<installDir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\n\nand update the file with the correct information. Then launch\nthe installer specifying the file. For example:\n\nuninstall(.exe) -f \/tmp\/setup_uninstall.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.\n\nOn the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:\n\n1. Change to the directory: \n<installDir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\n\n2. Run the uninstall command:\n\nUNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\/uninstall\n\n\nWindows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\\uninstall.exe\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\"\n\n3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear\nthe server cache.\n\nLinux\/AIX: <TIP_HOME>\/bin\/clearClassCache.sh\n\nSolaris: java -Xshare:dump\n\nWindows: <TIP_HOME>\\bin\\clearClassCache.bat\n\n\n\n4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35\n\nNOTE: On a \"Data server only\" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix\nPack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS\n7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at\na future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is\nnecessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. \n\nThese steps DO NOT apply to a \"Dashboard sever only\"\nenvironment or a \"Single server\" environment, where both the\nData and Dashboard are installed together.\n\nAgain, these steps are only needed on a \"Data server only\"\nenvironment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent\nthe re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!\n\na). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location\nThe uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:\n<installdir>\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\/plan\/install\/MachinePlan_localhost\/00002_WASFP\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Unix:\n\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tbsm\/_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3\/plan\/install\/MachinePlan_localhost\/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Windows:\nC:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\_uninst\\TBSM611_FP3\\plan\\install\\MachinePlan_localhost\\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nOr from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>\\TBSM\\COI\\PackageSteps\\WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nb). Edit the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt (on the temporary location)\n\nc). locate this line: -W product.location=\"@IAGLOBAL_WAS_HOME@\"\n\nd). Replace above line with: -W product.location=\"<installdir>\/tipv2\"\n\nWhere <installdir> is the fully qualified directory where tipv2 located:\n\nfor example (Unix): -W product.location=\"\/opt\/IBM\/tivoli\/tipv2\"\n\nfor example (Windows): -W product.location=\"C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\"\n\ne). Save the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file (on the temporary location)\n\nf). Execute the following command:\nOn Unix:\n<installdir>\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.sh -options <templocation>\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor example: \/opt\/IBM\/tivoli_root\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.sh -options \/tmp\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nOn Windows:\n<installdir>\/tipv2\/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\/update.exe -options <templocation>\/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor exampe: C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\\update.exe -options C:\\Temp\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\n5. Restart the Data Server and Dashboard Server.\n\n\n\nDiscovery Library Toolkit\n===================================================\n\nThe Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\nA backup copy of the original files can be retrieved from:\n\n[InstallDirectory]\/tbsm\/\nXMLtoolkit\/log\/install\/maintenance\/backup\/611FP0003\n\n\n\n3.10 Recovering from a failed Fix Pack install\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf the install fails, try to uninstall in which case, it goes back to\nthe previous version. If there is no uninstall file under \n_uninst\/TBSM611_FP3, then nothing really got installed and you can delete\nthe TBSM611_FP3 file and reinstall.\n\n\n3.11 Restoring failed DE upgrade from backup\n---------------------------------------\n\nTo recover a failed Deployment Engine upgrade in TBSM 6.1.1, see the\nTBSM Installation Guide at: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3\/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc\/installguide\/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html]\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

It is stabilized in the previous V7.3 release, but MQ Configuration will be supported as long as V7.3 is in support. The components in V7.5 are the IBM MQ Monitoring Agent and the IBM Integration Bus Monitoring Agent, both of which have enhancements in V7.5 that address monitoring requirements you may have. You can upgrade your OMEGAMON for Messaging monitoring components to V7.5 while using the previous release of MQ Configuration. \n\nWhether or not you want to continue using MQ Configuration when you install and configure OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, there may be steps you need to take, so please review this document prior to installing and configuring V7.5. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, please determine whether you have previously installed and configured the MQ Configuration component. If you have not done so previously, there is no need for you to consider the rest of this document. For this determination, please examine the following: \n\n\n\u00b7 SMP\/E: Are the FMIDs for MQ Configuration installed? The FMIDs are HKMC730 and HKCF730, or HKMC710 and HKCF710 if you are using the V7.1 level. \n\u00b7 PARMGEN: In your PARMGEN configuration for each runtime environment, does the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up\/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), have the line for \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d selected for configuration in the environment? \n\nIf the answers are \u201cyes\u201d to both of the above questions, then you do need to continue with the following general steps, which are documented in detail below: \n\n1) Determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration in your environment. There are many cases in which the MQ Configuration component is installed and configured in PARMGEN, but no one is actually using it. It is important to determine this in order to decide which step to take next.\n\n2) If you do not have users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway, there may be steps required when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 especially if you previously configured a shared agent address space for MQ monitoring (KMQ) and MQ configuration (KMC) agents. \n\n3) If you do have users of MQ Configuration and want to continue supporting that usage, you need to follow recommendations when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 upgraded products.\n\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1) Suggested ways to determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration:\n\na. In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view. For users and\/or groups that have been configured for TEP, check the Navigator Views tab to see if any of them have \u201cConfiguration\u201d in their Assigned Views. If no one is allowed access to the Configuration navigator, then they are not using MQ Configuration feature. \n\nb. Another item to check in Administer Users is whether any user or group has the Permissions tab showing that View or Modify permission has been authorized for WebSphere MQ Configuration Authorities \u201cConfigure\u201d authority. Some user or group should have permission to use this feature if it is used by anyone. \n\nc. Check whether there are configured names that reflect queue managers in your environment. Click on the Configuration navigator in the view drop-down list in the Navigator pane, then click on Defined View on the left. In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various \u201c+\u201d items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.\n\nd. If it appears that there is usage of MQ Configuration, it would still be good to check with MQ users at your site to see if they actually require it. Perhaps they have experimented with it but do not actually use it regularly. If the OMEGAMON feature for MQ Configuration is not absolutely required in your environment, the recommendation would be to review all the ways that the IBM MQ product offers to configure and administer MQ, some of which are new in recent releases. Also, remember that the OMEGAMON MQ Monitoring agent offers the Take Action facility to issue any MQSC configuration command if the user is authorized.\n\n\n2) If there are no users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway: \n\na. If you use a Serverpac that contains the upgraded OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 components to install, the MQ Configuration FMIDs (HKMC730 and HKCF730) are not installed because they are not included in the Serverpac. However, depending on your previous configuration, the missing MQ Configuration component could cause unexpected results in your LPAR runtime environment (RTE), so check and act on the following items prior to installation and configuration of OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5:\n\n1. If your Hub TEMS is configured on the z\/OS platform and there are RKCF* DDNAME statements in your existing Hub TEMS started task JCL, update the TEMS started task JCL to remove those RKCF* DDNAME statements.\n\n2. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. For the MQ Monitoring agent to be the owner, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting, as depicted in the following example before and after settings:\n\nBefore (MQ Configuration owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ):\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER OMEGMQ\n\nAfter (MQ Monitoring owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ): \nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===>\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d \n\nTip: Please review the SMPE06 upgrade scenario [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAUBV\/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2\/parmgenref\/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center as part of deploying these changes. You can use the refreshed OMEGMQ OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 KMQ Agent-only address space in the RTE\u2019s W\/RKANSAMU dataset for refreshing the original shared address space in your system procedure library. The only delta would be the RKMCAPLA DDNAME, which can be staged for removal.\n\nb. If you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into an existing SMP\/E CSI, the MQ Configuration FMIDs will remain installed, but since you are not using MQ Configuration, it is recommended you follow these steps:\n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. See item a.2 above for more details.\n\n2. In the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up\/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), deselect the line with \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d so that it will be removed from the runtime environment (RTE) during reconfiguration\/upgrade of the RTE. Follow one of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAUBV\/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2\/parmgenref\/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] documented in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center. \n\nTip: Prior to upgrading the RTE, you also have the option to SMP\/E delete the HKMC730 and HKCF730 FMIDs from the existing CSI. When you start the PARMGEN configuration phase of the upgrade, the inexistence of these deleted FMIDs is PARMGEN\u2019s trigger to delete the product from the RTE upon reconfiguration following any of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios (SMPE04 [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAUBV\/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2\/parmgenref\/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2], SMPE05 [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAUBV\/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2\/parmgenref\/smpe05_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] or SMPE06 [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAUBV\/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2\/parmgenref\/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2]). \n\n\n3) If there are users of MQ Configuration, and you want to continue supporting that usage: \n\na. It is highly recommended that you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into the existing SMP\/E CSI so that MQ Configuration remains available. If you do this, there are no other steps required, however, the following step is also highly recommended: \n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, separate them into their own address spaces, since they will be running at different product levels. For this, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting to be like the following example in which MQ Configuration is running in an address space called OMEGMC and MQ Monitoring is running in an address space called OMEGMQ:\n\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMC\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\n\nb. If you were to install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 in a Serverpac, you would need to retain your old SMP\/E CSI and maintain a separate PARMGEN runtime environment in order to use MQ Configuration separately. This may be acceptable to you if you already separate MQ Configuration from the rest of your monitoring infrastructure, with its own Hub TEMS, etc. In this case, for the configuration that will contain OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, please see item 2 above, steps a.1 and a.2 in case they would apply to that particular configuration.\n\nc. OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 application support does not include application support for the MQ Configuration component. If you need to re-install application support for MQ Configuration for any reason, you should use the latest V7.3 level of application support.

To see why the messaging engines were not available, check the SystemOut.log for applicable messages. Examine the SystemOut.log file starting at the time period when the application experienced the problem and search backward. \n\n\nCheck for the CWSID0016I which indicates status of the Messaging Engine activity. You may see messages like this:\n\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopping.\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopped.\n\nThe solution for this problem is to start the messaging engine.\n\nIf the messaging engine is running and you still see these errors at the application side, other possible reasons for this problem are:\n\n1) Check provider end points. The value for the provider endpoints should be in the format of host_name:port_number:BootstrapBasicMessaging.\n\nIn the JMS connection factory, you can define a list of provider endpoints that govern which servers the application will attempt to connect to. If you have defined these endpoints, ensure that the messaging engines for these servers have all started and that the port and transport chains defined in the endpoint list are correct. Also, ensure that the values for the Connection proximity (bus, cluster, host or server) and the Target groups and Target significance settings are appropriate. For example, if the Target significance value is Required and no suitable messaging engine could be located, then this would cause a connection failure. Please refer to the following links for how to set provider endpoints:\n\nDefault messaging provider queue connection factory [Settings] : [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/SIBJMSQueueConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nDefault messaging provider topic connection factory [Settings]: [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/SIBJMSTopicConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nRestart the server after making the change.\n\n2) If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds.

The Combined Cumulative Fix is a package of WebSphere Portal fixes and Web Content Manager Cumulative fixes. \n\nWhat's New \n\nAs of WebSphere Portal V7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix 26 (CF26), support has been added for syndicating to subscribers running WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.1 Combined Cumulative Fix 09 (CF09) or later. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace requirements \n\nEnsure that enough disk space is available in the following directories: \n\nz\/OS: 625 cylinders in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 625 cylinders in the <Portal Configuration HFS>, 625 cylinders in <WebSphere Configuration HFS> and 1250 cylinders in your system temp directory. \n\nAll other platforms: 2 GB in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 1 GB in <Portal_Install_Root>, 1 GB in <wp_profile_root> temporary disk space and 1 GB in your system temp directory, such as \/tmp on Unix or Linux platforms or C:\\temp on the Microsoft Windows platform. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for installing Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN:\nFamiliarize yourself with the Portal Upgrade Best Practices available from IBM Remote Technical Support for WebSphere Portal.\n\nPortal Upgrades: Best Practices for V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21452611] For instructions on how to validate your environment prior to the upgrade, see the instructions for running the Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal at:\n\nHealth Checker tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] IMPORTANT: Certain security configurations can cause failures with the upgrade. Please check the following technote to see if this may apply to your environment.\n\nFix Pack 7.0.0.1 fails at action-import-defaultnodes-wp.filestore\/base task. [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21496067] \n 1. Perform the following steps before installing Combined Cumulative fix:\n     1. Before you install this combined cumulative fix, check to see if the list of fixes already installed on your system is included in the list of fixes provided in this combined cumulative fix. If you have temporary, interim or cumulative fixes on your system that are not included in this Combined Cumulative Fix, then uninstall those fixes before installing this Combined Cumulative Fix and contact IBM Support for an updated version of that fix, or for more information. \n     2. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     3. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix\/Linux\/Windows\/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n        \n        \n     4. Special considerations for multiple profiles or binary install or migration upgrade:  1. If you did a binary installation and created a WebSphere Portal profile later, or your Portal 7.0.0.x was migrated from 6.1.x, ensure that the PortalServer\/wps.properties file correctly references the profile. The Portal Update Installer uses the wps.properties file to determine which profile is the primary profile to update. Failure to complete this step could result in an inoperable Portal server after the Combined Cumulative Fix installation completes.  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>\/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add these two properties if they do not already exist:\n                ProfileName=<your profile name, e.g. wp_profile>\n                ProfileDirectory=<your profile directory, e.g. \/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/wp_profile>\n                \n                Note: The ProfileDirectory property should use forward slash (\/) instead of backslash (\\) on Windows.\n            \n            \n         2. If you have created multiple profiles. the Portal Update Installer will automatically upgrade all profiles. If you want to specify which profiles are updated, then complete the following steps:  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>\/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add this property if it does not already exist:\n                AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles=<comma separated list of profile names, e.g. wp_profile, wp_profile2, wp_profile3>\n            \n            \n         3. If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting upgrade.\n            \n        \n        \n     5. Perform the following steps to download the Combined Cumulative Fix and the WebSphere Portal Update Installer:  1. Download the latest Combined Cumulative fix (e.g. 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn), and the latest WebSphere Portal Update Installer from http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857]. \n         2. Create the PortalServer_root\/update directory and extract the WebSphere Portal Update Installer file into this directory. \n         3. Create the PortalServer_root\/update\/fixes directory and extract the 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn.zip file into this directory, where n is the numbers associated with the version of the Combined Cumulative fix. Note for z\/OS users: refer to Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z\/OS using Portal Update Installer [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670] for detailed descriptions of how to execute steps ii. and iii. above. \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n2. Choose either the graphical user interface installation option or the command line installation option: \n\nNOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z\/OS can only use command line). \n\nNOTE: If the installation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/support\/isa\/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task. \n\n\nIf using the Universal PUI, (which does not include the bundled Java environment), run the following command, setupCmdLine.bat for Windows or . .\/setupCmdLine.sh for Unix\/Linux from the was_profile_root\/bin directory to set up the Java environment for the graphical user interface installation program. When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall=\"true\", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root\/bin. z\/OS users can not use the Universal PUI. \n\nEnter the following command to launch the graphical user interface installation program:  *  Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortalWizard.bat Unix\/Linux: PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortalWizard.sh\n   \n   - OR -\n   Perform the following steps to launch the installation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. \n    2. Enter the following command to launch the installation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):\n   \n    * Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortal.bat -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\\update\\fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * Unix\/Linux: PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * IBM i: portal_server_root\/update> updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<portal_server_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<portal_server_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * z\/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before installing the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to install the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>\/bin directory:\n          . .\/setupCmdLine.sh \n       2. PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortal.sh -install\n          -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n          -fix\n          -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n          -fixes <Cumulative fix>\n          \n          Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z\/OS using Portal Update Installer [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670]. Submit the JCLs, and then return here to continue.\n          \n      \n      \n   \n   If you do not have any profiles at this point (because you are in the process of migration from WebSphere Portal 6.1 or Installing an additional node for a cluster or creating multiple profiles) no post installation steps are necessary and you can continue with the next steps that create the profiles as outlined by the according documentation.\n   \n   z\/OS: If doing an upgrade as part of a migration from a previous version (eg. 6.x), run .\/ConfigEngine.sh gather-migration-files command from the <wp_profile_root>\/ConfigEngine directory.\n   \n   z\/OS: Run the following command: <wp_profile_root>\/PortalServer\/bin\/UpdateProfile.sh install CF skipPreCheckProfile\n   \n   All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be applied. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].\n   \n   <wp_profile_root>\/PortalServer\/bin\/UpdateProfile.bat|.sh install CF\n   \n   This cumulative fix provides updates to OSGi bundles. After installing the cumulative fix, run \"<profile location>\/bin\/osgiCfgInit.sh\" (for IBM i the command is just osgiCfgInit, for Microsoft Windows the command is osgiCfgInit.bat) to clear the caches and make the OSGi container pick up the updates to the modified OSGi bundles. Note that it is recommended to stop the portal server before running the osgiCfgInit command. \n * \n * \n\n3. Perform the following post installation steps: \n *  If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:\n    1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. \n    2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. \n    3. Restart the Web server.\n       \n   \n   Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to installing the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration \/ Portlet Management \/ Web Modules \n        * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>\/PortalServer\/wcm\/prereq.wcm\/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration \/ Portlet Management \/ Web Modules \n        * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>\/PortalServer\/wcm\/prereq.wcm\/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.\n   \n   Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager. Review the following documentation \"Configuration Changes and Options introduced in WP\/WCM V7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes\" [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27021250] to see if it applies to your environment.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for uninstalling Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nNOTE: Changing the server context root after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. To uninstall after changing the context root, you must first change the server context root back to the values of the previous version. \n\nNOTE: Configuring Portal Server from a stand-alone environment to a cluster environment after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. \n\n 1. Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix\/Linux\/Windows\/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. During the Combined Cumulative Fix uninstall the primary profile is downgraded first if one exists (The Update Installer also supports the update case for a binary only install without profiles). The primary profile is identified by two properties, ProfileDirectory and ProfileName. Ensure these properties are set before starting the downgrade process. \n         * If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting downgrade.\n           \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 2.

Also, note that some pieces of WCM functionality (exs. inability to close Workflow dialogs, Applet issues) may not work correctly with these browsers even in compatibility mode as they are not supported. \n\nProblem: Inline help may not appear correctly after CF29 update on zOS. \nSolution: From the <wp_profile_root>\/ConfigEngine directory, run task \n\n.\/ConfigEngine.sh expand-ear-wp.iehs.ear \n\nThen restart the Portal server. \n\n\nProblem: When using versions earlier than 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51', a security pop-up dialog or error will be seen every time the WCM FileTransferApplet or Ephox EditLive editor is instantiated. \nSolution: It is recommended to upgrade the Java runtime environment level to either 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51' or later. Please refer to the following URL: swg21663838 \n\n\nProblem: After you enter a number into the number element\/component, and then save the content\/component more than twice, you will notice that the number field gets populated with some dots, i.e. 123.456.78. If you then click on Save again, you will get the following error: \n'Enter a valid number. ( content\/component name here)' \nSolution: The workaround is to remove the dots and save again. \n\n\nProblem: Page theme is changed to current Portal default theme when changing page content layout. \nSolution: The workaround would be to change the page theme back to \"Inherit Parent Theme\". A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After upgrading to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix and \"Portal 7.0.0.2\" theme has been set as the default portal theme, a user is unable to post to a blog or update a wiki using Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer. \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Navigate to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Contenet_Root -> Hidden pages. \n 2. Select \"Edit Page Properties\" for the hidden page named 'Web Content Management'. \n 3. On the 'Edit page: Web Content Management' page, extend 'Theme:' drop-down list and select \"-----Inherit Parent Theme-----\".\n\n\n\nProblem: WCM Authoring Search may not work after an upgrade to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Edit the <wp_profile>\/PortalServer\/jcr\/lib\/com\/ibm\/icm\/icm.properties file in a text editor to verify all properties are correct. \n 2. Set jcr.textsearch.enabled=true \n 3. Change jcr.textsearch.indexdirectory to a corresponding location in the filesystem \n 4. Restart your Portal Server. \n 5. Create a new library or make changes in existing libraries\n\n\n\nProblem: When configuring Portal for use with a remote DB2 on z\/OS database, the sample job provided for the database creation does not contain the statements required to create the storage groups. These take the form: \n\nCREATE STOGROUP group \nVOLUMES(' volume') \nVCAT category; \nCOMMIT; \n\nwhere, \ngroup is the name of the storage group for the database, \nvolume is the volume serial number of * to let SMS select the volume where the database will reside, \ncategory is the category name of the Integrated Catalog Facility. \n\nSolution: When using the EJPSCRDB sample job add the above statements for each storage group to the final version. These should be added at the beginning of \"Step 2\" of the sample job, just before the CREATE statements for the actual databases. \n\n\nProblem: Theme Policies are not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Client-side aggregation is not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: The WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 theme does not support Sametime 8.5.1 \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Loading a page with the out of box default profile (Deferred) causes \"dojo is not defined\" error. \nSolution: Dojo is not available in view mode using the Deferred profile, which is the default out of box. Switch the page or theme to use the Full profile to access Dojo in view mode. For more information see URL: http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc [http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Portal 7.0.0.2 drag-and-drop framework does not support multi-selection and copying resources. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. This can be enabled by creating a custom drag and drop source and enabling these features. \n\n\nProblem: The deploy-7002-theme task fails \nSolution: The Portal 7.0.0.2 theme requires several artifacts from the \"Page Builder\" theme to exist on the server. If you have removed the theme or if you are coming from a migrated environment where the theme never existed, you will need to add the Page Builder theme back to the system before running the deploy-7002-theme task. Please see the \"Additional instructions for a migrated environment\" section at the following URL for more information http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc [http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Feedspace portlet in Portal 7.0.0.2 may show JavaScript issues. \nSolution: The Feedspace portlet needs to be redeployed to resolve this. Use the Portal administration area to update the the SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war. Use the PortalServer\/bp\/wp.bp.feedspace\/installableApps\/SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war to do this update. \n\n\nProblem: If a WCM cumulative fix is installed on a Websphere Portal 7.0.0.2 where the date of the install is later than the date on which the cumulative fix was packaged, then the update-wcm task will fail to overwrite the WCM war files from the base version. \nSolution: To workaround this problem, the war files from [PortalServer]\\wcm\\prereq.wcm\\installableApps have to be manually copied to [PortalServer]\\installableApps. Once this is done, the update-wcm task will execute successfully. \n\n\nProblem: Newly added WCM libraries might not be listed in the \"Web Content Libraries\" portlet on all nodes of the cluster due to an issue in cache replication. \nSolution: The workaround would be to restart nodes which have the stale library list. A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After uninstall of the combined cumulative fix, WPVersionInfo shows IBM WebSphere Portal Configuration Framework (CFGFW) at the upgraded version level. \nSolution: This is expected. The CFGFW version level shown after the uninstall of the combined cumulative fix remains at the upgraded level. There is no functional problem. \n\n\nProblem: If you plan to configure Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder as your external security manager to handle authorization and authentication, the XML configuration interface may not be able to access WebSphere Portal through eTrust SiteMinder. \nSolution: To enable the XML configuration interface to access WebSphere Portal, use eTrust SiteMinder to define the configuration URL (\/wps\/config) as unprotected. Refer to the eTrust SiteMinder documentation for specific instructions. After the configuration URL is defined as unprotected, only WebSphere Portal enforces access control to this URL. Other resources such as the \/wps\/myportal URL are still protected by eTrust SiteMinder. If you already set up eTrust SiteMinder for external authorization and you want to use XMLConfiguration Interface (xmlaccess), make sure you have followed the procedure to allow for xmlaccess execution. \n\n\nProblem: If using the Firefox browser, portlets cannot be dragged to a page from the palette. It is necessary to click the + icon next to the portlet in the palette to add it to the page. \nSolution: This is documented as a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: If an error is seen starting server \"WebSphere_Portal\" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. \nThe error would appear similar to the following as part of the \"action-start-portal-server-standard\" task : \"ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal\" \nSolution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for \"Node restart state\" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment. \n\n\nFor a list of known issues for Previous WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes, see IBM WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix Previous Known Issues [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27023912]for details. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information \nYou can find additional information on the WebSphere Portal support page [http:\/\/www-306.ibm.com\/software\/genservers\/portal\/support\/]. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks and service marks \nFor trademark attribution, visit the IBM Terms of Use [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/legal\/us\/] Web site. \n\nBack to top"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q119","question":"How do I change from shared to unshared connection?\n\nin WAS, how do I change from shared to unshared connection.

By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java\u2122 Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK.

The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT\/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT\/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/i\/v14\/rules\/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections.

A runtime exception occurs when the Java\u2122 snippet calls a method in a class found in one of the plugin JARs in the server's plugins directory. \n\nCAUSE\nSome of the Java methods found in the JARs in the server's plugin directory are available to be called, but some of them are considered internal use only and an exception is thrown if you try to call them from user code.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nA runtime exception is detected in the server log naming a class and method called from a visual snippet in the application.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe reason the method you selected in the snippet editor cannot be called in the JAR in the plugins directory is because of the architecture of the server. JARs in the plugins directory have a list that specifies what classes in the JAR can be called. This is called the exports list, and it is honored by the class loader the server uses. Classes not on the list are considered internal use only. Thus, not all classes in the server plugin JARs are available to be called by user code. \n\nYou can call any method when the JAR is in the server's library directorym because it is not being treated as a plugin and a different class loader is used, one which does not implement the exports list.\n\nThe snippet editor is not aware of this mechanism so it treats a plugin JAR the same as a regular Java JAR file. That is it allows you to select the (unavailable) class and method to call in your program. The resolution is to make sure that classes you call in plugin JARs appear on the exports list. \n\nFor example you may search for StringUtils and find the class org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils in the WebSphere JAR plugin\/com.ibm.ws.jpa.jar. This class is used internally by the plugin and it is not exported. In this case you must download the class you need directly from Apache and place the JAR in the server's classpath."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q136","question":"Unexpected instance name for SQL Server agent after FP10\n\n\n\nHello,\n\non a new server I have installed SQL Server agent 6.31 FP10 and then tried to create an instance.

For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS\/INPROGRESS\/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, \nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, \nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop \nusing the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not\nthe component directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nUnchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.08.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.08.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.08.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the \nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed build date and installation date might not \nbe accurate. This is known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo -i\n\nOn Windows systems:\n-------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>kincinfo -i\n************* Monday, March 21, 2016 6:18:11 PM *************\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : ESX1-SQL-T-9 Installer : Ver: 063004000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\nOQ TEMS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.00 Build: 60071\n\nOQ TEPS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.01 Build: 60711\n\nOQ TEPB App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.00 Build: 60071\n\nOQ TEPD App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.01 Build: 60711\n\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nAbstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade\nProblem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading\nagent fix pack.

It may be necessary to return the appliance to IBM for repair.\nThe reinit CLI command will allow you to reconfigure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance. The reinit CLI command will allow you to delete (not erase) all existing configuration and data from an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance.\n\nWhen the reinitialize command completes, your network IP configurations, user accounts and other configuration options, are no longer accessible. \n\nYou will only be able to connect to the appliance using the serial connection. \n\nYou will need to configure your Ethernet and all other settings again using the information in the product information center available from our library page [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/datapower\/library\/index.html].\n\nImportant points: \n\n * Make sure you have a working serial connection to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * The admin password will revert to the initial value of \"admin\" after the command executes.\n   \n   \n * A firmware image must be on the appliance prior to running the command. The firmware image used for the last upgrade of the device is removed from the file system automatically when the device reboots. Use DataPower's File Management WebGUI option to confirm you have an image or use these CLI commands:\n   xi52# configure\n   xi52# dir image:\n   If an image file is not found, you will need to load a firmware image to the appliance into the image:\/\/\/ directory. For example: you can use the WebGUI file management options or from the Control Panel, choose the System Control icon, the under Boot Image, choose the firmware file upload options.\n   \n   \n * Use the DataPower File Management to confirm you have sufficient file space. If you don't have sufficient file space, you can delete domains or other files to free up file space to allow the firmware image to be loaded to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * reinit is a CLI command available in the config-flash# mode, for example:\n   \n   xi52# configure terminal\n   Global configuration mode \n   xi52(config)# flash \n   Flash configuration mode \n   xi52(config-flash)#\n   reinit <filename> \n   \n   Where <filename> represents a firmware image contained within the image:\/\/\/ directory. This will be the firmware image which will be installed during the reinit process.

This may include scan results, capacity data, etc.\n\n\nCAUSE\nBFI\/SUA\/LMT is designed to import only newly created data. To achieve this, the data is marked with the so-called sequence number. The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.\n\nData for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be re-generated by re-running the scans if needed. \n\nData from DB restoration time until first successful import is also by default not imported (causing a gap). To cover this gap you may follow the procedure described below.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWarning: The following procedure will impact the length of the first import after the sequence is reset. After performing below steps ALL DATA from all endpoints available on BigFix server side will be imported (not only covering the problematic gap). For big environments the impact may be huge and it is better to re-run scans on selected endpoints instead.\n\n1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI\/SUA\/LMT server.\n2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI\/SUA\/LMT database:\n\nDB2:\nUPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');\n\nMSSQL:\nUPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;\n\n3) Start the BFI\/SUA\/LMT. \n4) Run an import.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Security IBM BigFix Inventory"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q179","question":"What is the difference between the software available in Passport Advantage and Fix Central?\n\nIs it possible to get IIB General Availability (GA) code from somewhere else or is it only available on Passport Advantage?\n","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q180","question":"How to download IBM MQ ?\n\nHow and where to download IBM MQ V8 or IBM Websphere MQ V7.1 or 7.5 for production environment ?\n","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q181","question":"Problem with EJB WebService and empty beans.xml in META-INF directory\n\nWhen using a EJB WebService (EAR file attached) with a empty beans.xml file in the META-INF directory (my intent is to use CDI), the project can be deployed correctly, but when the EJB WebService is called, I get the following error message:\n[24\/04\/14 21:33:34:913 CEST] 0000003b id= com.ibm.ws.webbeans.WebBeansInitializer E An error occured while starting application context path : [\/SampleEJBWebService] [24\/04\/14 21:33:35:028 CEST] 0000003b id= com.ibm.ws.logging.internal.impl.IncidentImpl I FFDC1015I: An FFDC Incident has been created: \"java.lang.NullPointerException com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.osgi.VirtualHost startWebApp\" at ffdc_14.04.24_21.33.34.0.log\nWhen I remove the beans.xml file, everything works fine without any problems.\nNow my question is:  Are there any workarounds available?","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q182","question":"ITCAM J2EE configuration problem with Tomcat as a Windows Service\n\nI want to configure ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 agent to monitor Tomcat 7.0 to be started as a service on Windows 2008 R2 64-bits.\n\nConfiguration fails with the following error message:\n\n2016-05-06 20:31:37.723+08:00\ncom.ibm.tivoli.itcam.install.j2ee.custompanel.ConfigProcessSectionPanel getActionErrorText [DEBUG_MIN]\nExit, return value = J2_EC_CONFIG_FAILED:Configuration failed.\nThe server is: \"Tomcat Application Server\"\nThe instance is: \"myTomcat\"\nThe trace log file is under the directory:\n\"C:\\tivoli\\ITM\\TMAITM6\\j2eedc\\7.1.1.0.0\\installer\\logs\"\n\nWhy is this failing?","answer":"There is an option to specify the Tomcat Windows Service during GUI configuration of the ITCAM J2EE 7.1.1 agent\/DC.

If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001.

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button.

This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:\/\/\/ directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed.

The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn_<instanceName>.config will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn.ini while the instance is re-configured.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command\nto view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t or\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t bn\n\nNote: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n07.10.03.00\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on\nLinux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions\nof the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems\nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The date shown for the build might not be accurate.

When you install application support on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, you are installing the files required for presenting workspaces and online help for each monitoring agent. When you install application support on the hub monitoring server, you are installing the files required for product-provided situations, situation distributions, and other product-specific data. Installing application support on the hub monitoring server is also known as \"seeding\" the hub.\nMost z\/OS-based agents provide application support files on CDs or DVDs, which are separate from the mainframe installation media. Distributed agents include their application support files in the distributed installation process. Each CD \/DVD that contains application support files is listed below, with information about which products use the CD \/DVD and where the CD \/ DVD can be found. The latest level in fulfillment is the CD \/DVD on this list. Where possible, IBM provides both .zip and .tar formats, as well as .iso format, so that a physical CD \/ DVD can be created.\n\nPlease note that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) media is separate from the workspace application support files which are included with products that run in the ITM environment. ITM can be obtained by ordering either 5724-C04 IBM Tivoli Monitoring through Passport Advantage or the no charge 5698-A79 IBM Tivoli Management Services on z\/OS through Shop zSeries. Your IBM rep can ask Techline to configure and submit the order as well. 5698-A79 includes the server, engine, and configurator on z\/OS. Workspace application support files may have their own fixpacks which are separate and distinct from any ITM fixpacks. Fixpacks can be found on the product support urls at: \nhttp:\/\/www-306.ibm.com\/software\/support\/index_A_Z.html [http:\/\/www-306.ibm.com\/software\/support\/index_A_Z.html].\n\nThe ITM Configuration Guide describes the application support installation process. It can be found online in the ITM information center at: https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/install\/agent_support.htm [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/install\/agent_support.htm].

Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case.

This should help address common issues with this component before calling IBM support and save you time. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following are some examples of common JSP problems and some basic information on how to resolve them: \n\n * java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource\n   If the browser displays a JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource message, the JSP processor cannot find the specified JSP page in the Web module, as shown below.\n   \n   java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036F: Failed to find \/Tests\/index.jsp\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.findWrapper (JSPExtensionProcessor.java:246)\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.handleRequest (JSPExtentionProcessor.java:228)\n   ... \n   Take following steps to verify URL being requested order to debug this exception:\n   \n   To determine the URL of the installed application, you need to use the administrative console to view the configuration of a number of items. The format of the URL is as follows:\n   \n   http:\/\/host:port\/context_root\/resource_name \n   Finding <host>:<port>\n   When a Web module is installed, a virtual host is associated with it. To find the virtual host using the WebSphere Application Server administrative console:  1. Select Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the application name to open the details page.\n       \n       In the Web module Properties section, click Virtual hosts.\n       \n       \n    3. Note the virtual hosts that are used by the specified application Web module.\n   \n   \n   To find the host and port numbers that are valid for the virtual host:  1. Select Environment > Virtual Hosts.\n       \n       \n    2. Choose the virtual host, and then under Additional Properties, click Host Aliases.\n       \n       \n    3. The list contains the host name and port combinations that can be used to access this virtual host. The host name column should contain values that are registered in a DNS server as a host name for the WebSphere Application Server. An asterisk (*) in the host column indicates that any name can be used. In this case, use the server host name.\n   \n   \n   Finding <context_root>\n   The context root is the Web application root and is used to identify the application in the URI. To find the context root:  1. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, click Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the target application, then under Detail Properties, click View Deployment Descriptor.\n       \n       \n    3. Review the <context-root> tag for the specified Web module in the related deployment descriptor tag.\n   \n   \n   Finding <resource_name>\n   To find the initial file for the application (for example, index.jsp), you can look at the welcome file list in the Web deployment descriptor. As per J2EE specification, JSP files should reside under web module root or under sub directory other than META-INF and WEB-INF.\n   \n   For example:  * Web module root :\n      \n      install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\installedApps<CELL>\\<EAR>\\<WAR> \n      \n   \n   In the preceding case, the index.jsp file should reside uner Web_module_root\/Test directory. If not, than it explains this error message. \n   \n * JSP not reloading\n   If, after modifying and saving a JSP file, the change does not show up in the browser, you need to check the reload settings in the Web module configuration and the JSP runtime reload settings. For the JSPs, the Web container reloads a Web module only when the IBM extension reloadingEnabled in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file is set to true.\n   \n   The following is an example of web module reloading settings in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file:\n   \n   <webappext:WebAppExtension xmi:version=\"2.0\" xmlns:xmi=\"http:\/\/www.omg.org\/XMI\" xmlns:webappext=\"webappext.xmi\" xmi:id=\"WebAppExtension_1109270589179\" reloadInterval=\"3\" reloadingEnabled=\"true\" fileServingEnabled=\"true\"> \n   Location of the ibm-web-ext.xmi file :\n   \n   install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\config\\cells\\cell_name\n   \\applications\\<EAR>\\deployments\\app_name\\<WAR>\\WEB-INF\\ibm-web-ext.xmi \n   Configuring JSP runtime reloading:\n   You have the ability to modify the JSP processor behavior for different JSP stages (such as development, testing, or production environments). This done by configuring specific attributes in the IBM Web module extensions that affect the JSP runtime reload behavior.\n   \n   JSP files can be translated and compiled at runtime when the JSP file or its dependencies are modified. This is known as JSP reloading. JSP reloading is enabled through the reloadEnabled JSP engine parameter in the ibm-web-ext.xmi configuration file.\n   \n   The JSP engine settings are stored in the ibm-web.ext.xmi file, as shown \n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_1\" name=\"reloadEnabled\" value=\"true\"\/>\n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_9\" name=\"reloadInterval\" value=\"3\"\/> \n   \n * Encoding and internationalization issues\n   Encoding and internationalization problems usually showup as garbage characters in Web pages and input from user interpreted incorrectly. Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) character processing is a common issue for encoding problems. DBCS is used for languages such a Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, where a single byte is not sufficient to represent all characters in the alphabet. Proper coding and configuration usually resolves these problems. For JSP pages, page encoding is the character encoding in which the file is encoded. For JSP pages in standard syntax, the page encoding is determined from the following sources:  1. The pageEncoding attribute of the page directive of the page \n    2. The charset value of the contentType attribute of the page directive\n   \n   \n   If none of these is provided, ISO-8859-1 is used as the default page encoding.\n   \n   Page directive implementation in JSP code:\n   \n   <HTML>\n   <HEAD>\n   <%@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text\/html; charset=UTF-8\" pageEncoding=\"ISO-8859-15\" %>\n   <META http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n   <TITLE>Receiving parameters<\/TITLE>\n   <\/HEAD>\n   <BODY>\n   <H1>\n   Your data is <%= request.getParameter(\"name\") %>\n   <\/H1>\n   <\/BODY>\n   <\/HTML> \n   The pageEncoding and contentType attributes determine the page character encoding of only the file that physically contains the page directive. \n   \n * java.lang.IllegalStateException\n   This exception is thrown when attempt is made to modify HttpServletResponse object after it has been committed.\n   \n   If you have written something in the response buffer, you cannot forward a page:\n   \n   [7\/8\/05 20:36:25:694 ART] 0000004f ServletWrappe E SRVE0068E: Could not invoke the service() method on servlet TestServlet.

Creating and associating another output stream is the reason for this problem. The following piece of code will describe the reason for this error condition: \n   try\n   {\n   lStream = pResponse.getOutputStream();\n   lStream.write(lDocument);\n   lStream.flush();\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception writing ... to page output stream.\");\n   }\n   finally\n   {\n   try\n   {\n   if (lStream != null)\n   {\n   lStream.close();\n   }\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception closing page output stream.\");\n   }\n   } \n   Two output streams cannot be associated with one JSP file. \n   \n\nWhat to do next \nIf the preceding troubleshooting steps did not help solve your problem, see the MustGather [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21255205] for JSP problems.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q242","question":"Getting Delay or AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed  when trying to start a MQ SSL channel, why?\n\nGetting Delay or AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed when trying to start a MQ SSL channel, please help resolve this?

With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. \n\n\nThis was ignored before V7.0.1.0.

This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe best thing to do in this case is to determine the cause of the UNKNOWN return code and fix it. \n\n\nThere are two possible methods to discover which OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess URL is embedded in a certificate. \n\nMethod 1.\nPlace the certificate on a Windows machine; ensure to use a file extension of \"crt\" and double-click it. View the detail extensions for the AIA. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=1]\n\nMethod 2\nUse IBM Key Management (gskit) GUI to view them. Issue the following command::\nIn Windows: strmqikm \nIn UNIX: gsk7ikm (MQ V7) or runmqckm (MQ V8)\n\nFrom the IBM Key Management window:\nSelect View\/Edit for certificate\nView Details\nExtensions\nAuthorityInfoAccess\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=2]\n\nThe first step would be to insure that connection to the URL in your certificate can be reached.\n\n\nWork-around:\nUse this only as a temporary fix until the root cause can be found.\nYou can do the following. It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start.

Continue with the uninstallation process. \n   \n   \n   \n * Windows: Attachment Manager Symptoms: \n   \n   If you are installing an IBM product by using an electronic image from IBM Passport Advantage, and you are using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later, your Windows Security settings might cause Attachment Manager to block the content of the installer .zip file, causing your installation to fail. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete the following steps: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Properties\n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * General\n    * \n    * Unblock\n    * \n   \n   \n   For more information about Windows Attachment Manager, refer to the Microsoft Support site at: http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/883260 [http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/kb\/883260]\n   \n * HP-UX: Runtime component supplied on a physical DVD The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component has exceeded the 700 MB limit recommended for a physical CD. For this reason, the installation image for the HP-UX platform is supplied on a physical DVD rather than a physical CD. The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component is also available from the Passport Advantage website. For information about downloading WebSphere Message Broker Version V8.0 installation images from the Passport Advantage website, see the Download WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 from the Passport Advantage website download document, which is available at:\n   http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968]\n   \n   \n   \n * Installing using the fix pack installer Symptoms: \n   \n   The WebSphere Message Broker V8.0.0.0 GA runtime installer requires that you accept the license agreement.\n   The fix pack installer requires either that you install on a system that already has WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA installed, or that you provide the original WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA license files. The WebSphere message Broker V8.0 GA license files can be from either an existing V8.0 runtime installation, or from the original V8.0 installation media. The location of the license files is required only when you are installing a WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 fix pack on a system on which an installation of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA has not been detected. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   GUI or Console installations\n   For a fix pack GUI or console installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system, the installer will prompt you to provide the path to existing media licenses or an existing installation of V8.0.\n   Where V8.0 is already installed on the system, you should not be prompted for existing licences, and the installation will progress as normal. \n   \n   Silent installations\n   For silent installations (full media or fixpack) you must always accept the license, so for example \n   \n   \n   For a full GA silent media installation\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   setup32.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 already exists on the system\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system\n   Also add the argument: -DExternal_License_Path=<path to licenses> to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"D:\\messagebroker_ia_runtime1\\license\n   \n   Note if pointing at an existing installation of V8.0.0.0 the path is subtly different\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\MQSI\\8.0.0.0\\license\\8.0.0.0\"\n   \n   \n\n\n\n * Instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker runtime and ODBC Database Extender components with a non-root user ID Symptoms: \n   \n   In the information center topic \"Security on Linux and UNIX systems\" (bh26031), steps 3d) and 3e) for installing the runtime and ODBC Database Extender (IE02) components with a non-root user ID are incorrect. If you follow the steps described in the topic, the product will not install correctly. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Replace steps 3d) and 3e) in the topic with the following new steps 3d) to 3i):\n   \n   \n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  \/opt\/ibm\/mqsi and \/opt\/ibm\/IE02 (for Linux) For example: SUDO mkdir \/opt\/ibm\/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir \/opt\/ibm\/IE02\n   \n   \n   \/opt\/IBM\/mqsi and \/opt\/IBM\/IE02 (for UNIX and AIX). For example:\n   SUDO mkdir \/opt\/IBM\/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir \/opt\/IBM\/IE02 \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Platforms \n\nUbuntu WebSphere Message Broker is supported on Ubuntu, but only for development systems. Production systems should not be used to run WebSphere Message Broker on Ubuntu. \n\nFor more information, see the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements page. The WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page is available at:\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wbimessagebroker\/requirements\/ [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wbimessagebroker\/requirements\/] \n\n\n * Unable to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes (116214) Symptoms \n   \n   When attempting to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes, a connection is not created. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete one of the following steps: \n   \n    *  Set the following environment variable: GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1 \n   \n   OR  *  Use a different window manager \n   \n   \n\nSolaris and HP-UX \n * Increase in bipbroker and DataFlowEngine memory footprint on Solaris and HP-UX platforms Symptoms \n   \n   When upgrading from 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2, bipbroker and DataFlowEngine processes running on Solaris or HP platforms might consume an additional 204 MB of memory. This is caused by an increase in the default size of the ReservedCodeCacheSize parameter in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used by the broker processes. This area of memory is related to the just-in-time compilation of Java classes and was increased by the JVM supplier in response to an increase in bug reports from third party products failing due to exhaustion of space in the code cache. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   Customers should use the default value for this parameter, but if this causes unnecessary resource contention, the default can be reverted to its former value by exporting the following environment variable in the broker's profile prior to starting the broker: \n   \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n\nAIX  * DataFlowEngine abend on AIX when resolving hostname  \n   \n   Symptoms\n   The DataFlowEngine process running on AIX may terminate on startup or during a deploy with the following call stack in the abend\/core file: \n   calloc [] \n   getaddrinfo [] \n   Java_java_net_Inet6AddressImpl_lookupAllHostAddr \n   \n   Solution\n   Apply AIX equivalent APAR fix for IV95824.\n   Alternatively apply one of the following workarounds: \n   1) Specify hosts resolution order in \/etc\/netsvc.conf so that IPv4 is resolved first. For example: \n   hosts=local4,bind4 \n   2) Export the following environment variable setting: \n   IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true \n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Migration \n * Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 with new function capability enabled cannot participate in a multiple-broker global cache with brokers running 8.0.0.1. Symptom: \n   \n   After upgrading to fix pack 8.0.0.2, cache catalog servers fail to start. All cache components report BIP7190 warnings. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In 8.0.0.2, by default, each WebSphere eXtreme Scale server participating in the global cache starts with a domain name that is derived by the broker.\n   Previously in 8.0.0.1 the domain name for all servers in all embedded caches was an empty string. Servers in different domains cannot collaborate in the same grid.\n   Therefore, for a cache that spans more than one broker, you must enable the new capability for these brokers at the same time. \n   \n   Enable the new capability by using the -f parameter on the mqsichangebroker command. \n   \n   Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 without new functionality enabled can still collaborate in the same grid as brokers running 8.0.0.1.\n   In this scenario, the servers running 8.0.0.2 will continue to use an empty string as the domain name, and will report a BIP7140 warning message to the system log with this information.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Explorer \n * Connecting to a queue manager requires a SHARECNV value that is greater than 0 To connect the WebSphere Message Broker Explorer to a queue manager to receive publications, the SHARECNV property on that queue manager's SVRCONN channel must have a value that is greater than 0. This value is required if you want to use the Broker Statistics or Broker Statistics Graph views in WebSphere Message Broker Explorer.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit \n * Reset the Broker Application Development perspective after migrating Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0, items might be displayed in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit that are removed in V8.0; for example, previous toolkit options in menus. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To resolve this problem, complete the following step: \n   \n    * \n    * Window > Reset Perspective\n    * \n   \n   \n   After the perspective is reset, menus and views are updated for Version 8.0.\n   \n * Migrating or importing resources to a WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace, might result in erroneous errors. Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating or importing WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1, erroneous errors might be displayed in the Toolkit. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   With your V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace open in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit, select Project > Clean... > Clean all projects. The erroneous error messages are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Importing resources into a new workspace might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you import resources into a new workspace, error messages might display after autobuild is complete. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In the Broker Development view, select your projects and right-click Project > Clean to rebuild the projects. After the projects are cleaned, the error messages relating to the import are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Specifying a new workspace with mqsicreatebar might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you run the mqsicreatebar command and specify a new workspace, error messages might display. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the -cleanBuild option when running the mqsicreatebar command to clean the projects.\n   \n   \n   \n * DFDL topics in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit are displayed in US English only Symptom: \n   \n   When using the information center that is included in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 GA, Data Format Description Language (DFDL) topics are displayed in US English only.\n   These topics have the identifier \"dfxxxxx_\", where \"xxxxx\" is a five-digit number. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.0 GA can view these topics, in a language other than US English, using the online product documentation. The online product documentation for WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 contains the latest translated documentation, and is available at: \n   \n   http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/mapfiles\/help_home_msgbroker.html [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/mapfiles\/help_home_msgbroker.html]\n   \n   \n   \n * Java, PHP, and Message Set projects having the same name can only belong to one Application or Library Symptom: \n   \n   If a customer has more than one application or library in their workspace which requires a Java, PHP, or Message Set projects having the same name, an error message similar to the following will appear:\n   The project < Project Name > can not be a member of multiple applications or libraries.... \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Where an identical project is required in more than one application or library, a copy of the project should be made, and given a different name.\n   \n   \n   \n * Documentation contains incorrect instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit as a non-admin user Symptom: \n   \n   Non-admin user is not able to install Toolkit while following current installation documentation. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.0, who are installing Toolkit as a non-admin user, can refer to the online product documentation at [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmbhelp\/v8r0m0\/index.jsp]http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/mapfiles\/help_home_msgbroker.html [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/mapfiles\/help_home_msgbroker.html], or \n   \n   \n * Step 5 of the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation should be updated as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run the following command: <disk1 image>\\installToolkit.bat -nonAdmin On Linux run the following script: <disk1 image>\/installToolkit.sh -nonAdmin \n   \n   \n * Step 14 should be added to the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation and read as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run command: <WMBT80_Home>\\wmbt\\postconfig\\postInstall_admin.bat On Linux run script: <WMBT80_Home>\/wmbt\/postconfig\/postInstall_admin.sh \n    * \n   \n   \n * When using an application project and a subflow with a .msgflow extension it is possible to create a BAR file with a duplicate message flow if the sub-flows have been used incorrectly in the previous release. Symptom: \n   \n   This is caused when an External InputNode is added to the sub-flow; the resultant BAR file will contain two compiled message flows. One of the message flows will be the intended flow with the sub-flow embedded, the other message flow will be the extraneous sub-flow containing the ExternalInputNode without an appropriate ExternalOutput Node. \n   \n   When the BAR file is deployed both of the message flows will run. The sub-flow will incorrectly start a new thread and attempt to read data from the InputNode. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Either : \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n   \n * Launching the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit from Installation Manager makes the toolkit use WebSphere MQ 7.0.1 Symptom: \n   \n   When an installation has completed, the user is provided the option to start the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Toolkit. When the toolkit opens, any broker which is running with a queue manager on WebSphere MQ version 7.1 or 7.5 will be reported as stopped, irrespective of whether the broker is running or not. A dialogue might be displayed warning the brokers can not be connected to. \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is stopped, an error message is displayed containing the following text: \n   \n   The queue manager '<QueueManager>' is not running (MQ reason code 2059 while trying to connect) \n   \n   Check that: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is already started, a dialogue is displayed indicating that the broker can not be started as it is already running. Solution: \n   \n   Shut down the toolkit and re-open it using the toolkit installation and not by using Installation Manager.\n   \n   \n   \n * A version of XULRunner which is not compatible with Eclipse 3.6 (upon which WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit is based) may cause the Linux toolkit to crash shortly after being launched. Symptom: \n   \n   Within a minute or so of launching the Linux toolkit, it crashes with the following error:\n   JVM terminated - Exit code=160 \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Install a version of XULRunner which is compatible with Eclipse 3.6. \n   \n   Compatible versions of XULRunner are versions 1.8-3.6 and associated fix packs. \n   \n   Testing at IBM has been done using the following version, and this has been confirmed to resolve the issue:\n   http:\/\/ftp.mozilla.org\/pub\/mozilla.org\/xulrunner\/releases\/1.9.2.19\/runtimes\/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 [http:\/\/ftp.mozilla.org\/pub\/mozilla.org\/xulrunner\/releases\/1.9.2.19\/runtimes\/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2] \n   \n   Expand the downloaded compressed file into a convenient directory ( e.g. \/usr\/lib\/xulrunner_new) \n   \n   Add the following line to the eclipse.ini file under the mb install directory:\n   -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<location of unzipped download> ( e.g. -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=\/usr\/lib\/xulrunner_new)\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web Services \n * No known issues.\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web UI \n * Upload of WSDL on zOS in the Web UI is not supported On WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1 on zOS, you can not currently upload WSDL files using the Web UI for use in the Web Based Static Endpoint pattern.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Nodes  * After applying fixpack containing APAR IT01950 error BIP2503 is received.\n\n * \n * Symptoms:\n * WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that if ESQL containing a FOR statement which iterates over a SHARED ROW variable contains a PROPAGATE statement within the FOR block then any attempt to write to that shared variable will result in an exception BIP2503 \"Propagate with a SHARED variable lock held by FOR statement\" being thrown.\n   \n   The reason for this is that while iterating over a SHARED ROW variable a lock is held on the variable, this lock is also obtained when writing to the variable in downstream nodes and the exact timing of these operations could result in a deadlock occurring. It is not valid to modify the SHARED ROW variable being iterated over in downstream nodes as it may invalidate the loop therefore behavior has been changed to throw an exception instead of deadlocking.\n   \n   Solution: \n * This means that there may be some flows which were at risk of deadlocking which now throw an exception. The recommended action is to modify the flows so that they do not use the affected invalid pattern however if this is not possible the previous behavior can be restored by setting the environment variable MQSI_ALLOW_PROPAGATE_WITH_SHARED_LOCK_HELD=1 and restarting the Broker.\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Adapter nodes \n * Saving Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) adapter connection information during iterative discovery Symptoms: \n   \n   During WebSphere Adapter for SAP Software Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) iterative discovery, the Adapter Connection wizard Service Generation and Deployment Configuration panel is displayed and can be edited; however, any adapter system connection information that you enter is not saved in the adapter component. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the WebSphere Adapters editor to change the adapter system connection information to ensure that subsequent EMD iterative discoveries preserve the adapter system connection information: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Open With\n    * \n    * WebSphere Adapters editor\n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n   \n * Assured delivery option for JDEdwards is not supported Symptoms: \n   \n   The JDE inbound adapter fails to deploy if the assured delivery check box is selected in the adapter wizard. The following error is issued: \n   \n   An attempt to set the property 'AssuredOnceDelivery' on adapter component 'AssuredDeliveryMSApp.IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne' failed because the property is not supported. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This functionality is not currently supported, and should not be used in message flow development.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Graphical Data Mapper \n * Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database uses the default database schema name specified for the configured JDBC connection identity Symptoms: \n   \n   Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database is dependent on the default schema name configuration of your database server. The broker does not currently provide a facility to override the database schema name to be used in the SQL statements issued against the database. Currently, the SQL statement issued by the map includes only the database and table name but not a schema name. As a result, your database server uses the default database schema name for the identity that the broker used to connect to it while running the map. The connection identity that the broker uses is configured in a broker JDBCProvider configurable service. The JDBCProvider configurable service used is selected by the data source name in the map. \n   \n   If the required database table is not available in this schema, the map execution fails with a broker error containing specific error codes for your database server. For example:\n   BIP3947E: The map processing for QName '{maps}:RDB_Mapping' has failed, with the following details:\n   '{Your specific database schema table access error message and codes}' \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This restriction is addressed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1, and later, through provision of the capability to optionally override the name of the database schema. For more information, see JDBCProviders configurable service [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc\/an60170_.htm] property \"databaseSchemaNames\". \n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0 GA should ensure that the table being selected from the graphical data map is available in the schema that is set by your database server for the database connection identity that is configured in the JDBCProvider configurable service. This is particularly restrictive on z\/OS.\n   \n   \n   \n * Errors occur during runtime execution of newly created graphical data maps, that were converted from message map (.msgmap) files, or utilise certain extended capabilities such as submaps with multiple inputs, or xs:<type> cast transforms Symptoms: \n   \n   The execution of a graphical data map created using WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit version 8.0.0.2 that is deployed to a WebSphere Message Broker Runtime version 8.0 or 8.0.0.1 fails. \n   \n   Example error messages: \n   \n   BIP2230E: Error detected whilst processing a message in node '<node label>' ComIbmMSLMappingNode: <flow name>\n   BIP3946E: The map script generation for QName '<map routine name>' has failed, with the following details: java.lang.RuntimeException: IXJXE0609E: [ERR 0548][ERR XPST0017] The function '<function name>' with parity '<n>' is not in the in-scope function declarations. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Update the WebSphere Message Broker runtime to version 8.0.0.2.\n   \n   \n   \n * Errors are seen during runtime when using a complex Data Analysis generated GDM map. Symptoms: \n   \n   A JVM Out of Memory exception is seen at runtime when using a Data Analysis generated GDM Map \n   \n   When using complex XML structures more memory is required that the default JVM Heap size \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the mqsichangeproperties [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSKM8N_8.0.0\/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc\/an09143_.htm] command to increase the maximum heap size to greater than 256Mb. For example : mqsichangeproperties MB8BROKER -e default -o ComIbmJVMManager -n jvmMaxHeapSize -v 786432000\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Commands \n * Calling mqsiprofile in a zsh shell exits the session (A63403) Symptoms: \n   \n   On UNIX systems that use Z shell (zsh) as the shell environment, a call to 'source {install path}\/mqsiprofile' causes the shell to exit.

Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as \/MyRuleApp\/MyRuleset\/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as \/MyRuleApp\/2.0\/MyRuleset\/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: \n\n * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config\/config_ds_res_was8\/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] \n * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the \"About\" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor \n * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. \n * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. \n * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully \n * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. \n * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing\/topics\/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] \n * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251] \n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES \/ RES) Platform Independent 7.1.1, 7.1, 7.0.3, 7.0.2, 7.0.1, 7.0"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q253","question":"What TLS cipherspecs\/ciphersuites are supported when connecting from Oracle Java (non-IBM JRE) to MQ queue manager?\n\nWhat TLS cipherspecs\/ciphersuites are supported when connecting from Oracle Java (non-IBM JRE) to MQ queue manager?","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q254","question":"Why is my delete virtual portal timing out after 120 seconds?\n\nWhen deleting a virtual portal via the Portal Admin User Interface (UI), it fails to complete.

fixes\n---------------------------------------------------- \n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR : IV22637\nAbstract : AGENT CORE DUMP IF TNSPING IS NOT ACCESSABLE\nAdditional Information: A core dump occurs for the Oracle Database \nExtended agent if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME but, \n$ORACLE_HOME\/bin\/tnsping file did not grant read+execute permission\nto the agent OS user.\n\nAPAR : IV14403\nAbstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate \nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener\/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME\/network\/admin\/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME\/network\/admin\/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN\/network\/admin\/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN\/network\/admin\/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows systems:\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora \n\nIf this new variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk\/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file size:\n\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\n\nDefect: 172392\nAbstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in\nthe SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of\nBaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n<\/SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"SampleTable1\" GrantName=\"SampleTable1\"\/>\n<\/SQL>\n\nIf you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent \nuser in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942\nbecause the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element \nwhile the agent runs continuously.\n\nThe error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized\nsql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml \nfile and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n<\/SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"dual\" GrantName=\"dual\"\/>\n<\/SQL>\n\nDefect: 172695\nAbstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE \nAdditional Information: The RAS1 log file for the \nkrzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03.

Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux\nor UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the \nfollowing systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components are installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo\n\nThis command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows.

Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=\/\/host:port\/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat \/tmp\/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=\/opt\/IBM\/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=\/\/tivx010:1521\/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/bin\/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p \/tmp\/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir\/config\/rz.ini and installdir\/config\/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z\/OS Java SDK z\/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q260","question":"Framework Manager data source error\n\n\n\nUsers receive the following error on selecting a data source from the list defined in IBM Cognos within Framework Manager 10.2.2 Fix Pack 5\n\nalt text\n\nThat error (BMT-IMP-0002 Failed to Execute Metadata request.

Use the following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade \nPrerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this interim fix on UNIX systems, set the CANDLEHOME \nenvironment variable to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this interim fix, be sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent to be updated.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" \ncommand, see section [6.2]. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\n> <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\/ksa_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar\n\nwhere:\n- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column \nreturned by the .\/cinfo -i command. \n\nIn the following example, the file is \n\"ksa_li6263_tema_if0001.tar\".\n> .\/cinfo -i\n[Monitoring Agent for Your Product]\n[lx8266 Version: 07.11.01.01] \n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor Windows 32-bit\n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor Windows 64-bit \n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote: if the itmpatch command gets this error:\n\"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side\nconfiguration is incorrect. Please see the application event\nlog for more detail.\" it's necessary install the \"visualstudio\nredistribution package\" before to run the itmpatch command.\n\nFor a 32bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x86.exe, available at\nhttp:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=5582 [http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=5582]\n\nFor a 64bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x64.exe,available at \nhttp:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=2092 [http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=2092]\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems \nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more \ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. After \"tacmd addBundles..\" from step 3 above, control files\non the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server must be updated.\nThese updates must be done manually.\n\na. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server update\nThe sa_dd_07110101.xml and sa_dd.properties files must be\ncopied from the <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ndirectory to the 071001000 version of the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Services depot.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patchdepot.bat - Windows\nksa_patchdepot.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The\nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\nb. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server update\nResource files must be copied from the\n<TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory to the\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Portal directory.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patch_resource_teps.bat - Windows\nksa_patch_resource_teps.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>\/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The \nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 07110101\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 07110101\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the \nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be \nupdated. The target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command \nis always an OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop. \nNote: If SDA feature is enable at the HUB TEMS, then below steps are\nare not required. SDA will install only browser support and if\ncustomer is using TEP Desktop then install the support manfully\nas shown below.\n\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent support files that must be installed. If you installed these\nupdates, there are no additional installation steps. If you did not\ninstall these updates, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (ksa_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located. \n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one \nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Aquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0002 at \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na 32-bit java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of Tivoli Monitoring components to which \nyou want to add application support. For this fix, check or \nclear the check boxes as follows:\n\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting SAP Agent\n07.11.01.01 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it must\nbe restarted.\n\n7. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote\n(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.\n\n5.5 Installing SAP agent transport\n------------------------------------\nNote: From this fix onwards,a single ITM file has been provided for\nimporting SAP transport on all supported SAP versions having BADI or\nnon-BADI implementation.\n\nThis procedure installs the SAP transport into the SAP system. You\nare not required to uninstall the previous transport before\ninstalling this transport.\n\n1. Go to the ABAP directory in the location where you expanded the\nfix archive file.\n\n2. Copy the transport files into the SAP environment as follows: \n\na. The following two sets of transport files are in the \nABAP directory of the SAP agent fix archive:\n\n1) K711_00103U.ITM and R711_00103U.ITM in \/ABAP directory.\nThese files are Unicode versions of the transport. \n\n2) K711_00103_DELETE.ITM and R711_00103_DELETE.ITM\nThese transport files remove the ABAP code. Do not import\nthe DELETE transport unless you stop using the product \nentirely and want to remove the transports from your SAP\nsystems.\n\nb. Copy your transport files to the SAP Transport System data\ndirectory as follows:\n\n1) Copy the K711_00103U.ITM file to the cofiles directory.\n2) Copy the R711_00103U.ITM file to the data directory.\n\n3. Run the following command for non-BADI and BADI where:\nSID Target SAP : system ID\nPROFILE_NAME : Name of the tp profile file\nnnn : Number for the target client where the agent is to run\n\ntp addtobuffer ITMK711_00103U SID\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\ntp import ITMK711_00103U SID client=nnn U16\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\n\n\nAlternately, you can use the SAP STMS transaction to import the\ntransport requests. Ensure that the Import Transport Request Again \nand the Overwrite Objects in Unconfirmed Repairs options are \nchecked on the Import Options tab of the Import Transport Request\nwindow.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If you have not installed the files, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring, Version 6.2.2FP2: Installation and Setup Guide\" \n(ITM6.2.2FP2 Installation and Setup Guide.pdf) under \n\"Installing monitoring agent baroc files on the event server\" in the\n\"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Event Synchronization\" \nsection for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using the itmpatch command\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe itmpatch command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere: \n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification, \nwhere the fix is located. On Windows systems, this path must \ninclude the drive letter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd\ncommand to view the current version of the agent after the agent\nis restarted. You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. The default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory. The default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly,\nuse the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command\non Linux(R) or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the\nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems \nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote:\n- The date of the build displayed might not be accurate. This is\na known problem.\n\nOn Linux systems:\n--------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example: \n> %CANDLE_HOME%\/bin\/cinfo -i\n\nNote: cinfo output may differ depending on ITM version.\n\n*********** Fri Dec 5 10:14:10 IST 2014 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel pkcs11\nHost name : IBMSAP1V9 Installer Lvl:06.23.03.00\nCandleHome: \/opt\/ibm\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nli6243 Version: 07.40.43.00\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nli6263 Version: 06.12.00.00\n\nsa IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP \nApplications\nli6263 Version: 07.11.01.01\n\nue Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n===================================\n\nAbstract: While configuring the agent instance on UNIX, more than 3 \nletters are accepted as instance ID. \nProblem: Three letters are accepted as Instance ID while configuring \nagent instance on UNIX.

There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21662193.txt","text":"Title: IBM Changes in the default user identifier between WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS - United States\n\nText:\n TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n You have configured a WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factory without an Authentication Alias and do not programmatically supply user identifier information when creating a connection to a queue manager. You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:\n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. \n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. \n\nIn the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:\n\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') \n\nIs this change in behaviour expected? \n\nANSWER\nWebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(\u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d);\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);\n\nIn the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.\n\nAs a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.\n\nThis change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.\n\nIn the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.\n\n\nIn summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.\n\n- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.\n\n\nThe com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property\n\nA Java System Property called \u201ccom.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID\u201d was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.\n\nThe changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.\n\nThis property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.\n\nOther Useful Resources\n\nWebSphere MQ Documentation\n\nThe WebSphere MQ Documentation contains a section on planning user authorization which also includes a description on access control for clients.

The extracted text is added to the Search index allowing users to find documents based on the content. \n\nWhen the Stellent utility is not configured correctly, file content will not be extracted or indexed. Therefore, search results within IBM Connections will not contain any matches on file content. For any content extraction issues, follow the steps in this tech note. \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n 1 Stellent installation \n\nEnsure that the following IBM Connections post-installation task has been carried out:\nhttp:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/lcwiki.nsf\/dx\/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/lcwiki.nsf\/dx\/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40]\n\n\n 2 Running the exporter in isolation from IBM Connections \n\nTo verify that the exporter is working correctly, you can run it on the command line in isolation from IBM Connections. To run the exporter executable on the command line, execute the following as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under: \n\n1. Change directory to the Stellent binary location. For example: \n\n $ cd \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\n\n2. Run the exporter command.\nThe exporter command has the following syntax: \n\n exporter inputpath=<path_to_input_file>\noutputpath=<path_to_extracted_text_output>\noutputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nFor example,\n$ .\/exporter inputpath=\/root\/translation.pdf \\ outputpath=\/root\/testStellent.txt outputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nIf the text extraction worked successfully, you will see the following output: \n\nExport complete\n\nHowever, if you see a message like the one below, continue to step 3:\n\n.\/exporter: error while loading shared libraries: libsc_ex.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory \n\n\n 3 Operating System Environment Variables \n\nEnsure that the operating system environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are set correctly in Section 1. Both variables should contain the Stellent installation directory. To get the current values of the environment variables, run the following commands as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under:\n\n$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n$ echo $PATH\n\nTo verify that the Stellent exporter executable can be found through the PATH environment variable, run the following command:\n\n$ which exporter\n\nThe output of this command should contain the full path to the exporter executable. For example:\n\n\/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\/exporter\n\n\n 4 WebSphere Environment \n\nUsing the WebSphere Application Server administration console, ensure that the WebSphere environment variable FILE_CONTENT_CONVERSION points to the exporter executable. \n\nFor example: \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\/exporter\n\n\n 5 File Permissions \n\nEnsure that the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under has sufficient privileges. They should have read\/write\/execute permissions on the exporter executable and read\/write permissions on the other files in the Stellent installation directory.\n\n\n 6 Library compatibility \n\nVerify that the libraries deployed with Stellent are compatible with your platform.\n\nFor example, on a 64 bit Linux system:\n$ uname -a\nLinux host1 2.6.18-308.11.1.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jun 15 15:41:53 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU\/Linux\n\n$ cd \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\n$ file libsc_ex.so\nlibsc_ex.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped\n\n(Note that your Stellent installation may contain 32 bit libraries though you are running on 64 bit platform. This is not an issue, provided that the 32 bit compatible libraries are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or can be found on the shared library search path).\n\n\n 7 Shared library dependencies \n\nThe Stellent exporter executable has a number of dependencies on both the shared libraries packaged with Stellent and on shared libraries installed on your system. To verify that all the required shared libraries can be found, use the 'ldd' command on the exporter executable as follows:\n\n$ ldd -v exporter\n\nCheck the output of this command for any shared libraries marked as '=> not found'. \n\n Stellent shared library not found \n\nIf a Stellent shared library can't be found, then check that the setting of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable contains the Stellent installation directory. \n\n System shared library not found \n\nIf a system shared library can't be found, then you are missing a prerequisite library.\nNOTE: It is still possible to pick up libraries from locations other than those included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable, as long as they can be found elsewhere on the system's default search path. \n\nIn addition to libc.so.6, Stellent is dependent upon the following libraries: \nlibstdc++.so.5\nlibgcc_s.so.1 \n\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later, it is possible that you are missing the package compat-libstdc++-33 . This package contains libstdc++.so.5.\n\n\n\n\n * \n *"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q289","question":"Why does the other instance of my multi-instance qmgr seem to hang after a failover?\n\nWhy does the other instance of my multi-instance qmgr seem to hang after a failover?","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q290","question":"Hey, how can I transfer my spss 24 licence from my old macbook to the new one?\n\n\n\nI made the backup from my laptop to my new one, but SPSS doesnt allow me to start, because of the licence!

It contains the following files: \n\n * audit_trail.csv \u2013 all user actions that influence the final results of the licensing reports, for example, software classification actions, uploads and imports of the PVU table, software catalog, and charge units as well as changes to the VM managers. \n * data_conditions.txt \u2013 conditions that were used during the generation of the audit snapshot, including the reporting period and filters applied on the reports as well as general information about the time when the snapshot was generated, version of the PVU table and software catalog, status of the import, aggregation, and recalculation. \n * part_numbers.csv - part numbers that are listed in the software catalog for all software products that are included in any of the CSV report files. \n * pvu_full_capacity.csv - PVU full capacity license metric results \n * pvu_sub_capacity.csv - PVU subcapacity license metric results \n * rvu_full_capacity.csv - RVU full capacity license metric results \n * rvu_sub_capacity.csv - RVU subcapacity license metric results \n * bundling_definitions.csv - list of IBM software regardless of its license type and utilization together with details of the computers on which the software is installed \n * readme.txt - a link to this document (technote) \n * checksums.txt, signature.rsa, and pub_key.pem - files used by IBM auditors to verify the authenticity and correctness of the audit snapshot.\n\n\n\nWhy some product instances are not listed in the CSV reports? \n\nCSV reports with information about PVU and RVU MAPC utilization (pvu_full_capacity.csv, pvu_sub_capacity.csv, rvu_full_capacity.csv, and rvu_sub_capacity.csv) list only software instances that were discovered during the license peak value time. If an instance was installed in your environment during the reporting period of the current audit snapshot but was not discovered during the license peak value time, the instance is not listed in the CSV reports. \n\nExample: \nThree instances of DB2 are installed. The reporting period is set to one month and DB2 license utilization is as follows: \n\u00b7 Instance 1 uses the maximum of 100 PVUs, \n\u00b7 Instance 2 uses the maximum of 300 PVUs, \n\u00b7 Instance 3 uses the maximum of 500 PVUs. \n\nThe license peak value occurs when the sum of PVU values for all instances is the highest and equals 800 PVUs (300 PVUs for instance 2 + 500 PVUs for instance 3). The peak occurs during the period that is marked with a red square (it is the license peak value time). The peak usage for instance 1 is outside of the red square. It means that this instance was installed in the environment during the current reporting period but was not discovered during the license peak value time. This instance is not listed in the CSV report. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1]  \n\n\nWhy some values from the CSV report do not relate back to what is displayed on the user interface? \n\nWhen all values from column M (Physical Server PVU Subcapacity) for a particular product are added, the obtained value is greater that the value that is displayed in the user interface.

This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/webservers\/appserv\/support.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/webservers\/appserv\/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

Remove all license servers from the \"DaemonHost\" line and save the file.\n\nb). Create a system environment variable, called LSHOST, on each SPSS client with your redundant license servers as its value. Separate each redundant license server with a colon, e.g.\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: server1:server2:server3\n========================== \n\n\n\nIf the \"DaemonHost\" value is accurate and you are using a Hostname value, you have a name resolution problem. Error # 2070, Symptom number 3 typically means the SPSS client cannot connect to the name resolution database or the name resolution database does not contain a record for the machine where the SPSS Sentinel License Manager resides. To verify, please do the following:\n\n1. Run lswhere.exe (which is located in the SPSS directory, see above) from the problematic SPSS Client machine and take note of the displayed output. The following is an example of the output: \n\n\n==========================\nSentinel LM 8.x.x Search Tool For License Servers\nCopyright (C) 20xx Rainbow Technologies, Inc.\n\nServer Address : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nServer Name : Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine is not listed or you encounter the error, \"Error[17]: Probably no servers are running on this subnet.\", please add the following system environment variable to the IBM SPSS Statistics\/Modeler client and run lswhere.exe again: \n\n\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: Name or IP address of the License Manager machine \n========================== \n\n\nFor information about defining environment variables, see the Network License Administrator's Guide. If using the LSHOST environment variable does not render the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine, try using LSFORCEHOST instead.\n\n2. When you see the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine name and corresponding IP address listed in the lswhere output, ping the displayed Server Name from a command line, e.g.\n\n\n==========================\nping Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nAn example of the resulting output is as follows:\n==========================\nUnknown host Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the ping command is unable to resolve the Server Name, you have a name resolution problem and must address it (with help from your IT Administrator\/Help Desk team) before IBM SPSS Statistics\/Modeler can acquire a license from the Sentinel License Manager.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/97013 [https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/97013] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N\/AC:M\/Au:N\/C:P\/I:N\/A:N) \n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nThis vulnerability affects all versions and releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.\n\n\nREMEDIATION\/FIXES\nThere is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. \n\nThe update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. \n\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nFor all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: \n\n\nAdd the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains \"SSLEnable\":\n\n# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566\n# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7\n# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers \n# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.\nSSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2\n\nStop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.\n\nNote: \n\n * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the \"Include\" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.\n\n * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable\n\n\nIBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions.

RES components that interact directly with the RES Console management stack normally expect to find exactly one RES Console within the this management scope : an error can arise from not finding a RES Console management stack, as well as finding more than one.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCertain use cases are supported that involve deploying more than one RES console in a cluster, most notably for situations where a active\/passive fail over is needed, see the following document for more information: Clustering Rule Execution Server (RES) management console [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] \n\n\nHowever there is a number of limitations that one can face when several RES consoles are deployed within the same administrative cell, such as : \n\n 1. The use of the API ilog.rules.session.IlrManagementSession (reference [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/brjrules\/v7r1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc\/html\/api\/html\/ilog\/rules\/res\/session\/IlrManagementSession.html]) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell. \n 2. With JRules 6.x deploying RSM in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed can lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above when attempting to add an SSP through the RSM console. \n 3. With JRules 7.x DVS scenario suite executions initiated from Rule Studio to be run on a remote Java EE server in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed may fail with java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. \n 4. The use of interceptors (i.e. IlrSessionInterceptor implementations) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException or an error message such as ilog.rules.res.session.interceptor.IlrSessionInterceptorException: Unable to find RuleApp \/myruleapp\/myruleset for use by the interceptor. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell.\n\n\nFor situations 2. and 3. note that DVS and RSM are normally deployed in a non-production environment since they support the testing process of the rules prior to their deployment to production. So in practice it is not necessary to deploy multiple RES console instances for fail over purpose when in a testing environment. The recommendation is then to set up RES console and SSP in a testing cell that is separate from the production cell. In this testing cell, only one instance of RES console should be installed.

Will the user be asked to re-login?\n\nAnswer 1 \nNo. When using single sign-on (SSO), the Security Cache will refresh from the LTPA Token. If your LTPA Token is also expired, then the user will be asked to re-login. Also, the cache timeout period is reset every time that entry is hit. So, if the entry is hit 9 minutes into the 10 minute timeout period, the clock is reset at that time.

So far everything is working fine. \n    \n 2. You manually changed the password for UserA in the LTPA (LDAP or custom registry) from Password1 to Password2. \n 3. Using a new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the new password (Password2) a token was created and again everything is working as expected. \n    \n 4. Using a another new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the old password (Password1). You were surprised to notice that a token was created and UserA was able to access the application. \n\n\nAnswer 2 \nThe old password takes up to 1.5 times the security cache to disappear. It will also expire at the end of the LTPA token timeout. \n\nIn IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.0.2 and later, you can purge a user from the security cache using an MBean interface.

Answer 3 \nSee the answer to this question in item 9 of the following developerWorks article:\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/websphere\/techjournal\/1003_botzum\/1003_botzum.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/websphere\/techjournal\/1003_botzum\/1003_botzum.html]\n\n\nQuestion 4 \nIf this is the case, can we expire or delete the LTPAToken cookie when the session expires? If so, what mechanism should we use? \n\nAnswer 4\nYou can manually perform a form-based logout (as described in the Information Center) to request that the LTPAToken cookie be destroyed in the web browser, but within WebSphere Application Server, there is no functionality to automatically perform the form-based logout when the session times out. This would have to be performed programmatically.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Federated Repository cache settings [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/en\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/uwim_ldapperfsettings.html]\nAuthentication cache settings [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/en\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/usec_sec_domains_cache.html]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q333","question":"javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The reference to entity must end with the ; delimiter.\n\n\n\nAfter an upgrade from JRules to ODM we are receiving errors because of an ampersand in our data.

Search the installation log for instances of the CheckLockedFiles string. Locked files are listed at these places. Locked files are files that might need to be upgraded during an installation, and because they are in use (locked) the silent install terminates.\n\n\n2. Identify the process that is locking the files.\n\n\n3. Stop the process.\n\n\n4. Prevent file locking by modifying the response file for installation file. This step is required when a silent installation has terminated. \n\na. Open the response file in a text editor. In many cases, the file in which you make this modification is named silent.txt. On Windows, the file to modify is the NT_Silent_Install.txt file that is located on the monitoring server.\nb. Add the following line to the [INSTALLATION SECTION] area of your silent install response file:\nLocked Files=continue\nIf you apply any other value or assign no value for this parameter, silent installations fail when locked files exist.\nc. If Locked Files=continue is used in a silent install or remote deploy, the computer MUST be rebooted before ITM is brought up or another install is run. This is mandatory or the <ITMHOME> directory could become corrupt. If the <ITMHOME> directory becomes corrupt, all of ITM will have to be uninstalled and reinstalled.\n\n\n5.

Have you tried using the approach recommended in the CORBA Interop samples?\n     \n     \n 11. Where was the Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiled (what tool was used)?\n     \n     Note: See the WebSphere Application Server detailed system requirements [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27006921] for the information related to the third party ORB Supported\/Tested, then select WebSphere Version > Server Type > Search on third-party ORB in Software Requirements List.\n\n \n\nA collector output is required for the WebSphere Application Server support team to troubleshoot an ORB issue. By providing the collector output, your configuration can be reviewed to help get a better understanding of your topology and settings. \n\n\n * Detailed instructions on how to run the collector program can be found at the following link:\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEQTP_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/ttrb_runct.html [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEQTP_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/ttrb_runct.html] \n\nMake sure you do not run the collector program from within the WebSphere Application Server product installation root directory. This will lead to an error. Make a working directory where you can start the collector program. \n\nOnce you have run the collector program from the dmgr, upload the collector.jar file that is created.  \n\nIf specific ORB traces have been requested by the Application Server support team, use the following instructions:\n\nNOTE: In most cases, support is going to need a matching client and server side trace to troubleshoot the issue. In some cases, they may even need traces from the nodeagent.\n\n\n\n * WebSphere Application Server V6.1, V7.0, V8.0, and V8.5 ORB trace instructions \n   You can review the following video that walks you through setting up the ORB trace in the Administrative Console. It goes through each step listed below to make sure the ORB trace is enabled correctly. \n   \n   \n    1.  From the Administrative Console, select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Change Log Details Levels.\n        \n        \n    2.  Remove any previous entries in the text field type the following:\n        \n        *=info:ORBRas=all\n        \n        \n    3.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    4.  Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service.\n        \n        \n    5.  Change the Maximum Number of Historical Files to 10 and maximum file size to 50mb\n        \n        \n    6.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    7.  Enabling Comm Trace:\n        \n        Application Server\n        From the Administrative Console, Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Container Services > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        Node Agent\n        From the Administrative Console, select System Administration >Node Agent > nodeagent > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        Deployment Manager\n        From the Administrative Console, Select System Administration > Deployment Manager > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        NOTE: You will need to do a server restart for the Comm Tracing to be captured in the trace.log file. You can also leave the Orb Tracing check box checked permanently in case you run into another ORB issue in the future. That way, you don't have to do another server restart for the trace to be captured. Leaving the Orb Tracing check box checked won't log any data to a trace log unless you have the ORBRas=all trace string enabled (Step 2 above). This means it won't cause any performance issues or affect anything else in the server. \n    8.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    9.  Restart the sever and recreate the problem\n        \n        \n    10.

Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair\n\nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nChoosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out \nand shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted \nto replace the existing data file for the module.\n\nCreate a replacement session file \nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nAdjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. \nYour support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.\nNo work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored\nfor the effected module.  \n\n\nNote: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module.

To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file.

In the above example, this is the unicode character 0x0, but there are a number of other unicode characters that can cause the same result. The problem does not occur in the WebSphere Adapter itself because the WebSphere Adapters are entirely capable of handling full unicode data. Rather, the problem happens in some brokers which fail to properly serialize the incoming data into a valid XML object.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe only complete solution at this time is to not process unicode characters that are not valid in XML. This can be done by not importing data fields that might contain such characters or by purging such characters from the incoming data source. It is not sufficient to do filtering in the BO maps since the broker can still run into problems prior to this Java\u2122 mapping. \n\n\nIf handling of fields containing these unicode characters is essential to your use case, it will be necessary to open a PMR with your broker's support team (rather than the WebSphere Adapter team) to determine if there are any alternatives available.\n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 75349\n344\n000"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q353","question":"CQWEB  can\\'t retrieve repository dropdown list options in RedHat Linux, how to deal with it ?\n\nI setup a cq demo env in redhat linux with oracle database, CQ 7.1.2, LRKS 8.1.3,  Linux CQ client can login CQ as the following picture 1, but CQWEB login page can't retrieve the repository dropdown list options as the following picture 2.

As the query is being processed the system allocates memory for each row of the result set. This includes each of the GROUP BY columns and each of the aggregates. For queries doing aggregates on variable length columns, the total length of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is \"Boston\" and the new min value is \"Albuquerque\" space for the new min value needs to increase. \n\nThe NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra pseudo-column that is tacked onto each row. It does not contain any data. It is a filler that starts out at NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE and then dynamically shrinks and expands as needed to keep each of the aggregate rows at a fixed length. There is a single springfield in each grouping record that has to shrink and grow to offset the combined changes in width of the running values for all min\/max aggregates. \n\nTo avoid this error message, increase the value for this parameter as follows: \n\n1. nzstop\n2. export NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE=1024\n3. nzstart \n\nYou can confirm that the environment variable took effect by running the command \"nzsystem showregistry\". The output should contain the following: \"system.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\". \n\nUnfortunately, the setting for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will revert to its default value the next time the database is stopped and started without the NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE environment variable being set. To ensure that the setting persists after every database restart, do the following:\n1. Add the following line to the \/nz\/data\/config\/system.cfg file. (Create the file if it does not exist.) \n\nsystem.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\n2. nzstop\n3. nzstart \n\nIf 1024 does not work, try higher values. Setting the limit may take a little trial and error. Increasing this value should not have a noticeable impact on other system performance. \n\n \n\nNote: \"By default 512 bytes is allocated to each row taking part in aggregations. By increasing this value by 512 we allocate over 30MB more memory for every 1 000 000 rows participating in aggregations. This is for one query, there might be other queries in the system which do aggregations as well. The more memory that is allocated for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE (for each row) the less memory left for other processes. Having said this, it is not uncommon to see NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE set to 8192 without consequence but care must be taken and one must still be aware of how increasing NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will impact resources, thus increase it wisely. \" \n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n NZ755310"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q356","question":"What can be done about \"Too many open files\" messages in the DASH systemOut?\n\nWhat can be done about \"Too many open files\" messages in the DASH systemOut log on a system running Linux?

Use\nthe following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n------------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites\nfor this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment \nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation \ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM \n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent code to be\nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>\nrepresents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On\nWindows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or \nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\"\ncommand, see section 6.2. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004, the install command is:\n\n> itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\/kph_aix526_tema_if0004.tar\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or \nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\n\"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\nAdministrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t ph\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062203004\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t PH \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 062203004\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is\nspecified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the managed\nsystem name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\n\nThis fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the agent\nsupport files which need to be installed. Use the following steps to\nupdate the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (kph_tems_teps_tepd_if0004.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server,\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an extract\nutility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version\nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM\nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer,\n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0003 at\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\n\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n-- OR --\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to\na Java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running\nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below.\n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the\ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for\nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is\nlocated.\n\nNote: Using the silent installation option for Linux and zLinux\noperating systems requires the following files contained in\ninterim fix 6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001:\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent]\n[-r <response file>]\n[-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]\n[-r <response file>]\n[-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Optional. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and modified\nfor your environment. Do not update \"response.txt\".\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the \"bin\"\ndirectory where Java(R) is installed. The\nlocation of Java on your system might vary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer asks\nfor the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components you want\nto add application support to. For this fix, check or clear the\ncheck boxes as follows:\n\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the HMC Base\n06.22.03.04 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nBrowser was running when the update was installed, it must be\nrestarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n\nFor additional troubleshooting installation information, see the\nitmpatch.log in the patchlogs directory in <CANDLEHOME>.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThis fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be installed. Refer to IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Installation and Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring\nagent baroc files on the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Console Event Synchronization\" section for more\ninformation.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax:\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t PH\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t PH \n\nNote: The component (-t) for the \"tacmd listSystems\" command is\nspecified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.22.03.04.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\n\"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command on\nLinux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions\nof the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems\nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed date of the build might not be accurate. This\nis a known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo -i\n\n*********** Thu Oct 7 13:57:24 CST 2015 ******************\nUser: root Groups: system bin sys security cron audit lp\nHost name : <hostname> Installer Lvl:06.30.02.00\nCandleHome: \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n.\n.\n.\nph Monitoring Agent for HMC Base\ntms Version: 06.22.03.04\ntps Version: 06.22.03.04\ntpw Version: 06.22.03.00\n.\n.\n.\n\nOn Windows systems:\n---------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\n{Add your sample output here}\n*********** Thu Oct 7 16:03:55 Eastern Standard Time 2015 **********\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : <hostname> Installer: Ver: 062204000\nCandleHome: C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm: C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*********************************************************************\n.\n.\n.\nPH Monitoring Agent for HMC Base Support\nWINNT Version: 06.22.03.04 Build: 201510070000\n\nPH Monitoring Agent for HMC Base Support\nWINNT Version: 06.22.03.04 Build: 201510070000\n\nPH Monitoring Agent for HMC Base Support\nWINNT Version: 06.22.03.04 Build: 201510070000\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n=========================\nNone.\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n======================\nNone. \n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information\n==================================\nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com\/legal\/copytrade.shtml.\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: \n\n 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). \n 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. \n 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default \/Applications\/IBM\/SPSS\/Statistics\/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:\n    USER_INSTALL_DIR=\/Applications\/IBM\/SPSS\/Statistics\/24 \n 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. \n 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:\n    \n    .\/SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties\n\n\nInstallation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the \u2018root\u2019 user. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nGuidelines for unattended\/pushed installations for Linux-based clients: The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Linux Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Running a Silent Installation on Mac and Linux Computers\". \n\nNote: Please contact IBM SPSS Technical Support to obtain the appropriate installer.properties file for the Linux platform. \n\nSPSS Statistics Server - 24.0 FP2 Installation Instructions \n\nInstallation Windows \n\n 1. Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. \n 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. \n 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. \n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add\/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.\n\n\nInstallation UNIX\/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX \/ Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation \n\n 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. \n 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. \n 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the \/bin, \/lib and \/common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: \n    \n    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator\u2019s Guide for more information. \n 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): .\/<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. \n 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): .\/<installer_name>\n    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. \n 7. Start the Statistics Server after the Fix Pack installation is complete. \n 8. Run .\/statisticsb and enter SHOW VERSION. The response should indicate 24.00.00.02\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z\/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor\/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode.

If these Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression\/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http:\/\/ss64.com\/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z\/OS and z\/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.messages\/diag\/appendixes\/messages\/j9gc\/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor\/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_6.0.0\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer\/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression\/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/tools\/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem.

If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22.

The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS.\" \n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:\n\n\n\n 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh\n 2. \n 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh \n    sh> PATH=$PATH:\/opt\/java7\/bin \n    \n\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.\n\nIt is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.\n\n\n\n * Syntax\n * Examples\n * WebSphere Application Server\n * Sample output\n * Resolving problems\n * Download\n\n\n\nSYNTAX\n\n 1.  mqjavalist.sh -? | -h \n 2.  \n 3.  mqjavalist.sh [-v] [-r] [-f File] -d Directory ...\n 4.  \n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  -?:\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. -h:\n 11. \n 12. \n 13. -v:\n 14. \n 15. \n 16. -r:\n 17. \n 18. \n 19. -f File\u200b:\n 20. \n 21. \n 22. -d Directory:\n 23. \n 24. \n 25. \n 26. \n 27. \n 28.

Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.\n\n\n 1.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and\/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

This can happen for many reasons, including: \n\n * The application tries to get a connection and fails, as when the database is not started.\n   \n   \n * A connection is no longer usable due to a database failure. When an application tries to use a connection it has previously obtained, the connection is no longer valid. In this case, all connections currently in use by an application can get this error when they try to use the connection.\n   \n   \n * The application using the connection has already called close() and then tries to use the connection again.\n   \n   \n * The application tries to use a JDBC\u2122 resource, such as a statement, obtained on a now-stale connection.\n\n\nWhen the StaleConnectionException is issued, the behavior is determined by the Purge Policy setting for the connection pool. If the Purge Policy is set to EntirePool, the entire pool is flushed. But if the Purge Policy is set to FailingConnectionOnly, only the connection that caused the StaleConnectionException is purged from the pool. \n\nAn application can recover from bad connections by explicitly catching the StaleConnectionException and getting a new connection from the pool. Numerous exceptions issued by DB2, Oracle, DataDirect (for connecting to SQLServer), Sybase, and Informix are currently mapped to the StaleConnectionException, which makes recovery easier for the application programmer.

To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code.

Remove the space in the directory path and install the ITM on a directory without spaces. \n\nExample : D:\\IBM\\ITM \n\n \n\n2. Check the NTFS 8.3 name creation and enable the 8.3 naming creation to install the ITM on a directory path with spaces.\n\ncheck the value on the below registry location \n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem\\NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation\n\nIn case NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation is set to (2), this means the following: NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.\n\nYou can check the 8.3 name creation using this command for the volumes that are impacted.\n\nFor example, if the %TEMP% folder is located on c:\\, but you are installing on d:\\, then you should run these commands: \n\n\nfsutil 8dot3name query c:\nfsutil 8dot3name query d:\n\nYou will get an output like this:\nThe volume state is: 0 (8dot3 name creation is enabled).\nThe registry state is: 2 (Per volume setting - the default). \n\n\nValue and Meaning\n\n0 NTFS creates short file names. This setting enables applications that cannot process long file names and computers that use different code pages to find the files.\n1 NTFS does not create short file names. Although this setting increases file performance, applications that cannot process long file names, and computers that use different code pages, might not be able to find the files.\n2 NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.\n3 NTFS disables 8dot3 name creation on all volumes except the system volume. \n\n \n\nmore detail... \n\n\nhttps:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/cc959352.aspx [https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/cc959352.aspx]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q432","question":"Maintenance Manager login with LDAP\n\n I\"m trying to set up NENU to run on a 9.0.1 application.

That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21508890.txt","text":"Title: IBM How to serve static files from both IBM HTTP Server and an application in WebSphere Application Server - United States\n\nText:\n TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can I configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS), and the IBM web server Plug-in, and my web application running in WebSphere Application Server (WAS), to serve some of my static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from the IHS web server, but serve other static files from my web app running in WAS? \n\nCAUSE\nThe \"fileServingEnabled\" property in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the web application, is like an ON \/ OFF switch.\nA setting of fileServingEnabled=\"true\" means that ALL static files will be served from the web application in WAS only. In this case, the plug-in config will use a wildcard with the application context-root like \"\/myapp\/*\". That way every URL starting with \/myapp\/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand, fileServingEnabled=\"false\" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like \"\/myapp\/servlet1\" and \"\/myapp\/index.jsp\". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"\/myapp\/*\" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with \"myapp\" will be routed to the application in WAS. \n\n\nNow, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer\/htdocs\/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n\/usr\/IBM\/HTTPServer\/htdocs\/static\/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static\/picture.jpg\", or \"static\/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\/myapp\/static\/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any \"static\" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/static\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n<\/ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with \/myapp\/static\/* then IHS will rewrite it to just \/static\/* and \"pass-through\". Since \/static\/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nBut, the file will really be served by IHS from here:\n\/hostname\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nHere is another example:\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif, *.css and *.js files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif|css|js)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n\nWhich assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]\/static\/.\n\n4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images\/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname\/myapp\/images\/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nBut other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/images\/sunset.jpg"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q442","question":"Help with Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5 (CVE-2015-4000)\n\nI need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5 (CVE-2015-4000).

You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:\n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. \n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. \n\nIn the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:\n\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') \n\nIs this change in behaviour expected? \n\nANSWER\nWebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(\u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d);\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);\n\nIn the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.\n\nAs a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.\n\nThis change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.\n\nIn the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.\n\n\nIn summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.\n\n- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter.

However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nBefore proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>\/PortalServer\/derby\/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.\n\nNOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add \".sh\" or \".bat' depending on the platform.\n\nThere are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, \"dblook\", \"ij\", and \"sysinfo\", under the <was_root>\/AppServer\/derby\/bin\/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.\n\ndblook utility\nThe dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. \n\nThe usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the \"jdbc:derby:<database>\" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb. \n\nCommonly used options include: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Examples:\n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\\temp\\user_desc.sql\n * \n * \n\n\nij utility \nThe ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). \n\nTo start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt \"ij>\". \n\nThe following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * \n * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> show connections;\n * \n * \n *  CONNECTION0* - jdbc:derby:C:\\ibm\\websphere\\wp_profile\\portalserver\\derby\\wpsdb \n   * = current connection \n   ij> driver \"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> set schema=release;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> select * from user_desc where oid=1000;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> run 'myquery.sql';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE('RELEASE','USER_DESC','USER_DESC.SQL',';','|',NULL);\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> \n * CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY('SELECT * FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC','user_desc_query.sqlL',null,'|',NULL);\n * \n * \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Derby utility from Apache [http:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javadb\/10.3.3.0\/getstart\/cgsusingtoolsutils.html]\nDerby SQL references from Apache [http:\/\/db.apache.org\/derby\/docs\/10.1\/ref\/crefsqlj23296.html]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Organizational Productivity- Portals & Collaboration WebSphere Portal End of Support Products AIX, HP-UX, IBM i, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z\/OS 7.0, 6.1"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q456","question":"zonecfg error while starting nodeagent and dmgr\n\n\n\nI saw zonecfg error while starting nodeagent and dmgr in solaris server\n\nMy env is Oracle Solaris 11.2 SPARC, and WAS is 8558, jave 1.7.

Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nFor example, if your system's \n\nMaximum number of WebContainer threads is 100 \n\nthen you should set your \n\nMaximum number of Portal datasource connections to 125 \n\nfor each Portal datasource. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nIf during Runtime, you should find that your running out of Portal Datasource connections, you may go ahead and increase the ratio up to 2:1. Please be aware of how this might impact your backend resources and be sure to scale your database accordingly. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nTo find the number of WebContainer threads that are running in any particular Portal server, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console and go to the following location: \n\nServers ---> Application Servers --> WebSphere_Portal (your server) --> Thread Pools --> WebContainer \n\n \n\nTo find the Data Source setting for your Portal datasources, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console to go to the following location: \n\nResources ---> Data Sources ---> wpdbDB (for example) --> Connection pools \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q458","question":"Error TASK001X while upgrading Portal 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.1 CF14 during import-nodes sub-task\n\n Error TASK001X while upgrading Portal 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.1 CF14 during import-nodes sub-task","answer":"Please make the following change in the WAS Admin Console...\nApplications > WebSphere enterprise applications >\nJavaContentRepository > Target specific application status > Check the\nbox for the WebSphere_Portal server > Click Enable Auto Start > Save\nchanges > restart Portal\n\nAfter making this change please attempt the CF upgrade again.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21691034.txt","text":"Title: IBM Error TASK001X while upgrading Portal 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.1 CF14 during import-nodes sub-task - United States\n\nText:\nupgrade; TASK001X; import-nodes; 404 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM\nWhile attempting to upgrade Portal to CF14 the upgrade fails during the import-nodes sub-task.\n\nSYMPTOM\nThe ConfigTrace.log shows the following...\n\nimport-nodes:\n\n--- Exception Thrown ---\nC:\\Portal8\\PortalServer\\jcr\\wp.content.repository.install\\config\\include\ns\\jcr.install_cfg.xml:826: com.ibm.icm.jcr.task.TaskException:\nTASK001X: Remote task execution failed with response code 404 due to\nexception : Not Found .

A coordinated update procedure should be followed when there is a need to change the user account and\/or password. This procedure applies to FileNet Content Engine 4.x and above. \n\n * \n * Note: \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the same user account is also used as the CE Bootstrap user, the corresponding user in the BootstrapConfig.properties needs to change as well. For changing the GCD admin user\/password in BootstrapConfig.properties specifically, refer to this documentation: \nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm] \n\n\n1. Launch FEM and the application server's administrative console. \na. Login to FEM using the Directory Service account. \nb. Login to the application server administrative console with an administrator account. \n\nImportant: Do not close above two applications until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n2. Make LDAP account changes: \na. Change the password for an existing account on the LDAP server - Using LDAP interface, change the password for the CE Directory Service account. \nOR \nb. Create a new user account on the LDAP server for the CE Directory Service account. \n\n\n3. Add new user (if applicable), to FEM \nIf the bind user is also the CE admin user, then the bind user will need to be added to all the existing objects in the P8 domain. Please read Update object store with new users and groups [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_update_os.htm] for instructions \n\n\n4.

Click on Change password check box > change to a new password > click OK. \n\nAt this point you will be presented a dialog box with following message: \n\u201cThese changes require the application server to be restarted. Please restart the application server to incorporate these changes\u201d \n\nclick OK > click OK \n\nImportant: Do not restart the application server until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n5. Change the user in the application server's directory configuration \n\n- For Websphere, in the WebSphere Administrative Console, go to Global Security > click on Configure under User Account Repository > Modify Bind Distinguished Name (DN) > Modify Bind Password > click OK and Save changes \n\n- For WebLogic go to Security Realms > myrealm > Providers > ldap provider and click on \"Provider Specific\" tab in WebLogic Admin Console. Change \"Principal\" and \"Credential\". \n\n- For JBoss go to <JBoss Home>\\server\\<CE Server>\\conf directory and edit \"login-config.xml\". \nFind \"FileNet\" application-policy and in login module change bindDN\/bindCredential. \n\n\n6. Changing the CE Bootstrap user \n\nFor CE 4.5.x and above: \na. In the Configure Bootstrap Properties task, set the Bootstrap Operation property to Modify Existing. \nb. Confirm that the Bootstrapped EAR file property contains the path to the bootstrap file you need to edit. \nc. Change the Bootstrap user password. Use Configuration Manager's features to save and run the task. \nd. Run Configuration Manager's Deploy Application. \n\nFor CE 4.0: \nNote: This step is needed only if the GCD user name is the same as the Directory Service account. Note that the example below is for a Windows environment. \n\n- For WebSphere \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder where EAR file reside (it differs depending on CE version). For example, in CE 4.5.1, go to \"<CE Home> \\ tools \\ configure \\ profiles \\ <profile> \\ ear\" \nb. Backup Engine-ws.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-ws.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\nd. Since the Engine-ws.ear file has been deployed in the WebSphere's installedApps path, the Bootstrap file need to be copied to the path manually. Extract the props.jar file from the ear file by utility such as Winzip, copy the props.jar file to theinstalledApps location - \u201c<WebSphere Home>\\ AppServer\\ profiles \\ <profile name> \\ InstalledApps \\<serverNodecell> \\ FileNetEngine.ear \\ APP-INF \\ lib \\\" \n\nNote that an alternative to copying the props.jar file is to uninstall and re-install the updated ear file in WebSphere. \n\n- For WebLogic \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder - \"<WebLogic home> \\ user_projects \\ domains \\ <domain> \\ servers \" \nb. Backup FileNetEngine.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-wl.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\n- For JBoss \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder - \"<JBoss Home> \\ server \\ <server> \\ deploy \\\" \nb. Backup FileNetEngine.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-jb.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\n\n7. Remove cached files in the application server \n- Close FileNet Enterprise Manager (Step 1a) \n- Close Administrative Console (Step 1b) \n- Stop the application server \n- Remove the cached FileNetEngine directory in the application server. \nFor example, the default windows path on Websphere 6.0 is \n\"C:\\program files\\Websphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\<profile name>\\temp\\<server node>\\ \n<server>\\FileNetEngine\" \n\n\n8. Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the new user and password. \n\n\n9. Troubleshooting \n\nIf CE fails to start due to mistakes in the above procedures, you may not be able to redo the change through these procedures because FEM will fail to run. \nIn this case, you can do the following: \n\n- Back out the change made to the GCD database in step 3 by deleting the latest row in the FNGCD table. \n- Back out the change made to the application server in step 4 by redoing the procedure with the previous user. \n- Back out the change made to the BootstrapConfig.properties file's GCD user by using the backup EAR file \n- Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the previous user."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q468","question":"How can I alleviate performance problems with the octigate database?\n\nITCAM-related question: How can I alleviate performance problems with the octigate database?\n","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q469","question":"Help with Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in WebSphere Application Server shipped with WSRR \n\nI need to understand details regarding Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in WebSphere Application Server shipped with WebSphere Service Registry and Repository ( CVE-2011-4343).

See attached Throwable for details.

For example: INSERT INTO tab1 VALUES (X'C3')\n\n * By running the IMPORT or LOAD commands for files which contain character data that is not in the code page of the client machine, so the appropriate code page conversion was not done. To make sure that the the appropriate code page conversion is done when running IMPORT or LOAD, specify the code page of the input file by including the \"codepage=x\" file type modifier (specifying the code page in place of x).\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou can use the HEX function to find out what are the byte values in a character column. \n\nFor example, to find out the byte values in column COL1 in table TAB1, run: \nSELECT HEX(col1) FROM tab1\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUpdate the invalid data with a valid UTF-8 character string. \n\n\nAlternatively, for JCC driver versions that support it you can set the JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 so that instead of throwing an exception the JCC driver returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) in place of a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. \nThe JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder is supported in versions of the JCC driver that come with DB2 LUW 9.5 Fix Pack 8 and later (APAR IC74896), DB2 LUW 9.7 Fix Pack 5 and later (APAR IC74895), and all DB2 LUW releases from DB2 10.1 onwards.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a Java program MyApp.java that executes an SQL query of a database column that contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid string.\nWhen you run:\njava MyApp\nit throws an exception. But when you run:\njava -Ddb2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 MyApp\nit returns the string with any invalid sequence of bytes replaced by the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. \n\nThe Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER often appears like this \n(a diamond with a question mark inside it) : [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21684365&amp;aid=1]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IC78495 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74895]\nAPAR IC74896 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74896]\nMaking the setting for IBM Data Studio [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21612346]\nMaking the setting for IBM Content Collector [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAE9L_4.0.0\/com.ibm.content.collector.doc_kc\/troubleshooting\/ts_afu_java_throws_exception.dita]\nUDF to identify invalid data in a UTF-8 character colum [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21608985]\nHow invalid data can get into a UTF-8 character column [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21412846]\nLOAD command [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc\/doc\/r0008305.html]\nIMPORT command [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc\/doc\/r0008304.html]\nHEX function [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc\/doc\/r0000811.html]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q474","question":"CICS Transaction Server for z\/OS 4.1 and 4.2 End of Service dates\n\nWhen will CICS Transaction Server for z\/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 and V4.2 be withdrawn from support?

Except as noted below, the copies of the MQ jar files should match the versions listed on this page [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089]. Any copies of the MQ jar files other than those listed below might represent a problem: \n\n\n 1. WebSphere Application Server V8.5.5, V8.5 and V8.0\n 2. \n 3. \n\n\n\n 1. WebSphere Application Server V7.0\n 2. \n 3. \n 4. \n 5. \n 6. If you created a WebSphere Application Server V7.0 profile before applying fix pack 7.0.0.1 or later, you must update the profile to use the correct MQ Resource Adapter path [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAW57_7.0.0\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/tmj_wmqra_restoredefault.html]. Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.\n\n\n 1.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and\/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

The preferred technique for thwarting guesses at Session IDs is the generation of unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 approved random number generator. However, it is recognized that available DBMS products do not all implement the preferred technique yet may have other protections against session hijacking. Therefore, other techniques are acceptable, provided they are demonstrated to be effective. \"\n\nA: No because DB2 does not use session ids for authentication and thus not vulnerable to the attack described above.

As of DB2\u00ae Universal Database\u2122 (DB2 UDB) Version 8 fixpak 7 (equivalent to DB2 UDB Version 8.2), DB2 is using ICC on most platforms.\n\nCustomers who need to operate in an environment that is compliant with FIPS 140-2 federal standard should take into account the releases of ICC that are shipped by DB2 on different platforms and the compliance status of those releases with FIPS 140.2.\n\nFollowing is a list of platforms on which DB2 is using ICC for encryption of data flowing between clients and servers:\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 7 through DB2 Fixpak 11: \nICC Version 1.2.2 on platforms:\nAIX 32 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 32 bit\nICC Version 1.2.1 on platforms: \nAIX 64 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 64 bit\nHP-UX IA64\nLinux x86, Linux x86-64, Linux IA64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and IA64\nSolaris SPARC 64 bit\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms:\nSolaris x86-64 (DB2 V8.2 GA)\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 12 and later: \nICC Version 1.4.1 on platforms \nAIX\nHP-UX PA-RISC\nLinux x86 and x86-64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and x86-64\nSolaris SPARC\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms \nHP-UX IA64\nLinux IA64\nWindows IA64\n\nSummary of known problems encountered in ICC 1.2.1\/1.2.2:\nThere are a number of issues with DB2 and the ICC encryption libraries at levels prior to 1.3.9. The known problems are: \n\n\n 1. Severe performance problems where processes seem to hang, or take several minutes to run. \n 2. A bug in ICC code causes it to communicate with the OpenSSL EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) which under certain circumstances could hang \n 3.

For example: \n\n * The first user accessing a RTS \/ DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. \n * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. \nThe network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments.

What are IBM recommendations regarding SLF4J and Logback? \n\nIn general, we recommend that customers use JUL when possible\/practical (as mentioned in The Support Authority: A developer's guide to WebSphere Application Server logging [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/websphere\/techjournal\/0802_supauth\/0802_supauth.html]). JUL provides a good, ubiquitous logging infrastructure, which is suitable for most applications, and integrates with WebSphere Application Server log and trace. Using JUL directly also avoids extra log\/trace API \"hops\" that are introduced by using other log\/trace frameworks that map to JUL. The WAS logs are generated using JUL Handlers connected to the root JUL Logger.\n\nIn case you don't want to use JUL, or you have code that is already instrumented with another logging package, SLF4J or Logback can be helpful. For example, you may have code already written with Log4J. Log4J log\/trace is not routed to WAS log\/trace files, and Log4J loggers don't show up in the WAS tree of loggers you can control from the admin console. Further, trace spec settings you make in WAS do not control Log4J logger settings. This is where SLF4J or Logback can come in handy, as you can use them to intercept Log4J calls and forward them to the logging implementation of your choice. In order to integrate well with WAS logs\/trace, we would recommend you bind your SLF4J\/Logback API to map your log\/trace content to JUL -- this will give you the ability to see your logs\/trace in the WAS log\/trace files, and enable you to have easy admin console control over all of your loggers.\n\n3. How can I get WAS logs to go to syslog or the Windows EventLog?\n\nThere are a number of places that users have asked to be able to direct logs to in the past. Most notably, a number of customers have asked for the ability to send logs to syslog.\n\nWebSphere Application Server sends all of its logs to java.util.logging (JUL), and customers can customize what happens to the log\/trace events by way of using JUL Handlers. Once content is sent to JUL, it can be handled in a variety of flexible ways:\n\n1) By default, we store the content in our log files, such as SystemOut.log, trace.log, or the newer log and trace repositories of the High Performance Extensible Logging framework we added in WebSphere Application Server V8.0. We also send the log content over JMX notifications, which allows for remote access.\n\n2) If customers want to send content to places like SMTP, syslog, event log, or a few other places, they can use SLF4J to route WAS logs to Log4J, and use the corresponding Log4J Appenders. In this configuration, WAS logging routes to java.util.logging, SLF4J's Handler routes the request to Log4J, and Log4J can be configured to write log records to a syslog Appender. \n\n3) If users want to do something even more custom, they can write their own JUL Handlers and plug them into WebSphere Application Server. \n\n4. I am unable to turn on WebSphere Application Server trace. The trace state sets to *=off?\n\nThe systemOut.log shows: \n\n\n\n[5\/26\/15 14:10:44:746 EDT] 000000d9 ManagerAdmin I TRAS0018I: The trace state has changed. The new trace state is *=off. \nThe problem is related to the below two JVM arguments: \n\n-Djava.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=TRUE\n-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<path>\/logging.properties \nVerify if the above 2 JVM arguments are configured. If yes, temporary disable it so WAS trace can be enabled. \n\n5. The WebSphere Application Server logging has stopped, what may have caused this? \n\nThe user might have disabled the trace by setting trace output to none. \n\nSetting runtime trace output to none impacts the JVM logs. To do that, the runtime trace spec will be set to *=off, which means to turn off all log levels. If customers just want to disable the trace for debug information only, we recommend setting the runtime trace spec, accordingly, instead of setting runtime trace output to none. For example, set to *=info, which is the default. \n\nVerify if the commons-logging.jar and commons-logging.properties exist in the JVM classpath. If yes, suggest to remove it and put them inside the application (with parent_last setting) or put them in the isolated shared library. \n\n6. How can I separate my logs into separate files for each application? \n\nIn WAS V8.5, we added the application name to log and trace records stored using HPEL (High Performance Extensible Logging). Since HPEL lets you format and filter your log content after it has been persisted to the HPEL log\/trace repository, this lets you decide if you want to see your application content on its own (helpful for uncluttered debug of an application), or together with the application server log\/trace content (helpful to see impact of server on applications, and vice versa). \n\nFor example, if you had 3 applications called app1, app2, and app3, you could create app specific logs as follows: WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app1 > app1.log\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app2 > app2.log\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app3 > app3.log \nor see everything in one file as follows: \n\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer > all.log \n7. How can I add my own java.util.logging.Handler to WAS? \n\nTo create a Handler you need to extend the java.util.logging.Handler class as follows (this example also shows how to filter for only the most severe messages): \n\nimport java.util.logging.Handler;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.LogRecord;\npublic class MyHandler extends Handler {\npublic void close() {\n}\npublic void flush() {\n}\npublic void publish(LogRecord record) {\nif (record.getLevel().intValue() >= Level.SEVERE.intValue()) {\n\/\/ do something...\n}\n}\n}\nIn your application you can add that Handler to the root logger as follows:\nimport java.util.logging.Handler;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n...\nHandler myHandler = new MyHandler();\nLogger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"\");\nlogger.addHandler(myHandler);\n... \n8. Why can't I set my own log levels using the Logger setLevel method? \n\nThe application server can run in two modes. \n\nBy default, the logger levels are managed, and we expect any changes to logger levels to be done only through wsadmin or through the admin console. When the trace spec update is applied, we explicitly set each logger to the level specified in the trace spec -- we do not leave any named loggers at level set to null. So, while you can change a logger's level using the setLevel method, that change only lasts until you apply your next trace spec update from wsadmin or the admin console. Basically, changes you make via logger.setLevel are temporary at best, and do not apply automatically to children since the children won't have a null level. \n\nAlternately, you can have the server to be configured by the JRE's logging.properties file by setting the java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile property. In this mode, the application server will not touch the logger levels -- you cannot update the levels through the admin console, nor through wsadmin. See Java virtual machine custom properties [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=matt&product=was-base-dist&topic=xrun_jvm] for more information on this setting. In this mode, you can specify anything you would normally specify in your logging.properties file. Be careful not to use a console handler though, as that will lead to an infinite loop, since we take data sent to System.out, turn it into LogRecords, and send it to the root logger. \n9. How can I get java.util.logging to initialize from a jre\/bin\/logging.properties file in the application server? \n\nYou can do this via system property: java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=true\n\nNote that if you do set up your server in this mode, we will not manage your logger levels via the admin console.\n\nNote also that we will ignore any console handler entries found in the logging.properties file, since we route System.out to the root logger, which would mean that a console handler would cause an infinite recursion. \n\nIf you do use this system property, and you want to change logger levels, you have two choices:\n\n\n * \n * 2) Set the Logger levels programatically using the Logger.setLevel method\n   \n\n10. How can I get the full logger name from log and trace records? \n\nThe full logger name can be handy to know for enabling trace. How you get to it depends on what log and trace mode you use: \n\nBasic log and trace mode: \n\nThe basic log format (not to be confused with basic log and trace mode), which is the default format for SystemOut.log \/ SystemErr.log \/ trace.log has a truncated version of the logger name: \n\n[4\/14\/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857 \nThere is no way to get the full logger name from basic formatted logs. You need to switch to advanced format for your logs\/trace if you want to see the full logger name. Once in advanced format, log contents appear as follows: \n\n[4\/14\/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]\nhello fine 54857 \nHPEL log and trace mode: \n\nYou can use the HPEL LogViewer command line tool to output the log\/trace content in either basic or advanced format. \n\n> logviewer -format basic \n\n....\n[4\/14\/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857\n.... \n> logviewer -format advanced \n\n....\n[4\/14\/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]\nhello fine 54857\n... \n11. How can I write HPEL content to a database? \n\nIf you want to write to a Database, any of the following options will work: \n\n1) Write your own log handler (that writes to a database) and plug it into JSR47. (see the Java doc for java.util.logging.Handler) \n\n2) Write an HPEL reading Java application to read the content from an HPEL log repository and write it to a database \n\n3) Write an HPEL reading Java application to read the content from an HPEL log repository and write it out in .csv format, then just use the common database commands to load the .csv content into the database. \n\n12. How do you tune HPEL for optimal performance in tWAS? \n\nIn the server.xml, jvmEntries element: \n- Ensure debugMode is set to false \n- Ensure RAS JMX notifications are disabled by including -Dcom.ibm.ejs.ras.disablerasnotifications=true in genericJvmArguments \n- Ensure -Xquickstart is not in the list of genericJvmArguments \n\n<jvmEntries xmi:id=\"JavaVirtualMachine_1183122130078\" verboseModeClass=\"false\" verboseModeGarbageCollection=\"false\" verboseModeJNI=\"false\" runHProf=\"false\" hprofArguments=\"\" debugMode=\"false\" debugArgs=\"-Dcom.ibm.ws.classloader.j9enabled=true -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=7777\" genericJvmArguments=\"-Dcom.ibm.ejs.ras.disablerasnotifications=true\"> \nIn hpelModel.xml: \n- Ensure textLog is disabled. \n\n<hpelTextLog xmi:id=\"HPELTextLog_1\" enabled=\"false\" dataDirectory=\"${SERVER_LOG_ROOT}\"\/> \n13. How can I tell who is writing to System.err \/ System.out ? \n\nAdd the following to your genericJvmArgument s : \n\n-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{com\/ibm\/ejs\/ras\/System*.*,jstacktrace} \n14. How can I identify what code is writing to System.out.println? \n\nAdd the following to your genericJvmArguments and restart the server to see a stack trace for each call to System.out.println: \n\n-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{java\/io\/PrintStream.println,jstacktrace} \nA snippet of the stack trace for a sample application, which calls System.out.println(), with the above JVM argument set, which identifies that the Hello.printHello (Hello.java:15) writes to System.out. \n\n03:41:01.245*0x3277900 mt.0 > java\/io\/PrintStream.println(Ljava\/lang\/String;)V Bytecode method, This = 7fffff49f98\n03:41:01.247 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.0 - jstacktrace:\n03:41:01.248 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [1] java.io.PrintStream.println (PrintStream.java:829)\n03:41:01.248 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [2] com.ibm.jvm.io.ConsolePrintStream.println (ConsolePrintStream.java:311)\n03:41:01.250 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [3] Hello.printHello (Hello.java:15)\n03:41:01.251 0x3277900 j9trc_aux.1 - [4] Hello.main (Hello.java:9)Hello World\n03:41:01.253 0x3277900 mt.6 < java\/io\/PrintStream.println(Ljava\/lang\/String;)V Bytecode method \n15. How can I see who called a particular method? \n\nAdd the following to your genericJvmArguments: \n\n-Xtrace:print=mt,trigger=method{java\/util\/logging\/Logger.setLevel,jstacktrace} \n16. What are the .owner files for in the log directory? \n\nThe server creates a .owner file for each of the log files. The file content indicates which cell\/node\/server is the rightful user of the similarly named log file. This is used as a sort of locking mechanism to make sure that users don't improperly configure their systems. If two or more servers are configured to use the same log directory and file name, we can detect it using the .owner file and we will print a warning in the log file. \n\nFor more information, see Java virtual machine (JVM) log settings [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=JVMLogs_description] \n\n17. How can I correlate information from thread stacks in the javacore with information in my SystemOut.log file? \n\nThere are a few ways to correlate content in WAS logs\/trace with content in javacore thread dumps: \n\nBest option, if you are using WebSphere Application Server 8.0 \/ 8.5: \n\nApplies to: \nWAS 8.0.0.4 and above running with Java 626 SR4 and above \nWAS 8.5.0.2 and above running with Java 7 SR3 and above or Java 626 SR4 and above \n\nIn recent releases, we have made it possible to have the thread id used in the WebSphere Application Server log\/trace match with the thread id used in javacores. In WAS 8.0.0.4 and above, you can use a system property to make the thread id in the logs\/trace match the Java thread id. In WAS 8.5.0.2 and above, the thread id used in the logs\/trace matches with the Java thread id by default. For more information, see PM60913: Introduce ability to use Java Thread ID in Logs instead of LogRecord Thread ID [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM60913] and JVM log interpretation [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=rtrb_readmsglogs] \n\nAnother option if you are using High Performance Extensible Logging (HPEL) \/ Binary Logging: \n\nApplies to: \nFull profile WAS 8.0.0.0 and above \nLiberty profile WAS 8.5.5.0 and above \n\nFull Profile: \nUse the HPEL logViewer command to output the logs in advanced format so you can see the full thread name: \n> logViewer -format advanced (basic is the default format) \n\nLiberty Profile: \nUse the binaryLog command line tool to output the logs in advanced format so you can see the full thread name: \n> binaryLog view --format=advanced \n\nYou will get output that looks like the following: \n\n[4\/14\/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4] \nThe javacore contains the same thread name: \n\n3XMTHREADINFO \"WebContainer : 4\" J9VMThread:0x1578D700, j9thread_t:0x150D0D04, java\/lang\/Thread:0x02517CE0, state:R, prio=5\n3XMTHREADINFO1 (native thread ID:0x15B0, native priority:0x5, native policy:UNKNOWN)\n3XMTHREADINFO3 Java callstack:\n4XESTACKTRACE at com\/ibm\/io\/async\/AsyncLibrary.aio_getioev2(Native Method) \nAnother option if you are using Advanced format for your SystemOut.log \/ trace.log: \n\nApplies to: \nAll currently supported WebSphere Application Server releases. \n\nChange your log\/trace format to Advanced.

The value is dynamically changed by the plug-in during runtime. The \"weight\" of a server (or clone) is lowered each time a request is assigned to that clone. When all weights for all servers drop to 0 or below, the plug-in has to readjust all of the weights so that they are above 0. Using a starting value of only 2 (default), means that the weights will get to 0 very quickly and the plug-in will constantly be readjusting the weights. Therefore, It is recommended to start with a higher LoadBalanceWeight. The IBM WebSphere Application Server administrative console will allow a value up to 20 for this. However, it is certainly possible to manually edit the plugin-cfg.xml file and specify some other value for LoadBalanceWeight that is higher than 20.\n\nNote: At runtime, the LoadBalanceWeight of each appserver in a cluster are normalized by their highest common factor. For example, 100, 90, 80 have a common factor of 10. So, these configured weights would be divided by 10 at runtime, resulting in actual starting weights of only 10, 9, 8. Setting all clones to the same starting LoadBalanceWeight (for example: 20, 20, 20) will result in an actual starting weight of only 1 for each, because of normalization. So, it is recommended to set the weight of at least one of the clones to be off by a value of 1. For example, if there are 3 clones, you might choose the starting LoadBalanceWeights to be: 20, 20, 19. After normalization the weights will be unchanged.\nRecommended values = all clones the same, except one clone off by one (for example: 20, 20, 19)\n\n\nMaxConnections is used to gauge when a server is \"starting to become overwhelmed\". It is not used to determine when to fail-over (mark the server \"down\"). When a request is sent from the plug-in to the WAS appserver, it is called a \"PendingRequest\", until the response comes back. If the application running in WebSphere Application Server is handling requests quickly, each request will only be PENDING for a very short time. So, under ideal conditions, MaxConnections is not needed and therefore the default is (-1) meaning unlimited. However, sometimes an application may start to become overwhelmed and the application may not be able to handle the requests as quickly. Consequently Pending Requests start to build up. MaxConnections can be used to put a limit on the number of PENDING requests per server. When the MaxConnections limit is reached, the plug-in will stop sending requests to that appserver, but it is not marked down. The optimal value for MaxConnections will depend on how quickly the application and appserver respond to each request. If normal responses are returned in less than one second, it may be appropriate to set a low value for MaxConnections, like 20 or so. However, if it normally takes several seconds to get a response from the application, then it would be prudent to use a higher value for MaxConnections, like 100. Please note that if the MaxConnections limit has been reached the plug-in will not send ANY more requests to that server until responses come back for the current PENDING requests, and the pendingRequests count drops back down below the MaxConnections limit.\nRecommended value = 20 - 100 depending on application response times\n\n*Best Practices: with MaxConnections=\"-1\" use LogLevel=\"Stats\" to monitor the pendingRequests numbers in the plug-in log, under normal conditions. Then, choose a value for MaxConnections that is significantly higher than the highest number shown in the log. This method will help you to determine a MaxConnections value that is right for your specific environment.\n\n\nConnectTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait when trying to open a socket to the Application Server\"? If there are streams already open and available to the Application Server, the plug-in will use one of those. However, sometimes the plug-in needs to open a new stream to the Application Server. That should not take very long, so the value for ConnectTimeout should be very small. A ConnectTimeout value of 0 means never time-out. In that case, the time-out is left up to the OS TCP layer, which is NOT ideal. It is much better to specify a small positive number (like 5 seconds).\nRecommended value = 5\n\n\nServerIOTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait for a response from the application\". After the socket is opened, the plug-in sends the request to the Application Server. The application processes the request and a response is sent back to the client, through the plug-in. How long should that take? What is reasonable, based on the application? There is no single correct answer here. It depends on the application. If the application is very quick to respond, then you can use a lower value for ServerIOTimeout. However, if the application requires more time to process the request (maybe to retrieve data from a database), then you should use a higher number for ServerIOTimeout. Using a value of 0 means that the plug-in will NOT time-out the request. This is often NOT ideal. A positive value means that the plug-in will NOT mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to continue sending requests to the timed-out appserver, use a positive value. On the other hand, a negative value means that the plug-in WILL mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to immediately mark the appserver down and fail-over to another appserver in the same cluster, use a negative value.\nRecommended value = -900 (that is negative 900)\n\nNote: The ability to use a negative ServerIOTimeout value was introduced in plug-in apar PK72097 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK72097].\n\n*Best Practices: use traces to determine the amount of time it takes for your application to respond to requests under normal conditions. Be sure to include the longest running requests that take the most time to respond. Then choose a value for ServerIOTimeout that is much larger (2X or 3X or more) than the longest response time. This method will ensure that your ServerIOTimeout is high enough to allow adequate time for the application to respond normally. Make it a negative value so that if the ServerIOTimeout pops, the plug-in will immediately mark the server down, and retry the request to a different appserver.\n\n\nServerIOTimeoutRetry can be used to decrease the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout has fired. By default, the Plug-in will try a request equal to the number of members in the cluster. For example, if the cluster has four members, and there is a ServerIOTimeout, the Plug-in will try it a second time. If the retry fails with ServerIOTimeout fired, then it will try a third time, and a fourth time if needed. But after four attempts, the Plug-in will give up and stop retrying. If you want to override this default behavior and reduce the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout, you can set ServerIOTimeoutRetry to a value that is less than the number of members in the cluster.\nRecommended value = -1 (this is the default)\n\nNote: This property was introduced by Plug-in apar PM70559 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559].\n\n\nRetryInterval is the time that the plug-in will wait before trying again to use an appserver that was marked down. The optimal value for RetryInterval depends on the number of appservers in the cluster, and the value used for ServerIOTimeout. You can use the following formula to determine the maximum RetryInterval value for your plug-in config:\n\n(number of appservers in cluster - 1) x (absolute ServerIOTimeout) - 1\n\nFor example, if there are two appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(2 - 1) x (900) - 1 = 899 seconds or less\n\nAnother example, if there are four appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(4 - 1) x (900) -1 = 2699 seconds or less\n\nWarning: Setting RetryInterval to a value higher than the recommended maximum, based on the formula above, can lead to an undesirable situation where all of the appservers in the cluster may be marked down simultaneously resulting in all requests temporarily failing.\nRecommended value = 60 (this is the default)\n\n\nAffinity requests are requests that contain a session cookie (ie. JSESSIONID). The session cookie is set by the Session Manager in WAS to ensure that all subsequent requests from the same client return to the same app server in the cluster. The session cookie contains the clone ID (or partition ID) of that specific app server. The web server Plug-in will look for the session cookie and use the clone ID to send the request to that specific WAS app server. An affinity request is not load balanced.\n\nIn the plug-in config there is a property called IgnoreAffinityRequests. This property determines if affinity requests will affect the load balance weights, or not. The default value for IgnoreAffinityRequests is True, which means that affinity requests will not have any affect on the load balance weights. This is best for environments where there are no, or few, affinity requests. On the other hand, for an environment with a lot of affinity requests, it may be better to set IgnoreAffinityRequests to False so that the load balance weights will accurately reflect the effect of having a lot of affinity requests.\n\n\nFail-over occurs when the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver (or clone) as \"down\", and then sends the pending requests to other members of the same cluster. This can happen if the plug-in is unable to open a new connection to the appserver within the ConnectTimeout. Or fail-over can happen if the plug-in has already sent the request to the appserver, but does not receive a response from the application within ServerIOTimeout. When the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver \"down\", it will handle the PENDING requests in one of two ways: Prior to plug-in apar PM12112 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in would send all of the pending requests to the very next appserver in the cluster. However, after plug-in apar PM12112 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in will randomly send the pending requests to any of the available appservers in the cluster. While the appserver is marked \"down\" the plug-in will no longer send any requests to it. After RetryInterval the plug-in will check to see if that appserver can be used successfully again. If so, the \"down\" flag will be removed and the appserver will be used again.\n\nNote: By default, the number of attempts to handle a request is limited by the number of appservers in the cluster. For example, if there are only two appservers in the cluster, and the request fails once, the plug-in will only attempt that request one more time (total of two attempts). Or another example, if there are five appservers in the same cluster, and the request fails once, then the plug-in will attempt to retry that same request up to four more times (total of five attempts). That number includes retries sent to the same appserver (session affinity), or attempts sent to different appservers (fail-over).\n\nUpdate: The plug-in apar PM70559 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559] introduced a new setting called \"ServerIOTimeoutRetry\" that can be used to control the number of retries due to ServerIOTimeout.\n\n\nIf Memory-to-Memory (M2M) session replication is enabled in WebSphere Application Server, then the GetDWLMTable setting in the plug-in config must be changed to \"true\". Memory-to-Memory replication uses partition IDs rather than clone IDs. This can lead to broken session affinity if GetDWLMTable is set to false (which is the default). So it is very important to set GetDWLMTable=\"true\" whenever using M2M in WebSphere Application Server.\nRecommendation = GetDWLMTable=\"true\" whenever M2M is used in WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\nEach web server child process loads a separate instance of the web server plug-in. And multiple running instances of the web server plug-in do not share information with each other. For example if the IBM HTTP Server web server is configured to start 3 child processes (StartServers 3), then there will be 3 instances of the web server plug-in running (one for each IBM HTTP Server child process). The dynamically changing LoadBalanceWeight of each cluster member is not shared between the plug-in instances. So, in one instance of the plug-in \"member1\" might be considered UP with a weight of 5, when in another instance of the plug-in \"member1\" might be considered DOWN and unusable. This can result in possibly different behaviors depending on which child process \/ plug-in instance handles each incoming request. For this reason it is recommended that you should configure the web server to use only a few web server child processes with many threads on each. See Tuning IBM HTTP Server to maximize the number of client connections to WebSphere Application Server [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21167658].\n\nIf you choose to use more than one web server child process, keep in mind that the plug-in settings are handled on a per instance basis. For example, MaxConnections means the number of pending requests that will be allowed on that server, for each plug-in instance. If MaxConnections = 20, and there are 3 web server child processes (3 plug-in instances), then each instance will allow 20 pending connections to that Application Server for a total of 60 pending connections.\n\n\nRelated information\n[http:\/\/g01zciwas003.ahe.pok.ibm.com\/support\/dcf\/preview.wss?host=g01zcidbs003.ahe.pok.ibm.com&db=support\/swg\/swgtech.nsf&unid=E3B7487DDFB64D2C852574C00071DA95&taxOC=SSCC2GP&MD=2011\/05\/11%2011:05:12&sid=#]Understanding plug-in Load Balancing [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219567]\nUnderstanding plug-in Fail-over [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219808]\nTuning IBM HTTP Server processes and threads [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21167658]\nweb server plug-in configuration [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21450051]\nModifying plug-in properties from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21460889]\nHow do the properties ServerIOTimeout and PostBufferSize affect plug-in behavior?

The list of menu options will now include 'Library'.\n(6) Select the 'Library' menu option.\n(7) Open the 'Preferences' folder.\n(8) Rename the com.ibm.spss.plist object to old_com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n\n- Another option is to use the Terminal application and do the following:\nrm -fR ~\/Library\/Preferences\/com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n \n\nFinish and test your changes by doing the following: \n\n(9) Launch Statistics\n(10) Work with the program a bit.\n(11) Close the software (It should be quicker, do not force quit)\n(12) Re-launch Statistics\n(13) Work with the program a bit.\n(14) Close the software (do not force quit)\n(15) Launch the software \n\n\nNOTE: When you launch Statistics for the first time, it will take a little longer than subsequent launches, until you reboot your computer again. This is related to Java initialization routines. \n\n\n- FYI: Additionally, if you are using Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.x, you need to stop the process that protects this file and restores it (it is deleted):\n\nSince OSX 10.9.x Mavericks a cached copy of your \"plist\" file is stored that uses a background process: CFPREFSD\nDeleting the \"plist\" file and restarting SPSS Statistics does not create a new copy of these files.\nRather, Mavericks restore its cached copy. \nOnly by stopping the \"cfprefsd\" process and starting SPSS Statistics, will it generate a new \"plist\" preference file and default toolbar.\n\nWhen you go to Finder - Applications - Utilities and open Activity Monitor on the 10.9.x computer you see that there is a CFPREFSD process visible for root user and for the current logged in user.\nYou need to stop the CFPREFSD process for the current user. Do so in the Terminal application by running the following command:\n\nkillall -u {CURRENT_USER} cfprefsd\n\nWhere {CURRENT_USER} is replaced with the person's user ID. One can get the user ID by typing \"whoami\" at a Terminal prompt. \n\nShould removing these files and running the program does not resolve the issue, you might need to remove all of them and reinstall the program.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

If you attempt to check the database integrity for issue the module is not flagged for any problems. \n\nThe full error message is as follows:\n\nDOORS report\nUnable to open module '\/A Project\/Requirements' No such file or directory\"\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\Rational\\DOORS\\9.5\\data\\v6data\\20\\m00000021.mod\\current.ver\\s1000005.dtc\n\n\nimage \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21511831&aid=1]\n\nCAUSE\n This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM50525 [http:\/\/ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM31236].\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThis error indicates that a user session file is corrupted on the database server. \n\nThis defect is resolved in IBM Rational DOORS Version 9.4.0.1 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27036720#9401] \n\n \n\nWORKAROUND: \n\nthe following options can be used to correct this problem: \n\n * Retrieve the missing file from system backup and insert it into the module current.ver directory\n   \n   The advantage of inserting the missing session file is you do not need to restart the database server.\n\nWarning these two option should only be performed by Rational Support. Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair\n\nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nChoosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out \nand shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted \nto replace the existing data file for the module.\n\nCreate a replacement session file \nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nAdjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. \nYour support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.\nNo work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored\nfor the effected module.  \n\n\nNote: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module. For this situation you may need to perform a successive repair to the index file."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q522","question":"Can IBM Content Navigator be installed on Windows and be deployed to an Application Server that is running on a Unix Platform?\n\nCan IBM Content Navigator be installed on Windows and be deployed to an Application Server that is running on a Unix Platform?

In order to run against a V710 queue manager the V710 libraries need to be used by the batch job. \nIn order to connect to a V710 queue manager the application needs to run with a V710 SCSQAUTH. The V710 SCSQAUTH will allow an application to connect to both a V710 or a V701 queue manager. \nThis is documented in the Information Center (section 'z\/OS: Planning for migration from WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1 to WebSphere MQ version 7.

Password must be double quoted.

The default password is blank. \n\nOne will have to edit the HSQLDB DataSource to enable it to connect to the database with the new password. \n\nA) One method is by encrypting the password and editing the HSQLDB DataSource to allow DSA connection. Use nci_crypt to encrypt the password - for example: \n\n * \n * \n * \n\n\nedit the file: \n\n * \n\n\nto alter the property: \n\n * \n\n\nfrom the default value of {aes}9C71E0F544E705326E2B5CBDFC54CE46 to the new encrypted password value - for example: \n\n * \n\n\nThis requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. \n\nB) An alternate method is to edit the DataSource via the normal Impact configuration GUI and provide the new password there. This alternate method has the advantage that one does not need to perform the encryption oneself, nor does one need to manually edit the configuration file and nor does one need to perform an ImpactServer restart to read up the new configuration into the memory resident database that is the ImpactServer."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q538","question":"Is ITCAM Data Collector for WebSphere 7.2.0.0.14 available?\n\nIs ITCAM Data Collector for WebSphere 7.2.0.0.14 available?

IO24880 (IBM Content Navigator users) When adding a document by clicking Add Document Using Entry Template, the repository root folder is automatically selected in the Save in field, and an error message is displayed if the logged in user does not have permission to save the document under the root folder.\nWith this fix, the repository root folder is not automatically selected. IO24883 (IBM Content Manager users) Some TIFF files can not be viewed when using the Content Manager applet viewer.\nWith this fix, the documents can be viewed. IO24884 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) When the results list is displaying the contents of a folder , users can not refresh the results.\nWith this fix, the folder contents can be refreshed. IO24886 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) For Content Manager user, if the name property is a string:ext type, the name does not appear. \nWith this fix, the name property is used for the document title. IO24909 (IBM Content Navigator users) When a multi-line value is first displayed in an entry template property layout text area field, the complete value is not displayed. The text area field does not resize to display the full value until the input focus enters the text area field.\nWith this fix, the text area displays the value as expected. IO24944 (IBM Content Manager users) Navigator does not allow a user to change the class of a document with content to another class if the user does not have permission to add content to the target class. IBM Content Manager does not require the permission to add content to the target class.\nWith this fix, the user can change the class. IO24949 IBM Content Manager OnDemand users) Decimal numbers are not sorted properly when the server is set to a locale that uses a comma to indicate the decimal place, i.e., French.\nWith this fix, decimal numbers are sorted properly. IO24952 (IBM Content Navigator users) In a load balanced environment, if the client IP address for a request changes for an active session, the application executes an invalid DNS look up for each request after the client IP address change which can add a significant delay to the time it takes to process each request.\nWith this fix, the invalid DNS look up is not executed. IO24953 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) When uploading a document, the user can manipulate the upload path and save documents in a restricted folder.\nWith this fix, the user to limited to folders they have permissions for. IO24965 (IBM FileNet P8 users) Sometimes adding the related child document fails.\nWith this fix, the child document provides an error that document import failed. IO24972 (IBM Content Manager users) When using a layout and a dependent property is linked to a foreign key, the dependent property is not displaying the default foreign key values when the parent property value changes.\nWith this fix, the foreign key default choices are updated properly as the user changes the parent property value. IO24973 (IBM Content Navigator users) When using the Paste action from the context menu to paste the password into the Password field, the login button is not enabled. \nWith this fix, the Paste action enables the Add button. IO24985 (IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office users) Users can not install on Windows 10 if .Net 4.6.2 is already installed.\nWith this fix, users can install on Windows 10. PJ44290 (IBM Collaboration Services users) When the document name is renamed with an extension, the first content element is not displayed as expected. Instead the user is prompted to download the content element as a document with the same extension. \nWith this fix, the content is downloaded with the correct extension. PJ44413 (IBM Case Manager users) When using Internet Explorer v11, the carriage return does not start a new line in a text area. \nWith this fix, the new line is created. PJ44420 (IBM CMIS for FileNet users) With CMIS v1.1, the \"query\" and \"unfiled\" links are throwing an error.\nWith this fix, the links do not cause an error."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q541","question":"Cognos Workspace Advanced Users are unable to see features.

In particular, it describes a scenario where performance is poor because of failed semget() calls to the operating system.\n\n\nCAUSE\nDB2\u00ae Universal Database\u2122 (DB2 UDB) has an internal trace facility called \"db2trc\". This trace facility acquires Inter Process Communication (IPC) resources (both semaphore and shared memory). Even though a DB2 trace is not turned on, it may issue semget() calls to the operating system. These calls will fail, though, since no IPC resources were acquired.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe trace facility has an \"alloc\" option that can allocate necessary IPC resources. When you issue db2start, internal functions equivalent to command db2trc alloc are automatically issued, and when you issue db2stop, the trace segment will be removed if no one is using it.\n\nSince a DB2 client does not necessarily have the ability to perform the db2start command, no IPC's will be automatically allocated for the trace facility, and hence the problem.\n\nThe solution is to issue the following command at the DB2 client:\n\ndb2trc alloc\n\nThis will then create the necessary IPC resources, and prevent the semget() calls from failing (since the semget() call now has IPC resources that it can use). The potential performance problem will thus be avoided.\n\nThe failed semget() operations are more of a concern for Solaris Operating Environment, Linux\u00ae, HP-UX and AIX\u00ae operating systems, in terms of performance implications. Windows\u00ae will not have this problem due to its specific architecture.\n\nThe db2trc alloc command should be invoked every time the client is restarted, and therefore it is recommended to add this command to a startup script.\n\nNote: To determine if the application is issuing semget() calls, the best course of action would be to take a \"truss\". Please read your operating system manuals on how to perform and read a truss.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n IC85712 (AIX) [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?crawler=1&uid=swg1IC85712]\nFP5: db2trc command has been improved for clients (Linu [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/db2luw\/v9r7\/topic\/com.ibm.db2.luw.wn.doc\/doc\/c0059466.html]\nv10.5 IT17501 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17501]\nv11.1 IT17518 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17518]"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q558","question":"Could UCD import template from ipas?\n\nI am trying to import a template from ipas, UCD seems to be able to retrieve the pattern name after some hints.

Before you can continue working on IBM BPM, you must log out and log in again.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21966881.txt","text":"Title: IBM Business Process Manager users receive errors that session has expired - United States\n\nText:\n TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n If you are using CA Wily Introscope to monitor performance in the same environment with IBM Business Process Manager, you might receive messages that a user session has expired. Before you can continue working on IBM BPM, you must log out and log in again. \n\nCAUSE\nWebSphere Application Server has session security integration enabled by default. Enabling this feature guards against the possibility of session data being hijacked by another user. \nThe Wily Introscope agent might try to access an active user session to monitoring purposes. Because Wily does not have the same authenticated user, the session security integration feature prevents Wily from accessing that user session. \n\nBy having a custom property named InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException set to true, the session manager will invalidate the active user session. This causes the \"session expired\" messages for the IBM BPM user. (The default value for InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException is false.)\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo verify you have this problem, you can turn on tracing for the Web container, the session, security, and IBM BPM using these tracing strings: \n\n\n*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.webcontainer*=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:com.ibm.ws.session.*=all:com.ibm.ws.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:WLE.*=all \n\nYou might see entries in the stack trace similar to the following lines:\n\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.getSession(ServletRequestHelper.java:286)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.get(ServletRequestHelper.java:513)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMapProvider.get(HttpServletLazyMapProvider.java:63)\nat com.wily.util.adt.LazyMap.get(LazyMap.java:182)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMap.putAllParameters(HttpServletLazyMap.java:191)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletTracer.IInvocationDataParameterCallback_addParameters(HttpServletTracer.java:782)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.InvocationData.addParameterCallbacks(InvocationData.java:3486)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.fillComponentParams(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:157)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransanctionSnapShotFromInvocationData(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:235)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransactionSnapshotFromStack(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:75)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallFeatureBase.reportStall(StallFeatureBase.java:50)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.ITimestampedRunnable_execute(StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.java:61)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$BehaviorNode.execute(IntervalHeartbeat.java:972)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.executeNextBehaviorAndCalculateSleepTime(IntervalHeartbeat.java:491)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.access$2(IntervalHeartbeat.java:445)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$HeartbeatRunnable.run(IntervalHeartbeat.java:668)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:784)\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo prevent the sessions from expiring, choose one of the following options: \n\n * Stop the Wily agent. \n * Remove the custom property InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException=true by completing the following steps: 1. Log in to the administrative console. \n   \n   2. Click server_name > Session Manager > Custom properties. \n   \n   3. Select the InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException property, which is set to true, and delete it.\n   The purpose of this setting in BPM default configuration is to \"gracefully\" terminate existing sessions and create new sessions in shared browser scenarios. With this setting removed, you may see temporary exceptions in cases two users share the same browser instance and try to switch identity without closing the browser in between. \n   \n   4. Click Apply and then save the master configuration. \n   \n   5. Restart the servers. \n   \n   \n * Disable specific Wily configurations that reuse the session IDs from existing users.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n CA Technologies: Session killed by agent heartbeat [http:\/\/www.ca.com\/us\/support\/ca-support-online\/product-content\/knowledgebase-articles\/tec1314663.aspx]\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard AIX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express Linux, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n BPM"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q561","question":"I am getting an error when attempting to apply CF09 on Portal 8001 on a secondary cluster node\n\nThe ConfigTrace.log shows the following....\n\n     [wsadmin] com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException:\n     ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName\n     WebSphere:cell=<cellname>,node=<nodename>,server=webserver1 for\n     module ilwwcm-authoring.war+WEB-INF\/web.xml.\n       [wsadmin] ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName\n     WebSphere:cell=<cellname>,node=<nodename>,server=webserver1 for\n     module ilwwcm-authoring.war+WEB-INF\/web.xml.\n","answer":"If using a remote Dmgr, be sure it is started prior to attempting the upgrade. \n\n2.

You want to know what is the problem?\n\n\nCAUSE\nSee the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:\nWebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands\nWebSphere MQ object names [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.1.0\/com.ibm.mq.doc\/fa11060_.htm]\n+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands\nMQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q565","question":"Does ODM 8.5.1 support MQ 9.0?\n\n\n\nDoes ODM 8.5.1 support MQ 9.0 where ODM Rule Execution Server is running on WAS 8.5.0.2 (embedded with ODM)?\n\nNo MQ version is specified in ODM 8.5.1 System Requirements.","answer":"WebSphere MQ V7.0, V7.1, V7.5, V8.0 and V9.0 queue managers and clients inter operate with queue managers and clients from any previous level of the WebSphere MQ or MQSeries products.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21312967.txt","text":"Title: IBM MQ 7.x, MQ 8.0 and MQ 9.0 compatibility with previous versions - including usage of CCDT files, JMS .bindings, SSL\/TLS - United States\n\nText:\ncompatibility; compatible TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Are WebSphere MQ (WMQ) V7.0, V7.1, V7.5 and V8.0 compatible with previous versions?\nCan an MQ 8.0 client use a CCDT created with a previous version?\nCan an MQ 7.0 client use a CCDT created with a newer version?\nCan a JMS .bindings file created in 7.1 be used with 8.0?\nCan a JMS .bindings file created in 8.0 be using with 7.1?\nCan an older MQ client using an old SSL protocol still work with MQ 9.0?\n\n\nANSWER\n\nCompatibility statement:\n\nWebSphere MQ V7.0, V7.1, V7.5, V8.0 and V9.0 queue managers and clients inter operate with queue managers and clients from any previous level of the WebSphere MQ or MQSeries products.\n\nThis means that ... \n\n *  A 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 client can connect to all queue managers, non-version 7, as well as version 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 \n *  A 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 queue manager can interact with all clients, non-version 7, as well as version 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0\n\n\nNote: If your V7.x, V8.0 or V9.0 client connects to an MQ 6.0 or earlier queue manager, or use a server-connection channel with the attribute SHARECNV = 0 (which treats the connection as being MQ 6.0), then you cannot use V7 features, and structures in your client application. \n\n\nMQ Client V6 and V7\/V8\/V9 compatibility \n\nThe new features which are available for a version 7.x, 8.0 or 9.0 client connected to a version 6.0 queue manager are: \n- Weighted selection on CLNTCONN channels. \n- Reconnecting via a previously used channel. \n- Maximum message length increased on MQSERVER environment variable. \n\nThe new feature which is available for a version 6.0 client connected to a version 7.x, 8.0 or 9.0 queue manager is: \n- Instance limits on SVRCONN channels. \n\n\nCaveat \n\nThe compatibility statement refers to: \nVersion.Release \n\n... such as: \nA 7.0 client is compatible with a 7.5 queue manager. \n\nThis statement does not extend to a more granular specification: \nVersion.Release.Maintenance.FixPack (V.R.M.F) \n\nIf there are known problems at a given V.R.M.F (such as 7.0.0.0), then an upgrade to a more recent fix pack for the same Version.Release will be necessary (such as 7.0.1.11). Notice that the upgrade is within the same Version.Release (7.0) and a migration to a newer Version.Release is not forced. \n\n\n+ Compatibility of MQ clients and CCDT files \n\nNewer versions of the MQ clients (such as 8.0) know how to handle CCDT files that were created\/edited by older queue managers (such as 6.0) \n\nOlder MQ clients (such as 6.0) do NOT know how to handle CCDT files that were created\/edited by newer queue managers (such as 8.0). That is, older clients do not know what are the new attributes (if any) introduced in newer MQ versions. \n\nBased on the above, if you have a mix of versions of MQ clients that use a common CCDT file, then this CCDT file should be edited from a queue manager at the LOWEST (OLDEST) version. For example, if you are using MQ 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 clients that use a CCDT file, then the CCDT file must be maintained by the MQ queue manager at version 6.0 \n- However, the newer MQ clients (8.0) when using the CCDT created with 5.3 will NOT be able to fully exploit newer features, even when connecting to an 8.0 queue manager because the CCDT will not show the new attributes for those new features. \n\nMQ CCDT created version Compatible MQ client versions \n\n6.0 6.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.1 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.5 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n8.0 8.0 9.0 \n9.0 8.0 9.0 \n\nNotes: \n- There was no change in the MQCD length between 7.1 and 7.5. Therefore the CCDT created on 7.5 can be used on 7.1. \n- There was no change in the MQCD length between 8.0 and 9.0. Therefore the CCDT created on 9.0 can be used on 8.0. \n- Unless documented otherwise, CCDTs created on higher level maintenance releases (for example 8.0.0.3) are compatible with lower level (for this example: 8.0.0.0) MQ clients running the same MQ version and release. \n\nUpdate on July 2016: \nThere are 2 APARs that allow OLDER MQ clients to use NEWER CCDT files! \nThese APARs relax the restriction by allowing newer CCDTs to be used on older clients but with the caveat that the older client cannot make use of any of the newer channel attributes. These attributes will assume their default values when the CCDT is negotiated with the queue manager. \n. \nFor Java\/JMS client applications: \nIT10863: WEBSPHERE MQ CLASSES FOR JAVA\/JMS APPLICATIONS CAN NOT USE CCDT FILES GENERATED ON A NEWER LEVEL QUEUE MANAGER [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT10863] \nVersion Maintenance Level \nv7.0 7.0.1.14 \nv7.1 7.1.0.8 \nv7.5 7.5.0.6 \nv8.0 8.0.0.3 \n\nFor C based (and non-Java\/JMS) client applications: \nIT11547: WEBSPHERE MQ CLIENT APPLICATIONS CANNOT USE CCDT FILES GENERATED ON A NEWER LEVEL QUEUE MANAGER [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT11547]. \nThis applies to C based and non-Java\/JMS applications. \nVersion Maintenance Level \nv7.1 7.1.0.8 \nv7.5 7.5.0.7 \nv8.0 8.0.0.3 \n\n\n+ Compatibility of MQ clients and JMS .bindings files \n\n- A JMS .bindings file that was created at an older version (such as 7.1) than the MQ JMS client (such as 8.0) will be used without version related errors by the client. \n\n- A JMS .bindings file that was created at a newer version (such as 8.0) than the MQ JMS client (such as 7.1), will be used without version related errors by the client. If there are any new attributes in the JMS administered objects that the older client cannot read, they are ignored. \n\n\n+ Compatibility of SSL\/TLS cipher specifications \n\nThere have been changes in recent fix packs related to the compatibility of SSL\/TLS cipher specifications. For example, if you have a MQ Client at 7.1.0.1 connecting to a MQ 8.0.0.1 queue manager using an older SSL cipher specification, after applying Fix Pack MQ 8.0.0.2 to the queue manager, the connectivity may be broken because the queue manager indicates that the older SSL cipher spec is now deprecated. \n\nFor more details on the compatibility of SSL\/TLS cipher specifications, see the following blog entry: \n\nSSL and TLS Cipher Specification Deprecations for the MQ Product [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/blogs\/aimsupport\/entry\/ssl_and_tls_cipher_specification_deprecations_for_the_mq_product?lang=en] \nMiguel A. Rodriguez \nMay 2016 \nDue to the recent security vulnerabilities (for example, POODLE Attack), the latest MQ product Fix Packs come with stricter, default security requirements that affect the use of the compromised Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Weak Transport Level Security (TLS) Cipher Specifications. Since these Cipher Specification deprecations are disabled in MQ Fix Packs by default, review the article for the changes separated by MQ versions and Fix Pack levels.

It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/prodguid\/v1r0\/clarity\/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. \n\nA) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. \n\nNOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). \nThe top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. \nThe official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. \n\n \n\nB) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] \n\nNo older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. \n\n \n\nC) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. \n\nFull documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. \n\n \n\nAlso, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] \n\n \n\nD) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n \n\nNote: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22. Please see http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572] for download. \n\n**** \n\nF) Apple Macintosh OSX Mountain Lion (10.8) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n**** \n\nG) Apple Macintosh OSX Lion (10.7) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nH) Apple Macintosh OSX Snow Leopard (10.6) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nOlder SPSS Statistics releases 18 and 19 and 20: \n\nPlease note that SPSS Statistics releases 18, 19 and 20 are no longer supported by IBM.

As a result, the white spaces end up disappearing and the bars blend into each other. This can be seen by looking at the scanned image at high magnification. The barcode must meet the specifications after accounting for this.\n\nANSWER\nTo optimize barcode recognition: \n\n * The width of the thinnest bar (called the X-dimension) must be at least one pixel, and two pixels are recommended for best results. At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch.

The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1\/5 inch. \n * Scanning can sometimes introduce white or black stripes on the image running in the scanning direction, typically vertical stripes if the paper is scanned in Portrait orientation. Bar codes printed in normal horizontal orientation cannot be read reliably when this occurs. It is advisable to print barcodes perpendicular to the direction of scanning. If the barcode must be printed horizontally on a page, scanning in landscape orientation will make the barcode more robust in the presence of common scanner issues. \n * By default, Datacap only accepts barcode images with 71% confidence or higher. To modify it to accept low confidence barcodes also, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * SetMinimumConfidenceBP(1) - This is equivalent to 11% confidence. Each increment increases the required confidence 10% and higher values can be used if false barcodes are detected. A value of 4 is usually sufficient for this purpose.\n   \n   \n * Barcode recognition has an internal barcode enhancement capability. To maintain high performance, this feature is turned off by default. If low quality barcodes are being received, it may be desired to turn on barcode enhancement, despite the performance hit. To do this, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * rrSet(1,@P.bp_enhance)\n   \n   \n * Performing Datacap's regular image enhancement (ImageFix) prior to running any barcode recognition action is not recommended. ImageFix is designed to optimize text recognition and can actually degrade the barcode. There are some rare exceptions, and if it is necessary to use image enhancement prior to barcode recognition, pay close attention to the configuration settings, especially vertical line removal and despeckle. To ensure image processing is not interfering with barcode recognition, test with the ImageFix() action removed.\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Enterprise Content Management Datacap Taskmaster Capture Not Applicable 8.1.0"}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q586","question":"How to enable the snippet results cache in the Netezza Platform Software releases?\n\nHow to enable the snippet results cache in the Netezza Platform Software releases?

Review this topic to learn how to enable the feature if your queries could benefit from it. \n\nCAUSE\nStarting with the June 2015 fix packs for NPS 7.1.0.6 and 7.2.0.5, and the NPS 7.2.1 release, the snippet results cache is disabled by default because it was optimized for specific workloads. Starting in the March fix packs 7.1.0.9, 7.2.0.8, and 7.2.1.2, the feature is enabled by default because it is optimized for most workloads. \n\nENVIRONMENT\nNetezza Platform Software releases 7.1.0.6 through 7.1.0.8-P1, 7.2.0.5 through 7.2.0.7-P1 and 7.2.1 through 7.2.1.1-P1\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nQueries that take advantage of the snippet results cache have longer runtimes after upgrades from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe snippet results cache is a query optimization feature added in NPS release 7.1 that can help to improve the performance of small queries. The feature was enabled by default for the NPS 7.1 releases up to 7.1.0.6 and for 7.2 releases up to 7.2.0.5.\n\n\nThe snippet results cache saves the intermediate results of snippets and can reuse them rather than incur the processing time to recompute them when needed. The cache can help to improve the performance of small queries. \n\nHowever, in environments where queries run against tables that constantly change with TRUNCATE, load, updates, and\/or rollback operations, caching may not be a good match if cached snippet results are frequently invalidated before they can be reused. \n\nIf you upgrade from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section and detect a change in query performance for queries that take advantage of the snippet results cache, you can re-enable the feature.\n\nTo enable the feature on a session level and test the snippet results cache behavior, you must pause the NPS system, set the variable, and resume the system, as follows: \n\nnzsystem pause -force\nnzsystem set -arg system.srcMode=1 -force\nnzsystem resume\n\nThis setting remains in effect until the database is restarted.

The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java\/lang\/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads\/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted."}]},{"id":"TRAIN_Q589","question":"How to have IBM HTTP Server re-direct an application URL from HTTPS to HTTP?\n\nWe have an application which uses SSL, but we need to make this http only.

To verify whether certain cipher suites are supported, visit the IBM Java Knowledge Center:\n\nIBM Java Cipher Suite Information\nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc\/security-component\/jsse2Docs\/ciphersuites.html?lang=en [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc\/security-component\/jsse2Docs\/ciphersuites.html?lang=en]\n\n\nDo You Need to Patch Java?\n\nFirst, determine whether your script uses 256-bit ciphers. In RPT workbench, open the script in Test Editor mode. In the left panel, drill down through the Server Access Configurations. Select SSL.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&amp;aid=1]\n\nIn the right panel, examine the available ciphers that display. If the list contains 256-bit ciphers, you need to support Strong Encryption in RPT and the RRT agent. The name identifies the encryption level. For example, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is a 256-bit cipher. The presence of 256 in the cipher name means that the cipher supports 256-bit encryption. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2]\n\nCipher Naming Conventions\n\nIn RPT workbench, the cipher name always begins with \"SSL\" to simplify naming conventions. If the script uses TLS as the protocol in the test, then the cipher is a TLS cipher.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3]\n\nPlayback Symptoms\n\nCheck whether your script playbacks indicate that the RRT JRE needs to be patched to support Strong Encryption. Strong Encryption adds 256-bit ciphers.\n\n1) The Playback Status workspace shows that playbacks are complete, but the Verification Failures workspace shows:\n\nEvent Type: Generic Failure\n\nViolated Value: java.lang.RuntimeException occurred in IBM Registration.

To use less restricted encryption algorithms, you need to download and apply the unlimited jurisdiction policy files (local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar). \n\nSee Enabling Strong encryption greater than 128 bit key lengths in Rational Performance Tester\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273]\n\nUse the following instructions to patch the JRE that the RRT agent uses.\n\nNote: Backup the jar files that these steps replace -- before you replace these files.\n\n1) Go to the IBM developerWorks Java Technology Security page for JRE 6 security information. \nSee https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/java\/jdk\/security\/ [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/java\/jdk\/security\/]\n\n2) Click on the \"Java SE 6\" link. \n\n3) Click on the \"IBM SDK Policy files\".\n\n4) On the Sign in page, enter your developerWorks IBM ID and password.\n\n5) After successfully logging in, select Files for Java 5.0 SR16, Java 6 SR13, Java 6 SR5 (J9 VM2.6), Java 7 SR4, and all later releases. Click on Continue.\n\n6) Scroll down to the License portion of the resulting page and click on the View license link to see the licensing terms for the download.\n\n7) If the licensing terms are acceptable, check I agree and click on the I confirm link. If the terms are not acceptable, you are not able to enable strong encryption, and you should click I cancel.\n\n8) Click on the Download now link to download the unrestricted.zip file.\n\n9) Extract the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files from the unrestricted.zip archive.\n\n10) Log onto the RRT agent host, and stop the RRT agent.\n\n11) Backup the local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files in the <ITM_HOME>\/tmaitm6\/java60\/jre\/lib\/security and <ITM_HOME>\/tmaitm6\/java70\/jre\/lib\/security directories on the RRT agent host.\n\n12) Place those two files in the <ITM_HOME>\/tmaitm6\/java60\/jre\/lib\/security and <ITM_HOME>\/tmaitm6\/java70\/jre\/lib\/security directories on the RRT agent host. Replace the existing files with the same names. Verify that the file permissions are the same as the files you replaced.\n\n13) Restart the RRT agent.\n\n14) Try to playback the RPT script again.

However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nBefore proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>\/PortalServer\/derby\/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.\n\nNOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add \".sh\" or \".bat' depending on the platform.\n\nThere are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, \"dblook\", \"ij\", and \"sysinfo\", under the <was_root>\/AppServer\/derby\/bin\/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.\n\ndblook utility\nThe dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. \n\nThe usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the \"jdbc:derby:<database>\" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb. \n\nCommonly used options include: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Examples:\n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\\temp\\user_desc.sql\n * \n * \n\n\nij utility \nThe ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). \n\nTo start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command.

You should also have an understanding of how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object that connects to remote WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (qmgr). This technote focuses on configuring DataPower MQ Client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode with Firmware Releases 3.8.2 and later fixpacks. Follow these steps to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object (mq-qm object) to access WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) in SSL mutual authentication mode.\nWebSphere MQ configuration prerequisites\n\nThe following three steps are necessary to make sure that the SSL configurations for the Remote MQ Server is correctly working. Refer to IBM WebSphere MQ product manuals to configure MQ environment to work in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n\n\n 1. Configure WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) to use SSL authentication (SSLCAUTH as \"required\") using URL: http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm]. \n 2. Configure WebSphere MQ Client to use SSL authentication. \n 3. Verify that WebSphere MQ Client can PUT\/GET message(s) using application programs such as amqsputc and amqsgetc with MQ Queue Manager in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n    \n\n\nGenerate self signed key\/certificate \n 1. Generate the self signed key\/certificate pair using the \"crypto tool\" from the DataPower device. \n 2.  Download the two files to your local machine. For the sake of illustration purpose, the names of the key and certificate files are defined as \"dpmqclient-privkey.pem\" and \"dpmqclient-sscert.pem\" respectively. \n 3. Assuming that openssl tool (www.openssl.org [http:\/\/www.openssl.org]) is installed in the local machine. With openssl tool, you can use the following command to create a \"pkcs12\" type key from the above key\/certificate pair which are of PEM type. This step is necessary as MQ key database will not import key\/certificate files created as PEM.\n    \n    openssl pkcs12 -export -out dpmqclient-key.p12-in dpmqclient-sscert.pem-inkey dpmqclient-privkey.pem-name ibmwebspheremqadmin\n    \n    Note the value associated with \"-name\" parameter. IBM WebSphereMQ client required a friendly label as \"ibmwebspheremq<userid>\" of the MQ client user. In this example, the user name is being used as \"admin\". This user must be used in the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object and it must also be an authorized user for both the DataPower MQ instance as well as for the remote WebSphere MQ Server. Please refer to Pages G58-62 in the 3.6.0-WebGui Guide for various fields as described in MQ Queue Manager configuration screen. Also note the following two fields with appropriate values which are required for the MQ Queue Manager object to connect the remote WebSphere MQ Server in SSL mode. \n\n *  SSL Key Repository: The key database file name \n   SSL Cipher Specification: TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US \n   \n\nTo import a personal certificate using \"iKeycmd\" GUI, use the following commands in your host machine where the WebSphere MQ Server\/Client is running. \n * UNIX\n * \n * \n *  gsk7cmd -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * Windows\n * \n * \n *  runmqckm -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * -file \n * filenam \n * \n * \n * -pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -type \n * pkcs12 \n * \n * \n * -target \n * filename\n * \n * \n * -target_pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -target_type \n * cms\n * \n\n\n\nGenerate the new password file \n\nFollow these steps to generate the new password file. \n 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI using either the gsk7ikm command (on UNIX) or the strmqikm command (on Windows). \n 2.  From the Key Database File menu, click Open. The Open window displays. \n 3.  Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System). \n 4.  Click Browse to navigate to the directory that contains the key database files. \n 5.  Select the key database file in which you want to save the certificate, for example key.kdb. \n 6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays. \n 7.  Type the password you set when you created the key database and click OK. \n 8.  The name of your key database file displays in the File Name field. The Personal Certificates menu will display both \"ibmwebspheremq<qmgr>\" and \"ibmwebspheremq<user>\" labels. \n 9.  In the WebSphere MQ Certificate key database, there is one certificate assigned to the queue manager or client. The certificate's Friendly Name attribute contains the string ibmwebspheremq followed in lower case by the queue manager name or the client logon ID. This Friendly Name value becomes the label of the certificate in the GSKit key database. Refer to Alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates for importing into GSKit [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21225160] if you want to alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates that are part of WebSphere MQ Certificate key database.

For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance.

Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/support\/isa\/]. \n\n\n\n\nLocating the Core Dump \n\nFor WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>\/profiles\/<PROFILE_NAME>\/ \n\nThe file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. \n\n\n\n\nProcessing the Dump \n\nExecute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use .\/jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. \n\nReplace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. \n\n \n\nIf you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. \n\n \n\nDetermining the Java Directory \n\nBecause different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. \n\n \n\nNOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n32-bit JVM and\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled\nAIX\/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>\/<JAVA_DIR>\/jre\/bin\/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\n\n\n\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled\nDoes not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1\nAIX\/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>\/<JAVA_DIR>\/jre\/bin\/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMax Heap Size \n\nTo adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFiles Generated \n\nThe output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. \n\nCore files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file \n\n \n\nIf you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nError Messages \n\nEyeCatcher Error\nUnable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher\nError. Internal failure detected during jextract \n\nThis error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including \n\n* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server\n* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.\n* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). \n\n \n\nOut of Memory Error \n\nSometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFAQ \n\nHow do I determine if compressed references is enabled? \n\nCompressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. \n\nChecking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs \n\nIf you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) \n\n \n\nWhat happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? \n\nIf you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n MustGather: Crash on AIX [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21055387]\nMustGather: Crash on Linux [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21104706]\nMustGather: Crash on Windows [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21053924]\nGenerating Userdumps on Windows [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21138203]\nCrash on AIX produces no core or a truncated core [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21052642]\nCrash on Linux produces no core or a truncated core [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21115658]"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q012","question":"I receive the following during UDX compilation Can't exec \"\/nz\/kit\/bin\/adm\/nzudxcompile\": Argument list too long\n\n","answer":"This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http:\/\/www.in-ulm.de\/~mascheck\/various\/argmax [http:\/\/www.in-ulm.de\/~mascheck\/various\/argmax]). \n\nBut we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23.

In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. \n\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. \nANSWER\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: \n\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. \n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). \n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\n\n\n\nWHEN TO UPDATE\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. \n\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. \n\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE UPDATING\n\n\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: \n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>\/shared\/data\/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>\/shared\/data\/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. \n\n\n\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. \n\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>\/shared\/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ..\/tools\/ant\/bin\/ant forcedestroyprofile. \n\n\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATING\n\n\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. \n\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\lib. \n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\applicationservers\\<App Server> folders.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. \n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\n\n\n\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. \n\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/dmanager\/v8r5m1\/topic\/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config\/topics\/odm_distrib_config.html]. \n\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. \n\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\n\n\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear \n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. \n\n\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\n\n\nUpdate the following application in your application server: \n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\n\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. \n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector \n     * wbehttpconnector \n     * wbejdbcconnector \n     * wbejmsconnector \n     * wbesoapconnector\n    \n    \n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. \n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information. \n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/websphere\/support\/lifecycle\/] page).

Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\n\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\n\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/webservers\/appserv\/support.html [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/webservers\/appserv\/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:\/\/\/ directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q034","question":"Profiler for WebSphere 8\n\n\n\nHi,\n\nWe noticed that a was application server uses 1,4 Go of memory at startup, we would like to understand what java classes are using most part of it.\n\nIs a Java profiler provided by default with WAS 8.0 ?

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=2]ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=1]\n\n\nAs for the certificate configuration on DataPower, the appliance will reference the actual key and certificate files stored in the cert: directory by file name. Navigation in the WebGUI to the SSL Proxy Profile -> Crypto Profile -> Crypto Key and Certificate objects will show the current files referenced by the configuration.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3]\n\n\nFor example, your DataPower configuration may currently reference the existing files cert:\/\/\/current-key.pem and cert:\/\/\/current-cert.pem.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4]\n\nAs long as the replacement file(s) are NOT named the same as these files (i.e. the new ones are named cert:\/\/\/new-key.pemand cert:\/\/\/new-cert.pem for example), it is safe to load the new file(s) into the cert: directory at any time ahead of the replacement operation. Your existing configuration will not use the new files, so long as the Crypto Key and Certificate Objects still refer to the files associated with the expiring certificate (i.e. cert:\/\/\/current-key.pem and cert:\/\/\/current-cert.pem). \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5]\n\nHaving both expiring and replacement files in the cert: directory at once allows for the capability to modify the configuration to point to the new files or revert it back to the expiring files relatively easily or to configure a new SSL Proxy Profile object that references the new files. The new SSL Proxy Profile could be used to test independently of the currently running configuration using a new test service such as an XML Firewall. \n\nYou can navigate directly to the key and certificate objects using these paths: \nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Certificate.\nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Key \n\nAnother view is from Control Panel -> Keys and Certificate Management.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6]\n\nEither way, note how the configuration ultimately references the files in the cert: directory and plan ahead for how you prefer to reference the new files. \n\nThey may be swapped out within the existing Crypto Configuration objects (i.e. update the objects to reference the new file(s) or to revert to the expiring ones as needed). \n\nAlternatively, a new separate set of Crypto Configuration objects that reference the new files may be created and replacement performed at the Crypto object level by updating the configuration to reference the new replacement Crypto Configuration objects.\n\nImportant Note: If the replacement certificate has the same file name of the expired certificate, you MUST disable\/enable the certificate object in order to clear all cached references to the expired certificate.\n\nFor more information on certificates, refer to the product documentation specific to your firmware and appliance type.

In this case data to be inserted should also be in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIf data has a different encoding then the database codepage (this can be verified using any hex editor), then the operating system codepage should be changed to match the data's encoding in order to enforce the data conversion to the database codepage. \n\nSYMPTOM\nError executing Select SQL statement.

Please verify the codepoints for non-ASCII characters that you try to insert. If you see only 1 byte per non-ASCII characters then you need to force the database conversion during insert from CLP to UTF-8 database. \n\nTo force codepage conversion during insert from the CLP make sure that the operating system codepage is non-Unicode and matching to the codepage of data when you insert data to Unicode database from non-Unicode data source. \n\nProblem Details\nAn example problem scenario is as follows:\n\n\n 1.  Create a database of type UTF-8:\n     \n     CREATE DATABASE <db> USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US \n     \n     \n 2.  Create a table that holds character data:\n     \n     CREATE TABLE test (col char(20)) \n     \n     \n 3.  Check operating system locale:\n     \n     locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \n     LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" \n     \n     \n 4.  Insert the non-ASCII characters '\u00c3' , '\u00b3', '\u00a9' which have codepoint 0x'C3', 0x'B3',0x'A9' in codepage 819 into the table:\n     \n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00c3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00b3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00a9') \n     \n     \n 5.  By running the following statement, you can see that all INSERT statements caused only one byte to be inserted into the table:\n     \n     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test\n     \n     \n     \u00c3 C3\n     \u00b3 B3\n     \u00a9 A9\n     \n     However, the UTF-8 representation of those characters are: 0x'C383' for '\u00c3', 0x'C2B3' for '\u00b3', and 0x'C2A9' for '\u00a9'.\n     So these three rows in the table contain invalid characters in UTF-8. \n     \n     \n 6.  When selecting from a column using the JDBC application, the following error will occur. This is expected because the table contains invalid UTF-8 data:\n     Error executing Select SQL statement.

If you prepare data yourself using some editor please check the documentation for your editor to find out how to set up the codepage for data being prepared by the editor. \n     \n     \n 9.  Insert data to the table:\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00c3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00b3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00a9') \n     \n     \n 10.

The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT\/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT\/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/i\/v14\/rules\/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

All rights reserved.\nComponent: IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring OS Agents, Version 6.3.0 FixPack 5\n\nDate: 30 June 2015\n\nContents:\n\n1.0 Introduction\n1.1 Quick Start\n2.0 New Attribute groups\n3.0 Parameters in OS agent environment files\n4.0 Parameters in property file\n5.0 Examples of property file\n6.0 Examples of private situations \n7.0 Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime workspaces\n8.0 Known problems and limitations\n9.0 Troubleshooting\n10.0 Quick Start Scenario\n\n\n1. Introduction\n===============\n\nThis feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.\n\nThe feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable\/disable it by setting a new environment variable \nKXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true\/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:\n\n- LZ for Linux OS agent \n- UX for Unix OS agent\n- NT for Windows OS agent\n\nThis is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.\n\nThe OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.\nThe property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named \u201cfcp_daemon\u201d if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.\n\nAccording to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.\nThe OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.\nAn event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.\n\n1.1 Quick Start\n================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:\n- create a property file under default directory (on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.\n\nOnly two properties are required:\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. \n\nNot only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. \nFor example, \"perl C:\\IBM\\scripts\\ITM_Custom_Scripts\\date.pl\". In this example you need to make sure that the location of \"perl\" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where \"perl\" is installed otherwise.\n\nFurther properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. \n\n\n2. New Attribute groups\n=======================\n\nTwo new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).\nDescription: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts. It contains a row for each defined script, information on the fcp_daemon and on property files:\n\nAttribute Size Description\n=========================== ===== =========================\nSystem_Name 32 This is the managed system name of the agent.\nTimestamp 16 This is the local time when the data was collected.\nProperty_File 256 The name of the property file.\nAttribute_Name 96 The attribute name that is defined in the properties file. The attribute is used for metric identification.\nScript_Name 512 The name of the script.\nScript_Path 512 The fully qualified path name of the script with arguments.\nCustom_Name 96 The custom name that is defined in the properties file. It is used for custom reporting.\nStandard_Output_Type 4 Standard output type of the script.\nStatus_Code 4 The status of the script. It includes general errors, configuration errors, the status or the execution code returned by the \nScript Provider.\nExecution_Start 16 The time when the last execution of this script started.\nExecution_Duration 4 The duration of the last execution of this script, in seconds. When timing out, the value of the configured timeout is returnd.\nAverage_Execution_Duration 4 The average duration, in seconds, of all the execution of the script.\nRefresh_Interval 4 The interval, in seconds, that the agent attempts to start this script.\nNumber_of_Collections 4 The count of execution attempts of this script since agent started.\nIntervals_Skipped 4 The count of occurrences where an execution of this script is skipped because the previous execution is still running.\nProperty_Group 64 The name of the property group.\nReturn_Code 4 Integer value returned by the Script.\nCust_Label_Str1 16 Label for custom string attribute #1\nCust_Label_Str2 16 Label for custom string attribute #2\nCust_Label_Str3 16 Label for custom string attribute #3\nCust_Label_Str4 16 Label for custom string attribute #4\nCust_Label_Str5 16 Label for custom string attribute #5\nCust_Label_Int1 16 Label for custom integer attribute #1\nCust_Label_Int2 16 Label for custom integer attribute #2\nCust_Label_Int3 16 Label for custom integer attribute #3\nCust_Label_Int4 16 Label for custom integer attribute #4\nCust_Label_Int5 16 Label for custom integer attribute #5\nCust_Label_Float1 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #1\nCust_Label_Float2 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #2\nCust_Label_Float3 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #3\nCust_Label_Float4 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #4\nCust_Label_Float5 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #5\nStandard_Error 2048 Script Standard Error in a unique row\n\nIn addition to script definitions, the table may report rows to return errors found on property files and they are identified by @ANY@ as Attribute_Name. Moreover, a row is always used to report the status of fcp_daemon and it is identified by @ANY@ as Property_File and @ANY@ as Attribute_Name.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRRTM (pure).\nDescription: Data gathered using custom scripts.

Parameters in OS agent environment files\n===========================================\n\nIt is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6_x64\\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6\\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent\n\nThe scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false\n\nOther parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions)\nThe location where property files are stored.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)\nOS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.\nNote: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)\nIf the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.\nTo avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:\n- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. \n- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.\n- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) \nAt startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.\nNote that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.\n\n- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)\nThis parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service \"Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider\". The user must have \"Full Control\" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)\nIt defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)\nThe OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). \nThe value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)\nIf set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. \n\n- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) \nIt is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.\nUsing low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).\n\n\nThe following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:\n\n- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.\n\n- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT\n\n- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file\n\n- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.\n\nThe fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:\nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]\n\n4. Parameters in property files \n===============================\n\nThe KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of \nscripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: \n\n- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).\nIt is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the \nATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).\nWhen multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.\n\n- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).\nIt defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. \nValues containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (\").\nEnvironment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.\n\n- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).\nIt indicates the script execution frequency.\n\n- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)\nThe user can fill it with a description of the script.\n\n- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). \nIt activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.\n\n- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.\n\n- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). \nWhen true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. \n\n\nOutput rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:\n\n- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;\nOUTPUT_TYPE can be:\n1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the \"Standard_Output_String\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the \"Standard_Output_Integer\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal\nprecision). When used, the \"Standard_Output_Float\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n\n- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).\nIt defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:\n<token_type>,<token_type>,\u2026\ntoken_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):\n- STRING or S\n- INTEGER or I\n- FLOAT or F\nIf <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.\nExamples of the same valid layouts:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT\n\n- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). \nIt defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated\nby commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. \ne.g.:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 \nIt is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.\n\n- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon \";\"). \nIt sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.\n\n\nThe following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:\n\n- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).\nThe value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.\nIf the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).\n- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).\nThe operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:\n= (equal to)\n!= (different from)\n> (bigger than) only for numeric type\n>= (not lower than) only for numeric type\n< (lower than) only for numeric type\n<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type\n\n\n\n5. Examples of property file\n============================\n\n#First script definition: script ex_script1.sh is launched every 150 seconds, it returns float values and only the output rows equal to 0.5 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=sample1 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/ibm\/itmd4255a\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions\/ex_script1.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=150\nOUTPUT_TYPE=FLOAT\nFILTER_VALUE=0.5\nFILTER_OPERATOR==\n\n#Second script definition: script ex_script2 is launched every 60 seconds, it returns integer values and only the rows different from 0 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script2\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${CANDLE_HOME}\/tmp\/check_out.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=60\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\nFILTER_VALUE=0\nFILTER_OPERATOR=!=\n\n#Third script definition: script ex_script3.sh is launched every 120 seconds with 3 input parameters (the first input parameter is an integer, the second and third are string). It's killed if it hangs or if the execution time is greater than the timeout value.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script3 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/scripts\/ex_script3.sh 1 \"second input parameter\" \"third input parameter\" \nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=120\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nKILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT=TRUE\n\n#Fourth script definition: script cpu_mem_percentage.sh is launched every 50 seconds and returns the cpuid as standard output string and 2 float for Idle and Used CPU percentage and 2 integers for Memory and Virtual Memory usage. The pipe is used as separator to parse the output. An example of row that must be returned by the script is: \ncpu2|35,5|65,5|3443|123800\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu and mem Usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${SCRIPT_HOME}\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,F,I,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Idle CPU %, Used CPU %, Virt MEM used MB, MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=50\n\n6. Examples of private situations \n==================================\n\nThe private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.\nExamples below are for the Linux OS agent:\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name \"demo\" in property file \"demo.properties\" returns a row equal to \"demo.log\" -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<CRITERIA>\n<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_NOPTAH\" INTERVAL=\"000030\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_ScriptLaunchErr\" INTERVAL=\"000060\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n\n7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces\n=======================================================\n\nA new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: \"Custom Scripts\" and \"Custom Scripts Runtime\". \n\n\"Custom Scripts\" workspace contains the following views:\n- \"Factory Daemon Status\" table view showing informational\/warning\/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.\n- \"Properties Files error\" table view showing problems related to property files.\n- \"Number of execution per script\" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts\n- \"Defined Scripts\" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.\n\n\"Custom Scripts Runtime\" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.\n\n\n8. Known problems and limitations\n===================================\n\n- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.\n- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.\n- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.\n- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.\n- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.\n- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.\n\n9. Troubleshooting\n===================\n\nStandard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.\nTo apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.\n\nTo trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:\nKBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)\n\nTo trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:\n(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent\n(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent\n(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent\n\nTo view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:\n(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)\n\nTo see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:\nKXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)\n\nTo troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)\n\nTo see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)\n\n\n10. Quick Start Scenario\n=========================\n\nThe following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.\n\nCustom Scripts descriptions\n===========================\nLet's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory \/scripts_repo:\n\n- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: \n\n4594740\n\n- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:\n\ncpu1|96,5|23800\n\nwhere the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.\n\nCustomization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts\n==============================================================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:\n\n- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:\n\n#CheckDIRsize.properties\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/checkDIRsize.sh \/opt\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\n\n#cpu_mem_usage.properties \nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=string\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10\n\n- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the \"Custom Scripts\" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.\n\nChange History:\n----------------------\n2017-01-09: Added new item under \"8.

Is there a solution to this issue? \n\nCAUSE\nIf the value of Retry Attempts is set to 0 on the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object, this negates the benefits of the Long Retry Interval since it will not be used. DataPower will retry forever using the specified Retry Interval. The default setting of Retry Attempts as 0 and Retry Interval as 1 second is provided to preserve backward compatibility. However, these default values should be changed to take advantage of Long Retry Interval feature available in firmware.\n\nANSWER\nThe solution to the issue of having DataPower vulnerable to the MQ Queue Manager being inaccessible is to change the Retry Attempts parameter on the Configure MQ Queue Manager window from 0 to some number. As an example, change the parameters as follows: \n\n *  Retry Attempts - change the default of 0 to 6 Retry Interval - change the default of 1 to 10 seconds Long Retry Interval - change the default of 1800 to 600 seconds (10 minutes) \n\n\nIn the event that the Queue Manager is down or a connection is not established, the above example configuration will allow the MQ QM Object to retry 6 times with 10 second intervals. After 6 attempts, the MQ QM object will retry every 10 minutes.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 Firmware 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 Firmware 3.8"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q107","question":"Why the exception \"BO Service is not supported or disabled in this profile\" when trying to publish from IID to a local Process Server?\n\nWhen trying to publish a project from IBM Integration Designer (IID) to the local Process Server, it fails with error ADMA5014E in SystemOut.log.

In addition to this file, README,\nyou can find more information on the WebSphere MQ Web site:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/ [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/]\n\nFor current information on known problems and available fixes,\nSupportPacs(TM), product documentation and online versions of this and\nother readme files see the Support page of the WebSphere MQ Web site at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/support [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/support]\n\nABOUT THIS RELEASE\n==================\n\nNomenclature\n------------\nThe terms \"WMQ V5.3.1\" and \"WMQ V5.3.1.0\" both refer to the same WMQ Refresh\nPack without subsequent service installed. Throughout this readme, references\nto \"WMQ V5.3.1.x\" refer to WMQ 5.3.1 with or without subsequent service\ninstalled.\n\nNew in this release\n-------------------\n\nThis is the twelfth FixPack for IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server,\nand is designated V5.3.1.12, with associated APAR IT15471.\n\nThis release is cumulative for all service and internal defect correction \nperformed since WMQ 5.3.1 was released. \n\nAll native object and executable files distributed with this FixPack have the\nfollowing version procedure strings:\n\nT0085H06_31MAY2016_V53_1_12_<buildid> (Where buildid is the internal build\nidentifier)\n\nThe Non-native library distributed with this FixPack has the following \nversion procedure string:\n\nT0085H06_28FEB2015_V53_1_11 \n\nIf upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases, this FixPack does NOT require \nTNS (non-native) applications to be re-bound with the MQI library. More on \nthis is described later on in this readme.\n\nIBM have not identified any new HP NonStop Server system software problems\nsince V5.3.1.6 was released. The current set of recommended solutions is \ndescribed later on in this readme.\n\nIBM recommends that you ensure that your HP NonStop Server system software\nproducts are at SPR levels that incorporate these fixes (solutions) as a\npreventive measure. IBM has tested WMQ with these fixes in our own\nenvironment before making the recommendations.\n\nImportant note about SSL channels\n---------------------------------\n\nThis release includes a new version of openSSL (1.0.2h) to maintain currency\nwith known vulnerabilities discovered since the version shipped with V5.3.1.\nA new version of the SSLupdate.pdf document was provided with the V5.3.1.10\nfixpack, and is also included with this this release, located in the \n<install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory. If you use SSL channels you\nshould review the revised version of SSLupdate.pdf prior to installing this\nfixpack.\n\nThe following SSL information applies if you are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1 and\nare using SSL channels. The following procedure is not required if you have \nalready installed WMQ V5.3.1.1\n\nSeveral of the fixes in this and previous FixPacks that relate to SSL channels\nchange the way that SSL certificates are configured with WebSphere MQ. If\nyou use SSL channels you will need to review the new documentation supplement\nSSLupdate.pdf for information about this change and make configuration changes\nPlease also see the Post-installation section below for a summary of the\nrequired changes.\n\nIn V5.3.1.10 Patch1 and all later releases, CipherSpecs that use the SSLv3\nprotocol were deprecated. Continued use of SSLv3 CipherSpec's is not recommended\nbut may be enabled by setting the AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE environment variable.\nIn addition to that Env01=AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE=1 has to be added to the MCA stanza \nof the queue manager's qmproc.ini file.\n\nWith OpenSSL 1.0.2h the following CipherSpecs have been deprecated:\nDES_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_MD5_EXPORT\nRC2_MD5_EXPORT\nDES_SHA_EXPORT\nTLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA\n\nWhile WMQ V5.3.1.12 does still support these weak CipherSpecs for compatibility\nreasons, they are deemed as not secure and should not be used. \n\nPlease check product documentation to confirm the CipherSpec is valid and consult\ndocumentation for any instructions when adding new environment variables.\n\n\nImportant note about WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.10 resolved an incompatibility between NonStop Java 7 and the\nWMQ product libraries - that fix is also included in V5.3.1.12.\nThe method used to configure Java in V5.3.1.10 and later differs from \nthat in releases prior to V5.3.1.10. The Java.pdf document shipped in the \n<install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory was updated to reflect the\nchange. Java\/JMS users migrating from versions prior to 5.3.1.10 should \nreview the updated document.\n\nImportant note about instmqm for V5.3.1\n---------------------------------------\n\nSince FixPack V5.3.1.5, IBM provided a modified WebSphere MQ product\ninstallation script, instmqm, for any level of V5.3.1. The new installation\nscript includes a workaround for the OS problem introduced in G06.29\/H06.06\nwhere the OSS 'cp' command creates Guardian files in Format-2 form during an\ninstallation rather than Format-1. This change caused problems binding and\ncompiling non-native and native COBOL applications, as well as wasting a lot of\ndisk space because of the very large default extents settings for the Format-2\nfiles created by OSS cp.\n\nInstmqm has been modified in FixPack V5.3.1.5 to work around this change in OSS\ncp by forcing all Guardian files in an installation to be created as Format-1.\nThe use of the new installation script is recommended for all new V5.3.1\ninstallations.\n\nExisting installations that are not affected by the application relink or\nrebind problems can remain as they are.\n\nProduct fix history\n-------------------\n\nThe following problems are resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.12:\n\nAPAR IT08589 - WebSphere MQ V6 or V7 queues become \"missing\" from clusters. Application\ncalls to MQOPEN (sometimes MQPUT1, MQPUT) suffer queue name lookup\nerrors (Examples: 2085, 2082) when they try to access the affected \ncluster queues. \n\nAPAR IT10388 - When the receiving QMgr has its channel set with SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL),\nthe Nonstop Queue Manager insists on sending a certificate to \nidentify itself. The remote side, however, does not require one\n\nAPAR IT11557 - Updated OpenSSL library to version 1.0.2h. This update deprecates sslchiph \ncipherspec TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and fixes various security \nvulnerabilities.\n\nAPAR IT12856 - When a node is removed from an MQ cluster and there is an automatically\ndefined cluster sender channel from a MQ node on NonStop to the removed\nnode, the sender channel on NonStop can go into state INITIALIZING and\nstay there for up to 60 minutes instead of being deleted after the first\nretry interval has expired.\n\nAPAR IT12875 - When a message is put into a remote\/cluster queue within a TMF user\ntransaction and while the corresponding transmit queue is empty or almost\nempty, it can take up to 60 seconds after the end of the transaction\nuntil the message is transmitted. As a side effect automatic channel \nstarts can also be delayed.\n\nAPAR IT12894 - Java 7 SSL clients behave differently than previous versions which \nresulted in an RC 2009 error on its connection attempt. This\nis fixed with V.5.3.1.12.\n\nAPAR IT14169 - When a CPU is stopped, some sender channels were not recovered \nand stayed in inactive state. \n\nAPAR IT15316 - Memory allocation during MCA and LQMA creation and initialization was\nnot handled properly and may result in an unresponsive system.\n\nAPAR IT15317 - Under some conditions agents stay alive but don't accept new\nconnections. That is the case if an agent has reached the maximum \nnumber of connections it is allowed to handle during its lifetime\nbut the agent can't terminate before the last connection has been \nclosed.\n\nAPAR IT15490 - A configured process name rule has not been applied because it \nwas defined with lower case characters, while the operating \nsystem interface delivered upper case process names. Since the name\ncomparison then fails the configuration is not applied.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.12:\n\nIN000100 - The CRTMQM command may fail with error 1017 if queue managers are \ncreated in parallel.\n\nIN000101 - The installer has been enhanced to properly support SMF virtual disks\nif the system revision is on H06.26 and newer or J06.15 and newer.\n\nIN000102 - Removed access to uninitialized memory within mqconn which may result in\nRC 2059 MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE.\n\n\nFixes introduced in previous fixpacks\n=====================================\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.11:\n\nAPAR IT03572 - In V5.3.1.10, the dspmqver -V command displays the string \n\"VPROC\" rather than the VPROC string encoded in the product.\nV5.3.1.11 corrects this problem.\n\nAPAR IT04083 - Error 30 received by Queue Server in a complex Queue Manager \nconfiguration using MQGMO_SET_SIGNAL. This is a result of\nthe limit on the number of outstanding messages sent by the \nprocess not being set to the same value as the internal counter.\nThis results in the Queue Server reporting \"Guardian error 30 \nattempting to send signal notification\" in the queue manager \nerror log.\n\nAPAR IT04533 - Cluster sender channels fail to start following a CPU failure\non a 2 CPU system when the Repository Manager and Channel Server\nare both in the same CPU. Following the CPU failure, the Queue\nManager error log repeatedly reports message AMQ9422 \n\"Repository manager error, RC=545284114\" \n\nAPAR IT04876 - Some ssl channels with mismatched sslchiph cipherspecs run \nsuccessfully because protocol versions are not compared. \n\nAPAR IT05353 - Mitigation for SSLV3 POODLE Attack - CVE-2014-3566 \n\nAPAR IT07330 - WebSphere MQ V5.3.X Process does not write FDC (First \nFailure Symptom Report) records when the current FDC file is\nphysically full. This can result in processes experiencing error\nconditions, but the error condition not being reported in the \nFDC file. This fix changes the error handling to identify this\nscenario and switch to a new FDC file with an incremented \nsequence number \n\nAPAR IV19854 - The master repository manager in a partial repository \nunnecessarily subscribes to each cluster queue manager that\nit is aware of. This causes a significant increase in the number\nof subscriptions that are made, and in large clusters this can\ncause performance problems. \n\nAPAR IY87702 - SIGSEGV resulting from failed getpwnam. In some circumstances\ngetpwnam can return a success value in errno, but a null\npointer as the user record. This results in a SIGSEGV from \namqoamd. This change adds a check for this condition and handles\nit correctly. \n\nAPAR IY91357 - Altering a channel definition unintentionally resets the \nSSLPEER() attribute for the channel. \nWhen a channel with SSLPEER information is modified to include\neither MSGEXIT or MSGDATA attributes, the SSLPEER attribute \nbecomes blank. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.11:\n\n909 - In the GA release, the TFILE was opened with depth 100 in the\nGuardian NonStop process pairs. In configurations with large\nlarge numbers of connecting applications\/threads, this could\nresult in probe QS270000 errors from nspPrimary, with an Arith1\nvalue of 83 (0083 Attempt to begin more concurrent transactions \nthan can be handled). This change increases the TFILE open depth\nto 1000. The default value can be changed from 1000 to a value\nbetween 100 and 1000 using MQTFILEDEPTH environment variable.\nIf a value < 100 or > 1000 is specified, a value of 100 will\nbe used, and an FDC will be reported with the text\n\"Invalid MQTFILEDEPTH specified - using default\"\n\n1380 - In the cra library, several FFST code sites report an error \nwithout reporting the name of the channel involved in the error\ncondition. This change adds the channel name to the FFST report\nin cases where the channel name is available to the calling code\n\n1471 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, if a garbage argument string is \nsupplied to dspmqfls, the command abends rather than reporting a\nusage message. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem\n\n1597 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the dspmqfls output shows a \nQueue\/Status server value. Status servers were part of the V5.1\narchitecture but are not present in 5.3.1. V5.3.1.11 changes the \nmessage to reflect the fact that all objects are now managed by\nQueue Servers.\n\n2230 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the runmqsc command \n\"DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL\" does not cleanly handle a\nscenario where there are more than 500 handles. Attempts to use\nthe command when there are more than 500 handles to be returned\nresults in FFSTs with probe NS013000 from nspReply, and probe\nQS264002 from qslHandleHandleStatus. See later section on\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\"\n\n4158 - Slow memory leak in MQDISC in non-native library. In prior\nreleases, the non-native implementation of MQDISC contained a\nslow memory leak. This resulted in applications performing \nrepeated MQCONN\/MQDISC operations during the process lifetime\neventually receiving a MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE error from\nMQCONN, and an FFST for probe ZS219001 from zstInsertPCD. The\nproblem can also manifest as a probe XC130006 from \nxehExceptionHandler inside an MQOPEN call.\n\n4395 - If memory allocation for internal working storage fails during\nan attempt to create a dynamic queue, the LQMA assoicated with\nthe operation will ABEND, rather than returning a completion\ncode of 2071 (MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE). This change resolves\nthe problem.\n\n4421 - If an attempt to start an OAM server detects an existing OAM\nserver in the CPU, in prior releases, the FFST generated did not\ninclude the process name. This change amends the FFST to\ninclude the process name of the offending process, where that\nname can be determined. \n\n4428 - The altmqfls command \"resetmeasure\" was incorrectly documented\nin the original version of the SysAdmin guide. See later section\n\"DOCUMENTATION UPDATES\"\n\n4496 - In earlier versions of this readme file, the instructions on \nhow to reassign Queue Server for \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMISSION.QUEUE are incorrect. Refer to the\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\" section for the\ncorrect procedure.\n\n4523 - If an OAM server attempts to start in a CPU, and there is \nalready an OAM server registered, prior to V5.3.1.11, the OAM\nsubsystem reported that there was a rogue process, but not\nthe name of the process. This change enhances the error\nreporting to report the name of the rogue process. \n\n4726 - Prior to this fixpack, the instmqm script did not check for\nsaveabend files and FFSTs generated during the validation\nphase of the installation. V5.3.1.11 adds this check.\n\n4774 - The cobol binding library, MQMCB, was shipped without symbols in\nFixPack V5.3.1.10, which causes applications to fail. V5.3.1.11\nresolves this issue. \n\n4800 - During instmqm, the script checks for the UNIX socket server.\nIn prior releases, in the event that this check failed, the\nerror message referred to the old UNIX socket server ($ZPMON).\nThis has been changed to refer to the new UNIX socket subsystem\n$ZLSnn, \"nn\" is the CPU number.\n\nAPAR IC85889 - UNEXPECTED IPC MESSAGES RECEIVED FOLLOWING PROCESS\nTERMINATION CAUSE EC TO ABEND REPEATEDLY\nIf a process sends an unexpected message to the MQECSVR\nprocess pair, the primary process will abend resulting in a\ntakeover by the backup process. The new primary process will\nthen abend. The only resolution is to restart the queue manager. \n\nAPAR IC87007 - PRIMARY QUEUE SERVER ABEND FOLLOWING TRANSACTION ABORT\nIn some circumstances, aborts of global units of work \ninvolving MQGETs of messages greater than 52k will result in an \nabend of the primary queue server responsible for the queue. \nThis renders the queue manager unresponsive \n\nAPAR IC87627 - WEBSPHERE MQ V5.3.1.8 FDC FILES DO NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH ERROR \nINFORMATION\n\nAPAR IC89128 - LISTENER FAILS TO START FOLLOWING UPGRADE TO \nHP J06.14\/H06.25 OR T9050J01-AWT\/T9050H02-AWS\nIn some configurations, the listener process will not run\nfollowing an upgrade to J06.14\/H06.25 or the installation of \nT9050J01-AWT\/T9050H02-AWS. The failure is dependent on the\nnumber of OSS processes running and their distribution between\nthe CPUs on the system. This problem also affects endmqlsr.\n\nAPAR IC89751 - CLUSSDR Channels do not restart without manual intervention\nafter CPU crash.\nIf a CLUSSDR or SDR channel is running in an MCA that is in the \nsame CPU as the Primary Channel Server, and that channel has \nbeen running for at least 5 minutes, and that CPU crashes, the \nchannel will not automatically restart. \n\nAPAR IC92511 - TERMINATION OF SLAVE REPOSITORY MANAGER RESULTS IN CLUSTER \nCHANNEL DELETION. In some cases this can result in a manually\nstopped cluster sender channel starting unexpectedly when they\nare dynamically recreated. \n\nAPAR IC92570 - MULTIPLE CLUSTER RECIEVER CHANNELS OR LONG RUNNING CLUSRCVR \nCHANNELS CAUSE METADATA FDC'S\n\nAPAR IC93289 - WEBSPHERE MQ R531 ON HP-NSS CLUSTER PUB SUB MESSAGES FAIL\nWITH AMQ9538 - COMMIT CONTROL ERROR \n\nAPAR IC94647 - Closing dynamic queues with MQCO_DELETE or MQCO_DELETE_PURGE\nwith an outstanding MQGET with signal results in multiple FDCs \nand an orphaned dynamic queue\n\nAPAR IC96947 - Backup Queue Server generates \"Open handle points to unused \nentry in default page\" FFST following LQMA termination \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.10:\n\n4607 - Analyze lock logic in queue server takeover does not take account\nof temporary dynamic queues\n4679 - Exhaustion of message quickcell (MQC) space available to queue \nserver results in unstable queue manager\n4563 - RDF compatible message overflow file setting requires queue \nmanager restart \n4560 - Slave repository managers issue channel manipulation commands \nthat should be performed only by the master\n4557 - Write NonStop specific trace information to product standard \ntrace files rather than platform-specific file\n4556 - Internal Queue manager query array size can cause problems \nwith clusters containing more than 10 queue managers\n\n\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.9:\n\nAPAR IC51322 - CODE CHANGES FOR OPTIMIZATION OF DEFAULT CONVERSION\nDelay in processing seen during the default conversion between\nclient and server. The channel attempts normal conversion first,\nincluding attempting to load a conversion table before dropping\nthrough to the default conversion. Once default is required \nfor a specific set of code pages, this is now remembered \nand the attempt to perform normal conversion skipped.\n\nAPAR IY76799 - A FAILED CALL TO GETPEERNAME RESULTS IN A LEAKED SOCKET FILE\nWMQ amqrmppa (channel) process leaks a file descriptor in\nthe rare circumstance that a call to the getpeername function\nfails. Such a failed call is reported in the WMQ error logs for\nthe queue manager via an AMQ9213 message reporting that the\ngetpeername call has failed. The failure of\nthe getpeername call is the result of preoblems external to \nWMQ. This problem could also cause the WMQ listener process\n(runmqlsr) to run out of file descriptors, if there is\nno queue manager running, and lots of connections come in,\nwhilst these connections fail with getpeername problems.\n\nAPAR IY95706 - SIGSEGV IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING RETURN FROM ZFUDOESOBJECTEXIST\nAn amqzlga0 process or amqrmppa process will raise an XC130004 \nFDC and the amqzlga0 process will end. The abrupt termination of\nthe amqzlga0\/amqrmppa process may cause channels or applications\nconnected to the queue manager to fail\n\nAPAR IZ06131 - RECOVER FROM SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE CORRUPTED BY USER ERROR\nApplications receive MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED (2035) error\nsetmqaut returns MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME (2085) and fails to\nset new authorities. Records are missing from the \nSYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE, determined by a mismatch between the \noutput from amqoamd -m -s, and the authorities that customers \nbelieve they have set for users and objects. This fix allows \nrecovery from this situation using setmqaut without the need \nto recreate the queue manager \n\nAPAR IC74903 - SSLPeer value slash (\/) causes SSL handshake to fail\nUsing slashes in the Distinguished Name name fields such as CN,\nO, OU, L, will fail SSLPEER value verification, and as such SSL\nHandshake, due to an MQ parsing error. MQ uses slashes (\/) to\ndelimit the distinguished name values when matching the SSLPEER\nvalue with the information contained in the certificate.\n\nAPAR IC82919 - xcsAllocateMemBlock returning xecS_E_NO_MEM\nQueue manager (receiver channel side) with API exits generate\nFDCs containing probe ZF137003 and error log entries for AMQ9518\nin the form of - File '\/mqs\/WMQtest\/var\/mqm\/@ipcc\/AMQRFCDA.DAT'\nnot found.\n\nAPAR IC80942 - Authority commands produced by amqoamd command is not usable if\nauthorization is \"+None\"\n\nUsing the setmqaut command with commands generated by amqoamd\nresults in a failure e.g\n\"setmqaut -m qmgrname -n name -t queue -g group +None\"\nreturns:\n\"AMQ7097: You gave an authorization specification that is not\nvalid.\"\n\nAPAR IC81429 - MQRC error 2003 received if an overflow file record is missing\nIf a portion of a message that should be stored the queue \noverflow file is missing, the generation of an FFST is \nsuppressed and a 2003 reason code is returned. All subsequent \nnon-specific MQGETs from the queue fail, since the partial \nmessage cannot be retrieved. \n\nAPAR IC81420 - Queue Server abend during simultaneous GET and BROWSE\nWhen a message larger than 56k is being browsed (MQGET with\none of the MQGMO_BROWSE_* options) from a client application \nusing message groups, and another process is simultaneously \nperforming a destructive MQGET on the same message. The primary\nqueue server terminates, and more or more of the following\nprobes are generated :QS003002, AO211001, AO200002, ZI074001,\nNS026006\n\nAPAR IC81367 - FixPack 5318 MQMCB Guardian library is not usable\nThe COBOL wrapper libraries were changed from type LINKFILE to\nDLL in the v5.3.1.8 Fixpack, and the packaging unintentionally\nstripped the symbols from the Guardian variant of the library\nZWMQBIN.MQMCB. During the link phase of a cobal program build\nthe following fatal error is encountered:\n\"Cannot use file specified in CONSULT or SEARCH directive\"\nProblem affects building in Guardian only.\n\nAPAR IC83299 - CPU Failure during mqget of persistent messages in global\nunit of work results in incorrectly deleted records in queue and\noverflow files\n\nIf a CPU fails where multiple applications are performing FIFO\nMQGETs from the same queue, and the following conditions are \ntrue:\n* The primary queue server is running in the failing CPU\n* Some (but not all) of the applications are running in the\nfailing CPU\n* None of the LQMAs are running in the failing CPU\n* The applications are using global units of work\n* Applications in the failing CPU have completed MQGET operations\nbut not committed the transactions\nThere is a failure window where an application not in the\nfailing CPU will remove an additional message record from the \nqueue file.\n\nAPAR IC83197 - Queue Server open handle management cannot handle backup\nrestart cases where handles from non-contiguous pages are \nsynced by the primary\n\nQueue servers with more than 3000 queue opens do not \ncorrectly handle a NonStop takeover. The queue manager becomes \nunresponsive and requires a restart to resolve the error \nsituation. When the queue server hangs, the backup queue server\nproduces a large number of FFST entries with the following \nprobe ids:\nQS165004 from qslSetHandle\nQS192007 from qslAddOpener\nQS190005 from qslHandleOpen\n\nAPAR IC83569 - Persistent Reference messages sent over a channel cause Commit \nControl Error\n\nWhen a persistent reference message is put to a queue, FFST's\nwith probe CS075003 are generated with the following error \ninformation\nMajor Errorcode :- rrcE_COMMIT_CONTROL_ERROR\nMinor Errorcode :- OK\nComment1 :- Error 2232 returned from lpiSPIHPNSSTxInfo\nIn addition, Sender channels will go into a retry state and\nqueue manager error logs will contain 'Commit Control' errors\n\nAPAR IC83699 - Cluster cache maintenance asynchronous time values result in\ncache content divergence\n\nRepository queue managers report FFST with probe RM527002\nfrom rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket and Comment1 field \n\"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=4\". The problem \nresolved by this APAR is one of several possible causes of\nthese symptoms.\n\nAPAR IC83328 - Permanent dynamic queues are not deleted in some cases when\nMQCO_DELETE is used on MQCLOSE.\nPermanent dynamic queues are not deleted as expected after \ntermination of the last application that has the queue open.\n\nAPAR IC83228 - Repository manager\/Channel server deadlock\nListener process hangs on queue manager startup for 5 \nminutes then generates an FFST with probe RM264002 \nfrom rfxConnectCache\nComment1 :- Gave up waiting for cache to be initialized\nComment2 :- Tried 300 times at 1 second intervals. \nThis problem also occurs sometimes when attempting\nto use runmqsc while the queue manager is starting\n\nAPAR IY90524 - segv in xcsloadfunction for channel exit\nWebSphere MQ channel process (amqrmppa) terminates with FFST\nshowing probe id XC130003 due to a SIGSEGV SIGNAL with\na function stack as follows:\nMQM Function Stack\nccxResponder\nrrxResponder\nrriAcceptSess\nrriInitExits\nxcsLoadFunction\n\nAPAR IC81311 - MQGET implementation masks reason codes in some cases\nAttempting to perform an MQGET after a Local Queue Manager\nAgent (LQMA) process fails or has been forcibly terminated\nresults in a MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR (2195). This is incorrect.\nThe result should be MQRC_CONNECTON_BROKEN (2009)\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.9:\n\n4363 - MQA process opener field is sometimes corrupted in MQGET with \nset signal operations\n4388 - Guardian sample uses the wrong link directive\n4339 - Shared hconn rendered unsuable by changes in 5317\n4123 - FASTPATH bound connect processing does not correctly set reason\ncodes in some cases\n4039 - Backup queue server abend during commit after MQGET\n3826 - altmqfls --qsize does not report failure correctly\n4116 - enhance SDCP to find installed version of OSSLS2 (T8620)\n\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.8:\n\nAPAR IC54121 - Cluster channel in a retrying state will no longer start \nautomatically if the following commands are issued \nSTOP CHANNEL() MODE(QUIESCE) STATUS(INACTIVE).\nThe channel will fail to start once communication\nto the remote system is restored. A manual start and\nstop of the channel is required to restore normal\nchannel operation\n\nAPAR IC54459 - Channel stays in binding state for a long time when it contains\nan invalid conname value. During this period, all requests to \nthe channel are ignored.\n\nAPAR IC60204 - Comamnd server experiences a memory leak when namelist\ninquireies are performed with names values.\nThe leak is observed when a PCF MQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST or\nMQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST_NAMES is requested that has one or \nmore names attributes.\n\nAPAR IC70168 - High CPU usage from backup Queue Server performing browse\noperations on queues with high queue depth.\nWhen a queue has a very high queue depth (CURDEPTH) a browse\ncan cause the cpu usage of the backup Queue Server to increase\nto 100%. Backup queue server CPU usage becomes significant at\na queue depth of 15000, with CPU use reaching 100% at a queue\ndepth of approx. 38000 messages.\n\nAPAR IC70947 - qmproc.ini file validation does not detect incorrect CPU syntax.\nCPU lists in the qmproc.ini file that do not use comma\ncharacters to separate CPU numbers in the list are ignored, but\nthey are not reported as an error. This can lead to unexpected\nCPU assignements for WMQ processes.\n\nAPAR IC71839 - RESET QUEUE STATISTICS PCF returns incorrect values.\nWhen using WebSphere MQ v5.3 for HP NonStop Server PCF command\nReset Queue Statistics, intermittently some of the values\nassociated with a queue will not be returned correctly.\n* HighQDepth - The maximum number of messages on the queue\nsince the statistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_HIGH_Q_DEPTH).\n* MsgEnqCount - The number of messages enqueued (the number of\nMQPUT calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_ENQ_COUNT).\n* MsgDeqCount - The number of messages dequeued (the number of\nMQGET calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_DEQ_COUNT).\n\nIncorrect values may also be returned incorrectly for the\ncommand Inquire Queue Status\n* LastGetTime - Time at which the last message was\ndestructively read from the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_GET_TIME).\n* LastPutTime - Time at which the last message was\nsuccessfully put to the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_PUT_TIME).\n\nAPAR IC71912 - MQMC Channel menu display shows incorrect channel status.\nIn some instances, the MQMC Channel Menu display will not\nshow a change in channel status, and attempts to refresh the\nscreen or recycle the MQS-MQMSVR Pathway server do not correct\nthe problem. RUNMQSC continues to show the correct status. \nThe MQMC channel monitor panel does show the running channels\ncorrectly.\n\nAPAR IC73800 - A queue manager with the MaxUnthreadeAgents parameter defined\nin the QMPROC.INI file with a value greater than 812\nreports unexpected process termination FDCs and or ERROR 22\nFDCs.\n\nAPAR IC74994 - Queue manager reports message sequence number error and\nproduces FDCs with probe CS094005, major error code\nrrcE_CREATE_SYNC_FAILED following a queue manager\nrestart. \n\nAPAR IC75298 - In some complex cluster configuations with large numbers of\ncluster members, large numbers of objects, or frequent changes\nto cluster objects, the repository managers in a queue\nmanager are unable to distribute a complete set of object \nmetadata information, resulting in repeated FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket, with probe RM527001, and cluster objects\nnot being visible in some CPUs in the queue manager reporting the\nproblems.\n\nThe fix for the problem adds a new configurable parameter to\nallow the repository metadata buffers to be increased to handle\nlarger configurations, and changes the reporting of the metadata\nerrors to include information on the amount of storage requested\nby the repository managers. The default size of the buffer is \n512K, this is sufficient for most configurations. If the buffer \nsize is insufficient, the queue manager reports FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSPutMetaPacket that indicate the present size of the\nbuffer and the size demanded.\n\nThe buffer size is configured using an environment variable, \nAMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES. To change the value, the \nenvironment variable should be specified in the \n\"RepositoryManager\" stanza of the qmproc.ini file of the queue\nmanager using the following syntax:\n\nEnv0n=AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES=x\n\nWhere \"n\" is the number of the environment variable, and \"x\" is\nthe required new size of the buffer in kilobytes. In a default\nconfiguration, environment variables are not present in the \nRepositoryManager stanza, hence \"n\" will be 1. If the \nconfiguration has existing environment variables specified in\nthis stanza, the value of \"n\" selected should be the next \navailable value. \n\nAPAR IC75356 - Partial repository queue managers in complex configurations\nwhere applications connected to the partial repository queue\nmanager attempt to open large numbers of nonexistant objects\ncan suffer from a build up of subscription objects on the \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE such that the TMF lock limits\nfor the volume containing the queue file are breached when the\nqueue is reconciled. This produces 2024 errors during operations\non the SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE The following error \nmessage appears in the QMgr error logs.\nEXPLANATION: The attempt to get messages from queue\n'SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE' on queue manager 'xxx' failed \n\nAPAR IY57123 - Attempts to put to a clustered queue via a queue manager\nalias when the queue has been opened using BIND_AS_QDEF\nfail. Following this fix, queue name resolution functions\nas described in the Application Programming Guide.\n\nAPAR IY78473 - Cluster workload management is not invoked if a queue is\nresolved using clustered queue manager aliases where there\nare multiple instances of the alias in the cluster.\n\nAPAR IY86606 - Cluster subscriptions are created for non-clustered queues\nwhen MQOPEN is called with non-clustered ReplyToQ or \nReplyToQMgr. This can result in a build up of subscriptions\nin partial repositories in the cluster. The error was \nintroduced by IY8473.\n\nAPAR IZ14977 - Queue manager cluster membership missing when namelists are\nused to add and remove queue managers from clusters. This can\nresult in the queue manager not acting as a repository for\none or more clusters, or other queue managers in the cluster\nnot recognizing that a given queue manager is a repository\nfor the cluster.\n\nAPAR IZ20546 - The repository manager process (amqrrmfa) consumes high CPU\nresources on an hourly basis for several minutes, and\napplications are unable to issue messaging MQ API calls\nduring this period. The problem is observed only in \nconfigurations where clustered queue manager aliases are\nused and they resolve to more than 50 destinations.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.8:\n\n1228 - COBOL Binding library mqmcb does not contain VPROC information\n1378 - FDC's cut as a result of errors from PATHWAY SPI operations do\nnot report the associated Guardian error code \n1566 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not correctly detect\nand report that files it is attempting to modify are in use,\nas is the case where WMQ applications are still runnning. \n1606 - Certain FDCs containing comment text have the comment text\ntruncated \n1710 - In some cases on heavily loaded systems, the EC re-allocates\nan MCA that has already been told to terminate. This results in\nFDC's cut with probe EC134000, from eclDeallocMCA.\n2534 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not log some aspects\nof its progress, making diagnosing some installation problems\ndifficult\n2856 - WMQ service installation tool should not attempt SECURE\noperations in installations where SAFEGUARD is enabled\n2943 - crtmqm does not correctly handle validation of the command line\nif a specified CPU number is invalid\n3037 - If the var\/mqm\/errors directory contains non-mqm user files \nthe WMQ service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture the \nMQM group FDC and ZZSA files.\n3128 - WMQ Service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture VPROC \nof the AF_UNIX R2 socket process\n\n\nThe following changes were released in FixPack V5.3.1.7:\n\nAPAR IC65774 - Under given conditions, the response time measured for MQGET\noperations when using SSL activated channels with multi-threaded\nMCA agents are found to be longer than that measured when using \nSSL activated channels with unthreaded MCA agents. This problem \nis seen with both distributed and cluster queue managers. \nMoreover, this problem does not occur prior to WMQ V5.3.1.5 \nrelease. A DELAY was introduced as part of an APAR(IC57744) fix\nin WMQ V5.3.1.5 release for mutli-threaded SSL channels which\ncaused this difference in measured response time. The problem is\nnow rectified in this release. \n\nAPAR IC67032 - Improvement to LQMA FDC during MQCONN processing. At times, when\napplication dies during MQCONN processing, LQMA's generate FDCs\nfor this rather unusual event to let the user take any \ncorrective action and\/or find the root cause. The problem can \noccur with a standard bound application in a very narrow timing\nwindow when the application connects with the LQMA agent but \ndies before the LQMA gets a chance to read the incoming message\nfrom the application. When LQMA detects this situation, it \ncleans up and generates an FDC. But unfortunately, the FDC does\nnot contain the application information. To let the user \nidentify the mis-behaving application and to possibly take\ncorrective action, LQMA FDC will be updated to include \napplication information. The updated FDC will contain the\nfollowing information :\n\nComment1 :- Application died during MQCONN Processing.\nComment2 :- Application: <Application PID> \n\nAPAR IC67057 - Unused LQMA agents(processes or threads) are found during MQCONN \nprocessing. During MQCONN processing if a standard bound \napplication fails to connect successfully to an allocated LQMA\nprocess or thread (depending on your configuration), then that\nLQMA process or thread remains in a hanging state for ever and\ndo not get re-used by Execution Controller for any further \nMQCONN processing. If an LQMA agent process ever goes into this \n\"limbo\" state, ecasvc utility shows \n\"Allocated, Pending Registration\" flag if it is unthreaded LQMA \nor a positive number against \"Conns Pending\" flag if it is a \nmulti threaded LQMA. If this problem occurrs multiple times, \nthen depending on the user configuration, it might lead to LQMA \nresource problems where Execution Controller will run out of \navailable LQMA agents to serve application MQCONN requests.\n\nAPAR IC65966 - runmqsc <queue manager name> causes FDC on a CPU due to missing\nOSS shared memory files (shm.x.x) for that CPU. Due to a yet\nunknown reason, the queue manager shared memory files for a\nparticular CPU on the system are deleted even when the queue\nmanager is in running state. This prevents any new MQ connection\nrequests from succeeding for the same queue manager on the\naffected CPU. This patch contains changes that will better\nprotect WMQ shared memory files and will prevent accidental\ndeletion of files by WMQ programs. The changes in this patch\nwill also report any such incidence by producing FDC files. The\nFDC file produced by this detection mechanism will contain the\nfollowing information :\nComment1 :- xcsIC_QUEUE_MANAGER_POOL being destroyed.\n\nAPAR IC67569 - When WMQ Queue Server detects an error due to invalid context\ndata during the completion of a TMF transaction started by the\nQueue Server for a PUT or GET no-syncpoint persistent message\noperation, it marks the message on the queue object as \naccessible. This causes the Queue Server to FDC with \n\"Record not found\" on any subsequent MQGET operation to retrieve\nthe same message. The particular message on the queue that has \nthis problem remains in this limbo state forever and can not be\nretrieved. However other messages on the same queue that do not\nhave this problem can be retrieved without any problem using \ntheir msgids. The Queue Server has been revised to correct this\nbehavior such that detection of inconsistent context data during\nMQPUT\/MQGET is logged in the form of an FDC but is otherwise \ncommitted as a normal operation. This will resolve the problem\nof MQGET failing on the retrieval of the message.\n\nAPAR IC68569 - Channel server FDCs during starting\/stopping of channels. The \nproblem occurrs due to a defect in the product where the channel\nserver erroneously closes its open to Queue Server but assumes \nthat its open to Queue Server is valid. The open handle \nto Queue Server after it is closed, gets reused by another open\nand hence any subsequent communication by Channel Server to \nQueue Server always fails. Typically, this problem is seen when\nthe Channel Server experiences transient socket errors with the \nchannel agent (MCA) and it wants to close the socket connection.\nAfter closing the socket connection, Channel server sends a \nmessage to Execute Controller process to de-allocate the MCA\nwith which it had socket error with. It is during this \ncommunication between the Channel Server and the Execution\nController when the Channel Server erroneously closes the open\nto the Queue Server.\n\nAPAR IC69572 - Channel server abends due to illegal address reference during\nadopt MCA processing. This problem happens if the Queue Manager\nhas enabled adopt MCA processing to a remote WMQ Queue Manager\nthat does not send a remote queue manager name during channel\ninitialization\/negotiation. The remote Queue Manager field\nremains NULL and during the Adopt MCA processing logic,\nthe channel server incorrectly references the NULL pointer and\nabends. \n\nAPAR IC69932 - SNA WMQ listener fails to start the channel when HP SPR \nT9055H07^AGN is present on the NonStop system. HP, in its SPR\nSPR T9055H07^AGN, changed the behavior of sendmsg() API if '-1'\nis used as a file descriptor to the API. This caused \nincompatibility with WMQ SNA listener process. WMQ code has now \nbeen revised to work with the updated sendmsg() behavior. \n\nAPAR IC69996 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC with reply error 74. When an\napplication with a waiting syncpoint MQGET suddenly dies \nbefore getting a reply, the Queue Server can cause FDC \nsometimes. This happens in a narrow timing window when a message\nbecomes available on the queue and the Queue Server starts \nprocessing the waiting MQGET request. If the application dies\nafter Queue Server starts processing the waiting MQGET request, \nthen Queue Server detects the inherited TMF transaction error \nand replies back with error 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE).\nHowever in this case, Queue Server erroneously does not delete\nits internal waiter record for MQGET. When the timer pops for\nthe waiter record, Queue Server attempts to reply back with\nno message available but the call to Guardian REPLYX procedure\nfails with error 74 as the reply to the same request has already\nbeen made(with error MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). This causes\nthe Queue Server to FDC.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.7:\n\n363 - WMQ Queue Server under certain conditions fails to handle non-persistent\nand persistent segmented messages at the same time.\n1317 - Support for parallel execution of multiple endmqm programs on the same\nQueue Manager. \n1404 - MQGET WAIT is not being rejected with error 2069 when there is an \nexisting MQGET set signal on the same queue handle. \n1434 - svcmqm utility fails when install files are open but does not tell the \nuser which files are open. \n1566 - svcmqm does not exit immediately when 'cp' command fails to copy \nbinaries during fixpack installation.\n1679 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC while failing to open the message \noverflow file during retrieval of very large messages (equal to or \nlarger than 'Message Overflow Threshold' displayed with dspmqfls \nutility).\n1709 - instmqm changes related to the use of \/opt directory for the creation of\nbackup archive file.\n1789 - Port of distributed APAR IY66826. Cluster sender channel does not start\nand Queue Manager cache status remain in STARTING state.\n1780 - Port of distributed APAR IY85542. RESET CLUSTER command does not remove \ndeleted repository entry.\n1993 - Enhancement to WMQ mqrc program to print messages related to errors \nbeing returned on NonStop platform.\n2018 - WMQ lqma agent process leaks catalog file open.\n2181 - svcmqm does not output the fixpack that is being installed.\n2282 - instmqm -b archives everything under \/opt directory.\n2290 - Enhancement to Execution Controller process to aid development dubugging\nand troubleshooting.\n2534 - svcmqm has no log of its progress.\n2580 - Potential SEGV in internal function call during Pathway serverclass \nstarting.\n2632 - Incorrect message output in FDC generated by WMQ Queue Server during \nnsrReply function call.\n2633 - WMQ Command Server memory leak found in CLEAR QL command.\n2842 - WMQ Repman process priority was not set correctly when the \nqmproc.ini 'AllProcesses' stanza Priority attribute is configured. \n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1971 - sdcp data was not collected correctly when there is a default \nQueue Manager defined.\n2211 - sdcp testing of the permission of \/tmp directory.\n2289 - sdcp logging of progress to a file to aid in sdcp problem diagnosis.\n2298 - sdcp performance improvement.\n2531 - sdcp logging of scheduled CPU information.\n2582 - sdcp capture of Pathway data for PATHMON, PATHWAY, TCP, PROGRAM\nand TERM attributes.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.6:\n\nAPAR IC60204 - A Memory leak occurs with repeated DISPLAY NAMELIST command. The\nleak is observed only when the NAMELIST(s) has one or more NAMES\nvalues defined. The problem is observed from within the runmqsc\nDISPLAY NAMELIST command, or from the PCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools\nthat request NAMELIST data via the command server with PCF\/MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the WMQ command server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC61324 - An orphan MCA problem occurs when a connection request from WMQ\nLISTENER or CHANNEL SERVER process to an MCA process fails. WMQ\nExecution Controller (EC) process fails to recognize the\nsituation and does not re-use the MCA process for future agent\nallocation requests. Over a period of time, this problem can\ncause the queue manager to run out of MCA resources which may\nlead to a situation where no new channel can be started. The\nproblem is observed during heavy load conditions where the WMQ\nExecution Controller(EC) process hands over a selected MCA\nprocess to LISTENER\/CHANNEL SERVER before the MCA process\nbecomes ready to accept connection requests.\n\nAPAR IC61551 - The use of cluster administrative command\nRESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE), to forcibly remove a Queue\nManager out of the cluster can cause FDCs. The problem can cause\nmultiple FDCs and sometimes abend in WMQ REPMAN process in a\nslave role. Once the command has been issued and the error has\noccurred, the concerned Queue Manager must be restarted to\nrestore the clustering function to normal operation. The problem\noccurs because WMQ REPMAN process in a master role does not\ndistribute the RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE) command to the\nslave REPMAN processes correctly.\n\nAPAR IC61651 - When a NAMELIST object with one or more NAMES values is defined\nfor a Queue Manager and a dspmqfls command is issued to retrieve\nthe details of either all objects under the Queue Manager or\nthe specific NAMELIST object, FDCs are seen from the WMQ LQMA\nprocess. The problem exists for both unthreaded and\nmulti-threaded LQMA process. The problem occurs because WMQ LQMA\nprocess does not allocate sufficient memory for NAMES buffer\nduring dspmqfls processing.\n\nAPAR IC61660 - A PCF RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command causes the WMQ QUEUE SERVER\nprocess to FDC. The problem occurs during a timing window when\nthere is an outstanding unit of work on the queue and a\nRESET QUEUE STATISTICS command is processed and then the\noutstanding unit of work is backed out. RESET QUEUE STATISTICS\ncauses certain internal counters inside WMQ QUEUE SERVER to be\nreset to zero without taking into account the outstanding unit\nof work. If the outstanding work is later backed out for any\nreason, the already reset counters become negative which causes\nan internal consistency check to fail within the QUEUE SERVER\nprocess and the FDC is generated.\n\nAPAR IC61681 - WMQ QUEUE SERVER causes FDC during MQCLOSE processing on a\ncluster alias queue. The problem occurs during MQCLOSE\nprocessing of a cluster QALIAS object hosted by a different\nQUEUE SERVER than that hosts the target local queue. MQOPEN\nincorrectly failed to allocate an internal handle for the QALIAS\nobject if it was a cluster alias queue. This lead to the FDC\nduring MQCLOSE processing.\n\nAPAR IC61846 - When a START CHANNEL command is issued after WMQ trace is\nenabled, the SSL channel logs a Queue Manager error message and\nfails to start.\nThe problem exists only for a SSL channel, no such problem\nis found for regular (non-SSL) channel. The problem occurs\nbecause of an incorrect implementation of NULL terminated string\nto store SSL Cipher data.\n\nAPAR IC61920 - WMQ on NonStop reports an extra EMS message when the generation\nof an FFST is reported.\nThe intention behind the second EMS message was to report the\ncase when the open of the generated FFST file fails but the\ncheck to see the status of the opened FFST files was missing\nin the code.\n\nAPAR IC62341 - A Security error from the WMQ OAM server is not propagated\ncorrectly. It was reported as MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME instead\nof MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED. When running the Java IVP (MQIVP) to NSK\nwith a non-mqm user specified as the MCAUSER in the SVRCONN\nchannel, and if the non-mqm group isn't given authorization,\nMQIVP fails to connect to the Queue Manager\nwith an authorization failure (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) but it is\nreported incorrectly as a MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME error.\n\nAPAR IC62389 - A REFRESH CLUSTER command within a cluster with more than two\nrepositories causes the Repository Manager to fail. The problem\nis not common in normal cluster operation but is likely if\nextensive administrative changes are being made to the cluster\nthat includes a REFRESH CLUSTER command. Incorrect distribution\nof channel status information across multiple copies of the\nREPOSITORY MANAGER cache in different CPUs of the system lead to\nthe FDC.\n\nAPAR IC62391 - Sometimes cluster queues are not visible on CPUs hosting WMQ\nREPOSITORY MANAGER process in a slave role. This is a cluster\nqueue visibility problem across the CPUs. Any attempt to open\nthe cluster queue on CPUs that have the visibility problem\nresults in error MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME or\nMQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR.\nThe problem does not occur on the CPU that hosts WMQ REPOSITORY\nMANAGER process in a master role.\n\nAPAR IC62449 - The WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not log storage related problems to\nthe Queue Manager log. Some of NSK storage related errors like\nerror 43 and error 45 are useful errors for which corrective\naction can be taken to restore normal operation.\nThe WMQ QUEUE SERVER now logs these errors to Queue Manager log.\n\nAPAR IC62480 - Port of IZ51686. Incorrect cache object linkage causes\nunexpected failures (AMQ9456) based on coincidental event\nsequences.\n\nAPAR IC62511 - Port of the following clustering-related APARs from other\nplatforms and versions:\nIZ14399 - Queue managers successfully rejoin a cluster when\nAPAR IY99051 is applied but have mismatching sequence\nnumbers for the cluster queue manager object and its\nassociated clusters.\nIZ21977 - MQRC_OBJECT_CHANGED(2041),\nAMQ9511 SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE,AMQ9448,\nRepository manager ends.\nIZ37511 - Generation of an FDC by the Repository Manager causes\nit to terminate.\nIZ14977 - Missing cluster information when Namelists are used\nto add and remove queue managers from multiple\nclusters at once.\nIZ36482 - Changes to CLUSRCVR shared using a Namelist not\npublished to all clusters.\nIZ10757 - Repository Manager process terminates with error\nRRCI_CLUS_NO_CLUSRCVR_DEFINED.\nIZ41187 - MQRC_CLUSTER_PUT_INHIBITED was returned when an out-\ndated object definition from the cluster repository\nwas referenced.\nIZ34125 - MQ fails to construct and send an availability message\nwhen REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS (YES) is issued on a queue\nmanager with more than 1 CLUSRCVR.\n96181 - Object changed problems with the Repository manager.\nIY97159 - Repository Manager process tries to access the cache\nwhile restoring the cache, resulting in a hang.\nIZ44552 - AMQ9430 message after REFRESH CLUSTER.\n135969 - Refresh bit not set when demoting QM to partial repository.\n\nAPAR IC62850 - The md.Priority of a message was not being set to the queue\nDEFPRTY when a no syncpoint MQPUT is performed using\nMQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF while there is a waiting MQGET.\nA syncpoint MQPUT with a waiting MQGET does not have this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC63081 - A WMQ application abends in the MQI library when attempting to\nenqueue messages to a Distribution LIST with one queue entry.\nAlso in certain circumstances, WMQ applications may receive\nincorrect status and reason code while using Distribution LISTS.\n\nAPAR IC63105 - A Memory leak occurs in the WMQ COMMAND SERVER with repeated\nDISPLAY QSTATUS command. The leak is observed only when\nTYPE HANDLE is used with the above command. The problem also\noccurs from within runmqsc DISPLAY QSTATUS command, or from the\nPCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request queue status data via\nWMQ COMMAND SERVER with PCF\/MQIA requests such as WMQ Explorer\nwill cause the WMQ COMMAND SERVER memory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC63271 - When an MQ application delays in replying to the HP system OPEN\nmessage from the WMQ QUEUE SERVER and an MQ message arrives on\nqueue during this period, the MQ message did not get delivered\neven after the reply to the HP system OPEN message is made.\n\nAPAR IC63757 - In a standard bound application, a memory leak occurs in WMQ\nLQMA process during MQCONN\/MQDISC processing. The problem occurs\nwith both unthreaded and multi-threaded LQMA process. If the\nLQMA agents are configured to have high use count\n(MaxAgentUse for unthreaded LQMA and MaxThreadedAgentUse for\nmulti-threaded LQMA) and WMQ Execution Controller process\nre-uses the same LQMA process to satisfy a application MQCONN\nrequest, then the heap memory of LQMA process grows even if\napplication calls MQDISC to disconnect from the\nQueue Manager.\n\nAPAR IC64297 - WMQ Queue Manager becomes non-responsive because the\nWMQ QUEUE SERVER does not clean up the internal queue manager\nobject opens. The QUEUE SERVER internal links for\nMQOPEN of the Queue Manager object were not\nbeing released during the MQCLOSE processing. This causes a\nbuildup of QUEUE SERVER memory as the application repeated\nMQOPEN of the queue manager object repeatedly. When either\na MQDISC occurred or the application process ended,\nthe QUEUE SERVER cleans up its internal lists for the process.\nThis resulted in a perceived QUEUE SERVER loop and\nnon-responsive WMQ as there were\nover 246,000 opens found of the Queue Manager object with a\nhigh mark of 548,000 within the QUEUE SERVER when a dump of the\nQueue Server was analyzed.\nMQOPEN of other MQ objects (qlocal, qalias, qremote etc.) do not\nhave this issue.\n\nAPAR IC64373 - The COBOL copybook now includes missing definitions for MQGET\nSET SIGNAL processing.\n\nAPAR IC64435 - An incorrect persistence attribute was being set for a\nnon-persistent message on XMIT queue. When MQPUT of a\nnon-persistent message is done using MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF\nattribute to a remote queue while the channel is idle, the MD\nMD data in transmit queue header contained\nMQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF value of (2).\n\nAPAR IC64630 - It takes longer for unthreaded SSL sender channel to end when\ncommunication to the remote Queue Manager is lost. The problem\noccurs because the unthreaded MCA process running the SSL channel\nfails to timeout correctly causing the channel to end differently\nthan non-SSL channels. The problem is observed only with SSL\nchannels and no such problem is visible with regular SSL \nchannels. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work are\nalso released with V5.3.1.6:\n\n1096 - An MQGET BROWSE operation can return prematurely with no message\navailable as well as can cause a waited GET to hang indefinitely.\n1513 - amqrrmit erroneously reports multiple master REPMAN processes.\n1587 - Enhancements to Execution Controller log messages pertaining to\nThreshold and MaxAgent capacity situations. For unthreaded agents,\nthe \"max unthreaded agents reached\" message will now be logged when the\nMaxUnthreadedAgent is allocated to perform work. In previous releases,\nthe message was logged when the MaxUnthreadedAgent was added to the idle\npool, which actually left one agent still available for use.\nFor threaded agents, messages have been enhanced to display separate\nThreshold\/Maximum messages for agents and threads. In previous releases,\n\"further connections refused\" was displayed when the MaxThreadedAgent\nwas started, which actually left MaximumThreads connections still\navailable for use. In this release \"further connections refused\" will be\ndisplayed when the MaximumThread is allocated for use.\nAlso in this release, messages will be logged when the number of agents\nor threads, after having exceeded the threshold or reached maximum,\nfall below the Maximum or threshold limit.\n1669 - ZCG_FFST does not report the error code for a TMF error.\n1675 - The Execution Controller now provides an API to mark MCAs that are no\nlonger used.\n1670 - Correction to missing component data in a FDC generated by the\nQueue Manager server(MQS-QMGRSVR00) process(amqqmsvr).\n1678 - Queue server abends due to uninitialized FFST inserts.\n1706 - dmpmqaut -m <qmgr> sometimes only reports the first QALIAS object and\nFDCs in kpiEnumerateObjectAuthority.\n1710 - The Execution Controller sometimes allocates an MCA that it has\npreviously asked to end\n1712 - Cluster queue manager STATUS and queue visibility problems in slave\nREPMAN.\n1734 - Fixes\/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1735 - Subscription id distribution.\n1751 - Fixes\/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1807 - Changes to improve service and debug capability of Execution Controller\nstarted processes.\n1873 - \"*\" subscriptions are generated incorrectly causing them to be ignored.\n1989 - Fix for channel server hanging problem while opening REPMAN process.\n2003 - LQMA now FDCs when a invalid message is received.\n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1659 - sdcp is not capturing the PSTATE of backup processes.\n1676 - sdcp takes too long.\n1690 - sdcp MQ utilities are not using the correct Queue Manager name if\nthe name is mangled because of non-alphabetic characters.\n1702 - sdcp doesn't collect all relevant Saveabend files.\n1705 - sdcp workaround to avoid APAR IC61651.\n1971 - sdcp now gives correct output for default Queue Manager.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.5:\n\nAPAR IC55607 - FDC files can fail to be written, or written to the wrong file\nFDCs can be suppressed or overwritten when application processes\nraise FDCs under User IDs that are not members of the MQM group.\nIn addition, because FDC files are named with the CPU and PIN of\nthe generating process, and PIN is reused frequently on\nHP NonStop Server, FDCs from different processes can be appended\nto the same file.\n\nThe format of the file name for FDCs is:\nAMQcccpppp.s.FDC\n\nwhere ccc is the CPU number\npppp is the PIN\ns is the sequence number\n\nIn V5.3.1.4 and earlier releases, the sequence number was\nalways set to 0. This fix introduces the use of the sequence\nnumber field to ensure that FDCs from different processes are\nalways written to different files, and that FDCs can always be\nwritten. FDC files are created with file\npermissions \"rw-r----\" to prevent unauthorized access to the\nFDC data.\n\nAPAR IC57435 - Attempts to end a queue manager with either -t or -p following\na cpu failure in some cases did not work as a result of\ndamage to the WMQ OSS shared memory files. The shared memory\nmanagement code was revised to tolerate OSS shmem\/shm files\ncontaining invalid data. Invalid data in these files is now\nignored and memory segment creation will continue normally.\n\nAPAR IC58165 - Triggered channels sometimes do not trigger when they should\nSome attributes of a local queue that determine if trigger\nmessages get generated are not kept up to date for long-running\napplications. The most critical attribute is the GET attribute\nthat controls whether MQGET operations are enabled for a queue\nor not. If the application opened the triggered queue while\nthe queue was GET(DISABLED), and the queue is subsequently\nmodified to be GET(ENABLED), triggering will not occur when it\nshould.\n\nAPAR IC58377 - Trace data is not written when PIDs are reused for processes\nrunning under different User IDs.\nTrace files are named according to the CPU and PIN of the process\nthat is being traced. On HP NonStop Server, since PINs are\nrapidly reused, it is likely that a process attempting to write\ntrace data will encounter an existing file written with the same\nCPU and PIN. The traced process will be unable to write data if\nthe original file was written (and therefore owned) by a\ndifferent User ID.\n\nThis fix introduces a sequence number into the trace file names\nto prevent trace file name collisions.\n\nThe format of trace file names will change from:\n\nAMQccppppp.TRC to AMQccppppp.s.TRC\n\nwhere s is a sequence number that will usually be 0.\nTrace files are now created with file permissions \"rw-r----\"\nto prevent unauthorized access to the trace data.\n\nAPAR IC58717 - The Queue Server backup process generates FDCs showing ProbeId\nQS123006 from qslHandleChpPBC when attempting to locate a browse\ncursor message, with the comment text of\n\"Error locating Last Message in Browse Cursor checkpoint in\nBackup\" or \"Error locating Last Logical Message in Browse Cursor\ncheckpoint in Backup\". The problem appears only when running a\nnumber of parallel browse \/ get applications for the same queue\nobject.\n\nAPAR IC58792 - strmqm fails to delete orphaned temporary dynamic queues if the\nassociated touch file is missing. This results in these queues\nremaining in the object catalog indefinitely, and FDC files\nbeing generated each time the queue manager is started,\nreflecting the fact that the queue could not be deleted. The\nhousekeeping function was modified to always silently remove\ntemporary dynamic queue objects from the catalog, whether or\nnot they are damaged. FDC files are no longer generated.\n\nAPAR IC58859 - wmqtrig script does not pass TMC with ENVRDATA correctly.\nIf ENVRDATA is part of the PROCESS definiton used by\nrunmqtrm to trigger applications the TMC is not delivered to\nthe application correctly. The problem does not occur with\nblank ENVRDATA. Additionally, ENVRDATA or USERDATA attributes\nthat contain volume names ($DATA for example) are not processed\ncorrectly by the wmqtrig script.\n\nAPAR IC58891 - Sender channels that were running in a CPU that failed are not\nrestarted in some circumstances. Sender channels that are not\nrestarted report \"AMQ9604: Channel <...> terminated\nunexpectedly\" in the queue manager error log, and the channel\nserver create FDCs with ProbeID RM487001, Component\n\"rriChannelTerminate\".\n\nAPAR IC58976 - A server channel without a specified CONNAME enters a STOPPED\nstate when the MCA process running the channel is forcibly\nstopped or ends following a CPU failure. The channel state\nshould be set to INACTIVE following this type of event. To\nrecover the situation the channel has to be manually restarted\nor stopped using MODE(INACTIVE).\n\nAPAR IC59024 - The copyright data in the COBOL COPYBOOK CMQGMOL file\nis incorrect.\n\nAPAR IC59126 - Context data is missing in COA message.\nWhen an MQPUT application sends a message with COA report\noption, the generated replied COA message does not contain\ncontext data eg. PutDate, PutTime, etc.\n\nAPAR IC59364 - Queue Server primary incorrectly commits an WMQ message in\ncertain cases where the backup process has failed to process\nan internal checkpoint message. This causes an inconsistency\nbetween the primary and backup processes when an MQGET is\nattempted on this message, resulting in FDCs with the comment\ntext \"Invalid Message Header context in Backup for Get\" from\nComponent \"qslHandleGetCkp\". The queue object is no longer\naccessible via MQGETs, but can be recovered by stopping the\nbackup process.\n\nAPAR IC59388 - V5.3 OAM Implementation contains migration logic which may be\ntriggered erroneously in some circumtances, removing authority\nrecords from the SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE. This change removes the\nmigration logic, since there are no previous versions of the\nOAM which require migration.\n\nAPAR IC59395 - Threaded LQMA actual usage is one larger than the configured\nmaximum use count in the qmproc.ini file. Unthreaded LQMAs\nand MCAs (both threaded and unthreaded) do not suffer from this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC59428 - In some circumstances where connecting applications terminate\nunexpectedly during the MQCONN processing, either by external\nforcible termination, or as a consequence of other failures that\n\nresult in termination, the resulting error can cause the LQMA\nprocess handling the application to terminate. This will\ncause collateral disconnections of all other applications using\nthe same LQMA, with the application experiencing either a 2009\n(connection broken) or 2295 (unexpected) error. The problem\nwindow occurs only during one section of the connect protocol\nand has been observed only on very busy systems with repeated\nmultiple forced terminations of applications.\n\nAPAR IC59742 - qmproc.ini file will fail validation if configured with both\nMinIdleAgents=0 and MaxIdleAgents=0.\n\nAPAR IC59743 - Queue Manager server expiration report generation is not fully\nconfigurable. The frequency with which the queue manager server\ngenerates expiration reports is configurable but the number of\nreports generated is not. This change introduces a new\nenvironment variable (MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE), to allow\nconfiguration of the number of expiration reports generated\nat any one time. The parameter can be added to the WMQ\nPathway MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass:\nALTER MQS-QMGRSVR00, ENV MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE=<1-99999>\nIf this value is not specified in the queue manager\nserverclass configuration, the value defaults to 100.\n\nAPAR IC59802 - Memory leak occurs with repeated DIS CHSTATUS SAVED command.\nA memory leak exists in the Channel Saved Status query. This\nleak is observed within either the runqmsc DISPLAY CHSTATUS\n\nSAVED command, or the PCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request\nsaved channel status data via the Command Server with PCF \/ MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the Command Server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC60114 - WMQ processes or user application processes generate FDCs\nreferring to \"shmget\" following forcible termination of the\nprocess or failure of the CPU running it. This is a result of\nthe Guardian C-files (Cnxxxxxx) for a CPU becoming corrupt\nduring an update operation, rendering the file and associated\nshared memory segment unusable. C-file update operations are\nnow performed atomically to prevent this problem.\n\nAPAR IC60135 - Improve servicability of the \"endmqm -i\" command to prevent the\ncommand from waiting indefinitely for the queue manager to end.\nFollowing this change after a specified number of seconds, the\ncommand will complete with the message \"Queue Manager Running\"\nand return to the command line with exit status 5.\n\nAPAR IC60175 - Description is not available (security\/integrity exposure)\n\nAPAR IC60361 - Memory leak occurs in SVRCONN channel MCAs which repeatedly open\nlocal queue objects.\n\nAPAR IC60455 - WMQ Broker restart may not work correctly.\nIf the WMQ Broker is restarted using strmqbrk\/endmqbrk,\nsubsequent attempts to restart the broker may fail, and 2033\nerrors my arise when running the test broker samples and\nrecycling the broker processes.\n\nAPAR IC60119 - System Administration manual incorrectly states the default\nvalue of the TCP\/IP Keepalive is \"ON\"\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.5:\n\n1403 Erroneous SVRCONN channel ended message.\nSVRConn channels should not generate \"Channel Ended\" messages in\nthe error log, but in some circumstances, threaded svrconn\nchannels do generate these messages.\n1451 Internal changes relating to trace and FDC files sequence numbers\n1453 Problem with MQCONN after restart of broker\n1516 strmqm fails with invalid ExecutablePath attribute (qmproc.ini)\n1560 Port of V51 MQSeries for Compaq NonStop Kernel APAR IC57981.\nBackup Queue Server runs out of memory processing non-persistent\nmessages in 27K range. \n1564 runmqlsr abends in nssclose after a previous 'socket' calls fails\n1570 Added Agent type to EC logged threshold and max agent messages.\n1576 Change ECA interface to V4\n1577 Queue Server message expiration deletion phase log message\n1583 Blank channel status entries can get created triggering\nchannels when AdoptMCA is enabled.\nUnder certain timing situations, when triggered channels are\nused and AdoptMCA is enabled for the queue manager, blank\nchannel status entries can be created with the JOBNAME\nreferencing the Channel Initiator (runmqchi), for example:\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL() XMITQ()\nCONNAME() CURRENT\nCHLTYPE() STATUS(BINDING)\nMSGS() BATCHES()\nJOBNAME(5,333 $MQCHI OSS(318898190)) RQMNAME()\nThis problem does not cause any immediate functional problem,\nhowever the blank entries consume channel status table entries\nand therefore could prevent legitimate channel starts in the\nevent that the status table becomes full.\n1594 C++ unthreaded libraries use threaded semaphores\n1596 Improved cs error reporting\n1597 EC started processes sometimes not started in intended CPU\n1598 NSS Incorrect component identifiers used in some parts of zig\n1608 Queue status errors on failure of a no syncpoint persist message\nput or get\n1601 Tracing details to the EC to augment the Entry and Exit trace\ncalls\n1611 LQMA Queue manager attribute corruption\n1613 Enhanced LEC Failure Handling\n1615 The EC may allow the os to choose in which cpu a MCA will start\n1616 Channel server comp traps have potential performance impact.\n1621 MQCONN does not report valid reason code when agent pool is full\n1622 After a channel is started dis chs displays \"binding\" in some\ncircumstances when it should display \"running\"\n1623 Incorrect message when MCA allocation fails\n1626 Addition of Service information collection tool (SDCP)\n\nNew platform support was released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.4 introduced support for the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem\nplatform, NB50000c. Use the H-Series (Integrity) package of WebSphere MQ\nfor execution on the BladeSystem. Please refer to the Hardware and Software\nRequirements section for details about the levels of the J-Series software\nrequired.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nAPAR IC57020 - runmqtrm does not function correctly and produces errors in some\ncases.\nWhen a triggered application is a guardian script file\n(ie filecode 101). runmqtrm produces an \"illegal program\nfile format\" error. Triggering also does not work correctly\nfor COBOL or TAL applications.\n\nAPAR IC57231 - The execution controller starts repository processes at the\nsame priority as itself in some cases, and does not take\naccount of the values set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nAPAR IC57420 - Repository manager restart following failure causes cluster\ncache corruption in some circumstances.\nIf a repository manager abends while a queue manager is under a\nheavy load of cluster-intensive operations, in some\ncircumstances the repository manager that is restarted can\ndamage the cluster cache in the CPU in which it\nis running. This can prevent further cluster operations in that\nCPU and cause WMQ processes to loop indefinitely. This release\nchanges the repository startup to prevent this from happening.\n\nAPAR IC57432 - OSS applications that attempt to perform MQI operations from\nforked processes encounter errors.\nIf an oss WMQ application forks a child process, that child\nprocess will encounter errors if it attempts to perform MQI\noperations. Some operations may succeed, but will result\nin the generation of FDC files.\n\nAPAR IC57488 - MQMC channel menu display display error after channel is\ndeleted.\nIf a channel is deleted while the channel menu in MQMC\nis displayed, refreshing the channel menu produces the\nerror: \"Unknown error received from server. Error number\nreturned is 1\" and will not correctly display the channel\nlist without restarting MQMC.\n\nAPAR IC57501 - unthreaded sender channels to remote destinations with\nsignificant network latency may fail to start with timeout\nerrors.\n\nAPAR IC57524 - Applications launched locally from remote nodes cannot access\nsome of the queue manager shared memory files due to default\nsecurity on those files.\n\nAPAR IC57627 - Handling of TMF outages to improve operational predictability.\nIf TMF disables the ability to begin new transactions\n(BEGINTRANS DISABLED), WMQ does not always react in a\npredictable or easily diagnosed manner, and applications can\nsuffer a variety of different symptoms. If TMF is stopped\nabruptly (STOP TMF, ABRUPT) queue managers can become unstable\nand require significant manual intervention to stop and restart.\nRefer to item 18 in \"Known Limitations, Problems and\nWorkarounds\" later in this README for more information.\n\nAPAR IC57712 - altmqfls --qsize with more than 100 messages on queue fails.\nWhen a altmqfls --qsize is performed with more the 100 MQ\nmessages in the queue the processing fails.\n\nAPAR IC57719 - FDCs from MQOPEN when an error exists in alias queue manager\nresolution path. If a queue resolution path includes a queue\nmanager alias, and the target of the alias does not exist,\nthis will produce an FDC, rather than just failing the\nMQOPEN as would be expected.\n\nAPAR IC57744 - CPU goes busy when stopping a threaded SSL receiver channel\nusing MODE(TERMINATE).\nIf a stop channel mode(terminate) is used to stop an SSL\nreceiver channel that is running in a threaded MCA, the CPU\nwhere the MCA is running in begin using large amounts of CPU\ntime (95% range). This is due to a problem in the threads\nlibrary.\n\nAPAR IC57876 - Very infrequently, messages put via threaded LQMAs can in some\ncircumstances contain erroneous CCSID information. This has\nbeen observed to cause conversion errors if the message is\ndestined for a channel that has the CONVERT(YES) set.\nUnthreaded LQMAs do not suffer from this problem.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.4:\n\n993 - Due to the way that default file security was used, file security for\ncertain shared memory files used by the queue manager (SZ***) may\n\ninadvertently change in a way that prevents applications not in\nthe mqm group from issuing MQCONN. File permissions were rationalised\nin this release to reflect those used for other shared memory files.\n1458 - Resolve Channel command generates FFSTs.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels, FFSTs were generated by the Channel\nServer and the MCA. Although the channels were successfully resolved,\nthe In-Doubt status in a DIS CHS query was not correctly updated.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels using the COMMIT option the following\nerror message was displayed \"AMQ8101: WebSphere MQ error (7E0) has\noccurred.\"\n1493 - The validation of the qmproc.ini file does not report the error case\nwhere multiple ChannelsNameMatch entries are specified ChlRule1.\n1498 - Instmqm does not support installation of the product on\nIntegrity NonStop BladeSystem platforms.\n1507 - Some Execution controller messages were missing \"Action\" descriptions\nwhen reported in the error log.\n1517 - In the qmproc.ini file, the AppRule4-SubvolMatch argument was not\nworking\n1522 - Communications Component Function ids and probes are incorrect. This\nresulted in misleading or missing information in trace files generated\nfor support purposes.\n1546 - MQBACK operation incorrectly reports error during broker operations\n1549 - Channel Server doesn't shutdown after takeover.\nIf the Primary Channel Server process is prematurely ended, for\nexample by a CPU crash, the Backup Channel Server process becomes the\nnew Primary process. Subsequent attempts to use endmqm will hang\nbecause the new Primary Channel Server process will not end.\n\n\nThe following documentation APARs are addressed by the V5.3.1.4 readme:\n\nAPAR IC55404 - REFRESH QMGR PCF command is not documented in the Programmable\n\ncommand formats manual.\n\nAlso - please check the \"Limitations\" and \"Known Problems and Workarounds\"\nsections later on in this readme for updates.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.3:\n\nAPAR IC54305 - The HP TNS (non-native) C compiler generates Warning 86 when\ncompiling MQI applications\nAPAR IC55501 - The altmqfls command does not return the correct completion\nstatus; it always returns success\nAPAR IC55719 - Non-native MQINQ binding does not deal with some null pointer\nparameters correctly\nAPAR IC55977 - Channel retry does not obey SHORTTMR interval accurately enough\nAPAR IC55990 - Trigger data changes not being acted upon if they were made\nwhile the queue was open, leading to incorrect triggering\nbehavior\nAPAR IC56277 - Command Server can loop with INQUIRE QS command with a single\nparameter\nAPAR IC56278 - A remote RUNMQSC DIS QS command always times out\nAPAR IC56309 - MCAs do not disconnect from some shared memory when ending,\nwhich causes a slow memory leak, and under some conditions an\nabend\nAPAR IC56458 - Channel Server loops after installing V5.3.1.2 due to corrupt\ndata on SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ\nAPAR IC56493 - Cannot use \"qualified\" hometerm device names with V5.3.1.2\nAPAR IC56503 - Channel Server and MCA can deadlock after repeated STOP CHANNEL\nMODE(FORCE) or MODE(TERMINATE) commands\nAPAR IC56536 - Unthreaded responder channels don't de-register from the EC when\nan error occurs during or before channel negotiation. For\nexample, bad initial data will cause this. Unthreaded MCAs\nbuild up and eventually reach the maximum which prevents further\nchannel starts\nAPAR IC56681 - C++ unthreaded Tandem-Float SRLs have undefined references\n\nAPAR IC56834 - endmqm -p can sometimes leave MCA processes running\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.3:\n\n663 - Guardian command line utility return status is not the same as the OSS\nutilities return status\n1402 - Add additional tracing when testing for inconsistencies in processing\na channel start in the Channel Server\n1416 - Ensure that the Channel Server can support the maximum BATCHSZ of 2000\n1446 - Pub \/ Sub command line utilities do not behave well if no broker has run\nsince the queue manager was created\n1470 - EC abends attempting to start a non-executable REPMAN\n1474 - Pub \/ Sub broker process handling corrections for the EC\n1476 - The EC checkpoints the number of threads running in agents incorrectly\n1477 - Enhancement to ecasvc utility: the creation date\/time of LQMAs, MCAs,\nand REPMEN are now displayed\n1487 - Enhancement to ecasvc utility: changed the display of Agent attributes\nto use the \"real\" qmproc.ini attribute names.

Reload CPUs.\n\nIf you use SNA channels with V5.3.1, we recommend the latest levels of the\nHP SNAX or ACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE) be used\nfor the SNA transport. The following versions were verified by IBM with this\nrelease of WMQ:\n\nACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE)\n- v4r1 on both HP Integrity NonStop Server and S-Series systems\n\nHP SNAX\n- T9096H01 on HP Integrity NonStop Server (H-Series) systems\n\nIf you use the WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS for HP NonStop Server\nyou will need to install HP NonStop Server for Java Version 1.4.2 or later.\nThe Java.pdf supplemental document in the <install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US\ndirectory has been updated in this release. Java\/JMS users should review the \nupdated document.\n\nUpgrading to V5.3.1.12\n---------------------\n\nFor systems running H Series operating systems, you may upgrade\nany prior service level of WebSphere MQ V5.3.1.x for HP NonStop Server to\nV5.3.1.12 level using this release. For NonStop BladeSystem running J series\noperating systems, you may upgrade from version V5.3.1.4 only, since V5.3.1.4\nis the earliest supported version on J series. If you need to perform a full\ninstallation on a J series system from the original installation media, see the\nsection later in this readme file for instructions.\n\nThe installation tool, svcmqm, is used to upgrade existing installations\nto this level. Additionally, the placed files for any prior level of V5.3.1\ncan be overlaid with the new files from V5.3.1.12 and then instmqm can be used\nto create new installations at the updated V5.3.1.12 level.\n\nYou must end all queue managers and applications in an installation if you\nwant to upgrade that installation to V5.3.1.12.\n\nYou do not need to re-create any queue managers to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.\nExisting queue managers (at any V5.3.1.x service level) will work with\nV5.3.1.12 once an installation has been properly upgraded.\n\nIf you use SSL channels, and are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, you must perform\na small reconfiguration of the Certificate store before running any SSL\nchannels after you have upgraded. The steps that are required are described\nbelow in the Post-Installation section. If you do not perform this\nreconfiguration, SSL channels in the upgraded V5.3.1.12 installation will\nfail with the log messages similar to the following:\n\nFor sender channels:\n\n09\/29\/07 08:52:43 Process(0,483 $Z8206) User(MQM.ABAKASH) Program(amqrmppa)\nAMQ9621: Error on call to SSL function ignored on channel\n'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAn error indicating a software problem was returned from a function which is\nused to provide SSL support. The error code returned was '0xB084002'. The error\nwas reported by openssl module: SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations, with reason:\nsystem lib. The channel is 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'; in some cases its name cannot\nbe determined and so is shown as '????'. This error occurred during channel\nshutdown and may not be sufficiently serious as to interrupt future channel\noperation; Check the condition of the channel.\nACTION:\nIf it is determined that Channel operation has been impacted, collect the items\nlisted in the 'Problem determination' section of the System Administration\nmanual and contact your IBM support center.\n---- amqccisx.c : 1411 ------------------------------------------------------\n09\/29\/07 08:52:44 Process(0,483 $Z8206) User(MQM.ABAKASH) Program(amqrmppa)\nAMQ9001: Channel 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000' ended normally.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nChannel 'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000' ended normally.\nACTION:\nNone.\n\nFor client or receiver channels:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n09\/29\/07 08:05:28 Process(1,802 3 $X0545) User(MQM.HEMA) Program(amqrmppa_r)\nAMQ9620: Internal error on call to SSL function on channel '????'.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAn error indicating a software problem was returned from an function which is\nused to provide SSL support.

The channel is '????'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and\nso is shown as '????'. The channel did not start.\nACTION:\nCollect the items listed in the 'Problem determination' section of the System\nAdministration manual and contact your IBM support center.\n---- amqccisx.c : 1347 ------------------------------------------------------\n09\/29\/07 08:05:28 Process(1,802 3 $X0545) User(MQM.HEMA) Program(amqrmppa_r)\nAMQ9228: The TCP\/IP responder program could not be started.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAn attempt was made to start an instance of the responder program, but the\nprogram was rejected.\nACTION:\nThe failure could be because either the subsystem has not been started (in this\ncase you should start the subsystem), or there are too many programs waiting\n(in this case you should try to start the responder program later). The reason\ncode was 0.\n\nWMQ Application re-compile Considerations :\n\nYou do not need to re-compile any applications to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.\n\nWMQ Application linkage Considerations :\n\na) If upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases (including patch releases) :\n\nExisting applications will continue to work with V5.3.1.12 release. However, \nIBM strongly recommends that if you are upgrading from a release prior to \n5.3.1.7, you review the impact of APARs IC67057 and IC68569 that were fixed in\nthe V5.3.1.7 release. Please also note internal defect 4158 that is fixed in \nV5.3.1.11. The IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158 fixes will not be \neffective in non-native applications unless the applications are relinked \nusing the HP BIND utility. \n\nb) If upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier releases (including patch releases) :\n\nYou MUST use the HP BIND utility to relink any non-native applications prior\nto using them with V5.3.1.12. If an application is not re-bound with the \nV5.3.1.12 WMQ product, MQCONN API calls will fail with a MQRC 2059 and the \nWMQ EC process will output an FDC when the MQI incompatibility is detected, \nas follows:\n\nProbe Id :- EC075003\nComponent :- ecaIsECup\nComment1 :- Application MQ API not compatible, relink application\nComment2 :- <process cpu,pid process name>\nComment3 :- <application executable name>\n\nInstallation from Electronic Software Download H or J Series based systems\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server,\nVersion 5.3.1.12, from the package downloaded from IBM. Please note the\nadditional restrictions for upgrading J Series systems to this version.\n\nUse svcmqm to update an existing installation from the V5.3.1.12 placed files.\n\n1. Unzip the fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 - this README\nwmq53.1.12_H07.tar.Z - H-Series H06 Package\n\n2. Identify the correct fixpack package to install:\n\nFor H-Series (H06) or J-Series systems (J06) use: wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n3. Upload the compressed fixpack archive to the OSS file system in binary mode.\nYou may wish to store the compressed archive, and the expanded contents\nin a location where you archive software distributions from IBM.\nIf you do this, you should store the compressed archive in a directory\nthat identifies the version of the software it contains,\nfor example, \"V53112\".\n\nmkdir -p \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nupload (in binary mode) the correct compressed tarfile to this directory\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\ntar xvof wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n5. Locate your WMQ V5.3.1.x installation(s). The service installation procedure\nrequires the full OSS path names of the opt\/mqm and var\/mqm directories for\neach WMQ installation to which the fixpack will be installed.\n\n6. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n7. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n\nEnsure all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ installation\nare ended.\ndspmq\n\nEnsure that the WMQ installation is at a suitable V5.3.1 level.\nmqver -V\nSee later notes concerning version requirements for NonStop BladeSystem\ninstallation.\n\n8. End any non-Pathway listeners for Queue Managers defined in the\nWQM installation:\nendmqlsr -m <qmgr name>\n\n9. Verify that no files in the Guardian subvolumes of the installation to\nbe updated are open. The installation cannot proceed safely unless all\nfiles in these subvolumes are closed. Use the TACL command 'FUP LISTOPENS'\nfor the files in all three subvolumes - an absence of output indicates\nthat no files are open. If files are shown to be open, use the output\nfrom the command to identify processes that are holding files open.\n\n\n10. Backup your WMQ Installation; the fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\ninstmqm -b can be used to back up an installation. Please refer\nto the readme file included with release WMQ V5.3.1.\n\n11. Install the fixpack by running the supplied service tool (svcmqm).\nSvcmqm requires the location of the OSS var tree as well\nas the OSS opt tree. These locations can be supplied automatically by\nrunning svcmqm in an OSS shell where the environment variables for the\nWMQ installation being updated have been established (typically by\nsourcing \"wmqprofile\"). If this is the case, svcmqm does not require the\n-i and -v parameters. \n\nFor example:\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nopt\/mqm\/bin\/svcmqm -s \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/opt\/mqm\n\nIf the environment variables for the WMQ installation are not established in \nthe environment of svcmqm or if you want to update a WMQ installation other\nthan the one that your current WMQ environment variable points to, then \nthe locations of the OSS opt and var trees must be supplied explicitly using\nthe svcmqm command line parameters -i and -v.\n\nFor example:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nopt\/mqm\/bin\/svcmqm -s \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/opt\/mqm\n-i \/wmq1\/opt\/mqm\n-v \/wmq1\/var\/mqm\n\nsvcmqm will prompt to confirm the location of the OSS opt tree for the\ninstallation to be updated.\nType \"yes\" to proceed.\n\nSvcmqm will then update the installation. The current WMQCSTM file for\nthe installation will be renamed to BWMQCSTM as a backup copy, before it\nis regenerated. Note that any changes to the WMQCSTM file you have made\nwill not be copied to the new WMQCSTM file, however they will be preserved\nin the backup copy made before the WMQCSTM file was regenerated.\n\n12. Repeat Steps 5-11 for any other WMQ installations that you want to update\nwith this fixpack.\n\n13. You can install this fixpack in the WMQ placed installation files so that\nany future WMQ product installations will include the fixpack updates.\n\nTo do this, locate your WMQ placed installation filetree containing the\nopt directory, make this your current working directory (use 'cd') and\nthen unpack the contents of the tar archive for this fixpack over the placed\nfile tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V531, for a H-Series system:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V531\ntar xvof \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V5319\/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\nInitial Installation on a NonStop BladeSystem\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server on\na NonStop BladeSystem using the original installation media, in conjunction\nwith the 5.3.1.12 package downloaded from IBM. NonStop BladeSystem platforms\nare not supported prior to V5.3.1.4, and a \"from scratch\" installation requires\neither V5.3.1.4 or later files to be overlaid on a set of placed files\nfrom the base product media prior to performing the installation.\nYou do NOT need to perform these steps if you have already installed V5.3.1.4\non your NonStop BladeSystem. In this case, follow the standard installation\nsteps earlier in this readme file.\n\n1. Place the files for the Refresh Pack 1 (5.3.1.0) version of WebSphere MQ\n\nfor HP NonStop Server on the target system. Refer to the \"File Placement\"\nsection in Chapter 3 of the \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick\nBeginnings\" guide. Pages 11-13 describes how to place the files.\nDo not attempt to install the placed files using the instmqm script\nthat was provided with V5.3.1.0 at this time. The V5.3.1.0 version of\ninstmqm does not support installation on NonStop BladeSystem.\n\n2. Unzip the 5.3.1.12 fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 This README\nwmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z H-Series H06 Package\n\n3. This installation requires the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z package.\nLocate the WMQ placed installation filetree containing the opt directory\nprepared in step 1 above, and upload the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z fixpack\narchive to this location in binary mode.\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n5. Unpack the contents of the extracted tar archive for this FixPack over the\nplaced file tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation \/usr\/ibm\/wmq:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\ntar xvof \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n6. Use the extracted instmqm script in this FixPack to install the product\nusing the updated installation file tree and the instructions in Chapter 3\nof \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick Beginnings\" guide, pages 13-29.\nBefore beginning, review the list of changes to Chapter 3 detailed in the\n\"Documentation Updates\" section at the end of this README file. Note also\nthat the list of installed files displayed will differ from those shown in the\nexamples in the manual.\n\nPost-Installation\n-----------------\nIf upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, read the following post-installation instructions:\n\nNon-Native TNS Applications:\n\nRe-BIND any non-native (TNS) applications. See \"Upgrading to V5.3.1.12\" above \nfor more information.\n\nRe-binding non-native (TNS) is REQUIRED if upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier\nreleases but is RECOMMENDED if upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later fixpack for \nincorporation of APARs IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158. \n\nIf you use SSL channels and have not already installed V5.3.1.1:\n\nEdit the SSL certificate store, cert.pem and move all the CA certificates\nto a new file, trust.pem, stored in the same directory as cert.pem. The\nonly items that should remain in cert.pem are the queue manager's personal\ncertificate, and the queue manager's private key. These two items should\nbe located at the start of the cert.pem file. All other certificates\n(intermediate and root CAs) must be moved to trust.pem. The trust.pem file\nmust be in the same directory as cert.pem, as configured in the queue\nmanager's SSLKEYR attribute.\n\nUpdate the copy of the entropy daemon program that you run for SSL channels\non the system with the new version (...opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqjkdm0).\n\nEnable new support for Danish CCSID 65024:\n\nCustomers who wish to enable the new support for Danish CCSID 65024\nshould do the following to install the revised ccsid.tbl file:\n\nIssue the following commands on OSS:\n\n1. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n2. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n3. Source in the installation's wmqprofile\n. $MQNSKVARPATH\/wmqprofile\n4. cp -p $MQNSKOPTPATH\/samp\/ccsid.tbl $MQNSKVARPATH\/conv\/table\/\n5. Start queue managers\n\nGuardian C++ DLLs:\n\nEnsure that the WMQ Guardian C++ DLLs are 'executable' by using \"FUP ALTER\"\nto set their FILECODE to 800 (for H-Series or J-Series). Use commands similar \nto the following:\n\n1. Logon to TACL using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n2. OBEY your WMQ Installation's WMQCSTM file\n3. VOLUME [#param MQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G]\n4. FUP ALTER IMQI2,CODE 800\n5. FUP ALTER IMQI2T,CODE 800\n6. FUP ALTER IMQI3,CODE 800\n7. FUP ALTER IMQI3T,CODE 800\n8. Logoff\n\nGuardian Subvolume File Permissions\n\nThe WMQ Guardian Installation Subvolume and all WMQ Guardian Queue\nManager Subvolumes must accessible to both MQM group members\nand to users that run WMQ application programs.\n\nEnsure that:\n\nAll members of the MQM security group have read, write, execute\nand purge permission to these subvolumes.\n\nAll users that run WMQ application programs, have read, write\nand execute permission to these subvolumes\n\nRestart Queue Managers:\n\nRestart the queue managers for the installation you have\nupdated with this fixpack.\n\nUNINSTALLATION INFORMATION\n==========================\n\nThis fixpack cannot be automatically uninstalled if a problem occurs\nduring the update of an installation using svcmqm.\n\nYou should use the instmqm -b option to create a backup of an\ninstallation before applying the service. If a problem occurs\nor you need to reverse the upgrade at a later date, use the\ninstmqm -x option to restore a backup of the installation at the\nprior service level.\n\nKNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\n===========================================\n\nThis section details known limitation, problems, and workarounds for\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n1. The current implementation of Publish \/ Subscribe is restricted to run\nwithin a single CPU. The control program and all \"worker\" programs run in\nthe CPU that was used to run the 'strmqbrk' command.\nThe Publish\/Subscribe broker does not automatically recover in the event\nof CPU failures.\n\n2. The current memory management implementation in the Queue Server limits\nthe total amount of non-persistent message data that can be stored on all\nthe queues hosted by a single Queue Server to less than 1Gb. The limit of\nnon-persistent message data on a single queue can not exceed approximately\n1Gb therefore, even if a single Queue Server is dedicated to that queue.\n\n3. The number of threads in threaded agent processes (LQMAs or MCAs) or in MQI\napplications, is limited to a maximum of 1000 by the limit on open depth of\nthe HP TMF T-file.\n\n4. API exits are not supported for non-native (TNS) applications. Any other\nexit code for non-native applications must be statically bound with the\nTNS application.\n\n5. Cluster workload exits are only supported in \"trusted\" mode. This means\nthat a separate copy of each exit will run in each CPU and exit code in\none CPU cannot communicate with exit code in another CPU using the normal\nmethods provided for these exits.\n\n6. Upgmqm will not migrate the following data from a V5.1 queue manager:\nmessages stored in Message Overflow files (typically persistent messages\nover 200,000 bytes in size) will not be migrated. If the option to\nmigrate message data was selected, the upgrade will fail. if the option\nto migrate message data was not selected, the upgrade will not be\naffected by the presence of message overflow files.\nclustering configuration data - all cluster related attributes of objects\nwill be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue manager.\nSNA channel configuration - channels will be migrated, but several of the\nattributes values will need to be changed manually after the upgrade.\nchannel exit data - attributes in channels that relate to channel exit\nconfiguration will be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue\nmanager.\nIn all cases where upgmqm cannot migrate data completely, a warning message\nis generated on the terminal output as well as in the log file. These can\nbe reviewed carefully after the upgrade completes for further actions that\nmay be necessary.\n\n7. Java and JMS limitations\n\nThe Java and JMS Classes do not support client connections. WebSphere MQ\nfor HP NonStop Server does not support XA transaction management, so the\nJMS XA classes are not available. For more detail, please refer to the\nJava and JMS documentation supplement, Java.pdf.\n\n8. Control commands in Guardian (TACL) environment do not obey the RUN option\n\"NAME\" as expected\n\nA Guardian control command starts an OSS process to run the actual\ncontrol command - and waits for it to complete. When the NAME option is\nused, the Guardian control command process uses the requested name, but\nthe OSS process cannot and is instead named by NonStop OS.\n\nIf the Guardian control command is prematurely stopped by the operator\n(using the TACL STOP command for example) the OSS process running the\nactual control command may continue to run. The OSS process may need to be\nstopped separately and in addition to the Guardian process.\n\n9. Trace doesn't end automatically after a queue manager restart\n(APAR IC53352) and trace changes do not take effect immediately\n\nIf trace is active and a queue manager is restarted, the trace settings\nshould be reset to not trace any more. Instead, the queue manager\ncontinues tracing using the same options as before it was restarted.\nThe workaround is to disable trace using endmqtrc before ending, or while\nthe queue manager is ended.\n\nAlso, changes to trace settings do not always take effect immediately\nafter the command is issued. For example, it could be several MQI calls\nlater that the change takes effect. The maximum delay between making a\ntrace settings change and the change taking effect would be until the end\nof the queue manager connection, or the ending of a channel.\n\n10. Some EMS events generated to default collector despite an alternate\ncollector being configured (APAR IC53005)\n\nAn EMS event message \"FFST record created\" is generated using the OSS\nsyslog() facility whenever an FDC is raised by a queue manager. This\nEMS event cannot be disabled, and goes to the default collector $0. For\nOSS processes, an alternate collector process can be specified by\nincluding an environment variable in the context of these processes\nas in the following example:\n\nexport EMS_COLLECTOR=\\$ALT\n\nGuardian processes always use the default collector because HP do not\nprovide the ability to modify the collector in the Guardian environment.\nHP is investigating if a change is possible. No fix for this problem\nhas yet been identified.\n\n11. The use of SMF (virtual) disks with WMQ is not supported on Release\nVersion Updates prior to H06.26 and J06.15 because of restrictions\nimposed by the OSS file system. For more details, please refer to the\nHP NonStop Storage Management Foundation User's Guide Page 2-12.\n\n12. The maximum channel batch size that can be configured (BATCHSZ attribute)\nis 2000. If you need to run channels with batch sizes greater than 680\nyou must increase the maximum message length attribute of the\nSYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ to 60000.\n\ne.g. from RUNMQSC - ALTER QL (SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ) MAXMSGL (60000)\n\n13. The SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ is a critical system queue for operation of\nthe queue manager and should not be altered to disable MQGET or MQPUT\noperations, or to reduce the maximum message size or maximum depth\nattributes from their defaults.\n\n14. Currently, the cluster transmission queue (SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE)\ncannot be moved to an alternative Queue Server because it is constantly\nopen by several internal components. The following procedure (which\nrequires a \"quiet\" queue manager, and a queue manager restart) can be\nused to achieve this reconfiguration. Do not use this procedure on a\nqueue manager that is running in production. Read and understand the\nprocedure carefully first since it includes actions that cause\ninternal errors to be generated in the queue manager.\n\n1\/ Rename the OSS repository executable (opt\/mqm\/bin directory)\nmv amqrrmfa amqrrmfax \n2\/ From OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nwhere X is the Queue Manager name.\n3\/ kill -9 those processes returned from step 2\nAt this point the EC will start continuously generating FDCs and\nlog messages as it attempts to, and fails, to restart the repository\nservers that were stopped. Perform the remaining steps in this\nprocedure without delay to avoid problems with excessive logging\nsuch as disk full conditions.\n4. Verify the processes are stopped\nFrom OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nWhere X is the Queue Manager name\n5. Issue the altmqfls --server command to move the cluster transmission\nqueue to an alternate queue server\n6. Issue dspmqfls to verify the alternate server assignment\n7. Rename the OSS repository executable back to the expected name\nmv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa\n8. End the queue manager using preemptive shutdown. The EC will generate\nFDCs ending because of the earlier attempts to start a repository\nmanager while the executable was renamed. There will be FDCs and\nEC Primary process failover\n\nComponent :- xcsExecProgram\nProbe Description :- AMQ6025: Program not found\nComment1 :- No such file or directory\nComment2 :- \/opt\/mqm\/bin\/amqrrmfa\n...\nAMQ8846: MQ NonStop Server takeover initiated\nAMQ8813: EC has started takeover processing\nAMQ8814: EC has completed takeover processing\n...\nThe EC may have to be manually TACL stopped if quiesce or immediate\nend is used thus the need for the preemptive shutdown\nendmqm -p <qmgr name>\n9. Rename the repository manager executable to the original name\nmv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa\n10. Restart the queue manager\nstrmqm <qmgr name>\n\n15. In Guardian\/TACL environments, support for some WMQ command-line programs\nhas been deprecated for WMQ Fixpack 5.3.1.3 and later.\n\nThe affected command-line programs are:\n\namqoamd\namqrdbgm\namqrfdm\ncrtmqcvx\nendmqlsr\nrunmqchi\nrunmqchl\nrunmqdlq\nrunmqlsr\nrunmqtrm\n\nThese programs will continue to function for now, however their use in\nGuardian\/TACL environments is discouraged. Support for these programs\nin Guardian\/TACL environments may be withdrawn completely in a future\nWMQ 5.3 release\/fixpack.\n\nIBM recommends that customers use the OSS version of these programs instead.\n\nCustomers who want to route output from WMQ OSS tools to VHS or other Guardian\ncollectors should use the OSSTTY utility. OSSTTY is a standard utility\nprovided by OSS and is described in the HP publication \"Open System Services\nManagement and Operations Guide\".\n\nNote: See Item 3. in \"Known problems and workarounds\" for a description of\nrestrictions when using the MQ Broker administration commands in the\nGuardian\/TACL environment.\n\n16. Do not use WebSphere MQ with a $CMON process that alters attributes of WMQ\nprocesses (for example the processor, priority, process name or program\nfile name) when they are started. This is not a supported environment since\nthere are components in WMQ that rely on these attributes being set as\nspecified by WMQ for their correct operation.\n\n17. Support for forked processes\n\nMQI Support from forked processes in OSS is subject to the following\nrestrictions:\n1. If forking is used, MQI operations can be performed only from child\nprocesses. Using MQI verbs from a parent process that forks child\nprocesses is not supported and will result in unpredictable\nbehavior.\n\n2. Use of the MQI from forked processes where the parent or child is\nthreaded is not supported.\n\n18. TMF Outage handling\n\nTMF outage handling was significantly improved with V5.3.1.4, however there\nis still a limitation in V5.3.1.6 and later to be aware of:\n\n1. If a STOP TMF, ABRUPT command is issued, TMF marks all open audited\nfiles as corrupt and the queue manager cannot perform further\nprocessing until this condition is rectified by restarting TMF.\nIn this state, the queue manager will freeze further operation, and log\nthe condition in the queue manager log file every 10 seconds for a\nmaximum of 50 attempts. Whether or not TMF is restored within this\ntimeframe, the WMQ queue manager should be restarted to reduce the risk\nof any undetected damage persisting.\n\n19. Triggering HP NSS non-C Guardian applications\n\nThe MQ default Trigger Monitor process, runmqtrm, at present cannot\ndirectly trigger the following application types:\n\nGuardian TACL scripts or macro file\nCOBOL application\nTAL application\nAn OSS script file (wmqtrig) provides indirect support for these\nfiles types. To use this script, the PROCESS definition APPLTYPE should\nbe set to UNIX, and the APPLICID should refer to the script as in\nthe following examples:\n\nFor a TACL script called \"trigmacf\":\nAPPLICID('\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -c \\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\nFor a COBOL or TAL application called \"mqsecha\":\nAPPLICID('\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -p \/G\/data06\/fp4psamp\/mqsecha')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\n\nNotes:\n1. TACL scripts use the wmqtrig script with a \"-c\" option.\nThe -c option should use the Guardian representation for file name\nof the TACL script file, with the special character ($) escaped,\nfor example:\n\n\\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf\n\n2. COBOL and TAL applications use the wmqtrig script with a \"-p\" option.\nThe -p option must use the OSS representation for the file name of\nthe application, for example:\n\n\/G\/data06\/fp4psamp\/mqsecha\n\n3. C applications can be triggered directly by specifying\n\nAPPLICID('$DATA06.FP4PSAMP.MQSECHA')\nAPPLTYPE(NSK)\n\nTo trigger a PIC application using the WMQ Pathway MQS-TRIGMON00\nserverclass, a DEFINE is required:\n\n=_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 <Guardian MQ binary Volume.Subvolume>\n\nFor example:\nALTER MQS-TRIGMON00,\nDEFINE =_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 $DATA06.FP4PBIN\n\n4. If the \"-p\" option is used, gtacl passes the complete MQTMC2 structure\ntext (which is 560 bytes) to the application being triggered, whereas if\nthe \"-c\" option is used, limitations in TACL will cause the triggered \napplication to receive 520 bytes only.\nApplications intended to be triggered using -p option must handle the \ncomplete 560 character startup character string.\nThis can cause problems, particularly with COBOL applications;\nSince a COBOL GETSTARTUPTEXT call can process only 529 characters,\ntriggering a COBOL application with the -p option (560 character startup\nstring) can result in a memory overwrite and application abend.\nIn this case, the -c option should be used instead of the -p option.\"\n\n20. Maximum numnber of LQMA processes\n\nThe maximum number of LQMA processes per queue manager is 1417. Attempts to\nconfigure a MaxUnthreadedAgents value of 1418 or greater in the qmproc.ini file\nwill result in FDCs when the queue manager attempts to start the 1418th LQMA.\n\n21. Limitation on ProcessNameRoot values in qmproc.ini file\n\nThe ProcessNameRoot value used in the qmproc.ini file for the MCA, LQMA and \nRepositoryManager stanzas must be unique across all queue managers in all\ninstallations on the system. If the values are not unique, two queue \nmanagers attempting to create a new process name at the same time may attempt\nto use the same sequence of names, resulting in heavy load on the OSS\nnameserver and\/or FDCs with probes EC062000 from eclStartMCA or EC065000 from\neclStartLQMA. This may result in the queue manager becoming unresponsive.\n\n22. BIND\/REPLACE Warning 9\n\nThe use of BIND\/REPLACE when re-binding non-native (TNS) applications with \nthe latest WMQ TNS Library is supported, however, when using this command, \nyou may encounter many Bind 'warning 9' messages. These warnings are safe to\nignore, as the changes made in the MQMTNS library are completely contained\nwithin that library and there is no external affect on an application that\nwould link with that library. Please refer to document \nID mmr_ns-4.0.6050052.2565545 in KBNS which has been updated by HP to include\nthis information. \n\n23. PING CHANNEL uses the =TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE as opposed to the \nvalue set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nIf the TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE is invalid, attempts to issue a \nPING CHANNEL request will fail with the following message -\n\":AMQ9212: A TCP\/IP socket could not be allocated.\"\n\n24. Using multiple cluster receiver channels for a queue manager can cause the \nmaster and slave repository managers to get out of sync in some configurations, \nthis results in FFSTs from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket with Comment1 field \n\"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=xx\".\nThe root cause of this problem has not been identified definitively, but it is\nrecommended that cluster configurations do not use multiple cluster receiver \nchannels for the same cluster on a given queue manager.\n\n25. Format 2 Queue and Queue overflow files are not supported\n\nIf an attempt is made to use altmqfls to change extent size or max extents of \na Queue or Queue overflow file such that the new file size would require a\nformat 2 file, the attempt will fail and an FDC file containing the following\n\nProbe Id :- XC066050 \nComponent :- xgcDupPartFile \n... \nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_RC \nMinor Errorcode :- krcE_UNEXPECTED_ERROR \nProbe Description :- AMQ6118: An internal WMQ error has occurred \n(20800893) \n...\nArith1 :- 545261715 20800893 \n\n26. RUNMQSC DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL can return only 500 handles\n\nThe current implementation of DISPLAY QSTATUS can handle only 500 queue\nhandles. In prior releases, executing the command in a scenario where there\nwere more than 500 handles resulted in an error return and large numbers of \nFFSTs (see internal defect 2230 earlier in this readme). These errors are the\nresult of a design limitation with the DISPLAY QSTATUS implementation. \nThe processing of the command has been modified to handle the scenario cleanly\nand return only the first 500 handles retrieved, as supported by the design.\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n------------------------------\n1. FDCs from Component xcsDisplayMessage reporting xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nOn RVUs H06.06 and later:\n\nThese FDCs occur frequently on queue manager shutdown, and at times during\nqueue manager start, from processes that write to the queue manager log\nfiles at these times, typically the cluster repository cache manager\n(amqrrmfa) and the EC (MQECSVR). No functional problem is caused by these\nFDCs, except that the queue manager log file misses some log messages\nduring queue manager shutdown. The FDCs report an unexpected return code\nfrom the HP lseek() function. An example of an FDC demonstrating this\nproblem follows:\n\nProbe Id :- XC022011\nComponent :- xcsDisplayMessage\nProgram Name :- $DATA06.RP1PBIN.MQECSVR\nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nMQM Function Stack\nnspPrimary\neclShutdownOK\nxcsDisplayMessageForSubpool\nxcsDisplayMessage\nxcsFFST\n\n6fffe660 000011FA ....\n6fffe670 2F686F6D 652F726F 622F4D51 \/home\/test\/MQ\n6fffe680 352E332F 5250312F 50726F64 2F776D71 5.3\/RP1\/Prod\/wmq\n6fffe690 2F766172 2F6D716D 2F716D67 72732F51 \/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/Q\n6fffe6a0 4D312F65 72726F72 732F414D 51455252 M1\/errors\/AMQERR\n6fffe6b0 30312E4C 4F47 01.LOG\n\nThis problem is fixed by the following HP SPRs\n\nT8620ACL (OSSFS) for G06 HP OS\nT8620ACM (OSSFS) for H06 HP OS\n\n2. APAR IC54594 - EC abends with non-MQM user running application from non-MQM\ndirectory.\n\nStatically-bound TNS applications that are not relinked after installing \nFixpack 5.3.1.4 have additional considerations. For these applications, \nqmproc.ini Application Rules 2 and 4 will not work if the application \nis located in a non-MQM directory.\n\n3. The Guardian control commands for the Publish \/ Subscribe broker\n(strmqbrk, endmqbrk, dspmqbrk ... etc) will not work correctly unless they\nare run in the same CPU as the broker is running in, or was last running in.\n\nPlease use the equivalent OSS commands instead of the Guardian versions, or\nensure that the Guardian Publish \/ Subscribe broker commands run in the same\nCPU as the broker was or is running in.\n\n4. Queue managers occasionally do not delete Temporary Dynamic Queues the \nwhen the last application closes them. The cause of this is unknown at present.\nThe problem is rare and unlikely to cause significant impact on queue \nmanager operation unless the queues are present in very large numbers.\nQueues orphaned in this way cannot be used by applications, and are removed\nunconditionally as a part of the normal garbage collection activity during \na queue manager restart.\n\nDOCUMENTATION UPDATES\n=====================\n\nPlease note that several supplements to the documentation have been provided\nwith fixpacks since V5.3 was originally released. These supplements have\nbeen released in Adobe Acrobat format and can found in the\nopt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory of any installation as well as the original\nsoftware distribution tree (placed files). The following supplements have\nbeen released to date (the name of the file describes the content):\n\nExits.pdf\nJava.pdf\nPubsub.pdf\nSNAChannels.pdf\nSSLUpdate.pdf\nUpgmqmreadme.pdf\nSdcp.pdf\n\nAlso please note that the current published versions of the cross-platform\n(\"family\") books contain references to the IBM MQSeries V5.1 for Compaq NSK\nproduct which is the previous major version of WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop\nServer. Consequently, these references may not be accurate with respect to\nthe functional support provided by V5.3.1.\n\nWebsphere MQ Programmable Command Formats and Administration Interface\n(SC34-6060-03)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 3 - PCF Commands and Responses in Groups\n\nPage 19: Add \"Refresh Queue manager\" as a supported command\n\nChapter 4 - Definitions of Programmable Command Formats\n\nPage 173: Add the following new command:\n\nRefresh Qmgr\n\nThe Refresh Qmgr (MQCMD_REFRESH_Q_MGR) command refreshes the\nExecution Controller (EC) process management rules.\n\nThis PCF is supported only on WebSphere MQ V5.3 HP NonStop Server.\n\nRequired parameters:\nNone\n\nOptional parameters:\nNone\n\nError codes\n\nThis command might return the following in the response format\nheader, in addition to the values shown on page 18.\n\nReason (MQLONG)\n\nThe value can be:\nMQRCCF_PARM_COUNT_TOO_BIG\n\nParameter count too big.\n\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server Quick Beginnings (GC34-6626-00)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 1 - Planning to install WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 1: the baseline release level for V5.3.1 on the HP Integrity NonStop\nServer is now H06.05.01\nPage 1: the typical approximate storage requirements are as follows:\n+ OSS files placed before installation:\nH-Series: 160Mb\n+ For each installation:\nH-Series: Guardian 220Mb, OSS 350Mb, Total 570Mb\n+ For each queue manager:\nH-Series: Guardian 9.5Mb, OSS 0.2Mb, Total 10Mb\nPages 2 & 3: please review the section \"Hardware and Software\nRequirements\" in these release notes for the details of all other updated\nrequirements\nChapter 3 - Installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 12: Product Selection dialog. The names of the products have been\nupdated to \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1\" and \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 Integrity\".\nPage 14: instmqm now includes the function of creating an automatic\nbackup archive of a successful installation, as follows:\nInstmqm has been enhanced to provide the ability to back-out an ungrade\ninstallation, and the ability to archive and restore installations\nindividually. Before instmqm starts to make changes to a system, it will\nautomatically create an archive of the current installation (OSS opt tree\nand Guardian installation subvolumes only) in the root directory\ncontaining the opt tree in OSS. If a failure occurs during installation,\nand instmqm has made changes, the user will be asked if they wish to\nrestore the installation to its original state using the archive created\nbefore changes were made. At the end of a successful installation,\ninstmqm will now automatically create a backup archive of the new\ninstallation.\n\nInstmqm also supports two new command line options to support creating\nand using backup archives independently from an installation:\n\n-b create a backup archive of the installation\n-x restore an installation from a backup archive\n\nThese options may not be combined with any other options. Both options\nrequire the user to respond to questions at the terminal.\n\nA backup archive file is an OSS pax file, created as follows:\n\n+ the Guardian PAK utility is used to create a backup of the three\nGuardian subvolumes for the installation in a file named \"WMQSAVED\"\n+ the PAK backup file is copied to the OSS opt directory of the\ninstallation that is being archived\n+ the entire OSS opt tree of the installation (which now includes\nWMQSAVED) is then archived by the OSS pax utility\n\nBackup archive files are always created in the directory that holds the\nOSS opt tree for the installation. Archive files created automatically\nby instmqm are named \"mqarchive-yymmdd-hhmmss\" where \"yymmdd\" and\n\"hhmmss\" are numeric strings of the date and time that the backup archive\nwas created - for example: \"mqarchive-061005-143606\".\n\nPage 15: instmqm has new command line options as described in these\nrelease notes for creating and restoring backup archives\nPage 17: the SnaProviderName and TcpProviderName fields of the\nQmgrDefaults stanza in the instmqm response file are used to populate\nthe proc.ini file to provide installation wide defaults for channels.\nPlease note that these fields do not get used for the default listener\nconfiguration either on the command line (runmqlsr) or in the queue\nmanager's Pathway environment. Users must manually configure the\ntransport names for all listeners.\nPage 28: in addition to the manual methods for cleaning up after a failed\ninstallation, instmqm will offer the option to restore the previous\ninstallation from a backup archive in the event of a failure while\nupgrading a V5.3 installation to V5.3.1 level. These release notes\ndescribe the additional function.\nIf an installation was initially created without SSL (selection of the\ninstallation type \"CORE\" for instmqm), the following procedure can be\nused to update the installation to include SSL components. In the\ninstructions below, <MQInstall> refers to the location of the\ninstallation that needs to be updated and <PlacedInstall> means the\nlocation of the complete set of placed files for the level of WMQ that\ncorresponds to the installation being updated. All queue managers\nmust be ended before attempting this procedure.\n1. mkdir <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n2. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n3. cp <PlacedInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/* <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n4. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amq*\"...\n5. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/openssl <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\n6. chmod 664 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/openssl\n7. chmod 774 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/openssl\n8. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqjkdm0 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\n9. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/amqjkdm0\n10. mv <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_nossl\n11. mv <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r_nossl\n12. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqccssl <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca\n13. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqccssl_r\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r\n14. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca*\n15.

Please see Chapter 12\n\nTransactional Support - Configuring TMF for WebSphere MQ for\ninformation on how to calculate the correct values. The HP TMF Planning\nand Configuration Guide describes the subject of resource managers and\nheterogeneous transaction processing.\n\nChapter 9 - Configuring WebSphere MQ\n\nPage 119: the CPUS section should state that the default can be\noverridden using the crtmqm -nu parameter. See Chapter 18 - The control\ncommands for a description of how to use this parameter with crtmqm.\nPage 120: the section describing the ARGLIST attribute of a TCP\/IP\nListener should also mention the use of the optional -u parameter to\nconfigure channels started by the listener as unthreaded processes.\nThe default is to run incoming channels as threads in an MCA process.\nPage 130: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\nPage 133: Figure 23 remove :\nOAM Manager stanza #\nOamManager:\nPage 136: the Exit properties section should state that the only\n\nsupported way of configuring and running a Cluster Workload (CLWL) Exit\nfor HP NonStop Server is in FAST mode. The CLWLMode setting in qm.ini\nis required to be set to FAST, which is the default for WebSphere MQ\non this platform.\nPage 139: the MQIBindType attribute of the Channels stanza is set by\ncrtmqm to FASTPATH. This should not be changed, except under the\ndirection of IBM Service.\nPage 140: the AdoptNewMCA=FASTPATH option is always required for\nthis platform in order for the adoption of MCAs to be effective. The\n\"Attention!\" box after the description of the FASTPATH option should\nbe ignored.\nPage 140: add the following description of the ClientIdle attribute:\nClientIdle=seconds\n\nClientIdle specifies the number of seconds of inactivity to permit\nbetween client application MQI calls before WebSphere MQ terminates\nthe client connection. The default is to not terminate client\nconnections however long they remain inactive. When a client connection\nis terminated because of idle activity, the client application receives\na connection broken result (2009) on its next MQI call.\n\nChapter 11 - Working with the WebSphere MQ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support\n\nA documentation supplement has been written to replace the sections on\nPage 170 (Preparing the queue manager's SSL files) to Page 176 (Building\nand verifying the sample configuration) because of changes to the files\nthat WebSphere MQ uses to hold certificates. The documentation supplement\nis called SSLupdate.pdf, and can be found in the opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US\ndirectory of an installation.\n\nChapter 12 - Transactional Support\n\nPage 185: The descriptions of the TMF attribute RMOPENPERCPU in the\n\nResource manager configuration section is modified as follows:\nRMOPENPERCPU\n\nEach WebSphere MQ thread or process that handles transactions has\nan open of a Volatile Resource Manager in the CPU it runs in. In\naddition, each application thread or process using the MQI also has\nan open. The minimum requirement for this configuration parameter\n\nis therefore the sum of:\n+ all Queue Server processes in that CPU\n+ all LQMA and MCA threads running in that CPU\n+ all MQI application threads running in that CPU\n+ 10 (to account for miscellaneous queue manager processes that\ncould be running in that CPU)\nYou should calculate the peak values of these numbers across all CPUs\nand add a safety margin to arrive at the correct value for your system.\nThe HP default value of 128 for this parameter is often suitable for\nsmall configurations, but unsuitable for medium or large ones.\n\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor Configuring TMF:\nIf the RMOPENPERCPU value is not configured to allow sufficient opens\nof resource managers in a CPU, WebSphere MQ connections will fail with\nan unexpected return code, and FDCs will be generated reporting an\nerror with the TMF_VOL_RM_OPEN_. The workaround is to distribute\napplications and queue manager processes in the CPU that exceeds\nthe limit to other CPUs. The correct remedy is to schedule an outage\nand modify the TMF configuration.\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor configuring TMF:\nIf TMF is stopped, or new transactions are disabled, and WMQ requires\nan internal \"unit of work\" (TMF transaction) to perform an update to\na protected resource requested by an MQI call, that call will fail\nand the reason code returned will be MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE (2255).\n\nNote that in some cases, updates to protected resources may be\nrequired by MQI operations do not directly perform messaging\noperations - for example, MQOPEN of a model queue that creates a\npermanent dynamic queue. If MQI calls return MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE,\ncheck the status of the TMF subsystem to determine the likely cause.\n\nChapter 14 - Process Management\n\nPage 197: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\n\nPage 200 and 204: the default value for the maximum number of unthreaded\nagents is now 200.

This supplement has been extensively revised for V5.3.1.1\nto clarify the requirements and process for creating and integrating\nexits with WebSphere MQ.\n\nAppendix B - Directory structure\n\nPages 430 and 431: there is a new G symbolic link to the Guardian\nsubvolume containing the product executables in\n...\/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/@SYSTEM\nPage 431: the content of the ssl directory is revised with V5.3.1.1\nas follows:\nThis directory contains up to four files used by the SSL support:\n\nThe queue manager certificate and private key store (cert.pem)\nThe trusted certificates store (trust.pem)\nThe pass phrase stash file for the queue managers certificate\nand private key store (Stash.sth)\nThe certificate revocation list file (optional - crl.pem)\n\nAppendix F - Environment variables\n\nPage 446: there are several environment variables that are used by the\nGuardian sample build scripts to locate the header files and the\nlibraries. Suitable settings for these are established in the\nWMQCSTM file (in the Guardian samples subvolume). The environment\nvariables, and their meanings, are:\nMQNSKOPTPATH^INC^G include file\/header subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^BIN^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^SAMP^G samples subvolume\n\nIn addition, an HP environment variable is also required (and set in\nWMQCSTM) that locates the OSS DLLs for dynamic loading from Guardian.\nThe environment variable is ^RLD^FIRST^LIB^PATH.\n\nPage 468: add after the \"Queue Server Tuning parameters\" section\n\nQueue Manager Server tuning parameters\n\nMQQMSHKEEP If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass, its value\nspecifies a numeric value in seconds to override the default housekeeping\ninterval of the queue manager server. The default interval is 60 seconds.\nThe housekeeping interval controls how frequently the queue manager\nserver generates expiration reports. The permitted range of values is 1-300.\nValues outside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\nMQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass,\nits value specifies a numeric value to override the default maximum number\nof expiration report messages that are generated during housekeeping\noperations by a queue manager server. The default maximum number of expiration\nmessages generated is 100. The permitted range of values is 1-99999. Values\noutside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\n\nAppendix H - Building and running applications\n\nBuilding C++ applications,\n\nTable 47 - there is no multi-threaded library support in\nGuardian so there should not be an entry for a\nmulti-threaded guardian library\n\nTable 48 - the name of this table should be \"Native non-PIC\"\n\nReferences to G\/lib symbolic links have changed with WMQ 5.3.1 to lib\/G\n\nNote that the MQNSKVARPATH and MQNSKOPTPATH environment variables must\nbe established in the environment, before an application starts up.\nThey cannot be programmatically set once a program is running by using\nputenv().\n\nPage 461: Building COBOL applications\n\nAdd the following text:\n\n\"In both the OSS and Guardian environment, the CONSULT compiler\ndirective referencing the MQMCB import library must now be used along\nwith correct linker options.

This supplement has been\nextensively revised for V5.3.1.1 to clarify the requirements and process\nfor creating and integrating exits with WebSphere MQ.\nThe description of compile options for PIC unthreaded, threaded and\nGuardian dlls in this document is incorrect. The option specified as\n\"-export all\" should be \"-export_all\".\n\nAppendix K - Setting up communications\n\nPage 482: The TCP\/IP keep alive function\n\nBy default, the TCP\/IP keep alive function is not enabled. To enable\nthis feature, set the KeepAlive=Yes attribute in the TCP Stanza in the\nqm.ini file for the queue manager.\nIf this attribute it set to \"yes\" the TCP\/IP subsystem checks periodically\nwhether the remote end of a TCP\/IP connection is still available. If it is\nnot available, the channel using the connection ends.\nIf TCP stanza KeepAlive attribute is not present or is set to \"No\", the\nTCP\/IP subsystem will not check for disconnection of the remote end.\n\nChapter 9 \"Configuring WebSphere MQ\" page 140 describes the TCP stanza\nattributes.\n\nAPAR IC58859: wmqtrig script\nThe wmqtrig script processing the -c option, for triggering a TACL macro\/script\nfile, will not normally propagate the TMC data to the macro\/script file.\nSome applications may need the TMC for processing. A switch used in conjunction\nwith the -c option, -5.1, has been added which will pass the TMC data to a TACL\nmacro\/script file with the wmqtrig script. Define the APPLICID attribute with\nthe -5.1 switch, for example:\nAPPLICID(\/wmq\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -5.1 -c \\$data06.test.trigmac)\n\nSSLupdate.pdf page 7\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SSLupdate.pdf document was first released with Fixpack 5.3.1.1\n\nThe SSL test scripts expect that a default TCP\/IP process ($ZTC0) is\nconfigured on the system to be used during the test. The configuration\nwill need modification if a non-default TCP\/IP process does not exist\non the system or another TCP\/IP process is used to communicate with the\npartner system. The ALICE.sh and\/or BOB.sh scripts that setup of the\nlistener (runmqlsr) will need modification to add the -g option to use a\nnon-default TCP\/IP process.\n\nCONTACTING IBM SOFTWARE SUPPORT\n===============================\n\nIBM Software Support provides assistance with product defects.

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z\/OS Java SDK z\/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q111","question":"StaleConnectionException errors with BPM databases\n\nThere is much published documentation about stale connections to databases on the web, and yet stale connections continue to be a very common problem, at least with BPM databases.

To make the updates, download the Process Designer file again and run the installation. Only the fixes or changes are applied.\n\n\nAbout this task\nWhen you install the fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, the IBM Process Designer.zip file is updated also. You must download it and install the updated Process Designer to the directory where you already installed Process Designer.\n\n\nProcedure \n\n 1. Open the Process Center.\n    \n    \n 2. Click the IBM Process Designer Download option. \n    \n    \n 3. When you are prompted, save the IBM Process Designer.zip file to your file system. This file contains everything that you need to install and run IBM Process Designer. Depending on your network connection, the download might take several minutes to complete.\n    \n    \n 4. Extract the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file to a temporary directory on your file system.\n    \n    \n 5. Open a command window and change to the directory where you extracted the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file. \n    \n    \n    Important: If you are running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008, right-click the command prompt and select Run as administrator.\n    \n    \n 6. Run one of the following commands to update the Process Designer. Use the same command that you used to install the Process Designer.  * Default location (C:\\IBM\\ProcessDesigner\\v8.5)  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat \n        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat\n          \n          \n       \n       \n     * Different location  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat install_location \n        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat install_location\n          \n          \n       \n       If the location has spaces in the directory name, put the whole location in quotation marks. The following examples show how to install to a different location.  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat D:\\IBM\\PD \n        * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat \"D:\\Process Designer\\\"\n       \n       \n    \n    \n\n\nResults \nIBM Process Designer is updated. Only the fixes or changes are applied. Installation messages are recorded in the %TEMP%\\IBMProcessDesignerInstall.log file, where the %TEMP% variable is typically set to C:\\Documents and Settings\\current_user_name\\Local Settings\\Temp.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nRefresh pack install verification \n\nFor upgrades of installations with existing profiles, refer to the Identifying profile update errors [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section under the Profile upgrade tab for details on verifying the refresh pack installation. \n\nNote: Installation Manager on the Microsoft Windows operating system does not recognize profile update errors. When you upgrade an installation on Windows, you must look at the Identifying profile update errors [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section, even if Installation Manager ends with the following message: The packages are updated. \nBack to top\n\n\n\nRolling back V8.5 Refresh Pack 5 \n\nYou can roll back the refresh pack to a previous version by using one of the following options:\nGraphical user interface (GUI) of IBM Installation Manager to roll back an installation\nCommand line interface of IBM Installation Manager for a silent roll back of a refresh pack\n\nNote: The following procedure rolls back only the product binary. Any existing profiles that were upgraded during a refresh pack installation are not rolled back; you must restore the profiles from the backup you took before you upgraded the product. Any new profiles created after the upgrade cannot be reused; you must delete and recreate the profiles after you have completed the rollback process.\n\n\nGraphical user interface (GUI) of IBM Installation Manager to roll back an installation\n\n\n 1.  Close all programs that were installed using Installation Manager before rolling back.\n     \n     \n 2.  Start Installation Manager.

The baselining of the application is a process that uses a pre-defined mathematical and statistical method to automatically calculate a threshold based on response time information typically collected over a period of time (few days to few weeks.) \n\nBy default baselining gets enabled with a situation WasAppDiscoverd. This situation is enabled by default and will discover new applications then run a take action to start the baselining. So if this situation is not enabled then you should enable it and assign to the ITCAM App Server managing system list. \n\nYou want to do baselining with normal or typical load on the server over a period of few days to few weeks, or even few months. The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see \"Good\"\" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health (\"Bad\" or \"Fair\" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. \n\nTo start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: \n\n(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) \n\n(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) \n\n1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. \n\n2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. \n\n3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] \n\n4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. \n\nSee screenshots here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2]\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&amp;aid=3]\nHit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)\n\nOnce you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Web Resources ITCAM for Web Resources (J2EE TEMA) AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, Solaris Opteron 6.1, 6.2 Advanced \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n ITCAM ITCAM4AD ITCAMfAD TEMA ITCAM for Web Resources"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q133","question":"Do I need to backup \/opt\/ibm-ucd\/server\/var\/sa\/dialogue ?\n\nMy UCD server has so many files in \/opt\/ibm-ucd\/server\/var\/sa\/dialogue that ls goes out of memory trying to list them all.

Prerequisites \n 2. What is the Match Database\u2019s purpose? \n 3. Setting the database up. \n 4. Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database. \n 5. On going maintenance \n\n\nPrerequisites \nThe following must exist before using the Match Designer functionality.  1. Match Specification built for use in match designer. \n 2. Create a data set that contains the data you will run the match analysis on. \n 3. Create a corresponding frequency data set to be used in the match analysis. \n 4. DSN for local PC \n 5. Create Database in which to perform the Match analysis processing. \n    a) Sizing of Database \n    b) Character sets required \n    c) Permission's for users \n\n\nAdditional information is also available with in the WebSphere QualityStage User Guide. \n\nWhat it\u2019s the Match Database\u2019s purpose?  1. The results Database is used to test the match specifications (logic) designed for use in match jobs. \n 2. This functionality enables the user to get a baseline of how good the match criteria are, based on the match logic developed for use in the application. \n 3. The results Database stores statistics and match results based on your data. For Example: How many matches, duplicates, and unmatched records. \n 4. This functionality allows developers to change matching logic on the fly and retest within minutes. \n\n * There is nothing from this Database that is used in production runs so it should never be created on or moved to a production box. \n * The Match Designer is to be used for development purposes only with a \"subset\" of the full volume data. If additional match modifications are required continue to use a subset of data not conduct testing with full volume data. \n * Determining the subset size of data to use in the Match Designer will vary depending on the clients environment and resources. Each client should run several iterations to determine the optimal subset to utilize in the Match Designer step. \n * To obtain the most accurate matching thresholds a full volume run should be performed in the DataStage Designer.\n\n\nCreating the Database  1. You should start from an empty Database; using the default XMETA Database is not recommended because it can become corrupt. \n 2. There are certain requirements on how the Database is to be created. \n    a) If Oracle: CHARACTERSET should be set to AL32UTF \n    b) If SQL: default is fine. \n    c) If DB2: create as codepage UTF-8 and page size 32K \n    d) Permission\u2019s - Each user has to have the ability to create tables, write and read rights in the DB. \n    e) The minimum DB space required will be calculated as follows = Number of Passes in match specification (X) Number of Input Records (X) Input Record Length (+) 100 filler.\n    f) If this is a distributed installation, you need to have ODBC defined in your client and on the server. They must have the same name. \n\n\nConfiguring the Match Designer for use with the Database  1.  Via the DataStage Designer navigate to the your match specification to work with \n 2.  Double click and a window will appear indicating: \n     \u201cThe ODBC Data Source Name (xxxxxxx) currently specified for this Match could not be found. Please create a DSN by this name or run a Test Environment Update to configure a different DSN for this Specification.\u201d \n 3.  Select the \u201cOK\u201d button \n 4.  Select option \u201cConfigure Specification\u201d \n 5.  From drop down select \u201cTest Environment\u201d \n 6.  For \u201cSample Information\u201d navigate to the location of your data set(s) created for analysis. \n 7.  Under \u201cFrequency Information\u201d navigate to the location of your frequency data set(s) created for use. \n 8.  Section \u201cTest Results Database\u201d fill the following information in. \n     a. Select the DSN created for the will allow the connection to the Database. \n     b. Enter user name required \n     c. Password required \n     d. Test Connection \n     e. Configuration File Location; these are the nodes located in your environment for use. Please make sure this matches the location of where the data sets reside on the server. \n 9.  Once connection is established hit the \u201cUpdate\u201d button. This will populate the Database with the required fields (not data) to populate when you perform the test specification. \n 10. The final step is to perform the Test All Passes. Please note this make take a few moments depending on the size of the files used. \n\n\nOngoing Maintenance  1. For each new run, results are cleared and rewritten to the DB. \n 2. Each user should have their own respective Databases to avoid rewriting over previous results. \n 3. There are separate tables holding results for each design. And from one user it is no problem to use a single Database and multiple designs. \n 4. Per the recommendation above in \"Creating the Database\" this database should not be your XMETA database. If you used the XMETA DO NOT RUN THIS STEP. When you are done testing you can drop the DB altogether."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q154","question":"Why are some Datatypes corrupt after Impact cluster failover\/failback ?\n\n\n\nRunning Impact 7.1.0.11.

Introduction\n===============\n\nThis feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.\n\nThe feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable\/disable it by setting a new environment variable \nKXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true\/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:\n\n- LZ for Linux OS agent \n- UX for Unix OS agent\n- NT for Windows OS agent\n\nThis is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.\n\nThe OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.\nThe property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named \u201cfcp_daemon\u201d if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.\n\nAccording to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.\nThe OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.\nAn event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.\n\n1.1 Quick Start\n================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:\n- create a property file under default directory (on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.\n\nOnly two properties are required:\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. \n\nNot only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. \nFor example, \"perl C:\\IBM\\scripts\\ITM_Custom_Scripts\\date.pl\". In this example you need to make sure that the location of \"perl\" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where \"perl\" is installed otherwise.\n\nFurther properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. \n\n\n2. New Attribute groups\n=======================\n\nTwo new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).\nDescription: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts.

The attribute is used for metric identification.\nScript_Name 512 The name of the script.\nScript_Path 512 The fully qualified path name of the script with arguments.\nCustom_Name 96 The custom name that is defined in the properties file. It is used for custom reporting.\nStandard_Output_Type 4 Standard output type of the script.\nStatus_Code 4 The status of the script. It includes general errors, configuration errors, the status or the execution code returned by the \nScript Provider.\nExecution_Start 16 The time when the last execution of this script started.\nExecution_Duration 4 The duration of the last execution of this script, in seconds. When timing out, the value of the configured timeout is returnd.\nAverage_Execution_Duration 4 The average duration, in seconds, of all the execution of the script.\nRefresh_Interval 4 The interval, in seconds, that the agent attempts to start this script.\nNumber_of_Collections 4 The count of execution attempts of this script since agent started.\nIntervals_Skipped 4 The count of occurrences where an execution of this script is skipped because the previous execution is still running.\nProperty_Group 64 The name of the property group.\nReturn_Code 4 Integer value returned by the Script.\nCust_Label_Str1 16 Label for custom string attribute #1\nCust_Label_Str2 16 Label for custom string attribute #2\nCust_Label_Str3 16 Label for custom string attribute #3\nCust_Label_Str4 16 Label for custom string attribute #4\nCust_Label_Str5 16 Label for custom string attribute #5\nCust_Label_Int1 16 Label for custom integer attribute #1\nCust_Label_Int2 16 Label for custom integer attribute #2\nCust_Label_Int3 16 Label for custom integer attribute #3\nCust_Label_Int4 16 Label for custom integer attribute #4\nCust_Label_Int5 16 Label for custom integer attribute #5\nCust_Label_Float1 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #1\nCust_Label_Float2 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #2\nCust_Label_Float3 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #3\nCust_Label_Float4 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #4\nCust_Label_Float5 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #5\nStandard_Error 2048 Script Standard Error in a unique row\n\nIn addition to script definitions, the table may report rows to return errors found on property files and they are identified by @ANY@ as Attribute_Name. Moreover, a row is always used to report the status of fcp_daemon and it is identified by @ANY@ as Property_File and @ANY@ as Attribute_Name.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRRTM (pure).\nDescription: Data gathered using custom scripts.

Parameters in OS agent environment files\n===========================================\n\nIt is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6_x64\\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6\\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent\n\nThe scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false\n\nOther parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions)\nThe location where property files are stored.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)\nOS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.\nNote: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)\nIf the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.\nTo avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:\n- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. \n- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.\n- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) \nAt startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.\nNote that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.\n\n- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)\nThis parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service \"Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider\". The user must have \"Full Control\" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)\nIt defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)\nThe OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). \nThe value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)\nIf set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. \n\n- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) \nIt is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.\nUsing low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).\n\n\nThe following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:\n\n- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.\n\n- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT\n\n- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file\n\n- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.\n\nThe fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:\nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]\n\n4. Parameters in property files \n===============================\n\nThe KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of \nscripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: \n\n- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).\nIt is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the \nATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).\nWhen multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.\n\n- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).\nIt defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. \nValues containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (\").\nEnvironment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.\n\n- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).\nIt indicates the script execution frequency.\n\n- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)\nThe user can fill it with a description of the script.\n\n- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). \nIt activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.\n\n- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.\n\n- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). \nWhen true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. \n\n\nOutput rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:\n\n- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;\nOUTPUT_TYPE can be:\n1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the \"Standard_Output_String\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the \"Standard_Output_Integer\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal\nprecision). When used, the \"Standard_Output_Float\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n\n- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).\nIt defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:\n<token_type>,<token_type>,\u2026\ntoken_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):\n- STRING or S\n- INTEGER or I\n- FLOAT or F\nIf <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.\nExamples of the same valid layouts:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT\n\n- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). \nIt defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated\nby commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. \ne.g.:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 \nIt is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.\n\n- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon \";\"). \nIt sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.\n\n\nThe following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:\n\n- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).\nThe value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.\nIf the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).\n- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).\nThe operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:\n= (equal to)\n!= (different from)\n> (bigger than) only for numeric type\n>= (not lower than) only for numeric type\n< (lower than) only for numeric type\n<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type\n\n\n\n5. Examples of property file\n============================\n\n#First script definition: script ex_script1.sh is launched every 150 seconds, it returns float values and only the output rows equal to 0.5 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=sample1 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/ibm\/itmd4255a\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions\/ex_script1.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=150\nOUTPUT_TYPE=FLOAT\nFILTER_VALUE=0.5\nFILTER_OPERATOR==\n\n#Second script definition: script ex_script2 is launched every 60 seconds, it returns integer values and only the rows different from 0 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script2\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${CANDLE_HOME}\/tmp\/check_out.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=60\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\nFILTER_VALUE=0\nFILTER_OPERATOR=!=\n\n#Third script definition: script ex_script3.sh is launched every 120 seconds with 3 input parameters (the first input parameter is an integer, the second and third are string). It's killed if it hangs or if the execution time is greater than the timeout value.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script3 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/scripts\/ex_script3.sh 1 \"second input parameter\" \"third input parameter\" \nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=120\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nKILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT=TRUE\n\n#Fourth script definition: script cpu_mem_percentage.sh is launched every 50 seconds and returns the cpuid as standard output string and 2 float for Idle and Used CPU percentage and 2 integers for Memory and Virtual Memory usage. The pipe is used as separator to parse the output. An example of row that must be returned by the script is: \ncpu2|35,5|65,5|3443|123800\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu and mem Usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${SCRIPT_HOME}\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,F,I,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Idle CPU %, Used CPU %, Virt MEM used MB, MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=50\n\n6. Examples of private situations \n==================================\n\nThe private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.\nExamples below are for the Linux OS agent:\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name \"demo\" in property file \"demo.properties\" returns a row equal to \"demo.log\" -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<CRITERIA>\n<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_NOPTAH\" INTERVAL=\"000030\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_ScriptLaunchErr\" INTERVAL=\"000060\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n\n7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces\n=======================================================\n\nA new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: \"Custom Scripts\" and \"Custom Scripts Runtime\". \n\n\"Custom Scripts\" workspace contains the following views:\n- \"Factory Daemon Status\" table view showing informational\/warning\/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.\n- \"Properties Files error\" table view showing problems related to property files.\n- \"Number of execution per script\" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts\n- \"Defined Scripts\" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.\n\n\"Custom Scripts Runtime\" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.\n\n\n8. Known problems and limitations\n===================================\n\n- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.\n- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.\n- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.\n- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.\n- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.\n- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.\n\n9. Troubleshooting\n===================\n\nStandard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.\nTo apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.\n\nTo trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:\nKBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)\n\nTo trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:\n(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent\n(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent\n(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent\n\nTo view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:\n(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)\n\nTo see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:\nKXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)\n\nTo troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)\n\nTo see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)\n\n\n10. Quick Start Scenario\n=========================\n\nThe following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.\n\nCustom Scripts descriptions\n===========================\nLet's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory \/scripts_repo:\n\n- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: \n\n4594740\n\n- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:\n\ncpu1|96,5|23800\n\nwhere the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.\n\nCustomization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts\n==============================================================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:\n\n- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:\n\n#CheckDIRsize.properties\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/checkDIRsize.sh \/opt\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\n\n#cpu_mem_usage.properties \nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=string\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10\n\n- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the \"Custom Scripts\" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.\n\nChange History:\n----------------------\n2017-01-09: Added new item under \"8.

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged.

The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nPertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the \"and StateChange >= 1234567890\" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSomething has \"future dated\" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the \"Clear State\" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.\n\nAn alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:\n\n\n\n * telnet [Hostname] [Port]\n\n\nwhere [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: \n\n * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n\n\nwhere [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process. \n\nIn cases where the likelihood of StateChange being inappropriately incremented in this fashion is quite high, one might wish to automate this process and have a Policy hunt for such occurrences. Please find following an example of a \"hunter\" Policy to capture any reoccurrence of this issue: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ANN=\"AcquireStateChange\"; \n   Log(2,ID+ANN); \n   Script=\"\/opt\/IBM\/netcool\/impact\/bin\/CheckState.sh\"; \n   Parameter=\"password\"; \n   JRExecAction(Script, Parameter, false, 30); \n   NumExecOutput=Length(ExecOutput); \n   Log(3,ID+ANN+\": NumExecOutput: \"+NumExecOutput); \n   \n   If(NumExecOutput >= 1) \n   {  * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(ID+ANN+\": CurrentStateChange: \"+HumanStateChange+\" is greater than CurrentTime: \"+HumanCurrentTime); \n      Log(ID+ANN+\": !!!

If it finds any it then acquires the StateChange value from the .state file via JRExecServer using the example script referred to in the above example Policy as CheckState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the Policy finds the string it extracts the StateChange value and compares it against the current time and, if StateChange exceeds the current time, it undertakes the stop, clear and restart of the EventReader to bring StateChange back into line. \n\nThis examples a simple script to use the Command Line Interface to stop the EventReader, clear the StateChange value and restart the EventReader and is referred to in the above exampled Policy as ClearState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nPlease note that the ClearState.sh script should not contain any spaces or special characters otherwise calling EOF will throw errors. Also, in latter versions of Impact, the username and password should be those of the tipadmin. Additionally, rather than have the password sitting clear case in a script one can pass it as a JRExecAction Parameter from the Policy - still clear case but the relevance of the variable can be made less obvious. \n\nBoth of these scripts are called by the JRExecAction() function in the example Policy and this in turn requires the JRExecServer to be running on the ImpactServer host(s *). \n\n* - The JRExecServer will be used by the current Primary ImpactServer only, as all EventReaders and PolicyActivators are run on the current Primary only but, if and when failover occurs and the Secondary ImpactServer becomes Primary, this new Primary will require access to a running, local JRExecServer. So, JRExecServer has to be running on both Primary and Secondary ImpactServer hosts to ensure availability in case of failover.

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. \nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is \nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: \n\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\n\n\u00b7 Administrator stop-quiesce\n\u00b7 Heartbeating \n\u00b7 Read ahead \n\u00b7 Client asynchronous consume\n\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP\/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\n\nSet a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nThe Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] \n\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP\/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\n\nSet a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\n\nOn average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.0.1\/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc\/mi12240_.htm]\nConversations on Client-connection Channels. [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.0.1\/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc\/mi12240_.htm].\n\nSince DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\n\nWhen using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\n\nFor DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. \n\nCases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\n\nNote: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.\n\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.\n\nrunmqsc <qmgr>\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n1 : display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.x1.x2.x3) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(1) MAXSHCNV(1) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 1\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.y1.y2.y31) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(0) MAXSHCNV(0) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 0\n\nend\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the z\/OS System.\n\n\n\nconnect to <qmgr>\nOn z\/OS system, options for issuing the commands are described at http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q085120_.htm [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q085120_.htm]. \n\/+RTP8 DIS CHSTATUS(channel_name) MAXSHCNV CURSHCNV\nwhere \"+RTP8\" is the command prefix."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q165","question":"DSNT408I SQLCODE -401 creating stored procedure CIUSNTSR after upgrading to DB2 11\n\nWhy would CIUSNTSR stored procedure creation fail with message DSNT408I and SQLCODE=-401?

Modifications to the files in your DOORS database could result is data corruption and jeapordize your DOORS database. Send the session.ixc file to support for repair\n\nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nChoosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out \nand shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted \nto replace the existing data file for the module.\n\nCreate a replacement session file \nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nAdjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. \nYour support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.\nNo work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored\nfor the effected module.  \n\n\nNote: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file. However in circumstances where DOORS reports a missing session file for a module- the event that caused this may have effected session files for other users connected to the module. For this situation you may need to perform a successive repair to the index file."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q193","question":"Are there any probes that can connecto the Nokia NSP EPC v17.9 and Nokia NSP RAN v17.3 using JMS\/HTTP?\n\nThe customer has asked if there are any probes that can connect to their Nokia servers, both of which use a HTTP\/JMS interface:\n\n Nokia NSP EPC v17.9 \n Nokia NSP RAN v17.3 ","answer":"This probe is written to support Nokia Network Functions Manager for Packet release 17.3.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg22005197.txt","text":"Title: IBM Tivoli Netcool\/OMINbus Integrations Release Notice - Probe for Nokia Network Functions Manager for Packet (nco-p-nokia-nfmp-1_0) - United States\n\nText:\nrelease notice; downloads; nco-p-nokia-nfmp; Probe for Nokia Network Functions Manager for Packet NEWS\n\nABSTRACT\n This new probe will be ready for downloading on July 20, 2017. \n\nCONTENT\n \n\nThis probe is written to support Nokia Network Functions Manager for Packet release 17.3.\n\nYou can download the package you require from the IBM Passport Advantage website:\n\nwww-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSHTQ\/omnibus\/probes\/nokia_nfmp\/wip\/concept\/nknfmp_intro.html [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSHTQ\/omnibus\/probes\/nokia_nfmp\/wip\/concept\/nknfmp_intro.html]\n\nNetcool\/OMNIbus V8.1\n\nIf you are running Netcool\/OMNIbus V8.1, a single package contains versions of the probe for all supported Operating Systems.

A remote attacker might upload a file from a remote system, which might be viewed in an iframe by other end users.\n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.0\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/93817 [https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/93817] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N\/AC:L\/Au:S\/C:N\/I:P\/A:N)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\n \n\n * IBM Business Process Manager Standard V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x \n * IBM Business Process Manager Express V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x \n * IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x \n * IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.x\n\nREMEDIATION\/FIXES\nInstall IBM Business Process Manager interim fix JR50092 as appropriate for your current IBM Business Process Manager or WebSphere Lombardi Edition version. \n\n * IBM Business Process Manager Express [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092] \n * IBM Business Process Manager Standard [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092] \n * IBM Business Process Manager Advanced [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092] \n * IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092]\n\n\nIf you are using earlier unsupported versions, IBM strongly recommends that you upgrade to a supported version. \n\nThe fix introduces additional functionality to the product with two server-side configuration options. One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.\n\n\nThe following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: \n\n<server> \n<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> \n<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> \n<allow-null-mime-type>false<\/allow-null-mime-type> \n<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> \n<mime-type>text\/plain<\/mime-type> \n<mime-type>img\/png<\/mime-type> \n<\/document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n\n<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> \n<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> \n<!-- document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<!-- will map text\/html mime type to text\/plain mime type --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>text\/html<\/from> \n<to>text\/plain<\/to> \n<\/mime-type-map> \n<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content\/octet-stream --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>application\/pdf<\/from> \n<\/mime-type-map> \n<\/document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<\/server> \n\nNote: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text\/html MIME type and maps it to the text\/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text\/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/install\/v1r6\/topic\/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc\/topics\/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp:\/\/ftp.software.ibm.com\/aix\/freeSoftware\/aixtoolbox\/ezinstall\/ppc\/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=\/opt\/freeware\/lib\/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q203","question":"Why WebSphere Application Server transactions are rolled back with these StaleConnectionExceptions?\n\nWhy WebSphere Application Server transactions are rolled back with these StaleConnectionExceptions?\nMy transactions are rolled back and the following errors are seen in the WebSphere Application Server logs:\n\nConnectionEve A J2CA0056I: ........ ........

This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Ulimits\n\nOn UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file\/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. \n\nDisplay the current soft limit:\nulimit -Sn\n\nDisplay the current hard limit:\nulimit -Hn\n\nOr capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:\nkill -3 PID\n\n\nPlease see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:\nGuidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)\nhttp:\/\/www.IBM.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]\n\n\nOperating Systems \n\nWindows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles\/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx [https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al \/proc\/PID\/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n\/usr\/proc\/bin\/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q211","question":"You want to know how to make persistent the events that indicate when a queue manager has started and stopped.\n\nYou want to know how to make persistent the events that indicate when a queue manager has started and stopped.","answer":"First, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.\n\n\nSecond, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop\/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.\nalter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg27050154.txt","text":"Title: IBM How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager - United States\n\nText:\n WHITE PAPER\n\nABSTRACT\n This techdoc provides all the necessary steps to help you monitor the queue SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT to audit the start and the stop for a MQ queue manager. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.\n\n\nSecond, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop\/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.\nalter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)\n\nCaveat:\nIf you want to have persistent messages in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue you will need to have discipline and a procedure to get and remove the messages, otherwise, the queue will eventually fill up.\n\n\n\nFile: How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf \n\nHow to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27050154&aid=2]How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27050154&aid=1]\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM MQ Capability AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 9.0, 8.0, 7.5"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q212","question":"Datacap 9.0.1 Application Manager not saving database configs\n\n\n\nHi All,\n\n \nI have installed Datacap 9.0.1 and there is a issue of not connecting to Admin and engine DB with Datacap 9.0.1.\n \nThe problem is there for saving admin and engine db configurations.\n \nWhen selected the path it saves but after tab out and tab in it clears admin and engine DB configurations.\n \nEven I tried with exporting and importing keys but no luck.\nRepair and re-install of Datacap is also done but no luck.\n \nPlease let me know if any of had faced similar kind of issue and any solution for it.\n","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"DEV_Q213","question":"Can I migrate or convert Workplace XT created Search Templates to Content Navigator?\n\nWhen migrating from Workplace XT to Content Navigator, can I covert or migrate XT created search templates to the ICN version of managed search templates?","answer":"Workplace XT created search templates are also supported in ICN with the restriction that the search template cannot be edited in ICN.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21648471.txt","text":"Title: IBM Does IBM Content Navigator support Workplace XT created stored searches and search templates?

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. \nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is \nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: \n\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\n\n\u00b7 Administrator stop-quiesce\n\u00b7 Heartbeating \n\u00b7 Read ahead \n\u00b7 Client asynchronous consume\n\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP\/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\n\nSet a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nThe Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] \n\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP\/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\n\nSet a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\n\nOn average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.0.1\/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc\/mi12240_.htm]\nConversations on Client-connection Channels. [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.0.1\/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc\/mi12240_.htm].\n\nSince DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\n\nWhen using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\n\nFor DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. \n\nCases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\n\nNote: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.\n\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.\n\nrunmqsc <qmgr>\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n1 : display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.x1.x2.x3) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(1) MAXSHCNV(1) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 1\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.y1.y2.y31) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(0) MAXSHCNV(0) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 0\n\nend\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the z\/OS System.\n\n\n\nconnect to <qmgr>\nOn z\/OS system, options for issuing the commands are described at http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q085120_.htm [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q085120_.htm]. \n\/+RTP8 DIS CHSTATUS(channel_name) MAXSHCNV CURSHCNV\nwhere \"+RTP8\" is the command prefix."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q216","question":"Error message 1311 when attempting to install SPSS 23 on Windows 10.\n\n\n\nI have downloaded SPSS 23 onto a Windows 10 operating system.

In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. \n\n To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nImplement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream. Any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to convert the session data objects into byte array stream.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic classMyObject implementsSerializable{\n}\/\/end of class MyObject\n\nCheck that all objects placed in the HTTPSession implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface.\n\n\n 1. Acess the SessionInspectServlet\n    \n    If the class name printed in the exception is not an object that is explicitly placed into the HTTPSession, use the SessionInspectServlet to determine the attribute in the HTTPSession that references a non-serializable object. \n\n\n\nSessionInspectServlet helps application writers to determine if application is written to support session persistence. SessionInspectServlet helps to: \n\n * Determine attributes present in the session\n   \n * Determine serializable and non-serializable attributes in the session\n   \n * Determine the size of each serializable attribute in session\n   \n * Determine if serializable attribute is implemented properly (if serializable attribute and all its internals are serializable)\n\n\nServlet serializes and deserializes attributes into memory to simulate session persistence; therefore, application writers need not turn on session persistence to run this servlet. However, you can run it with persistent sessions enabled. \n\nHow to Access the SessionInspectServlet: \n 1. com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. It is already in the classpath and does not need to be added to the application. \n    \n    Define a servlet\/uri entry for class SessionInspectServlet. If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet\/uri definition is not needed. \n    \n 2. Restart your Web module.\n    \n 3. Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.\n    \n 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\servlet\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope. That is, session contents need to be accessed by the server class loader scope.\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q231","question":"What IBM Business Process Manager version is affected by the Apache Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2016-1000031?\n\nWhat IBM Business Process Manager version is affected by the Apache Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2016-1000031?

The command is profile_root\/bin\/bpmdc\nThe profile_root variable is the base profile directory for the profile from which you want to get data. \n\nCommon Examples \n\nTo gather the logs and upload them to ECURep: \nC:\/MyProfileDirectory\/bin\/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes \n\nTo gather the logs and config directory: \n\nC:\/MyProfileDirectory\/bin\/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -config=yes \n\nTo gather logs for installation issues: \n\nC:\/MyProfileDirectory\/bin\/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Install \n\nTo gather 3 java cores from MyAppServer at 60 second intervals: \n\nC:\/MyProfileDirectory\/bin\/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Dump -server=MyAppServer -soapport=8881 -user=admin -password=admin -dumptype=Thread -count=3 -interval=60 \n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Line Parameter Default Value Description PMR None This parameter is the 11-digit PMR number to which the data is associated. Use one of the following forms for this value: 12345.678.901 or \"12345,678,901\"\nNote: Comma characters can be an issue on the Microsoft Windows command-line if you do not surround the value with the double quote characters. uploadToIBM no This parameter specifies whether to upload the data to the IBM ECURep site for a particular PMR. You can set this value to yes or no. outputDirectory install_root\/BPM\/isadc This parameter specifies the path to the directory where the output collection .zip file will be stored. type General This parameter specifies which type of collection to run. The valid values are General, Install, or Dump(8.5.5). config no With a general collection, when you set this parameter to yes, the config directory is included. You can set this value to yes or no. help No values When you include this parameter with the command, a description of the command options is displayed. Server Connection options added in 8.5.5 \nRequired for -type=Dump server No default This option specifies the server from which you wish to collect JVM dumps. soapport No default This option specifies the SOAP port for the server. user No default This option specifies the user with wsadmin access to the server to which you are connecting. password No default This option specifies the password for the user. Dump options added in 8.5.5 \nAvailable for -type=Dump dumptype Thread This option specifies the type of Java\u2122 virtual machine (JVM) dump to trigger: \nThread - Javacore or thread dump. \nHeap - A Heap dump is generated.\nSystem - System dump is also generated and has JExtract run on it. count 1 This option specifies the number of JVM dumps to trigger during the collection. interval 0 This option specifies the interval in seconds to wait between JVM dumps. \n\nYou can run the command without any parameters, which results in the general collection being run and the logs directory is compressed into a .zip file. \n\n\nThe output file name has the following format: PMRnumber . type _ timeStampValue .zip\nIn V8.5.5 the format is changed to: PMRnumber . ProfileName_type _ timeStampValue .zip \n\n\nThe data gathered is based on the profile where the command is run. If it is run from the installation directory, then the default profile is used. \n\n\nNote: Be sure to run the command from the profile from which you wish to gather data. \n\n\nGeneral collection \nThe \"General\" collection gathers the following information:  * Profile logs directory (profile_root\/logs). The collected files include all of the server log files and trace under this profile directory. \n * The results of the versionInfo-maintenancePackages command. \n * (Optionally) The profile config directory (profile_root\/config). This directory is only collected when the -config=yes option is used.\n\n\nNote: The limitation with this collection is that it does not gather log files and trace if it goes to a custom directory outside of the Profile logs directory. It is not recommended that you change the log file locations from the default as it makes it more difficult for other people to find them. \n\nInstall collection\nThe \"Install\" collection gathers the following information that is listed in the Collect troubleshooting data for installation or upgrade problems with IBM Business Process Manager products [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] document: \n\n * Any temporary launchpad log files. \n * Installation Manager Data directory \n * The results of the versionInfo -maintenancePackages command \n * Installation logs directory \n * Profile logs directory \n * Database upgrade script log files \n * Various configuration files that are related to the installation process\n\n\n\n\nJVM Dump collection The \"Dump\" collection type triggers various JVM dumps on a target server within a profile prior to gathering the general collection and generated dumps. \n\nWith the provided server connection options, the command will connect to the server using the soapport to make a wsadmin connection with the user and password. Depending on the dump type, it will trigger various JVM dumps until the count amount is reached. The dumps are triggered a set number of seconds apart based on the interval that is set. \n\nThe collection will gather the general collection files like \/logs and version information in addition to the dump files like Javacores, heap dumps and system dump .zip files. \n\n * Thread - This type will trigger Javacores or thread dumps to be produced for the JVM. \n * Heap - This type will trigger heap dumps to be generated. \n * System - This type will trigger system dumps to be generated. It will also run JExtract on the dump prior to the upload, which can take some time depending on the heap size. \n\n\n\nCommon usage The following list provides some common usage scenarios for this command: \n\n * After an issue occurs, use the basic bpmdc command to compress the log files for the profile into a .zip file. \n * Recreate your issue after setting a trace string using the administrative console [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wasinfo\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/ttrb_entrrs.html] or wsadmin [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wasinfo\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/txml_troubleshooting.html]. \n   Then, run the bpmdc command to collect the log files and send them to IBM. \n * After opening a PMR, use bpmdc-PMR=PMRnumber-uploadToIBM=yes with the most relevant type options to upload data. \n * IBM Support provides a specific command or set of commands to run for your environment that gets the needed data. \n * IBM Support provides a traces string that needs to be gathered with the commands. With trace enabled, you recreate the issue or wait for a reoccurrence before running the provided commands to gather and upload the data to IBM.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n A simplified Chinese translation is available [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21644209]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard General AIX, Linux, Linux zSeries, Solaris, Windows 8.5 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express General Linux, Linux zSeries, Windows 8.5 \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n BPM"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q243","question":"Using cobol copybooks\n\nSometimes, there will be errors\/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks.

The baselining of the application is a process that uses a pre-defined mathematical and statistical method to automatically calculate a threshold based on response time information typically collected over a period of time (few days to few weeks.) \n\nBy default baselining gets enabled with a situation WasAppDiscoverd. This situation is enabled by default and will discover new applications then run a take action to start the baselining. So if this situation is not enabled then you should enable it and assign to the ITCAM App Server managing system list. \n\nYou want to do baselining with normal or typical load on the server over a period of few days to few weeks, or even few months. The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see \"Good\"\" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health (\"Bad\" or \"Fair\" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. \n\nTo start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: \n\n(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) \n\n(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) \n\n1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. \n\n2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. \n\n3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] \n\n4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. \n\nSee screenshots here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2]\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&amp;aid=3]\nHit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)\n\nOnce you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Web Resources ITCAM for Web Resources (J2EE TEMA) AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, Solaris Opteron 6.1, 6.2 Advanced \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n ITCAM ITCAM4AD ITCAMfAD TEMA ITCAM for Web Resources"}]},{"id":"DEV_Q259","question":"Subnodes are still present on TEP after unconfiguring SOA DC\n\nAfter unconfiguring the ITCAM for SOA DC via the unconfig.sh script, I can still see SOA subnodes and workspaces on TEP.The Websphere instances were restarted and are no longer collecting data and forwarding to the D4 agent.I have shut down the ITCAM agent and deleted the offline entries for the managed systems, but the subnodes appear back once you restart the ITCAM agent.How can I remove them?","answer":"-","is_impossible":true,"contexts":[]},{"id":"DEV_Q260","question":"Crash happened due to \"PI50993:Apache HTTPComponents vulnerabilities in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)\"\n\nCrash happened due to \"PI50993:Apache HTTPComponents vulnerabilities in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)\"\n\nDetails of gpf crash events: A VerifyError was thrown due to \"Inaccessible class\" at offset 39(0x27) of the method executeInternal(Lorg\/springframework\/http\/HttpHeaders;[B)Lorg\/springfram ework\/http\/client\/ClientHttpResponse of the above class org\/springframework\/http\/client\/HttpComponentsClientHttpRequest.\n\nLooking at method the bytecodes :\n\n31 invokespecial 15 org\/apache\/http\/entity\/ByteArrayEntity.([B)V 34 astore 4 36 aload3 37 aload 4 39 invokeinterface2 41 invokeinterface 16 org\/apache\/http\/HttpEntityEnclosingRequest.setEntity(Lorg\/apache\/http\/Ht tpEntity;)V\n\nThe above sequence of bytecodes indicates it created an instance of org\/apache\/http\/entity\/ByteArrayEntity, trying to cast it to type Lorg\/apache\/http\/HttpEntity; which in turns led to the \"Inaccessible class\" VerifyError message.\n\nIt is clear that class org\/apache\/http\/HttpEntity was not loaded at all:\n\n    allclasses | grep org\/apache\/http\/HttpEntity\n","answer":"There would be NoClassDefFoundError observed after applying the fix because the API in HTTPCore and HTTPClient libraries are no long visible to application.

This will\n   eventually fill up the available heap space and cause an Out Of\n   Memory issue on the ODR.  Restarting the ODR will correct the\n   problem.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  Restart the ODR.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *\n   *                  Server Intelligent Management using the     *\n   *                  java On Demand Router (ODR).                *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An Out Of Memory error can be seen on   *\n   *                      the On Demand Router because            *\n   *                      HttpRouteAction objects can             *\n   *                      accumulate.                             *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *\n   ****************************************************************\n   There is a code bug where HttpRouteAction objects can\n   accumulate because they are not freed. This is particularly\n   noticeable when there are routing rules present, many\n   applications installed, and multiple configuration changes\n   happening on the system (such as installing or removing\n   applications). Over time this can cause exhaustion of the\n   available heap and an Out Of Memory error for the On Demand\n   Router.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The area of code was corrected to release the HttpRouteAction\n   objects. This fix supercedes PI51978 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI51978].\n   \n   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in\n   fix pack 8.5.5.9.

Portal then uses this value to query Virtual Member Manager (VMM) via findUserByIdentifier() and the failure occurs since the value is not formatted as a distinguished name.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\n- Collect Portal Login troubleshooting data [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21592791] \n\n- Look for the following in security.xml:\n<interceptors xmi:id=\"TAInterceptor_<identifier>\" interceptorClassName=\"com.ibm.ws.security.web.saml.ACSTrustAssociationInterceptor\">\n...\n<trustProperties xmi:id=\"Property_<identifier>\" name=\"sso_1.sp.idMap\" value=\"idAssertion\"\/> \n\nNote: There may be more than one sso_<n>.sp.idMap property (for example, sso_1.sp.idMap, sso_2.sp.idMap, etc). \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nOption #1: \n\nThe idAssertion value means that no entry is necessary for the user in the user registry, which is not supported in WebSphere Portal by default. Update the sso_<n>.sp.idMap property via the Integrated Solutions Console to use the value \"localRealm\" instead of \"idAssertion.\" \n\nThe localRealm value ensures that WebSphere Application Server will complete the JAAS Subject with the full distinguished name for the user by querying the user registry and thus Portal will pass the correct format to VMM. \n\nOption #2: \n\nTransient user support [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHRKX_8.5.0\/mp\/overview\/new_cf08.dita?lang=en] has been introduced for SAML TAI [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHRKX_8.5.0\/mp\/wcm\/wcm_secure_int_tai_auth.dita?lang=en] starting with Cumulative Fix (CF) #8 for 8.5.

A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.","is_impossible":false,"contexts":[{"filename":"swg21412061.txt","text":"Title: IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States\n\nText:\n TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? \n\nANSWER\nHSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. \n\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wsdatap\/v3r8m2\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\n\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password."}]},{"id":"DEV_Q303","question":"Why are the users unable to login to Web GUI 8.1 after I modify timeout to 2147483647 in security.xml file ?\n\n\n\nI followed the Web GUI 8.1 reference guide here to switching off the session timeout\n\nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSSHTQ_8.1.0\/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0\/webtop\/wip\/task\/web_adm_settimeout.html\n\nAfter I edited \/config\/cells\/JazzSMNode01Cell\/security.xml file, modified timeout setting to 2147483647, users are not able to login anymore.","answer":"1.
