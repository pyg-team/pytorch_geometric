PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After creating a shared library using the administration console in the WebSphere® Test Environment (WTE) version 6 server it is not obvious how to use it when building a J2EE project in Rational® Application Developer (RAD) v6. This technote provides that information. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Any shared library would have to be explicitly added to the Java Build Path of any J2EE project using the library. To do so, right click on a project and go to Properties >Java Build Path and add any required jars as appropriate. 

This can be made easier by creating a classpath variable for a commonly used library. Go to the menu item: Window > Preferences > Java > Classpath Variables and select New, to add a new variable. 

Note: Although it might work, use of the WebSphere version 5.x server administrative console is not supported with WTE 5.x server configurations.
