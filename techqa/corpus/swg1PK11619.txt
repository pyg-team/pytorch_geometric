APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  *** PK11619*** resolves the following problems:
   
      (1) When you delete a node group that has dynamic clusters
   associated with it. Node group members fail to be removed due to
   stale workspaces.
   
      (2) If you add the deployment manager node to a node group
   and then define a dynamic cluster using it, the application
   server created on the deployment manager node cannot be started
   because there is no associated node agent. With this fix,
   dynamic cluster will not generate application server for the
   deployment manager node when it is one of the node group member.
   
      (3) When the memory-to-memory replication setting is changed
   from the dynamic cluster server template,  it doesn't get
   propagated to the dynamic cluster member servers.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Node group members fail to be removed   *
   *                      from the Administrative Console due     *
   *                      to a stale workspace.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When you delete a node group that has dynamic clusters
   associated with it, sometimes the node group members fail to
   be removed from the Administrative Console due to a stale
   workspace.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Node group members are now removed from the Administrative
   Console when you delete the node group that has dynamic
   clusters associated with it.
