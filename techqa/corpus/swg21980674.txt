Text:
Spectrum Control Tivoli Storage Productivity Center TPC upgrade BPCIN0258E exportLDAPRepositories TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why didn't the work-around documented in this APAR solve my upgrade problem? 

CAUSE
Additional certificates are expired

ANSWER
Check the TIP logs (note: these may not have been collected by the 5.2.8 or 5.2.9 'service' command) and look for an error like this: 

<TIP_HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log -

[3/31/16 9:34:51:088 CDT] 00000021 WSX509TrustMa E CWPKI0022E: SSL HANDSHAKE FAILURE: A signer with SubjectDN "CN=servername.company.com, OU=TIPCell, OU=TIPNode, O=IBM, C=US" was sent from target host:port "unknown:0". The signer may need to be added to local trust store "C:/Program Files/IBM/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/nodes/TIPNode/trust.p12" located in SSL configuration alias "NodeDefaultSSLSettings" loaded from SSL configuration file "security.xml". The extended error message from the SSL handshake exception is: "PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: The certificate expired at Tue Dec 01 14:20:53 CST 2015; internal cause is: 
java.security.cert.CertificateExpiredException: NotAfter: Tue Dec 01 14:20:53 CST 2015".

To solve the problem, copy the renewed certificates key.p12 and trust.p12 from

<TPC_HOME>\TPC\ewas\profiles\WebServerProfile\config\cells\WebServerCell\nodes\WebServerNode

to these locations:

<TIP_HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\config\cells\TIPCell\nodes\TIPNode\
<TIP_HOME>\profiles\TIPProfile\etc\

then retry the upgrade.

This example is from the Windows OS, but this error and solution is similar on AIX and Linux platforms (the installation directory/path names will be different).
