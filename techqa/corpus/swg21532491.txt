QUESTION
 What does the message, SVTM049I **** SNDFMH74: FMH_74 SEND ERROR mean (SCI7230) 

ANSWER
This message is saying that something happened to the transport during the final moments of a process execution. The FMH74 is exchanged between nodes during process termination, and when statistics are exchanged. One might expect to see stats on both nodes, but not complete stats on either, because the exchange was not successful. Since the process restarted, and eventually completed, the marginal condition on the transport cleared up.
