QUESTION
 How to perform a Thread Dump from IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SBI) in Windows Using the IBM JDK uwithout installing additional tools or starting SBI in console mode? 

ANSWER
If you only need thread dumps once a minute or less for Windows instances, then you can just add an empty file named threadDumpTrigger.txt in the install directory

In the SBI install directory, create an empty file named threadDumpTrigger.txt. It is case sensitive. It will disappear within a minute or two. When it disappears the thread dump is complete. 
It will go to noapp.log with the date/time stamp. It checks every 60 seconds for the file so you can only do it that quickly. 
It is not as comprehensive as generating a javacore however.
