The Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.2 Feature Pack 
The Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.2 Feature pack is the means of upgrading an existing instance of Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1 to V2.2 The Feature Pack adds the new and enhanced features of V2.2 Once applied the version of the Tivoli Integrated Portal becomes V2.2. 

How the Feature Pack differs from a Fix Pack 
The Feature Pack is the mechanism for upgrading the Tivoli Integrated Portal to from V2.1 to V2.2. A fix Pack, however, does not provide any upgrade capabilities. Instead a Fix Pack typically includes fixes for problems identified in the field. 

A Fix Pack can only be installed on a product with the appropriate version number. It does not change the base version number of the product, but adds a fix pack number to the version number. This clearly identifies which Fix Pack is installed. 

For example, a Fix Pack for the Web GUI V7.3.1 can be applied only to an existing installation of Web GUI V7.3.1. If Fix Pack 3 were applied to Web GUI V7.3.1, the version number becomes V7.3.1.3. 

The version of the Tivoli Integrated Portal required by the Web GUI V7.3.1 
The GA distribution of the Web GUI V7.3.1 includes the Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1 This is the minimum version that the Web GUI requires. Thus on a system that has no instance of the Tivoli Integrated Portal, installing the Web GUI V7.3.1 creates an instance of Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1. 

The Web GUI V7.3.1 can be installed into an existing instance of Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1 or V2.2 In the case of V2.2, however, the Web GUI does not make use of any of the enhancements in that version of the Tivoli Integrated Portal. 

You can determine the version of an existing instance of the Tivoli Integrated Portal by using the listIU command of the Deployment Engine. Here are some examples of the output from this command: 

Name: TIPCore Version: 2.1.0.0 - TIP2.1 GA version 
Name: TIPCore Version: 2.1.0.x - TIP2.1 fix pack version 
Name: TIPCore Version: 2.2.0.0 - TIP2.2 GA version 
Name: TIPCore Version: 2.2.0.1 - TIP2.2 feature pack version 
Name: TIPCore Version: 2.2.0.3 - TIP2.2 FP1 - fix pack version 

Compatibility of the Web GUI V7.3.1 and Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.2 
You can install the Web GUI V7.3.1 into an existing instance of the Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.2. However, the Web GUI does not use any of the new features and enhancements that V2.2 provides. 

When the Feature Pack is required 
The Feature Pack is required to install a product that requires Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.2 into an existing instance of Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1. 

However, consult the installation and deployment documentation of that product and of the existing products that use the Tivoli Integrated Portal V2.1 instance before applying the Feature Pack. There may be further requirements and actions necessary for a successful installation and upgrade.
