Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A vulnerability in the node-uuid module causes the module to fallback on math.random under certain circumstances, which leads to predictable UUIDs. The node-uuid module is used by the Node.js Package Manager (npm). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-8851 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8851]
DESCRIPTION: node.js node-uuid could provide weaker than expected, caused by the use of Math.random() instead of a more cryptographically sound source of entropy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112166 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112166] for the current score
