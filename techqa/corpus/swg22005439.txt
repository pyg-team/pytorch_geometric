Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed by the OpenSSL project. OpenSSL is used by the Cordova tools in IBM Rational Software Architect and Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software. Below is the list of addressed CVE's 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-8610 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8610]
DESCRIPTION: SSL/TLS protocol is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing ALERT packets during a SSL handshake. By sending specially-crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to stop responding.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3730]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference. By sending specially crafted parameters for a DHE or ECDHE key exchange, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121311 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121311] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3732 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a propagation error in the BN_mod_exp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
