PROBLEM
When attempting to install Lotus Enterprise Integrator (LEI) on Windows, the install fails when installing the LEI files and generates the following error message: 

"An error occurred and product installation failed. Look at the log file, C:\Lotus\Domino\leidir\leiinst.log, for details."

The leiinst.log displays the following message:

"Setup.product.install, com.ibm.ismp.beans.lei.NotesCopyAction, err, ProductException: (error code = 200; message="Java error"; exception = [java.lang.Exception: Unable to initialize Notes Session. Returned status: 5922])"


CAUSE
In order to create the LEI files when installing, the LEI installer must find the Lotus Domino path to the notes.ini file. The error indicates that the path to the Domino server cannot be found or accessed. The failure can also be due to running the installer from a mapped or network drive that doesn't have access to the Domino path.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this situation, check all of the following: 

 

 * Check your server's path statement. On the Windows desktop, choose Start --> Control Panel --> System --> Advanced Tab --> Environment Variables --> Path. This path statement must contain the location of your Domino server's notes.ini file. 

 * There cannot be any spaces in the path statement. For example, if the path contains the words, "Program Files", you must replace it with "PROGRA~1". If the path contains "Program Files (x86)", you must replace it with "PROGRA~2".

 * Make sure the path is spelled correctly and uses the correct case.

 * Search your computer for more than one notes.ini file. You should only have one such file. If you have any extra notes.ini files that are not the active notes.ini for your Domino server, rename, move, or delete them.

 * Check your notes.ini file to make sure the "Directory=" statement is correct and there are no discrepancies between it and the path statement.

 * Make sure you are installing LEI from the local drive. Installing from a mapped or network drive is often the cause of this problem due to access or authority issues.
