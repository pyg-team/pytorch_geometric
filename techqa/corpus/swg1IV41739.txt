ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A correctly configured WebSphere MQ adapter for Dynamics AX 2012
   (SupportPac MA7R) fails to write outbound data (fails to
   retrieve data from Microsoft Dynamics AX). The following error
   appear:
   
   System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been
   thrown by the target of an invocation.
   ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to
   an instance of an object.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   IBM WebSphere MQ Adapter for Microsoft DynamicsAX 2012 customers
   using Outbound scenario not containing RequestMessageID in the
   XML message.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The NullReferenceException appears to be happening due to the
   adapter library specifically looking for the
   "RequestMessageId" attribute in the incoming XML message.
   
   Typically in an Inbound scenario, for example an external
   application invoking Sales order creation service, the
   response sent by AX will contain the "RequestMessageId"
   attribute. This "RequestMessageId" is actually the "MessageId"
   of the request message sent by the application for creating a
   sales order. Using the "RequestMessageId" an application can
   verify if the response received is actually for the request it
   had sent earlier.
   
   The MQ adapter sets the "RequestMessageId" attribute as a
   property on MQ message. This is to help MQ applications to
   select only the message that matches the "RequestMessageId"
   and correlate request and response messages.
   
   In an outbound scenario, the action is initiated by AX, so the
   XML message may not contain the "RequestMessageId" attribute.
   Hence System.NullReferenceException exception is being thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DynamicsAX Client code has been fixed to handle the
   RequestMessageId field from the XML depending on the Inbound and
   Outbound scenario.
