APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In APAR PK04446 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK04446] RAD exported metadata files such as .classpath
   and .project to an EAR that it shouldn't. RAD 6.0.1.1 appears to
   fix the problem for all metadata files except the .runtime file.
   .runtime files in the EAR project or the Web project are
   properly excluded from the export. However, RAD 6.0.1.1 still
   incorrectly exports .runtime files in Java projects included as
   a web library project or a project utility jar in the EAR. The
   .runtime file is incorrectly included in the .jar file that is
   produced.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Ear export was including .rutime files for Java utility
   Projects
    added to the EAR, and for Web Library Projects
   added to WARs in
   side the EAR.  A fix has been made to never
   include .runtime fil
   es during export even if meta-data is
   included .  Though .runtim
   e files are meta-data, they are
   not meta-data required during im
   port, thus they should never
   be included in an export.  Having t
   he .runtime files bundled
   in the EAR should not cause any runtim
   e problems.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ear export was including .rutime files for Java utility
   Projects added to the EAR, and for Web Library Projects
   added to WARs inside the EAR.  A fix has been made to never
   include .runtime files during export even if meta-data is
   included .  Though .runtime files are meta-data, they are
   not meta-data required during import, thus they should never
   be included in an export.  Having the .runtime files bundled
   in the EAR should not cause any runtime problems.
