APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  .
   Problem description
   The SEAS Session Idle Timeout value is actually double what is
   shown and configured in the GUI.  The application setting is
   effectively ignored, and the timeout value is double that of
   what is set.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 382822
   RJ/RJ
   Circumvention:
   Update to latest SEAS Build
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SEAS Session Idle Timeout does not work correctly
   The Idle Session Timeout value, which determines how long to
   keep idle connections, always uses double the value set. e.g.
   the 30 minute default yields a 60 minute timeout. The value is
   set in the GUI under System Settings in the Global tab.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Corrected the timeout logic to work without waiting for 2
   iterations.  Also, ensured that the timer was reset after the
   initial download of GUI information.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Update to SEAS2412 iFix 5
