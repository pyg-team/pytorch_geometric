APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the manual it is stated when wild card '*' symbol is used the
   symbolic links are ignored. But on linux, MQFTE doesn't ignore.
   When a destination file is created from a source that is a
   symbolic link, the destination file becomes a hard link (that is
   a regular file). You cannot successfully transfer symbolic links
   to directories.
   If symboliclink is directory and file is saved under the
   symbolic linkdir, file is not sent. But if symbolic link is a
   file, file is sent though set upper dir in fteCreateTransfer.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   The Infocentre at Boulder has been updated with teh correct
   words. A new disk will be produced and translated for the first
   fixpack.

   Before:
   Symbolic links
   Symbolic links are a type of file that contain a pointer to
   another file or directory and are known as shortcuts on Windows.
   Wildcard source specifications ignore symbolic links, but you
   can use symbolic links in a file transfer if you exactly specify
   the symbolic link as a source. However, when a destination file
   is created from a source that is a symbolic link, the
   destination file becomes a hard link (that is, a regular file).
   You cannot successfully transfer symbolic links to directories.
   
   After:
   Symbolic links
   Symbolic links are a type of file that contain a pointer to
   another file or directory and are known as shortcuts on Windows.
   You can match symbolic link files with wildcard characters.
   However, when a destination file is created from a source that
   is a symbolic link, the destination file becomes a hard link
   (that is, a regular file). You cannot successfully transfer
   symbolic links to directories because this could potentially
   create a recursive path.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WMQFTE manual incorrectly described wild card behaviour when
   compared to the product.
   Manual needs correcting
