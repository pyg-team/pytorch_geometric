 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What does the Terminate activity do and where/when can it be used? 

ANSWER
The Terminate activity stops all further orchestration job processing in the specific orchestration branch. This activity is commonly used while implementing "If and Else" logic. In an 'If-Then' activity, to stop the job processing on any specific input, one can use "terminate" to stop processing in any of the "if" or "else" branches.
The details of the terminate activity can also be checked in Studio online help.
