ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TITLE: LDAP filter for objectclass attribute is case sensitive
   in ITIM UI
   COMPONENT: General UI
   .
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   .
   Generally, for "objectclass" attribute, the LDAP filter is case
   sensitive in ITIM UI (for example in ACI filters) although
   "objectclass" is a case insensitive attribute in
   LDAP by default. This is confusing and can cause unpredictable
   results during system configuration.
   .
   CUSTOMER RECREATE: YES, L2 as well
   .
   DESIRED BEHAVIOR: Handle LDAP filter for "objectclass" attribute
   case insenstive in ITIM UI.
   .
   STEPS TO DUPLICATE:
   .
   Have a custom person objectclass "customPerson" which is derived
   from inetOrgPerson (incl. custom person entity).
   Create Person ACI for default ITIM person with "Deny" for
   "Search".
   In this ACI use the filter "(|(objectclass=customperson))" (use
   "customperson" instead of customPerson).Create Person ACI for
   custom person with "Grant" for "search".
   Althoug the first ACI should be filtered out for custom person
   it is valid for them so they won't see persons in OrgTree.
   .
   ENVIRONMENT: ITIM 4.6 FP40
