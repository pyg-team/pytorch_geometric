APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a user attempts to open a module in exclusive edit mode, but
   another user has the module open, they get the option to receive
   notification when the exclusive lock is available. When that
   notification is triggered it results in a diagnostic log and DXL
   error.
   
   To recreate:
   
    - open two clients connecting to the same DB server
    - in one client open a module in exclusive edit mode
    - in the other client attempt to open the same module in
   exclusive edit mode, then in the resulting message opt to open
   the module in read-only mode and select "Alert me when lock is
   available"
    - in the first client close the module
    - wait a few seconds for the notification to be triggered in
   the second client
   
   A diagnostic log and a DXL error will be displayed.
   
   Workaround:
   
   Manually check for lock availability.
   
   An automated workaround may be possible using DXL timers, but it
   would need to be manually initiated.
