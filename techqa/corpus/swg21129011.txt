PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to programmatically clear an editbox in IBM Rational Robot. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using the sqasetproperty command you can change the value of an objects properties. Therefore using this command you could clear the property that stores the text for the editbox object.

Example:




Sub Main
Dim Result As Integer
' uses sqasetproperty to change values in comboboxes and editboxes using the classics online sample.

StartApplication """C:\Program Files\Rational\Rational Test\Sample Applications\Classics Online\ClassicsA.exe"""

Window SetContext, "Name=frmExistingLogin", ""
'selects the login user
result=SQASetProperty ("Name=lstUserName", "ItemSelected", "Admin" )
if result <> 0 then msgbox error(result)

Window SetContext, "Name=frmExistingLogin", ""
PushButton Click, "Name=cmdOK"

Window SetContext, "Name=frmMain", ""
PushButton Click, "Name=cmdOrder"

Window SetContext, "Name=frmOrder", ""
'clears the quantity field
result = SQASetProperty ("Name=txtQuantity", "Text", "" )
if result <> 0 then msgbox error(result)
delayfor 2000

End Sub
