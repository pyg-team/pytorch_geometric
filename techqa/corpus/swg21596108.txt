Title: IBM "Null userid is not supported" when logging into Decision Center console - United States

Text:
RTS; team server; teamserver; rule team server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After successfully logging in to Decision Center Console, IlrDataSourceException is thrown. 

SYMPTOM
The following error shows when logging into Decision Center: 

ilog.rules.teamserver.model.IlrDataSourceException: Could not lookup 
datasource named 'jdbc/ilogDataSource' Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: 
Null userid is not supported. 


CAUSE
The error indicates a problem with database authentication. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Test connection on the datasource from the WAS admin console. 

- If Test Connection fails, verify that J2C authentication data is configured
- If Test Connection succeeds, it is likely that the runtime error from Decision Center was caused by the fact that Component-managed authentication alias is NOT defined for the datasource. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Select the J2C authentication alias for Component-managed authentication alias and then restart all WAS ND processes.

Refer to this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21595296] for complete instruction on J2C authentication configuration in WebSphere Application Server for Decision Center V7.5. Step 7 describes the aforementioned solution.
