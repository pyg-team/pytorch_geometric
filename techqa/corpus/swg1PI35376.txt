   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The CICS Explorer Client returns        *
   *                      message IZE0106E for a "Bad Request".   *
   *                      The CICS SYSLST contains message        *
   *                      DFHWB0723 for Program name: DFHWBADY    *

   ****************************************************************
   The CICS Explorer Client must authenticate with the CICS Server
   partition.
   
   DFHWBADY searches for an "Authorization:" string in the incoming
   HTTP GET request by starting at an offset from the start of
   the HTTP request, rather than by searching from the start of
   the HTTP headers.
   
   The search will terminate before the end of the headers, and
   will not find "Authorization:" unless it occurs as the first
   header, and this cannot be guaranteed in all cases.
   
   When the search fails, in addition to the IZE0106E message
   seen in the CICS Explorer Client, the CICS SYSLST will contain
   this message:
   
   DFHWB0723 date time applid tran The CICS Web Analyzer program
   returned an error response. Program name: DFHWBADY.
   RESPONSE: 4. REASON: 2. Host IP address: nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn.
   Client IP address: nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn. TCPIPSERVICE: xxxxxxxx

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHWBADY has been changed to search the HTTP headers correctly.
