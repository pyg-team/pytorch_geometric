   ****************************************************************
   A memory leak may occur when an application repeatedly calls
   the getService method of the
   com.ibm.websphere.sca.context.CompositeContext interface.
   Memory leak analysis indicates a large number of
   GeneratedClassLoader objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code is changed in DefaultJavaInterfaceFactory so that
   excessive GeneratedClassLoader objects are not created.
