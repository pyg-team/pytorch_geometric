 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am developing a custom application in IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search. The search results show up with highlight SPAN text. How can I disable highlighting?

This is the result that I get when I run one of the sample java files packaged with the product and pass author with value "Tom" as the search string -

This is default behavior.

ANSWER
You can disable highlighting in search results by setting the search property HighlightingMode.

Here are the values for HighlightingMode - 
- DefaultHighlighting: This is the default value and it is equivalent to
ExtendedHighlighting.
- ExtendedHighlighting: Extends the highlighting of query terms to other
areas of the search result, such as the title, URL, and other fields.
- SummaryHighlighting: Highlights query terms in the document summary
only.

In ICA 3.0, a new highlighting mode has been introduced called "NoHighlighting" which can be used to turn off highlighting. You need to set it in your code using the setProperty method of the Query object. 

eg: 

Query q = searchFactory.createQuery(queryString);
q.setProperty("HighlightingMode", "NoHighlighting");
