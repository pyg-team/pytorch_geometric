Title: IBM Windows user profile size for Controller 2.x users - Citrix/Terminal Server - United States

Text:
full TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I.T. administrator has noticed that Controller 2.x creates some temporary cache/profile files inside the user's Windows profile. This may cause an issue, for example if user's hard drive (C:) space is small. 

Can these profile files be safely deleted? 

CAUSE
Controller 2.x creates temporary (cache) files in several folders, during its operation. The purpose of these files is mainly to improve performance of Controller (by storing recently-used information, in case it is required in the future).

These temporary files are stored in the user's Windows profile.

By default, for Controller 2.3MR1 , these folders are:

 * %APPDATA%\Cognos\Controller\
 * %APPDATA%\FrangoController
 * %TEMP%\Cognos\Controller\
 * %TEMP%\Cognos\Controller\
 * %TEMP%\FrangoController

The exact values of these '%' variables are defined by the policies of the customer's I.T. department. However, by default, the above folders will typically be in subfolders of the following location:

C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\

(e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Local Settings\Temp\Cognos\Controller).

The above temporary files will grow over time. For example, they may typically be approximately 6 to 60Mb per Windows user.

NOTE:

 * Many of the above files will get deleted/overwritten during the course of the user running Controller
 *   * So they should not get too large in size (in total)
   
   
 * However, intentionally (by design) Controller will not delete all these 'temporary' files after the user exits Controller
 *   * This is in case they are helpful (in speeding up the system) when the end-user next launches Controller.
   
   

For most customers, the above mechanism is not a problem. However:

 * If the customer is using roaming profiles, then typically these files are written across the network when the user logs off, which can take some time.
 * Also, there may be a space issue (e.g. on a shared Citrix/Terminal Server) where there is not enough space on the system drive (e.g. C: drive) which is the default location (C:\Documents and Settings) for storing profiles.

ENVIRONMENT
Typically this article is useful for managed/locked-down environments such as Citrix / Terminal Services environments.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For most customer's environments, the following is unnecessary. However, some customers may find the following options useful:

 * OPTION #1 - Reconfigure PC/Citrix Server, to move the location of the user's profiles to a different drive
 * OPTION #2 - Create a logoff 'cleanup' script

Steps:See attached document ('48. User's Profiles in Controller 2.x.pdf') for more information on the above concepts. RELATED INFORMATION
