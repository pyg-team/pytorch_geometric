ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When importing a Rose model into IBM Rational Software Architect
   that has Cyrillic or Arabic characters either as a label on the
    model element or as documentation, the resulting characters wil
   l be different from those in the original Rose model.  Other non
   -Latin character sets, for example Greek and Hebrew, do not have
    the problem.
   
   The following steps reproduce the problem:
   
   1. Go to Start ? Control Panel ? Regional and Language Options t
   o set the regional settings to set the Regional Options ? Standa
   rds and formats and Advanced ? Language for non-Unicode programs
    to a language/locale that uses the Cyrillic alphabet, such as R
   ussian, or to a language/locale that uses Arabic, for example Ar
   abic(Egypt)
   2. Set the keyboard to either of the language/locales from Step
   1.
   3. Open Rose and create a model with labels and documentation th
   at contain either Cyrillic or Arabic characters
   4. Save the model, close Rose and open RSA
   5. Use the Rose Model Importer to import the Rose model
   Expected Result: The characters do not change during the import
   Actual Result: The characters in the RSA model are different fro
   m those in the Rose model
   
   There is no workaround other than to copy/pasted the labels and
   documenation from the original Rose model into the RSA model.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Cyrillic and Arabic characters are not imported
   correctly from Rose model to RSA model.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in release RSx 7.0.0.8.
   
   The characters in Rose and RSA are stored using different
   encoding,This problem is caused by use of incorrect decoding
   for Cyrillic and Arabic characters when migrating from Rose
   to RSA.
   
   Now proper decoding is used and problem is resolved
