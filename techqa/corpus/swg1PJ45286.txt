   COMMENTS:
   The current z/TPF version of Apache HTTP server version is
   2.2.9, which does not have support for the latest security
   standards (TLS 1.1/1.2). Support for TLS 1.1/1.2 was
   implemented by the Apache Foundation later in the open source
   version of 2.2.24. The z/TPF version of Apache remains at
   2.2.9, but support for TLS 1.1/1.2 enabled Apache2 sessions was
   added from the Apache HTTP server version 2.2.24.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
   Sections of Apache HTTP Server version 2.2.24 relevant to
   enabling TLS 1.1/1.2 were backported into z/TPF version of
   Apache.
   
   COREQS: NO
   None.
   
   MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS: YES
   Hardware, software, and configuration changes:
   User defined Apache2 shared objects that are enabled for TLS
   must be rebuilt and reloaded against the new z/TPF Apache2 code
   base. The Apache2 configuration file (httpd.conf) may need to
   be updated to enable TLS 1.1/1.2 sessions.
   
   
   
   BUILD COMMANDS AND INSTRUCTIONS: NO
   None.
   
   UPDATED INFORMATION UNITS: YES
