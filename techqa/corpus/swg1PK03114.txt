ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Hello,
   
   I am struggling with this for over a week now and I have no othe
   r choice than submitting this escalation.
   The porblem is that installing xde tester hotfix 17 or 18 on top
    of XDE Tester/TestManager 2003.06.13 or 2003.06.14 simply
   *breaks* somehow the integration between both tools and it then
   becomes impossible to open or run a xde tester script from TestM
   anager.
   I suggested my customer to go to SR 4 without applying any hotfi
   x but he has run into a defect that has been fixed in hotfix # 1
   7 :-(
   Consequently this is not feasible at his side. He needs SR3 or S
   R4 + HF#17. How can he acheive that without running into integra
   tion
   failures ?
   
   Note that I have reproduce the problem on my side :
   
   Typically this is the error I receive when trying to run a XDE T
   ester script
   when XDE Tester HF#18 (or 17 or 15) is on top of SR3 :
   
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.rational.test.ft.applicati
   on.rational_ft_tm
   at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source)
   at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)

   TSEE #001: user runtime error: maintain: , line 0
   [22.3.6.228]: Test Script execution failed for script 'maintain'
    via Test Script Execution Adaptor 'rttseajava': no message
   
   And this is the error when I apply the same patches on top of SR
   4 :
   
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.rational.test.ft.applicati
   on.rational_ft_tm
   at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source)

   ication.rational_ft_tm. If you are running XDE Tester, please ma
   ke sure it is upgraded to XDE Tester SR3 or later version.
   
   
   Please could help me in correcting this blocking situation at my
    customer site ?
   
   I thank you in advance
   
   Cheers
