ABSTRACT
 This document contains links (URLs) to published technical support articles and information pertaining to high availability (HA) and recovery. Use the information in these links to help you get more value from WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WebSphere ESB). 

CONTENT
This information is intended to help you support and administer your WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere ESB installations. 

Document title (click the title for link) Abstract Configuring high availability and workload sharing of service integration [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.iseries.doc/ae/tjt0023_.html] This WebSphere Application Server information center topic provides information on configuring HA and workload sharing of service integration.

It provides descriptions for the following tasks:
 * Creating a policy for messaging engines 
 * Configuring a policy for messaging engines 
 * Configuring shared durable subscriptions

Configuring efficient messaging in multicluster WebSphere Process Server cells [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0811_roberts/0811_roberts.html] This article describes the best practices for configuring the WebSphere Service Integration Bus component of WebSphere Process Server in environments that contain more components than the Golden deployment topology. The environments of particular interest are those with multiple application deployment targets, multiple messaging clusters, or connections to external messaging facilities. 

The article guides you through a series of steps that help ensure a smooth transition as your WebSphere Process Server implementation grows. Service Integration Bus Explorer - frequently asked questions (FAQ) [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/sibexplorer/faq] This FAQ document provides information on Service Integration Bus Explorer.

Service Integration Bus Explorer is a stand-alone tool that allows more natural navigation and monitoring of the messaging components of a Service Integration Bus. Transactional high availability and deployment considerations in WebSphere Application Server V6 [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0504_beaven/0504_beaven.html] This IBM WebSphere Developer Technical Journal article introduces the HA support for the WebSphere Application Server transaction service, which is available as part of WebSphere Application Server V6. 

The article describes the two main styles of providing transactional HA, discusses the infrastructure requirements that are associated with them, and explains the configuration steps that are required to enable these styles of HA in your WebSphere Process Server or WebSphere ESB deployment. Transactional high availability [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cjta_trans_ha.html]
This WebSphere Application Server information center topic provides conceptual information on transactional HA.

High availability of the transaction service enables any server in a cluster to recover the transactional work for any other server in the same cluster. This facility forms part of the overall WebSphere Application Server HA strategy. Configuring transaction properties for peer recovery [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_cfgpeer.html] This WebSphere Application Server information center topic provides information on configuring transaction properties for peer recovery.

It provides descriptions for the following tasks:
 * Configuring manual peer recovery for the transaction service. 
 * Configuring automated peer recovery for the transaction service 
 * Disabling file locking

Automate peer recovery for transactions and messages in WebSphere Application Server V6.0.x [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0509_lee/0509_lee.html] This IBM WebSphere Developer Technical Journal article provides information on how to set up, verify, and troubleshoot an environment for peer recovery of transactions and messages using HA features in WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V6.0.x, including the HA manager, transaction HA, and messaging HA. Asynchronous replication of WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere ESB for disaster [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0809_redlin/0809_redlin.html]
recovery environments [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0809_redlin/0809_redlin.html] This developerWorks article describes an environment that is based on using a disk-replication system in asynchronous mode. You can include this environment in a disaster-recovery plan that includes a secondary data center using WebSphere Process Server or WebSphere ESB. Exception handling in WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere ESB [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0705_fong/0705_fong.html] This developerWorks article explains how error conditions are captured and processed in WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere ESB, and describes problem detection, retry behavior, exception propagation, and reporting. The article assumes that you are familiar with the Service Component Architecture programming model and have experience developing applications with WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere ESB.
