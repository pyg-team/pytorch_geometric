PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  For IBMJCEPlus and IBMJCEPlusFIPS providers, the dependent
   library 'IBM Crypto for C module' has been upgraded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For IBMJCEPlus and IBMJCEPlusFIPS providers, the dependent
   library 'IBM Crypto for C module' has been upgraded.
   
   The dependent library for IBMJCEPlus provider has been upgraded
   from version 8.5.38.0 to 8.7.6.0
   
   The dependent library for IBMJCEPlusFIPS provider has been
   upgraded from version 8.4.1.0 to 8.6.0.0
   
   The upgrade fixes three Common Vulnerabilities and
   Exposures(CVE) and extends the sunset date for FIPS 140-2
   certification.
   
   FIPS 140-2 certification:
   
   The IBM Crypto for C module, version 8.6.0.0, is now FIPS 140-2
   certified till 11/13/2022 and the new certificate is available
   at the URL

   rogram/Certificate/3064
   
   The new version of the underlying native library used by
   IBMJCEPlus and IBMJCEPlusFIPS added support for some algorithms,
   which are not yet supported by IBMJCEPlus and IBMJCEPlusFIPS.
   These are:
   
   RSA-PSS algorithm for digital signature and verification.
   HMAC-SHA3 algorithms for message authentication code.
   SHA3 algorithms for creating message digests.
   AES-CTR algorithm for data encryption and decryption.
   
   Refer to the IBM SDK documentation for further details.
   
   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures:
   
   The upgrade fixes three CVEs  and the conditions under which the
   vulnerabilities are applicable are listed below.
   
   Performing DSA key operations with either IBMJCEPlus or
   IBMJCEPlusFIPS providers will require applying the upgrade to
   fix the vulnerability CVE-2016-0705.
   
   CVEID: CVE-2016-0705
   DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service,
   caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An
   attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and
   cause a denial of service.
   CVSS Base Score: 3.7
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 for
   the current score
   CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
   CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
   
   Performing RSA, DSA operations with either IBMJCEPlus or
   IBMJCEPlusFIPS providers, on a 64 bit Windows platform, will
   require applying the upgrade to fix the vulnerabilities
   CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2017-3736.
   
   CVEID: CVE-2017-3732
   DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain
   sensitive information, caused by a carry propagating bug in the
   x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker could exploit
   this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
   CVSS Base Score: 5.3
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 for
   the current score
   CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
   CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
   
   
   CVEID: CVE-2017-3736
   DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain
   sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the
   x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An
   attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit
   this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
   CVSS Base Score: 5.9
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 for
   the current score
