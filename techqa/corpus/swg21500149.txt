tmrt tmsub logging TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I enable TMrt logging for the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service when requested to do so by IBM Support? 

CAUSE
TMrt logging can help identify communication problems, such as COM call exceptions, between TMSub.exe and TMrt.exe, processes used by the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service. This does not apply to other clients, like the Datacap Quattro Rulerunner Service. 

TMrt logging is disabled by default and normally is not enabled unless instructed otherwise by IBM Support for troubleshooting purposes.



ANSWER
The system registry must be updated under HKEY_USERS\[USER]\SOFTWARE\Datacap\Task Master Run Task\Options Log on each machine running the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service. A machine reboot may be required for changes to take effect. 


Note: [USER] in the registry path will be the SID user branch for the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service account. For example, to find a userâ€™s SID on a Windows 2003 server, browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList, where the string ProfileImagePath indicates the SID mapping for each user. 

Relevant logging settings:

Name Log path - entry a valid file path like C:\Datacap\TMrt.log Overwrite File Overwrite log file on service restart? Set to 1 to overwrite, 0 to not. Reflush Immediately write to disk? Set to 0 for periodic writes, 1 to avoid memory buffering. Severity Logging severity - set to 9 for maximum logging. Show Date Date stamp - set to 1 to enable and 0 to disable. Show Time Time stamp - set to 1 to enable and 0 to disable. Common Buffer and Log Viewer should both be left disabled (0).
