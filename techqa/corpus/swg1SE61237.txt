APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After an application update, it was found that the application
   was looping incorrectly forgetting to close and disconnect from
   the Queue Manager. This resulted in several jobs with many
   handles to the queue. Somewhere between 20000-25000 handles on
   the queue, WRKMQMQSTS will fail with mch0601 instead of listing
   the jobs with 20000+ connections to the queue.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After an application update, it was found that the application
   was looping incorrectly forgetting to close and disconnect from
   the Queue Manager. This resulted in several jobs with many
   handles to the queue. Somewhere between 20000-25000 handles on
   the queue, WRKMQMQSTS will fail with mch0601 instead of listing
   the jobs with 20000+ connections to the queue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ code fails to allocate a large memory segment with single
   level storage on IBM i in MQ 7.0.1. From MQ 7.1.0 onward,
   teraspace storage is enabled, so this problem is not seen.
