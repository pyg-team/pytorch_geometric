QUESTION
 Why amd I receiving a SQL1768N RC7 when trying to use a second NIC card in a DB2 HADR env? 

CAUSE
When using the first NIC card, the Standby is successful in connecting to the Primary.

When trying to add a additional NIC card to be able to handle heavy network traffic, the error is returned upon a Standby connection attempt


ANSWER
Engage your local network team to run additional network tests to identify if the NIC’s MTU (communication’s block size) was configured incorrectly on the network. 


The network would attempt to fragment the blocks, some applications do support fragmentation but other's, like DB2 do not. 

So a direct DB2 connect went through, however DB2 HADR initial handshake failed. 

The network has been reconfigured to support "jumbo frames", eliminating the network frame fragmentation, and DB2 HADR handshake successfully completed over the 
second network and reaches peer mode successful
