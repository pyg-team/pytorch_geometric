RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
What does message CPA4072 mean? 

Each print file (XXXX in the CPA4072 message) has a parameter called MAXRCDS (maximum number of records). When this maximum is reached, the CPA4072 message is issued, and the user can abort printing, specify an additional number of records, or reply nomax to continue printing the file. For example, if the CPA4072 message shows a file of QSYSPRT, use the Work with File (WRKF) command:

WRKF QSYSPRT

Press the Enter key. Select Option 8 to display the print file options; the MAXRCDS (maximum spooled output records) parameter shows the limit (maybe 10,000). As soon as this number is reached, the message is issued. If a permanent change is needed, the MAXRCDS parameter can be changed to a larger number of *NOMAX. On the operating system command line, type the following:

CHGPRTF FILE(QSYSPRT) MAXRCDS(*NOMAX)

Press the Enter key.
