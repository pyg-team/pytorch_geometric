 *  VPMV5NAV: Ghost Link is generated when saving
   the CATDrawing which has Non-broken Contraints
   .
   Scenario:
   Step1 Open the "ORG_MIN_001.CATDrawing"
   Step2 Click on the "Save data in ENOVIA V5" icon.
   Step3 Click "OK" in the "Save in ENOVIA V5" panel
   to save the data to VPMNNav.
   Step4 Click on the "Save data in ENOVIA V5" icon
   again.
   Step5 Click "OK" in the "Save in ENOVIA V5" panel
   to save the data to VPMNav.
   Trouble : Ghost Link is generated and cannot save
   the data.
   .
   Severity:
   Ghost links prevent operation of drawing release
   system.
   Drawings are the customer ￇ ￇ0 s final product.
   Therefore it is considered necessary that an ghost
   links should not be generated

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED
   ON V5R18SP02 and V5R17SP08.
   .
   some ghost links are not rerouted when a document
   is "captured" by ENOVIA. As a result, some EV5 doc
   may keep some links on 'FILE' document. Because
   of our "save to enovia" engine, such links may lead
   to load pointed 'file' doc, and capture them again
   in EV5 The end user has 2 visible effects :
   - doc are repeated in save panel (same pb in R16
   and R17)
   - specifically in R17, name conflict is detected
   and prevent the save
   Correction Explanation
   As a result, the 'FILE' doc loaded because of ghost
   links are now detected as 'in name collision' with
   ENOVIA document. This progress has a side effect
   in our save panel. we didn't correct the minor pb,
   but the root one:
   we are now able to avoid getting 'FILE' doc
   pointed by ghost links in our save transaction
   (note CV5_EV5_KeepGhostLinks=0 means I no
   longer want to keep GhostLink in save)
   One must note the doc content is not cleaned (the
   faulty doc continues to have ghost links) and the
   doc stream is not updated in vault. Advantage is
   we don't modify the pointing doc (kept not dirty),
   we only impact the save transaction scope.
   (correction can be rollback ed with en var :
   set CV5_EV5_KeepGhostLinks=1)
   Answer and By-Pass
   bypass to allow save is really simple:
   manual rename of 'FILE' documents loaded because
   of GhostLinks, then save
   .
