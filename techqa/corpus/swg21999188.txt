Overview 

The steps outlined below are required to run IBM Traveler on a Domino 9.0.1 FP8 or later server. It is not required to run Domino 9.0.1 FP8 or later to use the latest available IBM Traveler release. 

 

Note: This technote does not apply to IBM Traveler installations on IBMi platform. For instructions for configuring Traveler for DB2 on IBMi please see the product documentation here: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYRPW_9.0.1/ConfiguringHAOnIBMI.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYRPW_9.0.1/ConfiguringHAOnIBMI.html] 

 

Traveler Requirements 

Java 8 support is included in IBM Traveler 9.0.1.16 and later releases. It is required to run this level or later on a Domino server running 9.0.1 FP8 or later. 

Download IBM Traveler from: 

 * Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=Collaboration%2BSolutions&product=ibm/Lotus/Lotus+Notes+Traveler&release=9.0.1&platform=All&function=all&source=fc] 
 * Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21700800]


JDBC Requirements 

If running IBM Traveler with either DB2 or MS SQL enterprise database server, then follow these steps to ensure compatibility with Java 8. 

 

 * If using DB2 server: In order to support Java 8 you must use DB2 JDBC Driver V10.5 FP7 (4.19.49) or higher, see technote 1983724 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983724] for details. The DB2 JDBC Driver can be downloaded directly from Fix Central, see technote 1363866 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866] for download information. Copy the db2jcc4.jar file to the <domino>\Traveler\lib directory and restart the Domino server. Be sure to remove any old copies of the DB2 JDBC driver from the system.

 * If using MS SQL server: In order to support Java 8 you must use sqljdbc42.jar file from MS JDBC 4.1 or later release. Download the latest Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver from this site [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11774]. For detailed system requirements for the SQL Server JDBC driver see this Microsoft article [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms378422(v=sql.110).aspx]. Copy the sqljdbc42.jar file to the <domino>\Traveler\lib directory and restart the Domino server. Be sure to remove any old copies of the MS SQL JDBC driver from the system.
