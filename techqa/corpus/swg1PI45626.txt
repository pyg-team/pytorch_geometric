APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the local environment is used to override the Web service
   URL in an Integration Node, for example,
   
   DECLARE URL CHARACTER MyURL || 'search?q=' || 'hello';
   SET OutputLocalEnvironment.Destination.HTTP.RequestURL = URL;
   
   and the query string contains reserved characters, then these
   characters
   will be incorrectly percent encoded.
   
   This may result in an HTTP Response status error, for example,
   "404 Not Found".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the following simple example, the URL is concatenated with a
   query string that includes the '=' reserved character and is
   then used to dynamically set the RequestURL in the HTTPRequest
   node using the Local Environment override:
   
   SET MyURL = 'https://www.google.co.uk/';
   DECLARE URL CHARACTER MyURL || 'search?q=' || 'hello';
   SET OutputLocalEnvironment.Destination.HTTP.RequestURL = URL;
   
   The defect will result in the '=' character being percent
   encoded, which in turn may result in an HTTP status error.
   
   To avoid the error without having to apply the fix, instead of
   the example ESQL code as above, set RequestURL to the base URL
   and override the QueryString in the Local environment:
   
   SET MyURL = 'https://www.google.co.uk/';
   SET OutputLocalEnvironment.Destination.HTTP.RequestURL = MyURL;
   SET OutputLocalEnvironment.Destination.HTTP.QueryString.search =
   'hello';
   
   For more details about the Local environment overrides that can
   be used for the HTTPRequest node, please see the following topic

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus using Local Environment
   overrides to set the RequestURL of the HTTPRequest node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If the HTTPRequest node Request URL is dynamically set using the
   Local Environment override and includes a query string that
   contains reserved characters, then all or most of the reserved
   characters will be percent encoded, depending on the platform.
   
   On z/OS, all of the reserved characters in the following list
   will be percent encoded, i.e.,
   : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =
   
   On distributed, all of the reserved characters in the following
   list will be percent encoded, i.e.,
   : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ ' ( ) * + , ; (& and = will not be percent
   encoded on distributed).
   
   This can result in HTTP error status codes, for example, '404
   Not Found'.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product no longer percent encodes the URL reserved
   characters.
