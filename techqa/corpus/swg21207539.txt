PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Various abends and program checks cause CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V2 to fail. The abends are occurring in several CICS regions because 4 bytes of zeroes are overlaying program instructions and control blocks. Storage Protection is active in all regions. 

SYMPTOM
The abends are unpredictable and include: 


DFHLD0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'4D6' in module DFHLDST. 
DFHFC0001 An abend (code 0C1/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'56E' in module DFHFCVS
IEA995I SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0C4 REASON CODE=00000011
IEA995I SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0C1 REASON CODE=00000001



CAUSE
Program TMON824, running in Key0, is overlaying program storage and control blocks.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A SLIP storage alter trap showed that program TMON824, offset x'14BC' is overlaying CICS storage with an XC instruction (D703 1542 1542). TMON824 is executing under a TCB in the TMON home address space, running in Key0. 

The following SLIP storage alter trap was used to trap storage address 28600569 being overlaid : 
SLIP SET,SA,RA=28600569,ASIDSA=('jobname1','jobname2','jobname3',...), 

SDATA=(ALLNUC,LPA,LSQA,PSA,RGN,SQA,TRT,CSA),DATA=(28600569,EQ,00000000), 
A=SYNCSVCD,ID=iiii,END 

where parameter ASIDSA should include all relevant CICS jobnames in single quotes. The ASIDSA parameter is necessary as TMON was executing under a TCB in the TMON home address space, but overlaying an address within the CICS address space.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade ASG-TMON for CICS/ESA Version 2.0 to Version 2.3. TMON 2.0 is unsupported. After upgrading to TMON 2.3, the overlays did not occur. Contact ASG Software Solutions [http://asg.com/] if you need additional assistance.
