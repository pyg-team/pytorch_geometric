   This problem occurs because HTTP redirect filter was being
   invoked out of order causing the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code changes were made to move the HTTP redirect filter to
   right after ODR first request filter so redirect routing rule
   is enforced correctly.
   
   This fix will be included in the next available fix pack for
