Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in MD5 Signature and Hash Algorithm affects IBM FlashSystem model V840 (CVE-2015-7575) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The MD5 “SLOTH” vulnerability on TLS 1.2 affects IBM® FlashSystem™ V840. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
FlashSystem V840 including machine type and models (MTMs) for all available code levels. MTMs affected include 9846-AE1, 9848-AE1, 9846-AC0, 9848-AC0, 9846-AC1, and 9848-AC1.
All V840 storage nodes (MTMs ending in –AE1) are affected when running code levels before 1.1.3.8. Code levels starting 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 are not affected.

All V840 controller nodes (MTMs ending in –AC0 or –AC1) are affected when running code levels before 7.3.0.10. Code levels starting 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 are not affected.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
If the code level you are running is affected, IBM recommends that you fix this vulnerability by upgrading the V840 nodes to the following code levels or higher:
