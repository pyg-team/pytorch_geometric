binding; client; MQ; libraries; JMS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to create a new instance for CDC Event Server in binding mode and getting the following error.

Testing JMS Destination. Please wait... 

Error: IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture failed to connect to the 
specified JMS Destination.Error: javax.naming.Reference incompatible 
with org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl Page 4 of 39 

Press ENTER to continue... 

CAUSE
The binding mode will only work if ES were to use MQ specific API (3rd party libraries) and ES is on the same machine as the MQ.

ENVIRONMENT
Change Data Capture Event Server

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install/change the third party libraries to the following jars:
jms.jar 
com.ibm.mq.jar 
com.ibm.mqjms.jar 
com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar 
connector.jar 
dhbcore.jar 
fscontext.jar 
providerutil.jar 

Only these jar files should be included.
