This issue was first seen after Oracle made a change starting with Java 8 update 131 to not trust md5 signed jar files. See the following blog for more details: 
https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jre-will-no-longer-trust-md5-signed-code-by-default [https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jre-will-no-longer-trust-md5-signed-code-by-default] 

 

In order to get past this error, the jar file utility that IBM uses to re-sign jar files had to be updated. Now that it is updated, customers will need to send us their jar files to be re-signed with the new signer utility. 

 

Update certificates at the current maintenance levels of IBM Tivoli Monitoring products installed as follows: 

Contact IBM support by opening a PMR requesting the updated certificate for Tivoli Enterprise Portal server (TEPS) support files. The PMR should be opened against COMPID 5724C04EP or 5724C04PS. You will need to send the jar and zip files from your Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS) located as follows:

UNIX/Linux
<InstallDirectory>/<Architecture>/cw/classes

Windows
%CANDLE_HOME%\CNB\classes 

Once the submitted files are updated, Support will then publish the update for download and notify the customer.

Once the jar files are downloaded from IBM support, copy the files back to the same location on the TEP server noted above in this document. After the jar files are copied back to the TEP server there is no further action needed on the tep server side. The TEP server does not need to be reconfigured nor does it need to be restarted. On the TEP client side the java plugin jar cache should be cleared in order to force the download of the newly signed jar files to the client machine. This can be accomplished by going to Windows control panel and opening the java plugin control panel. From the "General" tab in the plugin control panel press the "Settings" button under the "Temporary Internet Files" heading, then press the "Delete Files" button. Once the delete is complete, restart the TEP client to force the download of the newly signed jar files from the TEP server.
