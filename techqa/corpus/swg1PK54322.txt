APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently z/OS always adds the two byte pad when generating
   CCDTs, regardless of the value of exitLength. This behavior is
   inconsistent with the other platforms. So this apar is to bring
   the MQ server code to a consistent level so that WMQ Java code
   can handle it uniformly for all platforms. The Windows and
   distributed apar is IC53819 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC53819].
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 6 *
   *                 Release 0.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A Client Channel Definition Table(CCDT) *
   *                      is generated for a channel that uses    *
   *                      SSL. A client program then uses this    *
   *                      CCDT during a connect call, but the     *
   *                      call fails with code 2399 (SSL Peer     *
   *                      Name Error).                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apar (IC53819 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC53819]) has also been taken to        *
   *                 correct MQ Java/JMS/Explorer handling of     *
   *                 CCDTs.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   The CCDT contained the peer name in full, but a problem trace
   showed that the Connect call was missing the beginning of this
   name.
   In a correct CCDT, the peer name should be preceded by the
   channel exit details and an optional padding string (this
   string should only be present when the exit details are shorter
   than a certain length).
   Upon investigating further, it was found that the z/OS utility
   CSQUTIL and the Java parsing code (used in MQ Explorer) were not
   consistent in their handling of the padding string.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQUTIL has been changed to only add the padding string to the
   CCDT when the channel exit details are less than 8 characters.
