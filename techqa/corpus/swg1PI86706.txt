APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer entered a /STO AREA command for an Area which was
   part of restart PREOPEN. The command completed and Area was
   stopped. After PREOPEN completed, /STA Area was attempted, but
   failed with DFS3702I RSN10 and DFS3702I RC06.
   Preopen does bulk DBRC authorization of a list of Areas, and
   then opens each area. If the open fails ( DBFCMOC1 CALLOPEN )
   the DBRC authorization done by preopen isn't released.
   /STA AREA is then unable to obtain authorization for the Area
   after PREOPEN completes.
