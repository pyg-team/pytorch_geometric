Title: IBM Generating a report to show the "up time" of the Managed Systems - United States

Text:
up time; node; GBLTMSTAMP; ITM_TEMS_PERFORMANCE; ITM_TEMS_CONFIG; query TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you generate a report to show the "up time" (how long the agent is up and running since it was started) of the Managed Systems in IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) environment? 

ANSWER
There is no direct command, however, there is a work around but one needs some scripting skills (any language and any OS). 

The GBLTMSTAMP value on the below query, gives the Start time of the managed system 

You could write a script to execute a query and take the GBLTMSTAMP value and subtract the current timestamp to get the up time for the managed system 

SELECT GBLTMSTMP, NODE, ORIGINNODE, O4ONLINE, PRODUCT, THRUNODE, VERSION 
FROM O4SRV.INODESTS; 

Where NODE is the managed system name. 

Note : How to execute a query is not within the scope of this technote
