APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description/Scenario :
   Within some customization scripts to let client side
   script to identifify field in profile card, We use ST
   proposed API
   var controls = ProfileCardObj.GetControls();
   It takes 20 seconds to run, and it depend on how
   many attributes in the profilecard,
   if there are more attributes in profilecard, it runs
   around 40 seconds at least we had met.
   That's means, when user click a button, he need to
   wait around 30~60 seconds, than he can do next
   step.
   That heavily hurts customer satisfaction of willing
   to use ....etc.
   From our talent developer's self study. We replace
   original API with following one :
   var controls = windows.document.all;
   The performance improved times than
   original.....from 30~60 sec to 1~2 sec.
   But the side effect we know/foresee is that we
   have take care each field's data type instead of
   object type handling .....
