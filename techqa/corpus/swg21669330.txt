Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Missing authorization concept for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) User Attributes CVE-2014-0908 - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The User Attribute feature in IBM Business Process Manager does not have an authorization concept. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
As a consequence, each user can read and update their own attribute values and the attribute values for another user by using REST APIs. However, there are security-sensitive use cases for user attribute values, such as email notifications or task assignments that use expressions. You might also choose to store confidential information about users in user attribute values. The lack of authorization for this feature can create a security exposure.
