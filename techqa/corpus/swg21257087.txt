PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why using Service Data Objects (SDO) Generator in Rational® Application Developer version 7 (RAD), the generated code fails when running on the WebSphere® Test Environment (WTE) 6.1 version that comes with the default installation. 

SYMPTOM
The runtime error appears as 


java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org/eclipse/emf/ecore/EPackage$Registry.getEFactory(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/eclipse/emf/ecore/EFactory;




CAUSE
RAD v7 uses a newer version of SDO/Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) that is not compatible with the SDO/EMF version found in WTE 6.1.0.2. Within RAD v7, the Java™ classes are generated using EMF 2.2, but WTE 6.1.0.2 contains EMF 2.1. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The EMF level was upgraded to EMF 2.2.1 in WAS version 6.1.0.3. Upgrading the WTE to the 6.1.0.3 level or above resolves this version compatibility issue.
