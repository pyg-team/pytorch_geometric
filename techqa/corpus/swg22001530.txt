 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Guardium DC Controller not starting up with Guardium WinSTAP 

SYMPTOM
On the MS Window Server (DB Server) Guardium WinSTAT shows up and running but the Guardium DC Controller is not running. 

On the Guardium Collector's GUI the corresponding S-TAP shows as down (not running).


CAUSE
This issue could be caused due to wrong configuration of the INSTANCE_NAME in file GUARD_TAP.INI




ENVIRONMENT
MS Windows Enterprise Server
MS SQL Server




DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

1- Review the INSTANCE_NAME configuration/value in the file GUARD_TAP.INI


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * [DB_MSSQL1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


2- At the Windows DOS prompt, execute the following command 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Compare the instance name returned by the command with the INSTANCE_NAME configured in the INI file, if it is different you need to change to the valuer returned by the command.  

If the command returns MSSQLSERVER, you are using the default MS instance name MSSQLSERVER, if it returns MSSQL$xxxxxx, you are uisng a named instance "xxxxxx". Configure "INSTANACE_NAME=xxxxxx" in the GUARD_TAP.INI file. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If it returns MSSQLSERVER, you're using the default instance MSSQLSERVER.
Please set INSANCE_NAME=MSSQLSERVER in guard_tap.ini
If it returns MSSQL$xxxxx, you're using a named instance and the instance name
is xxxxx. Please set INSTANCE_NAME=xxxxx in guard_tap.ini.
