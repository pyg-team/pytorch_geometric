PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running batch creation tasks, such as VScan, with Rulerunner, multiple batches may be created and/or left in the running state. 

CAUSE
Rulerunner is a very efficient service and will overdrive the Rulerunner Server if too many tasks or threads are assigned.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Turn off Mixed Queuing 

 1. Run Rulerunner Manager. 
 2. On the Rulerunner tab, stop the service. 
 3. On the Rulerunner Login tab, click Connect. 
 4. Select the Workflow tab. 
 5. On the Rulerunner Settings subtab, uncheck Mixed Queuing. 
 6. Click Save, then go back to the Rulerunner tab and start the service.


Set skipsamebatch for VScan tasks  1. Run Rulerunner Manager. 
 2. On the Rulerunner tab, stop the service. 
 3. On the Rulerunner Login tab, click Connect. 
 4. On the Workflow tab, expand the hierarchy on the right and highlight VScan. 
 5. In the Settings section in the lower right, set skipsamebatch to 1. 
 6. Highlight the line labeled <dbs> above VScan in the thread hierarchy. 
 7. Set skipsamebatch to 1 there also. 
 8. Click Save, then go back to the Rulerunner tab and start the service.


For Datacap Taskmaster 8.0.1, the procedures are the same but some tabs will have different names. 

If you are still experiencing this issue the problem may be with your DataCap Object (DCO). Correcting DCO issues will resolve batches left in running state. RELATED INFORMATION
