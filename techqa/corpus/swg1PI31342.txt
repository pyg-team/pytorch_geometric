APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some xscmd commands that list servers or host names in table
   format fail with an OutOfMemory error when the catalog service
   domain has long server or host names.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere eXtreme Scale users who run xscmd *
   *                  and have long server or host names defined  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When an xscmd command prints a table,   *
   *                      it wraps the last column to fit the     *
   *                      command window, which might cause an    *
   *                      infinite loop.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   On some commands, such as showQuorumStatus, the server names
   and hostname are printed in a table format. If the names are
   very long, the last column does not fit and xscmd incorrectly
   goes into a loop trying to fit the last column.
   The xscmd table format was modified to wrap the last column to
   another row if the table is too wide to fit the last column.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To workaround, use the redirect output option on xscmd, -ro,
   or pipe the xscmd to a file instead of printing directly to the
   command window. See the following examples for Windows
   operating systems:
   
   xscmd -c showQuorumstatus -ro out.txt
   xscmd -c showQuorumstatus > out.txt
   xscmd -c showQuorumStatus > out.txt 2>&1
