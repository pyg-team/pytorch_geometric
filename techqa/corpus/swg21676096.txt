Text:
E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND Site Preferences TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An error message indicating that The requested item was not found for the Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT object was returned with an E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND error when trying to login to Workplace XT. 

SYMPTOM
When trying to login to Workplace XT, the following error is logged in the WebSphere SystemOut.log file:

[6/10/14 11:52:52:850 MDT] 0000001d SystemOut O 2014-06-10 11:52:52,847 ERROR [WebContainer : 0] - [throw] com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;The requested item was not found. Object identity: /Preferences/Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT. Class name: Versionable. [Code=null] ... Object Reference [DOCUMENT:1] ID "/Preferences/Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT" in ObjectStore "OS2"; OMFC/Document/GetProperties//E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND


CAUSE
The Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT object was not found in the object store OS2 in the Root Folder - Preferences folder.

ENVIRONMENT
Workplace XT 1.1.5
FileNet P8 Content Engine 5.x


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The object store OS2 did not contain the Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT object anywhere in the object store. However, there was a Site Preferences for WorkplaceXT object found in a different object store, OS1, in the Root Folder - Preferences folder.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM






Checked the bootstrap.properties file and found it was pointing to the wrong object store (OS2) for the Preferences Setting / Object Store name. The following entry in the bootstrap.properties file (usually found in \IBM\FileNet\Config\WebClient) was changed as follows:



 1. First make a backup copy of the bootstrap.properties file
    
    
 2. Edit the following line:
    
    
    objectStoreId=OS2
    
    
    Change to:
    
    
    objectStoreId=OS1
    
    
 3. After restarting Workplace XT in WebSphere, test to confirm the login to Workplace XT is successful.
