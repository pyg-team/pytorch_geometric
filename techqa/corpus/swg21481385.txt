Title: IBM Error Retrieving Security Provider when attempting to log into the repository after reboot or start up of Jboss. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A port conflict with the RMI port is causing an error when attempting to connect with Deployment Manager. Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS) is using JBoss as its application server.

Error seen from Deployment manager:
Error Retrieving Security Provider Information
Reason:
(400)No Host matches server name XXXXXX - where XXXXXX could either be localhost or domain name of server

Error seen from the Jboss server.log:
java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in user: 1098; nested exception is:
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The default rmi port for jboss is 1098. 
It appears the port is already being used by another service/task. 

The port can be changed to point to a different port that is free. The file to modify is jboss-service.xml and can be found in the jboss install under server/default/conf. The parameter to be changed is 'RmiPort'.
In addition, we will also use the 1099 port for JNP (Java Naming Provider).

Note: you can use 'netstat -ano' command to list all active ports to determine which ports are in use. It is possible that another application, such as SQL Server, is currently using that port or Window may be using this port for it's services. Ending and restarting that application or restarting windows may free up that port. 

If Windows is taking this port please see the Jboss community for more information: https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DebugBindException [https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DebugBindException]
