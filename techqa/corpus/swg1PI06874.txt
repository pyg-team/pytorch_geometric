APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are several locations in the CICS VSAM Recovery
   publications where references are made to the CICS TS utility
   DFHJUP. These are incorrect. The references must be changed to
   DWWJUP since DFHJUP will be unable to handle some logstreams if
   CICS VR has written to them. An indication that this might be
   the case is an error similar to the following:
   
   DFHLG0194 ERROR DETECTED BY CICS SUBSYSTEM.
             INVALID HEADER ID  18400000 04081840 6EC4E6E6
   
   The last 4 bytes of the invalid header data above is '>DWW'
   
   The DFHJUP utility expects '>DFH' not '>DWW'.
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): KIXREVRJL
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use DWWJUP for any logstream that has CICS VR records written
   to it
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects CICS VR 5.1 and 4.3 users  *
   *                 that use the DWWJUP utility.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS VR documentation incorrect refers  *
   *                      to utility DFHJUP instead of DWWJUP.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   CICSVR 5.1 and 4.3 publications "Implementation Guide and
   Reference" and "Messages and Problem Determination" were
   updated to change DFHJUP references to DWWJUP.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Doc changes to the CICS VR 5.1 documents are in the infocenter
   refresh that went out on 13 December 2013, for example:

   com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwig/lscu.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwig/lscu.html]
   Doc changes to the CICS VR 4.3 documents are in ftp://public.dhe
