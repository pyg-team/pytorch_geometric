 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Calling web service with local Web Service endpoint in Cast Iron Live fails with "operation not registered error" will results in "operation not registered" error. 

SYMPTOM
Error message -
Operation Name: <web_service_operation(activity)_name> has not been registered


CAUSE
Cast Iron Live can't find the web service operation

ENVIRONMENT
Cast Iron Live

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This error could be caused by incorrect setting in the Web Service endpoint which is used by the Invoke Service activity. It is common that user chooses Invoke > Location > Local since the two orchestrations are in the same project. Although "Local" works in the physical appliance and hypervisor, it results in this error as described in Cast Iron Live. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
"Cast Iron Cloud" should be selected in the Web Service endpoint panel. When invoking a web service, select Type > Invoke > Location > Cast Iron Cloud. When providing a web service, select Type > Provide > Transport > Cast Iron Cloud
