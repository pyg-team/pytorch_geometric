 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error occurs when saving in Cognos Configuration on a Citrix server.
However, Contributor and Analyst still function fine. 


SYMPTOM
ERROR:
Unable to save the configuration file. 
CAM-CRP-1193 An error occurred while attempting to contact the active 
Content Manager to update the local CA information. Check your 
configuration to ensure that the configured URIs are valid and that 
there are services running at those locations. Error removing BIBus 
wrapper from CA Cache message. Reason: org.dom4j.DocumentException: 
Error on line 1 of document : The reference to entity 
"ProtectionLevel" must end with the ';' delimiter. Nested exception: 
The reference to entity "ProtectionLevel" must end with the ';' 
delimiter. 
The parameter named 'User ID and password' located in 
'cognos_plan_84_dev' is currently invalid


CAUSE
On the machine that encounters the error, the PlanningStore is configured in Cognos Configuration. However, the machine is a Contributor Administration Client and therefore no services exist and the PlanningStore does not need to be defined.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the PlanningStore from Cognos Configuration and Save.
