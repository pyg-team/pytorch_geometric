Title: IBM Error 1920: Service PASW Modeler Server 13 (PASW Modeler Server 13) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start the service. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm trying to install PASW Modeler Server on my lap-top (HP 6730b) on Windows XP service pack 3. The wizard runs through the install process and at the end tries to start the service. It then issues the error message:

Error 1920: Service PASW Modeler Server 13 (PASW Modeler Server 13) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start the service.

I am forced to cancel the install process and as a result the PASW Modeler installer automatically rolls back the install.

1) I have sufficient privileges. I am in the Administrator group and can start/stop/install other services including PASW Statistics Server and MS SQL Server.

2) I have licensed the product while the error message is displayed and tried to manually start the service with no luck.

3) A colleague next to me has the same lap-top and OS yet has installed without any problems.


Here is some additional supporting information

Error Message: 2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Server init failed: bind(): error = 10038
Case Description: 
My Clementine server will not run on my laptop. I get the following error:

2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Clementine Server 12.0.3
2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Root (working) directory set to C:\Program Files\SPSSInc\ClementineServer12.0
2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Locale set to English_United States.1252
2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Encoding set to cp1252
2009/03/02 08:00:41 [8052]: Server init failed: bind(): error = 10038

No other reports currently exist which associate this error to other issues. The registry issue became appearant when attempting to install the Server again after an uninstall attempt and another install which failed at the end attempting to start the service.

The error when the Services was attempting to be started is:
"Error 1920. Service Clementine Server 12.0 (Clementine Server 12.0) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services."

Further research on the 1920 error provides information that the Windows registry is corrupt. 

To substantiate this information more, viewing the "Users" within the control panel, the following was seen as well.

domain\Administrator

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
*************** INTERNAL RESOLUTION ONLY ******************

1) 
In reviewing the reports of the 1920 error during installation, it was found that each of these reports were on a laptop running Windows XP. Due to the nature of the reports, it was found that each of them were from the Training Group. We tested the install on each of the models of laptops they were using and were able to install and start the server without issue. It is suspected that a 3rd party software package used by all the users reporting the error or a combination of software packages used, is causing the conflict in starting the service. 

Since Windows XP is not a support platform we can not determine what this conflict is and there for recommend the users only install server on a supported platform.

In addition, each case, one on Windows XP and one with Windows 2003 Server 32bit the resolution was the same in that Windows had to be reinstalled in order to correct the problem.

If you receive reports of users receiving this error on a supported platform, please let the Development Team know so we can investigate further.
