VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-14495 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14495]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak when the --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet option is specified. By using vectors related to DNS response creation, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume available memory.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132935 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132935] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-14494 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14494]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by improper validation of requests. By sending specially-crafted DHCPv6 forwarded requests, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132934 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132934] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2017-14496 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14496]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer underflow in the add_pseudoheader function. By sending a specially-crafted DNS request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the service to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132936 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132936] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-14493 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14493]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. By sending a specially-crafted DHCPv6 request, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132933 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132933] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-14492 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14492]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. By sending a specially-crafted IPv6 router advertisement request, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132932 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132932] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-14491 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14491]
DESCRIPTION: dnsmasq is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. By sending a specially-crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 9.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132931 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132931] for the current score
