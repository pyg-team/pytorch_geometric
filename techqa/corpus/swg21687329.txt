PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Vulnerabilities scanning tool report the following LMT 7.5.0 vulnerability - Clickjacking 

SYMPTOM
It was identified through testing that the ILMT application is vulnerable to Clickjacking. Clickjacking is a malicious technique of 

tricking Web users into revealing confidential information or taking 
control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous Web 
pages. A clickjacked page tricks a user into performing undesired 
actions by clicking on a concealed link. 
On a clickjacked page, the attacker displays a set of 'dummy' buttons 
and then loads another page over it in a transparent layer. 
The users believe they are clicking the visible buttons, while they are
actually performing actions on the hidden page. The hidden page may be 
an authentic page, and therefore the attacker can trick users into 
performing actions unintentionally, and there is no way of tracing such
actions later, as the user was genuinely authenticated on the other 
page. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clickjacking is a valid finding. However it could be easily 
mitigated using the IHS in the front of the UI. By adding: 
"Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY" in http.conf 
and loading headers module: 
#LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so 
Below you will find instruction how to setup http server in the front
