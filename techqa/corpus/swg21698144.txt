[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698144&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698144&aid=1]


CAUSE
In the IBM Case Manager configuration tool, the Deploy Workplace XT had an incorrect path in the Workplace XT EAR file path: entry when "Deploy Workplace XT" task was run. 



ENVIRONMENT
Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition, IBM Case Manager 5.2.1 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The "JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource /WorkplaceXT/eprocess/WcmDesigner.jsp" error indicates that Workplace XT is NOT successfully installed, and is NOT correctly deployed on the ICM server. 


Check to see if the WcmDesigner.jsp file exists on the server where the error occurs. The WcmDesigner.jsp file should be in the deployed eprocess directory of Workplace XT if Workplace XT has been successfully installed and deployed.

For example, here is the WcmDesigner.jsp file location in a working Windows system: 

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\installedApps\P8Node01Cell\WorkplaceXT.ear\web_client.war\eprocess

If you do not have this WcmDesigner.jsp file in the specified location above, it indicates that you have not successfully installed and deployed Workplace XT application on the affected application server. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use one of the two ways below to address the reported issue. 

 

 * Verify that in the IBM Case Manager configuration tool, the Deploy Workplace XT has a correct path in the Workplace XT EAR file path: entry , and make sure that the WcmDesigner.jsp file gets created after you have run " Deploy Workplace XT" task assuming Workplace XT is installed. 
 * Or starting with Fix Pack 5.2.1.1-ICM-FP001, it leverages Process Designer in IBM Content Navigator plugin from Content Platform Engine V5.2.1.0 to reduce the dependency for Workplace XT. Refer to https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.2.1/readme/icmfp5211.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.2.1/readme/icmfp5211.html] where it states that If you choose to use the Process Designer using IBM CPE Applets support plug-in ensure to select " IBM CPE applets support plug-in " as the value for "Process Designer container" before running the "Create Case Manager Applications" task. See the screen shot below for your reference.
