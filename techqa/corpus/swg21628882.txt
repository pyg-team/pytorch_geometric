PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 As part of Upgrade Guide instructions, running Integrity Checker for MAM 7.1.1.10 version before upgrading to MAM 7.5.0.3 and receiving BMXAA8149E on the Integrity Checker report. 

SYMPTOM
Cannot proceed with the upgrade process to Maximo 7.5.0.3 once the BMXAA8149E errors cannot be resolved. 


CAUSE
As per previous version of Maximo Upgrade Resources IBM document ( http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21266217 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21266217] – now with new upgrade road map / path information), we should be at MAM 7.1.1.10 database version to upgrade to Maximo 7.5.0.3.

Once you are at Maximo 7.1.1.10 database version you can run the Integrity Checker as it is required on the IBM document “Maximo 7.1 to 7.5 Upgrade Guide” ( mam_7.5_upgrade_guide.pdf ), section “Run integrity checker 7.1”, page 38, 63 or 86 (depending on the Upgrade Scenario in place). 

When you run Maximo 7.1 Integrity Checker against the database you will see it is not showing a Maximo 7.1.1.10 version, for instance (sample) :

BMXAA0388E -- Database jdbc:sqlserver://999.99.99.999:9999;xopenStates=false;trustServerCertificate=false;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=true;selectMethod=direct;responseBuffering=adaptive;packetSize=8000;loginTimeout=15;lockTimeout=-1;lastUpdateCount=true;encrypt=false;disableStatementPooling=true;databaseName=IBMSAMPLEDB75;applicationName=Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver; Version V7100-001. Sun Mar 17 19:30:47 CST 2013

It is connecting to a “V7100-001” and not a “V71110-16”database version as would be expected it to be as a prerequisite to upgrade to Maximo 7.5.0.3.

This is likely an upgrade scenario from version 6 to 7 and UpdateDB.bat was not executed for completing the upgrade. 

On the “Maximo 6 to 7.1 Upgrade Guide” document (document 6_to_7_upgrade_e17.pdf) the Maximo Upgrade Utilities process for upgrading from Maximo 6.2.8 database to Maximo 7.1.1.10 DB will comprehend the following utilities runs: Integrity Checker, Validation and then Upgrade. For completing the upgrade process, UpdateDB.bat must be executed (Chapter 4 - “Completing the upgrade process”, page 65).

The SERVICECONTRACT object is an obsolete table left over from Maximo 5 and UpdateDB .bat run for completing the upgrade from Maximo 6.2.8 to Maximo 7.1.1.10 should be taking care of deleting it from database automatically.

ENVIRONMENT
Maximo 7.1.1.10 upgrading to Maximo 7.5.0.3.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When running then Maximo 7.1.1.10 Integrity Checker on its log files IntegrityYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.lis and IntegrityYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log we will see on the “BMXAA0388E -- Database “ line that database is not at MAM 7.1.1.10 level. For instance (sample):

BMXAA0388E -- Database jdbc:sqlserver://999.99.99.999:9999;xopenStates=false;trustServerCertificate=false;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=true;selectMethod=direct;responseBuffering=adaptive;packetSize=8000;loginTimeout=15;lockTimeout=-1;lastUpdateCount=true;encrypt=false;disableStatementPooling=true;databaseName=IBMSAMPLEDB75;applicationName=Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver; Version V7100-001. Sun Mar 17 19:30:47 CST 2013

It is connecting to a “V7100-001” and not a “V71110-16” database version what we should expect it to be as a prerequisite to upgrade to Maximo 7.5.0.3.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Complete the missing step from Maximo 6.2.8 to Maximo 7.1.1.10 upgrade process as per “Maximo 6 to 7.1 Upgrade Guide” (document 6_to_7_upgrade_e17.pdf) guide and execute UpdateDB.bat (Chapter 4 - “Completing the upgrade process”, page 65) before executing MAM 7.1 Integrity Checker.
