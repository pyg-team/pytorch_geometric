Title: IBM Supported way to install WebSphere MQ Java jar files, JMS jar files, or C/C++ libraries - United States

Text:
MQ client java jms mqjava mqjms mqjar jar mqminfo com.ibm.mqjms.jar com.ibm.mq.jar TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the supported way to install the WebSphere MQ Java jar files, the MQ JMS jar files, or the C/C++ libraries? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are 2 sections, one for MQ 7.x and the other for MQ 8.0 and later
+++ Section 1: MQ 7.x

The only supported way to get the MQ jar files or the MQ C/C++ library files onto a system is to install either:
- the WebSphere MQ product or 
- the WebSphere MQ Client SupportPacs.

To legally download and use a client you must first accept the terms and conditions specified in the License Agreement.

Do not copy the WebSphere MQ jar files to application EAR or WAR files.

Do not copy the WebSphere MQ jar or MQ C/C++ library files from other machines:
- Fix Packs cannot be applied to an "installation" where jar or C/C++ library files have been copied from another machine, and this makes it much more difficult to ensure that all of these jar/library files are kept in step with each other, and are at compatible levels.
- Copying jar/library files between machines can also result in multiple copies of the files residing on the same machine, which can cause problems servicing the code and debugging problems.

+++ Section 2: MQ 8.0 and later

a) Starting with MQ 8.0, you can use Relocatable JAR Files
