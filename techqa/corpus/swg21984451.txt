Title: IBM Webgui 8.1 Installation fails with 32 bit package Error on zLinux - United States

Webgui Installation fails 32-bit 64-bit package group TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of WebSphere/WEBGUI fails during the installation of WebSphere with below error on zLinux:

The 32-bit IBM WebSphere Application Server package cannot be installed in a 64-bit package group. 

SYMPTOM
You will get below errors if you try to install 64-bit version of WebSphere on z-linux server, using 64-bit IBM Installation Manager. 

The 32-bit IBM WebSphere Application Server package cannot be installed in a 64-bit package group.

If you try to install Netcool WEBGUI on the same machine it requires 64-bit Installation Manager. If you try 32-bit IM the installation will fail with below errors:

ERROR: The 64-bit IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI package cannot be installed in a 32-bit package group. 

Err - Failure in installing WebGUI 8.1 ... Check Installation Manager logs.


CAUSE
Websphere 8.5 offerings do not support a 64-bit package group on zLinux in IBM Installation Manager (IM) even if you try to install 64-bit version of WebSphere. 

An internal APAR PI61710 is created for this. It is scheduled in WebSphere 8.5 Fix Pack 10. 
Estimated release date for 8.5.5.10 can be found in below technote:

The root problem is that WAS does not properly respect 's390x' (nor apparently 'ppc64') in the IM response file so you need to use arch='s390' to suppress above errors.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To complete the installation use below work around. Using this work around you can complete the installation using same response file and 64-bit Installation Manager. 

1. In the response file set arch='s390' for WAS only. The fix (setting arch='s390') applies to WebSphere's three components (Base, SDK, & JazzSM extensions) only. Make this change in the profile section of the response file. 

Following shows a line in response file which represents architecture.
<data key='cic.selector.arch' value='s390'/> 

2. For all other components (JazzSM/DASH,WebGUI, and OMNIbus Core) use 's390x', which is what it correctly should be if it is 64-bit zLinux on s390x (and 'ppc64'). 

3. After above change try the installation.
