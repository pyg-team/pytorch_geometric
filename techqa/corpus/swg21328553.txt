Title: IBM MAPI profile creation fails with error message:
AFUM0009E: An error occurred: MAPI call failed, return code '0x81002746', MAPI function 'ConfigureMsgService' - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ICC E-Mail Connector service and the ICC WebApplications services fail when they try to create a MAPI profile, which is needed to connect to a Microsoft Exchange server. The following error message appears in the systemout.log and trace.log files:

"SEVERE com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: AFUM0009E: An error occurred: MAPI call failed, return code '0x81002746', MAPI function 'ConfigureMsgService'."

The problem occurs when these services are run by the Local System account. 

SYMPTOM
All functions that try to access a mailbox fail. The following error message can be found in the systemout.log and the trace log files: 

SEVERE com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: AFUM0009E: An error occurred: MAPI call failed, return code '0x81002746', MAPI function 'ConfigureMsgService'.


CAUSE
To access a mailbox, both the ICC E-Mail Connector service and the ICC WebApplications service require a MAPI profile. Both services first try to find the required profile among the existing profiles. If the profile cannot be found, they try to create it.

Only a mail-enabled user account can create MAPI profiles. The Local System account is not mail-enabled and therefore cannot create MAPI profiles. In addition, a MAPI profile is associated to the user that creates it. So even if there was a profile with the required name, it cannot be found if the services are run by the "Local System account".


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Whenever mailbox related operations like archiving or restoring fail, check the systemout.log or the trace.log file for the following error message: 


SEVERE com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException: AFUM0009E: An error occurred: MAPI call failed, return code '0x81002746', MAPI function 'ConfigureMsgService'.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the logon properties ("Log-on") of the ICC E-Mail Connector service and the ICC WebApplications service so that these services are run by a domain user account with a mailbox and administration rights for Microsoft Exchange.
