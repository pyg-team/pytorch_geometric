QUESTION
 Syslog probe : Is there a Support's guide? 

ANSWER
The Syslog probe is a relatively straightforward probe to configure, and the online manual covers the probe well. 

The Syslog and Syslogd probes share the same software, and therefore features. 

 

If you need to run two Syslog probes you only need to set Name and RecoveryFile uniquely. 

e.g.
Name : "syslog_02"
Server : "NCOMS"
NetworkTimeout : 15
PollServer : 30
#FifoName : "/var/log/nco-fifo"
LogFile : "/var/log/ncolog"
RulesFile : "$OMNIHOME/probes/linux2x86/syslog.rules"
RecoveryFile : "/opt/nrv81/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/var/syslog_02.reco"
#EOF

Note that the RecoveryFile needs the full path name.

For completeness a Support's guide to the Syslog Probe was created [see the attachments].
