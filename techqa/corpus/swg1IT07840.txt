   *                      DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in         *
   *                      various IBM SSL/TLS implementations     *
   *                      could allow a remote attacker to        *
   *                      downgrade the security of certain       *
   *                      SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS     *
   *                      client implementation could accept      *
   *                      the use of an RSA temporary key in a    *
   *                      non-export RSA key exchange cipher      *
   *                      suite. This could allow a remote        *
   *                      attacker using man-in-the-middle        *
   *                      techniques to facilitate brute-force    *
   *                      decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between   *

   *                      This vulnerability is also known as     *
