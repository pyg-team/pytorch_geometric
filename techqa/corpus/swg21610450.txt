QUESTION
 Can I default a value for a field? 

ANSWER
You can specify a default value for a field by entering that value in the Default
Value field of the attribute to which the field is bound. You specify a default value
in the Details section for the attribute in the Database Configuration application.
For example, if you want the glaccount attribute in the WORKORDER table to
default to a specific account number, then enter that number in the Default Value
field. The GL Account Number you entered will appear as the default value in all
fields that are bound to the glaccount attribute.
Alternatively, you can define a field default value that is local to an application by
using the Default Value control.
To define a field default value using the Default Value control:

1 In the Application Designer, open an application in the Workspace tab.
2 Open the Control Palette.
3 Drag the Default Value control into the section that contains the field for
which you want to assign a default value.
If you do not see the Default Value control in the section, click Select Action >
Toggle Show All Controls.
4 Open Control Properties for the control, and perform the following actions:
a Enter the name of the attribute bound to the field to which you are
assigning the default value.
b Enter the desired default value in the Value field.
c Select Insert for the Default Type
5 Click Save.
