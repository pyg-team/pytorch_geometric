APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We intend to support Remote Search with WAS 9, but the
   installer currently does not work.
   Fortunately, unlike the Portal Server install, you can install
   Remote Search + the latest CF at the same time. Thus we are
   able to fix the problem in CF15.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Prior to CF15, the only workaround is for the customer to
   install Remote Search + CF14 in silent mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 15 (PI83476 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI83476]) for Portal
   8.5.0.0 / 9.0.0.0 available from Fix Central:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To install Portal Remote Search into a WAS v9 profile, point IBM
   Installation Manager to the repositories for (1) Portal Remote
   Search v8.5 GM image and (2) Portal Remote Search Cumulative Fix
   15. The installer will then recognize WAS v9 as a valid target
   for installation. You can either install Portal Remote Search
   into an existing WAS installation or install WAS and Portal
   Remote Search at the same time.
   Installing Portal Remote Search into a WAS v8.5.5 profile
   still works as well.
