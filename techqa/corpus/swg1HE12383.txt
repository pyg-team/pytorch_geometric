APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Atlas 6.0.1.4 the ReleaseIssued flag in the SCOPETARGET
   database table can be prematurely set to 1 meaning that the
   Matter Custodian in question is seen as released from that
   particular Notice. This prevents the user from being seen as a
   release candidate in the Application Interface. As a result, for
   a custodian who is a release candidate and is added to a Release
   Notice, the ReleaseIssued flag will not get set when the Release
   Notice is published.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Database administrator can manually set the ReleaseIssued flag
   to 0 in the SCOPETARGET table which will then set the custodian
   as a release candidate again and available for reciept of a
   Release Notice.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Some of the Matter Custodians are incorrectly set to Released
   status when not released from Notice and NO Release Notice has
   been sent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in Fix Central in 6033 iFix1.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Database administrator can manually set the ReleaseIssued flag
   to 0 in the SCOPETARGET table which will then set the Custodian
   as a release candidate again and available for receipt of a
   Release Notice.DBA should take full backup of the Atlas Database
   before attempting to make the update.
