Title: IBM Custom dialog missing from offering in Self Service Center - United States

Text:
SCCD; ICD; SRM; Offering; Offering Catalog; Catalog; Service Catalog; SSC; Self Service Center; Self Service Access; Ticket Template; duplicate; copies; custom dialog; default dialog TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We noticed that our Offerings with custom dialogs show up correctly in the standard UI, but in the Self Service Center they use the default dialog instead. Also, some appear to have duplicates. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
What you are seeing is not the Offering but the Ticket Templates. When a ticket template has the "Self Service Access" checkbox marked, it will display in the Self Service Center with Offerings. Ticket Templates cannot be configured to use a custom dialog. So this is what you are seeing.

If you created an Offering based on the Ticket Template, then you will want to uncheck that setting, so only the Offering will displayed.
