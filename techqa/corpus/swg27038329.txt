SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER WITH WEBSPHERE SDK JAVA TECHNOLOGY EDITION
All operating systems supported by Dynamic Workload Console are supported by IBM WebSphere™ Application Server, V8.5 Fix Pack 1. For more information about it, see: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023941 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023941]. In the information relating to hardware and memory requirements in this document, the application server is treated as part of Dynamic Workload Console, and its requirements are not listed separately. 

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR JAZZ FOR SERVICE MANAGEMENT EXTENSION FOR IBM WEBSPHERE WITH DASHBOARD APPLICATION SERVICES HUB 
See Jazz for Service Management extension for IBM WebSphere and Dashboard Application Services Hub requirements: http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0%2Finstall%2Fpsc_c_install_prereqs.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v15r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.tip.doc%2Fctip_install_prepare.html].

SUPPORTED BROWSERS
 Dynamic Workload Console 9.1 requires a supported Web browser. Use one of the following:

 * Firefox 17 ESR
 * Internet Explorer 8.0, 9.0
   
   Note: To correctly work with the Graphical View, Dashboard and event management using Internet Explorer 8.0 or 9.0, you must add the hostname of the Dynamic Workload Console to the web sites used in Compatibility View by Internet Explorer. To do it, from Internet Explorer toolbar, click Tools > Compatibility View Settings and add the Dynamic Workload Console hostname to the list.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LAUNCHPAD
The Tivoli Workload Automation Launchpad is supported on all operating systems where Tivoli Workload Scheduler components can be installed. 

If you use the launchpad, it requires a supported Web browser to be launched. Alternatively, you can always install the product by using the installation wizard or the silent installation.

For the launchpad, use one of the following browsers:

 * Firefox 2.0+
 * Internet Explorer 6.0+
 * Mozilla 1.7+
 * SeaMonkey 1.1.4+

These browsers are not all available on all platforms; some of them might only be available in a special version from the manufacturer of your operating system. See Table 2 for details:

On AIX 5.3 and AIX 6.1, at ML7 or later, if Firefox is installed you must run the launchpad from within a bash shell, whether you are running the launchpad on Firefox or Mozilla. However, if SeaMonkey is also installed, the bash shell is not required to use any browser.

Note This information, plus other information about how to launch the launchpad, is provided, platform by platform, in a readme.txt file in the root of the Launchpad directory on each DVD or electronic download image. However, this document contains more up-to-date information than the readme files.  SUPPORTED LDAP SERVERS
For a list of the LDAP servers supported by Tivoli Workload Scheduler, go to the supported software for WebSphere Application Server website [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27012369], click the appropriate MDM/DWC platform link and read the LDAP servers using Federated Repository Configuration section.

SUPPORT FOR INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION 6
 Dynamic Workload Console supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in addition to IPv4. To help you in the transition from an IPv4 environment to a complete IPv6 environment, Tivoli Workload Scheduler provides IP dual-stack support. The product communicates using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols simultaneously with other applications using IPv4 or IPv6.
