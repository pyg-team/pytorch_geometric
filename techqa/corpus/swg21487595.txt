Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0 on a Client or Server operating system and would like to save an SPSS data file as SAS or STATA file via the menu with File - Save As or with SAVE TRANSLATE syntax. However, when I click OK on the Save As dialog or try to run the syntax nothing happens. No file or output information is created, why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to IBM SPSS Development. This issue is resolved with the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FixPack 1. 

As a workaround please download the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FixPack 1 from IBM FixCentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] and install it for your Client or Server operating system. 

Select "Information Management" as product group and SPSS Statistics as product. As installed version select 19.0.0.0 and select the operating system Platform where you have installed the application. 

For example if you have installed on Windows 32 bit operating system the relevant FixPack would be:
