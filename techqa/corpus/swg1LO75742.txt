ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you display two time zones for iNotes calendars, time
   zones which do not use Daylight Savings Time do not display the
   correct time during the months of Standard Time. For example,
   if an iNotes user resides in the Central Time zone, and he adds
   Arizona, MST, which does not observer DST, then during DST
   Central and Arizona time are two hours off.  Yet, during non
   DST times the iNotes calendar continues to display 2 hours
   difference in time on the calendar.  Then Notes client display
   changes appropriately, displaying 1 hour difference during non
   DST time.
