QUESTION
 How do I configure File Connector to use Native HDFS as the File system type 

ANSWER
In the IBM Infosphere Information Server 11.7, a new Filesystem type in the File Connector has been introduced. Please follow the instructions provided below to configure the Connector to use the Native HDFS option. 

Steps to configure the File Connector to use the Native HDFS file system option 

1. Set the File system type to 'Native HDFS' 

2. Configure the Host property in the Connector to use the RPC namenode host address 

3. Set the port number. Use the namenode RPC port number. By default, the port number is 8020 

4. To be able to use the Native HDFS option, the Native HDFS client jars needs to be available on the Engine tier host and the user should configure the CLASSPATH and include the required jars either at the job level or at the project level. 

5. Below is the list of the jars that are required to be able to use the Native HDFS option in the File Connector

commons-cli-1.2.jar:
commons-codec-1.10.jar:
commons-collections-3.2.1.jar:
commons-configuration-1.6.jar:
commons-io-2.4.jar:
commons-logging-1.1.3.jar:
hadoop-auth-2.7.1.jar:
hadoop-common-2.6.0.jar:
hadoop-hdfs-2.6.0.jar:
hadoop-hdfs-2.6.1.jar:
hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.7.1.jar:
hive-exec-1.2.1.jar:
htrace-core-3.0.4.jar::
javax.ws.rs.jar:
jersey-bundle-1.9.1.jar:
log4j-1.2.17.jar:
org.mortbay.jetty.util.jar:
parquet-avro-1.6.0.jar:
slf4j-api-1.7.19.jar:
slf4j-log4j12-1.7.19.jar:
snappy-java-1.1.2.1.jar: 


6. User can download the respective jars from the Apache or pull the jars from the Hadoop distribution being used.
7. Additional jars may be required to use the formats Avro, ORC or Parquet.. Refer to the technote http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21999230 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21999230] for additional information. 

Note : 

1. Please note that the version of the jars could vary from the distribution to distribution. 

2. In certain cases, some of the classes might be available in different jars in some of the hadoop distributions and the user might run into ClassNotFoundException for respective classes. In such cases, the user needs to figure out which jar has the respective class in the given hadoop distribution and include that jar in the CLASSPATH.
