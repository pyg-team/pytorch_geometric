To save time, know the answers to these questions: 

 * What software versions were you running when the problem occurred? 
 * Do you have logs, traces, or messages that are related to the problem? 
 * Can you reproduce the problem? If so, what steps do you take to reproduce it? 
 * Is there a workaround for the problem? If so, be prepared to describe the workaround.
