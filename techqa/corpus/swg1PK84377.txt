LOCAL FIX
 *  In Admin console they can provide it in ext classpath
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The  lib/WMQ/java/lib/dhbcore.jar jar file is missing from the
   project classpath when a project is targeted to an actual WAS
   v6.1 and v7 installation. The fix is to add the jar to the
   classpath list.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The jar lib/WMQ/java/lib/dhbcore.jar has been added to the jar
   list when targetting to an actual WAS v6.1 and v7 runtime.
   
   The jars for a WAS v7 server is under the profiles directory
   instead The jar lib/WMQ/java/lib/dhbcore.jar has been added to
   the jar list when targetting to an actual WAS v6.1 and v7
   runtime (not the stubs) as requested.
   
   The jars for a WAS v7 server is under the profiles directory
   instead so corresponding adjust has been made to add the jars
   programatically in
   com.ibm.ws.ast.st.core.internal.runtime.WASRuntimeClasspathProvi
   der70.addMqJarFile(IPath, List).so corresponding adjust has been
   made to add the jars programatically in
   com.ibm.ws.ast.st.core.internal.runtime.WASRuntimeClasspathProvi
   der70.addMqJarFile(IPath, List).
