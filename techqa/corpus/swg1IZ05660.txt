APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Object Server reaches its soft limit (in temp_store)
   and core dumps without logging any messages
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem seen was caused by the use of large selects within
   triggers. To reduce the memory used, the select list should be
   specific to the data being used within the trigger.
   e.g.
   select * -> Select Identifier, Summary
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ObjectServer users who have automations with *
   *                 an evaluate clause, where the resultset      *
   *                 returned by the query will create a          *
   *                 temporary table that exceeds the size of the *
   *                 temp_store (100M).                           *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The problem is due to large result set  *
   *                      returned by the triggers evaluate       *
   *                      clause. If the evaluate clause query    *
   *                      selects a large amount of data, then    *
   *                      temp_store may exceed the memory limit, *
   *                      causing ObjectServer to stop.  The      *
   *                      problem may be caused by the select     *
   *                      statement having a large number of      *
   *                      columns being selected or the number of *
   *                      rows being returned being large or a    *
   *                      combination of both.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The ObjectServers temp_store reaches its soft limit and exits.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the temp_store limit is exceeded the ObjectServer will now
   log an error message and continue to run.
