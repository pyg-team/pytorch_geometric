Title: IBM Configuring an SSL connection between the eDiscovery Analyzer server and the IBM FileNet® P8 server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You must configure the SSL connection before registering the IBM FileNet® P8 content management server in the eDiscovery Analyzer archive registration page. 

SYMPTOM
If you try to register a FileNet P8 server that uses an HTTPS web address before configuring the SSL connection, you will receive an error stating that a valid certificate required to communicate with the content management server by using HTTPS cannot be found.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You must configure SSL support before you can register the FileNet® P8 content management server in eDiscovery Analyzer using an HTTPS URL.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When eDiscovery Analyzer connects to the FileNet P8 server using SSL and a valid certificate is not found, eDiscovery Analyzer fails to connect the FileNet P8 server. 

To prevent this from occurring, you must first use the keytool command to import the certificate into the JRE truststore that is bundled with eDiscovery Analyzer.

To configure the SSL connection:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * View Certificate. 
 * 
 * Copy to File...
 * 
 * . 
 * 
 * DER encoded binary X.509
 * 


To install the certificate into eDiscovery Analyzer:  * 
 * 
 * 2. Log into the eDiscovery Analyzer machine, then copy the JRE truststore file to a temporary directory: 
 *   * 
    * > copy EDA_INSTALL_DIR\_jvm22\jre\lib\security\cacerts \tmp\workdir\
