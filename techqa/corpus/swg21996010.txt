Title: IBM The event log table size growing too fast - United States

Process Engine event log TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to minimize the event log size in Process Engine? Some customers are simply using Tracker and needed to reduce the event log size. They are asking if they can turn off some "Trace instruction" logging option(s) to reduce the event log size without sacrifying too much for Tracker info. 

CAUSE
The IBM Knowledge Center documents Event categories required by Process Tracker and Case Analyzer are the documented here:
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.pe.user.doc/bpfes004.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.pe.user.doc/bpfes004.htm]

Required by Process Tracker

Trace instruction (event 100,110,120)
Creation (event 130,140)
Termination (event 150,160,165)
Exception (event 170,172,174)
Administration message (event 180,190,200)
Begin operation (event 350,352)
End operation (event 360,365,370,380,382,384,386,390,400,405,407)
User-defined message 1 (event 410,420,430,440)
Empty step / System step (event 500,510)


Required by Case Analyzer

Creation (event 130,140)
Termination (event 150,160,165)
Administration message (event 180,190,200)
Begin operation (event 350,352)
End operation (event 360,365,370,380,382,384,386,390,400,405,407)
Empty step / System step (event 500,510)

Pay attention to the fact that the Process Tracker requires more event log categories to be turned on.

*Trace instruction (event 100,110,120)
*Exception (event 170,172,174)
*User-defined message 1 (event 410,420,430,440)


ANSWER
If a site is using Case Analyzer, they must comply with the requirements event log requirements listed above for Case Analyzer, otherwise Case Analyzer will not work. 


For Tracker, a site can turn off the "Trace instruction" (event 100,110,120) event log messages. Without that information, Tracker will be unable to properly put the check mark notations next to some steps (showing that the step was already executed).

Similarly, a site may also turn off the Exception and User-defined event log messages. However there are relatively few Exception and User-defined event log records compared to the number of "Trace instruction" event log records, so that savings would be minimal.

This technote serves as basic guidelines, users should engage engineering for further assistance.
