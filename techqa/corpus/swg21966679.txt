QUESTION
 How do you ensure that your IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation or IBM Worklight apps will be supported on Android 6.0? 

CAUSE
Android 6.0 Marshmallow introduces a number of changes that require you to take additional actions so that your MobileFirst apps can support Android 6.0.

ANSWER
For your apps to support Android 6.0 Marshmallow, download and install the latest interim fix from IBM Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] for your product. 

After you install the fix, update your projects and your Worklight Server or MobileFirst Server according to the instructions in the following PDF file:

After you complete these tasks, your apps from IBM Worklight V6.0 and later, IBM Worklight Foundation V6.2.0, and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation V6.3 and later will continue to work on Android 6.0 as they did on previous versions of Android.
