QUESTION
 Is there a basic overview of steps involved for configuring Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) and Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC) to use LDAP for user authentication? 

CAUSE
LDAP configuration is documented in the TWS v8.6 Administration Guide, but the complexity of setting it up using the TWA/wastools scripts can be confusing.

ANSWER
The TWS development team has produced a two-minute video covering the basic steps involved in LDAP configuration through the TDWC and its WebSphere Administration Console. This video presents a walk-through of the different WebSphere Administration Console screens and panels necessary for authenticating users with Microsoft Active Directory LDAP. The same general steps are applicable for other supported LDAP servers as well. While the video was originally created for TWS 8.6, the same principles will still apply to TWS 9.x versions as well. 

It can be helpful to review this video with your LDAP administrator to make sure all the appropriate values for LDAP fields are collected prior to attempting the setup using the TDWC. 

Additionally, it is recommended to run (as the root user) the TWA/wastools/backupConfig.sh script prior to performing the steps from the video to ensure the embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) security settings can be restored if there are any issues. Note that changes to WAS security settings won't take effect until WAS is restarted.
