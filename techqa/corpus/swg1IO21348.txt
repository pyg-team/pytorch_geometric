APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Content Navigator, when a user exports the properties of a
   directory in a .CSV file, the .CSV file is missing the UTF-8
   marker at the beginning of the file. This confuses certain
   viewers such as MS Excel into mistaking the file as ANSI.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Resaving the document in NotePad restores the header and allows
   the file to be viewed normally.
