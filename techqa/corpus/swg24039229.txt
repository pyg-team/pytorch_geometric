1.0 General description
-----------------------

This interim fix resolves the APARs and defects listed in the
"Problems Fixed" section below. 


2.0 Problems fixed
------------------

The following problems are addressed by this fix.

2.1 APARs
---------------
None.

2.2 Defects
-----------
Defect: 210286
Abstract: Update model for VM PARTITION
Additional information: For "Free_Space" and "Used_Space" attributes, the
default aggregation is defined not as AVG but as SUM. It usually
works as expected but if there were two entries which have same
"Timestamp", the "VM_PARTITION" attribute group's data is shown
with doubled values.
Defect: 212729
Abstract: Drill through feature is not working in VE 7.2 FP2 reports
Additional information: A few VMware VI reports are showing the following
message, when we try drill through by clicking on report chart:
RSV-CM-0005 Content Manager did not return an object for the
requested search path.
Defect: 212776
Abstract: Datacenter parameter/prompt is missing in a few VM reports
Additional information: The Datacenter parameter/prompt is missing in the
following VMware VI reports: VM Heat Chart, Bottom N VMs by
Resource Pool and Top N VMs By Resource Pool.
Defect: 212851
Abstract: Place Date range parameter after the Resource prompts
Additional information: A few VMware VI reports contain time selection over
resource selection. Therefore to make uniformity across the reports,
place Date range parameter after the resource prompts (like Data
Center and Cluster).
Defect: 212924
Abstract: Unsorted resources e.g.Cluster on parameter selection page
Additional information: Most of the VMware VI reports sometimes display 
unsorted resources (viz. Data Center, Cluster, Host Servers, VMs
etc.) on parameter selection (aka prompt) page.
Defect: 212925
Abstract: Incorrect caption/label for Host Server resource parameter
Additional information: Incorrect caption/label for the resource parameter
e.g. In Network usage by VMs report, the "Host Server(s)" drop
down list title needs to be corrected as "Host Server" as user
can select only one host in this report.

2.3 Enhancements
------------------
Feature: 210245
Abstract: Enhance model to add SAMPLES.
Additional information: Add SAMPLES query item/column for each summarized
attribute group view (viz. Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly)
in existing VMware VI Agent reports data model.
Feature: 213018
Abstract: RFE 60331: Require a new report for Cluster Utilization Details
Additional information: Require a new cluster level report like the Host 
Server Utilization Details report, which is useful and included the
actual data points from the graph at the bottom of the report.
Defect: 213084
Abstract: Provide a choice to select date range or start & end week
Additional information: Provide a parameter choice (aka date filter option)
to either select date range or start and end week of the year in
the following VMware VI reports: Cluster Weekly Comparison and
Host Servers Weekly Comparison.
