ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  STEPS TO REPLICATE in MBS 7.1.1.7:
   
   
   go to the chart of accounts app, go to actions menu, validation
   options
   UNTICK Validate GL Component Combinations?
   TICK Require Valid GL Account for All Transactions, click OK
   Go to actions menu, GL components maintenance
   click the ELEMENT (i.e. the 4th component)
   click New Row button, gl component value = INVENTORY
   click New Row button, gl component value = INVCOST
   Go to actions menu, update database, Overwrite All Accounts,
   click OK
   
   
   go to app designer, bring up inventor application,
   add the following GL  fields to the main inventory tab:
   1st field: attribute = Inventory.ControlAcc
   2nd field: attribute = Inventory.GLACCOUNT
   3rd field: attribute = InvCost.ControlAcc
   
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup of these 3 fields
   
   Go to item master app
   Create an Item called NEW
   go to actions menu, add item to storeroom
   storeroom = CENTRAL, click OK
   standard cost = 0
   current balance = 1
   issue unit and order unit are both EACH
   click OK
   change the status to ACTIVE
   tick Roll New Status to Organizations and Inventory in the
   status change dialog box
   
   
   Go to the inventory app, bring up Item NEW
   change the GL Accounts to the following:
   
   INVENTORY.ControlAcc = 6220-300-300-inventory
   INVENTORY.GLACCOUNT = 6210-300-300-inventory
   
   INVCOST.ControlAcc = 6000-000-000-invcost
   INVCOST.GLACCOUNT = 6000-100-000-invcost
   
   save
   go to actions, issue current item
   
   GL debit account is 6000-100-000-invcost
   GL credit acct shows 6000-000-000-invcost
   
   When the Storeroom is changed after a WORK Order or Location,
   etc. has been entered, the Credit GL is still updated correctly
   but the Debit GL is not updated.  It should be repeating the
   process that merges the InvCost.GLAccount with the GL Account
   from the WO or Location,etc.
   
   
   When a WO, Location, etc. is entered after the Condition Code is
   changed to
   a Condition other than the default 100% value, the merge process
   appears to
   be using the GLAccount from the InvCost for the default 100%
   Condition
   instead of from the InvCost for the Condition actually on the
   dialog.
   
   note: client reported issue 10-19475 originally
