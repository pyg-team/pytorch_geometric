IMPORTANT NOTE for 2003.06.00 modifications on Windows

If you have applied one of the non-Service Release patches to an existing ClearCase service release and have subsequently done a Modify install to change your features as noted above, you must re-apply that patch afterwards to ensure that any fixes to that added feature are properly applied.

This step of re-applying the patch is necessary because the features are being installed from the installation media, and as such are not patched yet. Re-applying the patch will bring all the files on the system up to the same version.

Below is one scenario where this issue can be observed:


 * ClearCase 2003.06.16 (Service Release 6) was installed on a Windows host 
 * Patch clearcase_p2003.06.16.NT-2007B was subsequently installed on that host. 
 * A feature was mistakenly left out and needs to be added 
 * A modify install (a feature of the MSI install) of ClearCase 2003.06.16 is then performed over the existing installation in order to add the (previously not installed) missing feature. 
 * The newly added feature is installed at the 2003.06.16 level, however, it will not be up to date with any fixes that may be contained in the 2007B patch.
   

Note: The above scenario holds true for any of the following ClearCase 2003.06.16 patches: 
clearcase_p2003.06.16.NT-2007A 
clearcase_p2003.06.16.NT-2007B 
clearcase_p2003.06.16.NT-2007C 
clearcase_p2003.06.16.NT-2006E
