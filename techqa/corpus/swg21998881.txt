Title: IBM Cannot edit annotations after saving and reopening the document in the Daeja Virtual viewer within IBM Content Navigator using an IBM CM8 repository. - United States

Text:
CM8; Annotation toolbar. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After opening and viewing a document, then adding an annotation successfully.

I then closed the document that was in the viewer.

When I reopen the same document I can see the annotation I created but the annotation toolbar is not coming up. 

SYMPTOM
No annotation toolbar after reopening a document where you added an annotation.


CAUSE
With the release of IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 6a the 'cmannotationengine,properties' in the deployed Content Navigator application .../WEB-INF/classess had the property 'ANNOTATION_ENGINE2_allowEdit=false

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 6a

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After reopening a document in the Daeja virtual viewer which has an annotation, the annotation toolbar is not accessible.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Go to navigator.war/WEB-INF/classes, and edit cmbannotationengine.properties. 


Change: 

ANNOTATION_ENGINE2_allowEdit=false 


To: 

ANNOTATION_ENGINE2_allowEdit=true 



Save this change. If you do this in the deployed copy, restart the app server. If you do it in EClient/configure/explodedformat/, rebuild the EAR and redeploy.

Alternatively update IBM Content Navigator to ICN 2.0.3 fixpack 7 or higher.
