Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM MQ Appliance - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM MQ Appliance. IBM MQ Appliance has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2108 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2108]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow when deserializing untrusted ASN.1 structures and later reserializes them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and trigger an out-of-bounds write and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2105 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-2106 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2106]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112856 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112856] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2109 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2109]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error. By reading specially crafted ASN.1 data from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available resources and exhaust memory.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857] for the current score
