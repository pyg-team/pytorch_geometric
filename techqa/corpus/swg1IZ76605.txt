APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: N/A
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   Attach API implementation differs in some aspects from what is
   described in the IBM userguide.
   1. Sticky bit is not set on common directory
   (/tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach)
   2. Non-root user is observed to own the common directory.
   3. Execute bit set on the directories associated with the
   processes within the common directory reveals the filenames in
   that directory.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM userguide for Attach API has incomplete/insufficient
   documentation that can arise above said queries from the users
   of AttachAPI.
   
   1. This is fixed in Java 6 SR8 and Java 5 SR12.
   2. This is operating as intended. Per the Attach API
   documentation
   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/index.jsp
   ?topic=/com.ibm.java.doc.user.aix64.60/user/attachapi.html),
   "It is recommended that you change the ownership of the common
   directory to ROOT or another privileged user ID".
   3. The execute bit allows a user to traverse a directory, but
   does not allow it to list/read contents of files with in that
   directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Attach API UserGuide documentation has been corrected to have
   the complete information that matches with the current
   implementation of Attach API.
