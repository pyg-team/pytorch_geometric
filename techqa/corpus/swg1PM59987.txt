APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users Affected
   --------------
   Users who want to reconfigure or unconfigure ITCAM for WebSphere
   Data Collector deployed on WebSphere Application Server 5.1 on
   Windows
   
   Problem Description
   -------------------
   Unconfiguration and reconfiguration fails, because ":" char
   passed to unconfiguration script is converted to "_COLON_", for
   example property which identifies server configuration:
   cells/nc049030/nodes/nc049030/servers/Portali4:server.xml#Server
   _1 is changed to:
   cells/nc049030/nodes/nc049030/servers/Portali4_COLON_server.xml
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Perform manual unconfiguration
   ( described here:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com]
   .ibm.itcamwas.doc_6.1/itcam_61_4_was_dc_dist_install_guide117.ht
   m?path=16_6_5_6_1#manualunconfig )
   and then configure server again.
   
   If only Managing Server connection needs to be changed then
   follow manual steps described here:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/topic/com]

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ***************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users who want to reconfigure or unconfigure
   * ITCAM for WebSphere 6.1 FP5, Interim Fix 11 Data Collector
   * (6.1.0.5-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_MP-IF0011) and newer releases which
   * contain PM11274 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM11274], deployed on WebSphere Application
   * Server 5.1.
   *
   ***************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * Data Collector's unconfiguration and reconfiguration fails,
   * because ":" char passed to unconfiguration script is
   * converted to "_COLON_", for example property which identifies
   * server configuration:
   * cells/nc049030/nodes/nc049030/servers/Portali4:server.xml#
   * Server_1 is changed to:
   * cells/nc049030/nodes/nc049030/servers/Portali4_COLON_server
   * .xml
   * With such identifier configuration script is unable to find
   * server instance.
   *
   ***************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Use ITCAM for WebSphere 6.1 FP6, Interim
   * Fix 1, Data Collector (6.1.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_MP-IF0001) or
   * newer release which contains this fix to resolve this issue.
