APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Room owner click on Accept or decline to process the
   reservation request
   either directly from resource reservation database ->waiting for
   approval view
   or from their notes mail file by clicking the document
   link, request do not get process. For ex: When resource owner
   clicks on Accept
   button, they get message "You are about to accept this
   reservation. Do you want
   to continue?" with Yes and NO buttons. Clicking
   YES, nothing happens. The reservation request stays open and the
   reservation
   request do not get  processed
   
   
    Steps taken to try to reproduce however the issue was
   unreproducible in
   house.
   
   1. Place customer's RRDB on test 801 server and made appropriate
   changes (TN
   7003364).
   
   2. Added  Test UserOne to rooms "Decision Center 102b",
   "Daub/Forshaw  Seminar
   402b"  and  "Archibald McTavish Bruce QSB Lounge" rooms as owner
   (customer's
   owners were left)
   
   3. Copied and paste above three rooms mail-in docs from
   customer's NAB
   to test NAB and made appropriate changes (TN 7003364).
   
   4. Signed in as a test user not listed in the owner fields and
   created
   reservations for these three rooms from notes client as well as
   directly in to
   RRDB.
   
   5. Test UserOne as a owner can process all  reservations without
   any
   problem
   
   
   
   - I noticed my test owner name in Owner(s) field of the
   pre-existing customer's
   reservation request. So my test owner attempt to accept but  the
   reservation
   request stayed open and did not process. I did not see any
   error/message on
   console. So I am able to reproduce this issue with customer's
   pre-existing
   reservation requests
   
   - Noticed $CSTRack field is missing on cust's pre-existing
   reservation request.
   Not sure why this field do not get created when non-owner user
   creates the
   reservation directly in to RRDB using notes client 8.0.1
   
   What I need:
   Can you please provide some debugging on the client or the
   server that may help
   to find out the cause of the corrupted reservation documents as
   it seems the
   document become corrupted during the process of creation.
   Technote 1218939 has
   some debugs  but is not clear on what they will provide. The
   debug parameter
   DEBUG_CS_LEVEL only works in a non-prod environment.
