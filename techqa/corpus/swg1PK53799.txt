APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We run WAS for z/OS 6.1 and ITCAM 6.1 FP02. We are noticing that
   the  verbose GC output routed to the ITCAM DC/logs is getting
   dirty and the xml parser we run to get GC report is not able to
   parse the GC output.
   Our very  important app servers have multiple servants and we
   are losing the GC  log due to this issue.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of ITCAM V6.1 for WebSphere.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This APAR adds multiple servant support *
   *                      for Garbage Collection log analysis.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Java Garbage Collection analysis using HFS log files
   cannot distinguish GC events from individual servants.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Java Garbage collection can now be monitored using a GC log
   directed to DDNAME SYSOUT.
