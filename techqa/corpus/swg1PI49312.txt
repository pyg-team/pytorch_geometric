ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Release 23 plus FixPack 2 on a
   Macintosh OSX computer. The software is installed as
   network version with concurrent user license. However, when you
   open the Applications folder on finder and navigate to the
   installation directory of release 23 FP2 on Mac you see no
   shortcut for the Commuter Utility option.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS development. As a workaround you
   can right click on the SPSSStatistics.app and select
   'Show package Content'. After that locate the bin folder. On bin
   folder you should see the Commuter Utility and can create the
   shortcut manually or open the utility from there.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If you encounter the issue described above and it is not
   possible for you to create the shortcut manually, please
   download the public Interim Fix 23.0-IM-S23STAT-MAC-FP002-IF003
   which address the issue.
   Please log in to IBM FixCentral at
   www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ with your IBM web ID and
   password.
   Select product group SPSS. From the dropdown select SPSS
   Statistics.
   As Installed Version select 23.0.0.2 and as Platform: Mac OSX,
   click continue.
   Select 'Browse for Fixes' and click continue.
   Download Interim fix: 23.0-IM-S23STAT-MAC-FP002-IF003
   Please note: as a prerequisite for this fix you must have
   installed 23 FixPack 2 for Macintosh which is also available for
   download on FixCentral
   (Fixes for installed release version SPSS statistics 23.0.0.0
   for Macintosh).

   IBM SPSS Statistics Client 23.0 Mac Fix Pack 2
   
   fix pack: 23.0-IM-S23STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002 (silent

   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
