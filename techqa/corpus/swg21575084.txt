Text:
migration add-wcm-la-attributes CWWIM4521E ORA-01017 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
During migration from WebSphere Portal 6.0 to 7.0 or from WebSphere Portal 5.1 to 6.1, the add-wcm-la-attributes task fails with: 

WIMSystemException: CWWIM4521E The 'ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied



CAUSE
An incorrect password that was used initially while running the 'portal-port-upgrade' task was still stored and reused via the J2C authentication data "vmmladbDSJAASAuth".



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The ConfigTrace.log reports the following error:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove the vmmladbDSJAASAuth data via the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console under Security > JAAS Configuration > J2C authentication data and re-run the add-wcm-la-attributes task with correct user id and password.
