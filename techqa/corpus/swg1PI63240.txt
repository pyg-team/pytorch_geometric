APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When browsing the OAC with Internet Explorer 8 and 11, some text
   fields in the left-hand Search pane stay at their position, even
   if the form is scrolled up/down or left/right. As soon as the
   cursor leaves the scroll bar, the text entries re-adjust into
   their field boundaries.
   The problem could not be recreated with other browsers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Move the cursor away from the scroll bar or decrase the browser
   font to avoid a scrollable pane.

   When the browser window is minimised, data entered in the input
   fields on the search panels will not scroll when the

   A browser compatibility flag used in the OAC was updated to IE8.
