LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customer saw this error message "Notes Traveler: SEVERE *system
   NTS_ADMN_533" and the server failed to startup.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue actually had to do with locating the names.nsf file on
   the system.  As per instructed, the lookup code was changed to
   use Domino APIs to locate the names.nsf instead of hard coded
   strings.  This apparently does not work in all evironments, so
   the code was again updated to use the API calls, then if not
   found used the hard coded strings as a backup.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  An interim fix is available on request.  A formal fix will be
   included in 8513 and all future releases.
