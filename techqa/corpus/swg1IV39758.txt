APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reduce number of async event collections.
   Perform HTTP Deletes when user is no longer viewing a page.
   Avoid unnecessary ViewModel instance creation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Improve dashboard performance in concurrent user scenarios. If
   every events table makes its own connection to the ITM Data
   Provider instead of sharing data being returned from a single
   source it means that there are too many connections open and the
    ITM Data Provider is working too hard.
   Sharing the data, even if it means having to filter it when it
   is shown, reduces the number of open connections.  Since each
   open connection required servicing by the ITM data provider,
   setting up tables to share data greatly reduced the load on the
   ITM.
   In addition the Server Dashboards were sending a CURI DELETE
   operation for each dataset the Dashboard used when the user
   drills down to a page to cleanup the cache in the data provider
   before updating the store to request for new dataset. During
   performance testing, there are DELETE requests made to datasets
   that had not yet issued a GET request on the first time the user
   drills down to a page.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Redesign the situation events table to share data. Also, when
   user drills down to a page the first time, do not issue a DELETE
    operation before a GET request. The data store can now
   determine if a request has been made before deciding if a DELETE
    is necessary. This will speed up the loading time when drilling
    down to a page for the first time.
