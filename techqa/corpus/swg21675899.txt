QUESTION
 Are there any TCR reports for ITCAM for AD v7.1 and what kind of reporting is available? 

ANSWER

This package of Tivoli Common Reports (TCR) is based on data collected by the ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications, which is packaged with ITCAM for Application Diagnostics and ITCAM for Applications. 

The package depends on IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM), which includes Tivoli Common Reporting and the Tivoli Data Warehouse. 

The reports are installed on Tivoli Common Reporting. The user interface for Tivoli Common Reporting is the Tivoli Integrated Portal; the data source is Tivoli Data Warehouse. Historical data collection must be enabled for the ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications, so that historical data is stored in Tivoli Data Warehouse. 

The following predefined reports are available in this package: 

 * Application Request Performance 
 * DB Connection Pools 
 * EJB Performance 
 * GC Usage of Application Server 
 * JVM Usage of Application Server 
 * Request Performance for an Application 
 * Servlet-JSP Performance for an Application 
 * Threadpools 
 * Web Application Performance 
 * Application Request Performance for Clusters 
 * JVM and GC Usage for Clusters


The following software prerequisites are required for these reports:  * Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 fix pack 3 or higher 
 * Tivoli Common Reporting 2.1 or higher 
 * ITCAM Agent for WebSphere Applications 7.1 Fix Pack 2, interim fix 3, or higher
