Title: IBM Display more than 3 decimal places for numbers in decision table - United States

Text:
number format TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 By Default, decision table rounds to 3 decimal places when displaying numbers. Is it possible to prevent the rounding of the decimal places and display as many decimal places as entered? 

CAUSE
It is only the cell display that shows 3 decimal places by default. The actual cell value contains all of the digits and is not rounded. This can be verified by selecting the cell and observe its value in the edit bar above the decision table. 

ANSWER
There is no configuration to generally prevent rounding of the display. 
Instead, you can apply a Number formatter to the column with the desired number of decimal place-holders large enough to cover all of your use cases. 


This can be done by right-clicking on the column header in concern and select "Format". In the Format Statement field, instead of selecting one of the pre-configured formats, you can type a format, such as {0,number,#0.########} for instance, which will display 8 decimal places. 

This has to be done in Rule Studio/Rule Designer, on a column by column basis and you will need to define a specific number of the decimal place-holders. 

It is not currently possible to directly modify decision table number display format in Rule Team Server(RTS)/Decision Center. To apply the custom format to RTS decision table editor, follow the instruction above and publish the change from Rule Studio/Rule Designer to RTS/Decision Center.
