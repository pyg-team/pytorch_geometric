ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Business Viewpoint - Relational Adapter - Unable to Rerun
   Nominations (Data Imports).?
                                        ?We have a Dimension built
   with a Static Hierarchy. We have used the BV Client Relational
   Adapter to "Nominate Data" from an Oracle connection in order to
   add entries to our Hierarchy.               ?
            ?In building the "Nominate Data" task, we add an SQL
   Query to filter down the data, test this Query's syntax, and
   select to "Add to an existing dimension" AND to "Update the data
   at a later time" in order to specify a Subscription Name". We
   then followed the wizard to map the data being imported to the
   Hierarchy structure.?
                                 ?Once the "Nominate Data"
   Subscription was built, we selected it and performed an "Update
   Data" by selecting to "Update Business Viewpoint Studio". After
   running for a while, the additional entries were successfully
   added to the hierarchy.?
                                    ?When we run the saved
   subscription to"Nominate Data" a second time, it has no effect
   on the Hierarchy, even when new entries are added to the source.
   When the "Nominate data" ?subscription is rebuilt, it runs
   successfully but we need to go through the remapping every time
   - this is unacceptable as we are attempting to automate the
   "Nominate Data" for NEW entries and there is huge scope for
   human error in remapping the table columns to the
   hierarchy.??Note: If no SQL query is NOT added then the
   hierarchy can be successfully updated as seen in BV Studio.
   However, this is not acceptable as we would then need to create
   bespoke tables for each Cost Centre - very inefficient.??In
   summary: With a side-by-side test, where 2 identical
   Subscriptions are created with one difference only: Subscription
   1 has an SQL Query associated (tested on the database and it
   does select the correct data). Subscription 2 has no SQL Query.
   Subscription 1 fails to update, Subscription 2 works.
