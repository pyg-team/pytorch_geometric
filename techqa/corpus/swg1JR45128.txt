   Target event drop down menus are empty (no values can be

   ****************************************************************
   Code responsible for retrieving and displaying the current Page
   Navigator widget settings when the widget is opened in edit
   mode assumes that numeric identifier attributes for the current
   space and page settings are valid for the imported business
   space in the current context, instead of using the
   corresponding name attributes which should be valid even for
   imported spaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to use the name attributes for space and
   page if the numeric identifier attributes are not valid
   (numeric identifier is not available in the list of spaces or
   list of pages within the selected space, respectively).
