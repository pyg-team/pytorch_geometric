APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A WebSphere MQ JMS client application which uses a client
   channel definition table (CCDT) may connect using an asterisk as
    the first character of the queue manager name, for example
   "*MY.QMGR".  However, any attempt to open a dynamic queue on the
    connection will fail with an exception like:
   
   ABC.JMSWMQ2008: Failed to open MQ queue
   'SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE'.:com.ibm.mq.MQException:
   JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2'
   ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2086' ('MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_Q_MGR')
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue can be avoided by not using a CCDT or by not
   specifying an asterisk in the Queue Manager name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS
   who are
   attempting to create a temporary
   dynamic queue on a connection generated from a CCDT, where the
   entry in the CCDT was selected as part of a queue manager group
   by using a '*' character in the queue manager name
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When the temporary queue was created, a model queue was opened
   on the queue manager, passing some options. One of these was the
   queue manager name. However, the queue manager name that was
   being passed was the queue manager group name set on the
   connection factory containing the '*' character
   rather than the actual name of the queue manager connected to.
   This is not a known queue manager name, hence the
   MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_Q_MGR
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS have been modified such that
   when the model queue is opened, the queue manager name passed to
   the queue manager in
   the open options structure is the resolved name of the queue
   manager, which is a
   known queue manager name.
