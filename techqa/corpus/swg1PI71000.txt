APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempted to filter by amount greater than a certain value
   it does not return any items where the transaction is out of
   balance. When using amount less than it works properly. Also
   when doing an amount range no items are returned at all. In all
   cases it does return the control records (File, Cash Letter ,
   Bundle, etc) and adds them into the TOTALS on the screen. I can
   understand showing those records not sure why they are added
   into the count.
   
   Also if you filer by OUT OF BALANCE it does not return
   any items just the Bundle Header that shows its out of balance.
   When I try to filter by TRANACTION TYPE and choose CONTROL
   Records returns FILE and CASH LETTER records then I get a
   severe database error.
