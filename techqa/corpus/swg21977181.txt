Known issues 

Issue: Removing a view from a shared bookmark can result in the view appearing to persist in the bookmark in the GUI.
Workaround: Log out and log back in again.

Issue: When you select a network view in the Network Health Dashboard, by default a second tab opens, called "Network View". This tab contains a dashboard comprised of the Network View widget, the Event Viewer, and the Structure Browser. The Network View widget displays the selected network view. 

However, if you create a custom page that includes the Dashboard Network Views widget and the Network View widget, a new page containing a Network View widget still appears when you click on a network view, but it does not display the selected network view. Only the Network View widget on the same page updates.

Workaround: Do not include both a Network View widget and a Dashboard Network View widget on the same custom page.

Alternatively, if you want to prevent a new page from appearing when a network view is clicked from any Dashboard Network Views widget, change the default behavior by completing the following steps:
1. Edit the following configuration file: $NMGUI_HOME/profile/etc/tnm/topoviz.properties.
2. Find the following lines:
# Defines whether the dashboard network view tree fires a launch event when the user clicks a view in the tree
topoviz.networkview.dashboardTree.launchpage.enabled=true
3. Set the property topoviz.networkview.dashboardTree.launchpage.enabled to false.
4. Save the file.
5. Restart the Dashboard Application Services Hub.
