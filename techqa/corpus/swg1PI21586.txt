APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When ODM startup encounters an error in the recovery
   routine, the abend could enter in a loop, which throws the error
   repeatedly and fills up the JES Spool

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Operational           *
   *                 Decision Management for z/OS Version 8.5.1   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When an abend occurs during ODM         *
   *                      startup, it enters a recovery routine   *
   *                      which attempts to detach attached       *
   *                      TCBs. But because the TCBs have not     *
   *                      yet been attached, the pointers are     *
   *                      zero which causes a further abend in    *
   *                      the recovery routine and then an        *
   *                      infinite loop which fills the JES       *
   *                      spool.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An abend during zRES startup can result in an infinite abend
   loop which fills up the JES spool.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been modified to avoid attempting to detach
   TCBs which have not yet been attached. There is therefore
   no longer an infinite loop and abend processing completes
   normally.
