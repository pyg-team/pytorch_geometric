non-GIM STAP to GIM based; GIM; STAP PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Follow the steps to install the GIM client on DB server with STAP already installed and without rebooting server 

CONTENT
1. You have STAP installed on DB server without GIM.


Example- STAP v9-r85844 is installed without GIM 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=1]
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=2]

2. Download and execute BUNDLE-GIM shell installer on the database server. GIM installation does not require server reboot.

Example- Installing GIM v9-r85844 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=3]

You will notice GIM and STAP running under different directory.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=4]

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=5]

3. Download BUNDLE-STAP from Fixcentral. Upload to the Guardium appliance and then schedule installation.

(a) If this BUNDLE matches the revision number that was previously installed on the server, reboot will not be required

Example: After installing STAP v9-r85844 using GIM v9-r85844, you will notice STAP running under GIM directory and this STAP is fully managed by GIM

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=6]

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=7]

(b) If revision is not exactly matched, system will prompt for a reboot and after reboot the newer S-TAP/KTAP is installed and managed by GIM.

Example: Installing STAP with different revision V9-r89422 using GIM

Installation status appears as “IP-PR” (In Process-Pending Reboot) status. In this case, DB server reboot is required. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=8]

On DB server, you will notice STAP with new revision is installed under GIM install directory <usr/local/Guardium/modules> but KTAP module is still older revision. Reboot is required at this stage. 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=9]


After server reboot, you will notice KTAP with new revision is loaded and STAP is running and managed by GIM 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27049399&aid=10]


Note: In case you face any issue, Open a PMR with IBM Guardium support and send STAP diags from DB server.
