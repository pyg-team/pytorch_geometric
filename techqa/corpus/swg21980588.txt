QUESTION
 Does IBM TRIRIGA support Seamless Sign On (SSO-enabled without challenging Internet Browser for credential information)? 

CAUSE
Need to configure IBM TRIRIGA solution to use Single Sign-On (SSO) for not challenging Internet Browser for credentials (Seamless Sign-on)

ANSWER
For the purpose of this document SSO refers to Single Sign On meaning a single set of credentials stored in a directory server. References to SSO in this document DO NOT refer to Seamless Sign On where a user is not challenged for their credentials once they have authenticated to the network. 

For IBM TRIRIGA support, Single Sign-On(SSO) refers to the ability to have a single set of credentials that use a directory server for multiple applications. TRIRIGA does NOT define SSO the same as Seamless Sign-On, which may not challenge a user for credentials during the access process.

The most of SSO configuration is related to other components out of IBM TRIRIGA code management and control: Web Server & Application Server and Security Authentication layer or product you use. The same applies to Seamless Sign-On. For help on configuring those layers, you will need to contact their respective support & assistance teams (Typically 3rd party support). 

If you want to implement Seamless Sign-On, see that the most of configuration required on Web Server & Application Server and Security Authentication product will be the same if making it ready for SSO (SSO-enabled). Note: TRIRIGA may not be compatible with use seamless sign on even if it is configured. Functionality using applets (example CAD Integrator) may continue to challenge for credentials. Seamless sign on and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) are technologies unrelated to the TRIRIGA product and are configured at a layer prior to accessing TRIRIGA. 

So first, make sure system is ready and functional for SSO (SSO enabled), then confirm things work fine with simple SSO-enabled implementation, and finally go for the specific required configuration on Web Server & Application Server and the Security Authentication layer/product for having Seamless Sign-On implementation.

But see, this runs out of IBM TRIRIGA Support scope, since this happens out of IBM TRIRIGA code management and control, so you may need to get assistance from your Application Server, Web Server or Security Authentication administrators & support (typically 3rd party). 

For IBM TRIRIGA code, once the IBM TRIRIGA SSO properties are correctly set up based on your Web Server, Application Server & Security Authentication product configuration - IBM® TRIRIGA® single sign-on properties [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHEB3_3.4.2/com.ibm.tap.doc/sso_topics/r_sso_properties.html] - it will not care about how you have set up those other components, all it will do it is reading from the HTTP header the information it needs to load the user information (profile) from database, and proceed with the login process if it could get succeed in doing that. 

In other words, IBM TRIRIGA code will not be responsible for any configuration done on Web Server, Application Server and Authentication Security product (layer) you do for implementing SSO & Seamless Sign-on. 

But see that Seamless Sign-on adds even a more challenging configuration to Web Server once it needs to read from client's / end-users machine the domain user logged in (Operation System domain user session). It may use, for instance, kerberos protocol for reading from Windows user session (domain user name). 

For Windows, having Microsoft IIS as the Web Server will be easier implementation for reading this domain user name from Windows Session. 

IBM HTTP Server(IHS) may not be able to read it: You may need to create a PMR to WebSphere IHS team for checking on the feasible available options for your topology, product and versions. You may want to read this IBM WebSphere guide as additional information on implementing Kerberos on IHS, that may meet your business needs: Implementing Kerberos in a WebSphere Application Server Environment [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247771.pdf] .

If you use Oracle Web Logic as your Web Server, you may need to create a support ticket on Oracle vendor support for checking on that. Anyway, IBM TRIRIGA support will not be able to assist on this 3rd party configuration required for SSO & Seamless Sign-On implementation. 

For more information on how to configure, test and see some sample scenarios for preparing Application Server & Web Server for SSO-enabled environments, kindly review this IBM Wiki URL page:

SSO [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/SSO]

See our SSO compatibility information on this IBM Wiki URL page.

SSO Compatibility [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM+TRIRIGA1/page/SSO+Compatibility]

The above will bring us the following important note:

"IBM TRIRIGA is compatible with Single Sign On (SSO) when SSO has been configured properly. After TRIRIGA properties are enabled for SSO, TRIRIGA authentication trusts tokens that are provided by properly configured Application Servers with SSO. TRIRIGA Support can assist with configuring TRIRIGA properties for SSO, but, due to the number of possible configurations and supported products/technologies, TRIRIGA Support cannot assist in the configuration of SSO with application servers, web servers, load balancers, or third party products. For more information refer to Requirements for single sign-on requests in the TRIRIGA Application Platform. In this document, Single Sign On (SSO) refers to the ability to have a single set of credentials that use a directory server for multiple applications. By definition, SSO is not the same as Seamless Sign On, which may not challenge a user for credentials during the access process."
