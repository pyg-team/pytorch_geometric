Title: IBM Including long descriptions in the Maximo Enterprise Adapter - United States

Text:
long description; ldkey; hasld; MEA; TPAEINTEGRATION TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I include long descriptions when sending data in using the Maximo Enterprise Adapter (MEA) or Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)? 

ANSWER
 

Maximo 6.x MEA 

1. Go To Integration -> Integration Object 

On the Persistent Fields tab, exclude HASLD
On the Non-Persistent Fields tab, include DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION 

Maximo 7.x MIF

1. Go To Integration -> Object Structures 

Click Select Action -> Exclude/Include Fields 

On the Persistent Fields tab, exclude HASLD
On the Non-Persistent Fields tab, include DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION 

Maximo 6.x/7.x XML

Add the long description tag to the inbound XML:

<DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION>xxxxx</DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION> 

Do not include the HASLD tag. This column will be set automatically.

The same process will work for sending data in using flat files and interface tables, however, you must use an alias for DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION on DB2 and SQL Server since the column name is longer than 18. If your object structure has multiple MBOs with long descriptions, you will have to use an alias to identify each column name uniquely.
