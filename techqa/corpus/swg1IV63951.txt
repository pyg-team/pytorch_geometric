ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Duplicate attribute number deleting/undeleting new row
   
   Problem details:
   =================
   
   Maximo should be able to deal with rows being deleted and
   undeleted when adding or existing object in database
   configuration.
   
   
   Maximo should be able to deal with rows being deleted and
   undeleted when adding an object.
   
   
   If I delete the row without saving and then undelete it again,
   the database never sees that this attribute should be deleted;
   furthermore,I do not want the attribute to be deleted.
   
   The issue is like this:
   
   I create a new object. The unique ID attribute and the
   DESCRIPTION attribute are created automatically.
   
   
   I think I do not want the DESCRIPTION attribute, so I mark it
   for deletion.
   
   I add some attributes.
   
   
   Then I change my mind and I undelete the DESCRIPTION attribute,
   because now I want it.
   
   
   Then I save => error. Why should the DB want to delete the
   DESCRIPTION attribute?
   It is not marked for deletion. No, the problem is that while
   DESCRIPTION was marked for deletion, Maximo assigned its
   attribute number to one of the new attributes I created myself.
   
   I think Maximo should only assign the attribute numbers at the
   time of the save, not at the creation of the attribute.

   L2 ACTION TAKEN
   =================
   Reproduced by L2 support on latest release.

   I opened the first object (ACCOUNTDEFAULTS).
   
   I added an attribute and called it "newattribute". I did not
   save.
   
   I marked it for deletion. I did not save.
   
   I added an attribute and called it "anotherattribute". I did not
   save.
   
   I undeleted the "newattribute"
   
   I saved. The error appeared.
