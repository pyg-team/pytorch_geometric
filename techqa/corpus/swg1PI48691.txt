APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following information is in chapter 12 of the OpenPages 7.1
   Installation Guide, called: Installing a new OpenPages GRC
   Platform Deployment:
   
   8. For AIX installations, ensure that the 32 bit JRE directory
   property points to the location of a 32-bit Java Runtime
   Environment (JRE).
   The 32-bit JRE is used during the installation Fujitsu
   Interstage Business Process Management software (OpenPages
   workflow server). After the workflow server is installed,
   OpenPages does not use the JRE.
   
   Tip: To check the version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
   
       Ensure that JAVA_HOME is not set.
       Go to the JRE_HOME/bin directory.
       Type the following command: java -version
   
       The results display version information.
   
   
   The issue is that the documentation says a 32 bit JRE, but never
   says which version of Java.
   
   In OP 7.1, it is a 32-bit Java 1.7 JRE.
   The customer downloaded Java from IBM's site, I didn't catch the
   URL
   they used, but they had to download and install a 32 bit for AIX
   in
   order to get the Fujtistu IBPM software installed.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   Perform an installation on AIX and not have the correct 32-bit
   Java 1.7 JRE as the JRE location for the OPAdminConsole or
   silent-installer.
   
   Expected Results:
   
   32-bit Java 1.7 JRE requirement for installation of OpenPages
   should be defined in documentation and Clarity.
   
   Actual Results:
   
   32-bit Java 1.7 JRE requirement for installation of OpenPages is
   not defined in documentation and Clarity.
   
   Error Message:
   
   OPAdminConsole or silent-installer does not allow an
   installation to proceed because of the wrong JRE version and bit
   being used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make sure to download and use 32-bit Java 1.7 JRE for the
   installation of IBPM.
