APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using a map with an ampersand (&) in the name on a
   clustered instance of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator, the version
   of the map does not update when changed until after a restart.
   
   An error will show up in noapp.log with part of the map name.
   For example, if you have a map named "A&BMap" and you try to
   change the version you will see an error in the noapp log that
   looks like:
   
   ALL 000000000000 GLOBAL_SCOPE [Fatal Error] :1:381: The
   reference to entity "BMap:999:" must end with the ';' delimiter.
