APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: When installing from an ISO image, or CD, version
   files are not updated.
   Causes duplicate entries for 64-bit agents to appear in kincinfo
   output.
   
   Environment:
     Windows ONLY. Installing any ITM based product from an ISO
   image,  or real CD.
   
   Problem Description:
   When installing from ISO or CD all files have the read-only
   attribute.
   When these files are copied to the installation area the
   read-only attributes are not reset so updates to the ver files
   are lost.
   
   
   This can cause 32-bit and 64-bit agent recognition problems and
   th appearance of multiple agents when 64-bit agents are
   install. The  second version file is created to block the
   installation of the 32-bit  agent on the same machine.
   
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     If a network image is used for testing, be sure to make sure
   all the  files have the read-only attribute. This can be done by
   using the  attrib command from a DOS Prompt to set all files to
   have the  read-only attribute. (attrib *.* +r /s)
   
   
   1. From the Microsoft Applications CD install the Hyper-V
   agent only  on the target machine.
   
   2. Open a DOS Prompt and issue command kincinfo -i. Only one
   entry should show for the HV Agent. Without the APAR, 2 entries
   will appear. The failure will also appear on kincinfo -d and
    kincinfo -t commands.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not install from ISO image, or directly from the CD. Copy the
   images locally or to a network drive then reset the read-only
   attributes on all files copied from the CD.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On Windows when installing from an ISO or DVD, version files may
   not be updated with install information.
   
   During installation, version files (*.VER) are copied from the
   installation media. If the media is in ISO or DVD format, the
   files are marked read-only after they are copied to the
   %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\ver directory. The read-only attribute
   prevents the installer from updating information in these *.VER
   files. This can have an effect IBM Tivoli Monitoring components
   that depend on that information. Also when installing a 64-bit
   agent, a 32-bit version file is created from the 64-bit version
   file and installed to prevent older media from installing a
   32-bit agent into the same path. This prevents agents from being
   selectable for installation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A change has been made to remove the read-only attribute from
   the file before an upgrade is attempted. Also existing 32-bit
   dummy version files are now updated with the
   Dummy32BitVerfile=YES setting when necessary. Before files are
   installed, the installer scans for 32-bit dummy version files
   containing Dummy32BitVerfile=YES. If this setting is found, only
   the 64-bit agent will be started. Otherwise, both 32-bit and
   64-bit agents will be installed and started.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Do not install from ISO image or directly from a DVD. Copy the
   images locally or to a network drive then reset the read-only
   attributes on all files copied from the CD.
