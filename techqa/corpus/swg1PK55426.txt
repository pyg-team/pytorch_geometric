   WITHOUT ANY INPUT/OUTPUT PARAMETER WHICH MEANS DB2 COULD NOT
   FIND THE STORED PROCEDURE IN DB2 CATALOG.
   
   IF THE CALLER IS BROKER AND THE STORED PROCEDURE HAS ONE OR
   MORE INPUT/OUTPUT PARMS, IT WILL WORK WITHOUT PROBLEM.
   IF THE CALLER IS NOT BROKER BUT JAVA OR OTHER APPLICATION,IT
   WILL WORK WITHOUT PROBLEM.

   THE STORED PROCEDURE HAS NO PARAMETER ON DB2 V8 Z/OS.
