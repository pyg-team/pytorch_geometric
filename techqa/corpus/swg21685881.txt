QUESTION
 Are HTTPS, SSL and TLS supported by IBM TRIRIGA product? 

CAUSE
Need to implement HTTPS, SSL and TLS for my IBM TRIRIGA solution.

ANSWER
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are both supported via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). The HTTPS protocol is the result of simply layering the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on top of the SSL/TLS protocol, thus adding the security capabilities of SSL/TLS to standard HTTP communications. This is implemented via Web Server configuration. We have tested HTTPS for IBM TRIRIGA and support it via Web Server set up. See: Enable HTTPS in WebSphere for Maximo, SCCD, TSRM, and Tririga [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Anything%20about%20Tivoli/page/Enable%20HTTPS%20in%20WebSphere%20for%20Maximo,%20SCCD,%20TSRM,%20and%20Tririga] 

But we do NOT support:

- Secure Shell (SSH) on IBM TRIRIGA system, but see that during installation the IBM TRIRIGA installer may connect to application server as the IBM TRIRIGA user via SSH protocol (other remote terminal application protocol may be used as well, see IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform Version 3 Release 4.1 Installation and Implementation Guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHEB3_3.4.1/com.ibm.tap.doc/pdfs/pdf_tap_install.pdf] );

- The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) proprietary protocol;

- The encrypting communication session IP packet Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol suite (Your Application Server may support it, but this has never been tested out by IBM TRIRIGA);

- The Citrix System proprietary application server Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol.
