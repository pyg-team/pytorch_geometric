ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using take action command with a period delimited value
   with the period enclosed in quotes on z/OS, the single quotes
   are not removed.  For Example:
   
   CANCEL
   &Address_Space_CPU_Utilization.Job_Name'.'&Address_Space_CPU_Uti
   lization.StepName
   
   The command sent to z/OS is
   
   CANCEL JOBNAME'.'STEPNAME
   
   Using single quotes on takeaction on Windows seems to remove the
   single quotes properly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Action panel no longer uses quotes as of release 6.1.0.
   The attribute names are now enclosed as &{attrgrp.col} -- the
   prefered format for the TEMS. This change was done in 6.1.0 Fix
   Pack 1.
