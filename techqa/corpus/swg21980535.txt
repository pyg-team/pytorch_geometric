Title: IBM TRIRIGA AP v3.4.2 Installer does not deploy to WebSphere v8.5.5 - United States

Text:
TRIINSTALL; TRIWEBSPHERE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform v3.4.2 to WebSphere v8.5.5, you receive an "Install Complete" screen but TRIRIGA is not deployed within WebSphere and the application is not accessible. 

SYMPTOM
The installation will appear to complete successfully, but the TRIRIGA Application is not deployed within the WebSphere console. 

If you view the C:\IBM\Tririga\was-ant.log file, you may see the following error message:

[java] java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: JVMCFRE003 bad major version; class=com/tririga/util/PasswordCryptography, offset=6 



You may also see a java.lang.NullPointerException error message similar to the following (click to enlarge): 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980535&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980535&aid=1]


CAUSE
There are two (2) possible causes to the above errors:

1. You have not installed and configured the IBM WebSphere v7.0 SDK

2. You need to install a more current IBM WebSphere Fixpack


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you received the bad major version error above, it is likely you do not have the WebSphere 1.7 SDK installed or configured.

The IBM WebSphere version that is bundled with TRIRIGA AP 3.4.2 is WebSphere v8.5.5. It includes the IBM v6 SDK by default. You must also download, install and configure the 7.0 SDK. 


The IBM WebSphere SDK V7 is included with your TRIRIGA AP 3.4.2. software entitlement:

(Please not the below part numbers and descriptions are subject to change)

IBM WebSphere SDK Java (TM) Technology Edition V7.0 (1 of 3) (for WebSphere Application Server V8.5) Multiplatform Multilingual (CI717ML)
IBM WebSphere SDK Java (TM) Technology Edition V7.0 (2 of 3) (for WebSphere Application Server V8.5) Multiplatform Multilingual (CI718ML)
IBM WebSphere SDK Java (TM) Technology Edition V7.0 (3 of 3) (for WebSphere Application Server V8.5) Multiplatform Multilingual (CI719ML)

After you have downloaded and extracted the above files, install the SDK using the IBM Installation Manager.

Configure the SDK for WebSphere as per the TRIRIGA Installation Guide. To do this, open a DOS command prompt and navigate to the C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin folder

Run the following two (2) commands:

managesdk -enableProfileAll -sdkname 1.7_64 â€“enableServers

managesdk -setCommandDefault -sdkname 1.7_64

Once this is completed, restart WebSphere and re-run the TRIRIGA installation program. You should no longer receive the error in the was-ant.log file and TRIRIGA will deploy successfully to WebSphere. 

=======================================================================================

If you received the java.lang.NullPointerException error, you likely need to install a more current WebSphere fixpack. The WebSphere version that is bundled with TRIRIGA AP 3.4.2 is WebSphere v8.5.5.0.

Download and install WebSphere Application Server Fixpack v8.5.5.7 or greater using the link below:

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036319 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036319]

Once the fixpack has been fully installed, re-run the TRIRIGA AP v3.4.2 installation. You should no longer receive the error in the was-ant.log file and TRIRIGA will deploy successfully to WebSphere.

Note: you may need to restart the server for changes to take effect.
