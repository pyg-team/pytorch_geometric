APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  z/OS does not support the Olson timezone format, so we are
   restricted to specifying the POSIX format for the TZ environment
   variable. However, we should be setting the full POSIX format,
   i.e., the time zone and daylight saving time (DST) rules. For
   example, in the UK, we should set the TZ environment variable as
   follows:
   
   TZ=GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0/2
   
   This states that DST comes into effect on the last Sunday of
   March at 01:00 am GMT and ends on the last Sunday of October at
   01:00 am GMT.
   (Note that the TZ environment variable is expressed in local
   time, so 01:00 GMT is set above as 02:00 BST).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If customers experience problems with inaccurate local time
   values in returned TIMESTAMP variables, then they should update
   their Brokers ENVFILE TZ environment variable to use the
   full POSIX notation, e.g., GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0/2. The
   Broker will
   need to be restarted to pick up the change.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 and IBM Integration
   Bus V9.0 on z/OS.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   z/OS does not support the Olson timezone format, so we are
   restricted to specifying the POSIX format for the TZ environment
   variable. If the full POSIX format is not specified and the
   default daylight saving time (DST) rules are not valid for your
   timezone, then it is possible to experience inaccurate local
   time values in returned TIMESTAMP variables during periods in
   the year when the default DST values are in effect.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

   mft.doc/bb23814_.htm.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  BIPEDIT now specifies the full POSIX format for the UK as a
   default value for the TZ environment variable.
