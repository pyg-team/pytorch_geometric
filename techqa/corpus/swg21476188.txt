Title: IBM Reading Quantum ASCII Multipunch Files - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Quantum customer has provided me what is called a Quantum ASCII Multipunch file. It appears to be a normal fixed ASCII file, but in some fields there are asterisks, which are supposed to represent multiple response questions. At the end of some of the lines in this file, there are a lot of odd characters. When I try to read this file into SPSS, the plain ASCII fields come in correctly, but the asterisks are either not read in at all, or all I get is an asterisk in SPSS. How can I read this file? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS can read a standard multipunch file, which is a specialized file format that is used to put data on computer cards. However, a Quantum ASCII Multipunch file is proprietary format which SPSS MR products can read. The asterisks do denote multiple response fields, but the actual data for those fields are at the end of the line in binary format. SPSS cannot read these multiple response fields because they are in a proprietary format. Also, in SPSS, each case under a variable can only contain one answer or value. These multiple response fields, even if we could decode the binary format that Quantum is using, could not fit within one variable. 

In Quantum you may convert this file into a plain ASCII file that SPSS is able to read by using a "call explode" to change the multiple response variables into separate single response variables. Then, the file would need to be converted into plain ASCII.
