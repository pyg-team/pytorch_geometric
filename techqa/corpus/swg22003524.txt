Title: IBM How to have IBM Daeja ViewONE viewer window always opened in a maximised state? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 A new window pops up when the Daeja viewer opens upon selecting a document in IBM Content Navigator. Is there a way to set the window to always open as maximised when the Daeja viewer window opens? 

ANSWER
If a user maximises the window on startup, it does remain maximised thereafter (even with a browser restart) unless the user actively switches it back again.

To open the viewer window maximised with no user intervention you would need to use a custom plug-in to override the ecm.widget.dialog.contentViewerWindow.getSizeAndPosition() function to return the following: 

return {
left: 0,
top: 0,
width: screen.availWidth,
height: screen.availHeight
};

This will ensure the viewer window is maximised when a document is viewed.
