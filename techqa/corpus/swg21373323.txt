PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After ddexim import/export and recycle of IBM FileNet Image Services software, the Doc Class Security attributes changed to 'none,none,none' 

SYMPTOM
Users noticed they were not able to retrieve thousands of documents that were recently imported and migrated into an Image Services server. 

The problem seemed to have been isolated to all new documents imported for a specific Doc Class. It was noticed that the Doc Class Security attributes had been changed to 'none,none,none' instead of the originally assigned attributes.


CAUSE
After further investigation the root cause was narrowed down to the 'ddexim' tool, which was used to export/import Data Dictionary information for a Doc Class from one Image Services server into another, that had taken place the day before. 

After further testing it was noticed that after every 'ddexim' attempt and upon recycle of the Image Services software the Doc Class security settings (Read,Write,Execute) would change to "(NONE, NONE, NONE)" from their original group settings.


ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Windows 

RDBMS Release: MS-SQL
FileNet Image Services Release: 4.1.x


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To isolate the issue further, use the ddexim utility on the Image Services server to import the Data Dictionary of a Doc Class (without any changes being made a doc class) and then use ddexim to import to same DEV server and the Doc Class Security setting changes to "(NONE, NONE, NONE)" after recycle of Image Services software. 


The original ddexim export and subsequent ddexim import shows the doc class security is set to following parameter as expected:

class QA_Testing_Docs {
description "QA Testing"
security_read_name "QA_Group.Read:Lab_Server_IS:FileNet"
security_write_name "QA_Group.Write:Lab_Server_IS:FileNet"
security_exe_name "QA_Group.Execute:Lab_Server_IS:FileNet"

But after Image Services software recycle the same doc class security setting changes to:

class QA_Testing_Docs {
description "QA Testing"
security_read_name "(NONE)"
security_write_name "(NONE)"
security_exe_name "(NONE)"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before using 'ddexim' to export/import security definitions for document classes, you must perform these procedures if youâ€™re running on a Windows server with a SQL Server installation. 


On the Image Services server with an MS SQL Server installation, follow these steps:


 1. Stop the FileNet software and verify that MS SQL Server is also stopped. 
 2. Open the Start menu and select the Programs menu. 
 3. Select MS SQL Server from the Programs menu. 
 4. Select SQL Client Configuration Utility. 
 5. Verify that the Automatic ANSI to OEM option is turned off: If it is checked, click it to remove the check mark. 
 6. Start the FileNet software. 
 7. Import the data using this command:


ddexim -i <filename> 

where <filename> is the name of the file containing the security definitions for document classes.
