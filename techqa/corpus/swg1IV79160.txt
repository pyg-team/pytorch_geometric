APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   When the KD4 agent sends data to the TEPS it truncates
     a columns length according to the fixed length of the column.
     In doing so, it may not truncate all the bytes of a UTF8
     character properly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of ITCAM for SOA KD4 Agent on all
   * platforms.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * When the KD4 agent sends data to the TEPS it truncates a
   * columns length according to the fixed length of the column.
   * In doing so, it may not truncate all the bytes of a UTF8
   * character properly. If the last character in the column is a
   * UTF8 character it may be partially truncated. When this
   * happens the column does not display properly in the TEPS.
   * Also you may see an error similar to the following in the hd
   * logs:
   *
   * (562DED7B.0000-16:khdxjdbc.cpp,2027,"SQL_BindInputParameter")
   * ERROR: The value (...) in the column <COLUMNNAME> after UTF8
   * conversion has a length (257) greater than the column size
   * (256).
   *
   * Interim Fix 7 resolves this issue by truncating all the bytes
   * of any UTF8 character from the end of a column.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply IFix 7 when available.
