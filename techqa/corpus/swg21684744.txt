Title: IBM Updating the IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition for IBM Data Studio web console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Data Studo web client (DSWC) uses the IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition. When security vulnerabilities are discovered in the IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition, the only remediation is to replace the IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition that is installed with DSWC with a newer version which does not contain the vulnerability. This technote describes how to replace the IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
See the table below to find the IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition download link that matches your product version and platform. If you cannot find the download link for your product version and platform, contact IBM Technical Support and refer to this technote. 

 1. Download the installable package (for example: ibm-java-x86_64-jre-7.0-7.1.bin), or download the compressed archive package (for example: ibm-java-jre-7.0-7.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz) and extract it to a folder on a local file system (for example: /tmp/ibm-jre-7.0-7.1). 
 2. If necessary change the file permission (for example: chmod 755 ibm-java-x86_64-jre-7.0-7.1.bin). 
 3. Run the installer (for example: ./ibm-java-x86_64-jre-7.0-7.1.bin). The IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition will be installed on your local file system (for example to directory: /opt/ibm/java-x86_64-70). 
 4. Stop the service named IBMDSServer from DSWC start menu "Stop Web Console Server" or by using the stop.sh command (for example: /opt/ibm/DSWC/bin/stop.sh). 
 5. Back-up and then delete the contents of the “jre” folder from your product installation directory (for example: /opt/ibm/DSWC/jre). 
 6. Copy the contents of the “jre” folder from the latest IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition that you installed in Step 4 (for example: /opt/ibm/java-x86_64-70/jre/) to the “jre” folder in your DSWC installation directory (for example: /opt/ibm/DSWC/jre/).* 
 7. Ensure that the file permissions for the new files and folders match the file permissions for the original files and folders. If necessary, set 775 recursively. 
 8. Restart the IBMDSServer by clicking "Start Web Console Server" or by using the start.sh command (for example: /opt/ibm/DSWC/bin/start.sh).
