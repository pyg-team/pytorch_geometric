Title: IBM JazzSM prereq checker logs "FAIL" for os.isUnixServiceRunning.sshd property - United States

Text:
jazzsm install fail sshd isUnixServiceRunning TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the JazzSM prerequisite checker log failures on a server that meets the TPC documented hardware requirements? 

CAUSE
JazzSM components selected in the installer that are not required nor supported for installation on a TPC/JazzSM/Cognos installation

ANSWER
TPC server installer launches the JazzSM Launchpad installer. JazzSM launchpad installer runs it's prerequisite check and shows a status of "error" with a red "x" icon. Clicking on the "view details" button next to this will reveal a line that shows: 

os.isUnixServiceRunning.sshd with a result of "FAIL". 

This prerequisite is only required when users select components outside of what is required/supported for a JazzSM/Cognos reporting. 

When performing the optional installation of JazzSM/TCR/Cognos make sure to only select the components shown here:
