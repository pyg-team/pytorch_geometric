Title: IBM TWS Processes defunct - United States

Text:
tws defunct process jobman batchman TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing a new FTA the TWS processes start but immediately fail. When I look at the process list I see they are defunct. 

SYMPTOM
Processes fail but remain defunct within the operating system.


CAUSE
The TWS file system is configured incorrectly.

ENVIRONMENT
Unix

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the TWSMERGE and MAESTRO logs for information relating to the processes that fail. You find them within directories :-




<TWS_HOME>/stdlist/logs 

<TWS_HOME>/stdlist/traces 

<TWS_HOME>/stdlist/date 

You will see messages like :-

AWSDFF001I Invoking prog =/usr/TWS/bin/JOBMAN AWSDFF003E setuid failed; error

Check that the affected TWS processes have the correct permissions. Example :-

-r-s--s--x 1 mdm84 staff 3333772 Nov 23 2012 JOBMAN

If the permissions are correct, check that the TWS operating system allows suid. You should NOT see the nosuid within your /etc/fstab :-

/dev/mapper/vg00-usr_tws /opt/TWS ext3 defaults,nodev,nosuid 1 2


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit your /etc/fstab and remove the nosuid. 

Stop and restart the TWS processes.
