Tivoli System Automation for Integrated Operations Management V2.1.1

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Installation of the fix pack 1 of Tivoli System Automation for Integrated Operations 

Management 2.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Unzip the file 2.1.1-TIV-SAIOM-FP0001.zip into a local directory.
This will result in the creation of two subdirectories:
1) The directory '2.1.1-TIV-SAIOM-FP0001\SA IOM V211 FP1' containing 
the SAIOM Fixpack, which updates a previous SA IOM installation.
2) The directory '2.1.1-TIV-SAIOM-FP0001\SA IOM V211 FP1 Client Installer',
which contains the additional client-only installer.

2. Navigate into the 'SA IOM V211 FP1' subdirectory and then navigate
to the directory where you find the file 'setup.exe'.
The directory structure is as follows:
SA IOM V211 FP1\
-> Doc\
-> Installer\
--> Disk1\
---> Instdata\
----> VM\
-----> setup.exe

To install the fixpack, launch 'setup.exe' and follow the instructions
given in the user interface of the installer.

After update of the product please follow the reboot advice.

This installer will also install the files for the environment VS2008 which
is used by the new SA IOM version. Do not remove these files.


Documentation update:
-------------------
User's Guide, chapter 2: The tables for software requirements for the server and the
client should both include Windows 2008 R1 and R2.


Installation Notes:
-------------------
On Windows 2003 and Windows Vista the install process may end with a message
saying "some errors occurred" instead of "successfully installed".
Please ignore the error, all components were installed correctly.

If you have only selected product features installed on your system and choose 
'Selective install', installer will pre-select components which are NOT installed 
on the system for installation. If you do not plan to install and use missing 
product features, please select installed components you want to update and 
deselect components you do not need to install.


IMPORTANT:
----------
After updating the SA IOM with this Fixpack 1 followed by an uninstallation
of the old AF/Remote product, it is necessary to run the provided
RP3270.bat file from the following directory of the fix pack:
2.1.1-TIV-SAIOM-FP0001\SA IOM V211 FP1\RP3270 FIX\ .
The batch file restores several registry keys, which are mandatory for
operation of SA IOM, but which were removed by the de-installation of
AF/REMOTE.

THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO 64 BIT SYSTEMS.


COAX Support Removal
--------------------
The drivers that support the legacy protocol for COAX adapters could be removed
from the installation now.
As COAX support is deprecated and not used anymore by most of the customers
the support for those drivers are not the default anymore.
A new panel appears that the COAX driver support can be omitted now.
The checkmark for COAX is NOT set and if one wants to keep the drivers have to
checkmark this support. 
IF THE CHECKMARK IS NOT SET THE DRIVERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE INSTALLATION.


Error 193: 0xc1 possible issue:
-------------------------------
If for some reason the SA IOM server service is not startable and gets an
error 193 0xc1 on startup please have a look at the root directory of the
installation drive . If you find a file entry just called "program" delete
it.
Try to start the service again. If it fails again, please report the error.


Relocated data files:
--------------------
To follow the Windows standard and to enable non administrators to run RpClient
on Windows Vista, Windows 7, etc. it is now possible to have the SA IOM data
files in a Windows designated data directory. A new utility "RpDatLoc.exe"
is included to help with the configuration (see the on-line help on this 
stand alone program for further information).
The most common usage of RpDatLoc is to enable the SA IOM client to run
for a 'standard' Windows user. To do this follow the steps below:
1) Log on to Windows as an administrator.
2) Install the SA IOM Client using the SA IOM installer.
3) Log off the administrator user.
4) Log on with the 'standard' Windows users ID.
5) Start RpDatLoc.exe.
6) Go to the 'Copy Files' page and copy from 'Install directory' to the 'User Application directory'.
7) Close RpDatLog and start RpClient.


AF/Remote Migration
-------------------
If you migrate from existing AF/Remote installation you can choose to click
the migration checkmark. In this case, the following files are copied from
the old AF/Remote config directory to the new SA IOM config directory
o RPSERVER.DAT
o RPCLIENT.DAT
o RPUSER.DAT
This saves all preferences made in AF/Remote which are already configured.
