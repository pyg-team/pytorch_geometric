For vHMC on ppc, both the HMC and Power Firmware updates are required to mitigate the vulnerabilities. 

For vHMC on x86, mitigation may require additional hypervisor and firmware updates; customers should consult their hypervisor and x86 system vendors for information. 
The x86 HMC hardware appliance will not require HMC machine code updates to protect against these CVEs.
