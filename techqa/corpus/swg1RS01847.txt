APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer noticed that in Decision Center, when running DVS
   Scenarios, he gets different results depending on the user.
   While the Admin's get consistently the expected results, users
   with
   linited rights get different results. He found out that the
   permission "View Ruleflow" must be set to true for the user to
   allow the DVS Scenario to run succesfully.

   creating the ruleset.
