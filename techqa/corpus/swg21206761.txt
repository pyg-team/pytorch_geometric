PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The COBOL/SQL CoProcessor gets an error message count for messages that are not listed including IGYDS5201-U and IGYDS5125-U or IGYDS0209-W DSNHnnnn followed by SQL message text. 

SYMPTOM
Possible missing messages include IGYDS5201-U, IGYDS5125-U, IGYPS2121-S, IGYDS0209-W DSNHnnnn or ABEND04E. 

For example, compiling with IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS 3.4.x and DB2 Version 8, a RC16 was seen for the compile. The message count at the end of the listing showed 2 TERMINATING messages. However, the listing did not include any -U error messages. 

After adding compiler options SQL('CCSID(037)') and CODEPAGE(037), the following compiler errors appeared: 

 * IGYDS5125-U The compilation was terminated due to a compiler error in phase id: "IGYCDSCN". 
 * IGYDS5201-U Internal compiler error code "SQLGINIT_INTERFACE" occurred.
   
   These messages occur in the listing immediately after the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION header.
   
   In another situation, error IGYPS2121-S "SQLCODE" was not defined as a data-name was seen because the expansion of EXEC SQL SQLCA END-EXEC was not done correctly.


CAUSE
The COBOL/SQL Co-Processor option of IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS 3.4.x when used with DB2 Version 8 or later, requires a UNICODE conversion reference. This is not needed with DB2 Version 7.

ENVIRONMENT
Enterprise COBOL 3.4 or later; z/OS 1.7 or later, DB2 V8 or later.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply one or both solutions to resolve the issue: 

 

 * Use both of these compile time options:
   
   SQL("CCSID(37)")
   
   CODEPAGE(037)
   
   
 * Set SCCSID=37 in your DSNHDECM to setup the default in the DSNHDECP in the .SDSNEXIT library and concatenate it ahead of the .SDSNLOAD library.
   
   Matching CODEPAGE(037) should be used as an Enterprise COBOL Compiler option
   
   Note: The supported release of z/OS includes preconfigured Unicode pairs, so the setup required for earlier releases is no longer necessary.
