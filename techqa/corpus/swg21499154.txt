PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are attempting to install the CICS Explorer SDK into the CICS Explorer and receive message:
Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
Missing requirement: CICS Java SDK Plug-in .... requires 'bundle org.eclipse.pde.core 0.0.0' but it could not be found. Cannot satisfy dependency... 

SYMPTOM
Following is a complete set of messages that you receive when installing the CICS Explorer SDK:
Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
Software being installed: IBM CICS Explorer SDK 1.0.1.1_201103311702 (com.ibm.cics.explorer.sdk.feature.feature.group 1.0.1.1_201103311702)
Missing requirement: CICS Java SDK Plug-in 1.0.100.201103311702 (com.ibm.cics.explorer.sdk
1.0.100.201103311702) requires 'bundle org.eclipse.pde.core 0.0.0' but it could not be found
Cannot satisfy dependency:
From: IBM CICS Explorer SDK 1.0.1.1_201103311702 (com.ibm.cics.explorer.sdk.feature.feature.group 1.0.1.1_201103311702)
To: com.ibm.cics.explorer.sdk http://1.0.100.201103311702

CAUSE
The CICS Explorer SDK is not designed to install into the CICS Explorer. The CICS Explorer SDK provides all functions of the Explorer, and is for installation into Eclipse (or Eclipse based products). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you only require the functions of the CICS Explorer, then you can just install the stand-alone CICS Explorer [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/explorer_install.html] product. If you also require development features, or prefer to use your existing Eclipse environment, you can install the CICS Explorer SDK [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.java.doc/topics/installing_sdk.html] into an Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) instead.

For both types of installations, you should also review the CICS Explorer system requirements page. [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/explorer/requirements/]
