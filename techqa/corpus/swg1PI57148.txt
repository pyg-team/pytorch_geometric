APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As a result of multiple Data Collectors installed and
   configured in <ITMHOME>/dchome (for example, after SOA D4 7.2.x
   and YN 7.2 agents have been installed), the file
   <ITMHOME>/config/gdc_install_history.txt may contain multiple
   rows, e.g.
   /opt/IBM/ITM/dchome        7.2.0.0.10
   /opt/IBM/ITM/dchome        7.2.0.0.6
   In the above case, the second row should not be there, after DC
   7.2.0.0.10 is configured by enabling both WAS and SOA
   integrations.
   As a result, if YN agent is configured in dc-less mode, the
   JMXServer will not be able to start automatically (when
   starting TEMA), because of DCHOME parsing error.
   TEMA trace shows this error:

   YN Agent 7.2 IF0005 (DC 7.2.0.0.10) running in dc-less mode.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either remove the unexpected two in "gdc_install_history.txt"
   or manually start JMXServer by its startup script.
