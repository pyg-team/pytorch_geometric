wps bpc oracle thin TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The BPC Container configuration screen in the administrative console resets the BPE data source (jdbc/BPEDB) when you use the newer syntax for an Oracle thin driver (jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[HOST][:PORT]/SERVICE) definition. 

SYMPTOM
The Oracle BPE data source (jdbc/BPEDB) URL is reset to its default value, which is "jdbc:oracle:thin:@::", in the resource.xml configuration file. In addition, the Database Name and Server values are blank on the administrative console data source configuration page 


CAUSE
This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR JR42166.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can see a jdbc/BPEDB data source connection exception in the server log files. In addition, you cannot access the BPC Explorer.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete one of the following options:




 * Use the old syntax for the Oracle thin driver. For example:
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]:SID
   
   
 * Correct the jdbc/BPEDB data source value in the resource.xml configuration file.
