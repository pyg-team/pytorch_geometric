QUESTION
 We have a 'Post Entity Management' handler deployed as part of our IBM Initiate solution and every time it is executed, we get an error similar to the following:

ERROR : com.initiatesystems.hub.ldap.security.LdapLoginModule :: User name is null or empty
ERROR : com.initiatesystems.hub.engine.logic.AbstractEngineLogic :: Invalid user name/password. com.initiatesystems.hub.engine.logic.EngineLogicException: Invalid user name/password.
ERROR : com.initiatesystems.hub.logging.NativeLog :: UID=0, IXN=MEMGET, ERR=EINVAL, SMT=8016

We are not keeping and re-using reference of an earlier context and it is passed appropriately within the different methods. Why are we seeing this error and how can we prevent it? 

CAUSE
Unlike the other pre and post interaction call out handlers, the post entity management handler does not have user/password in the context when it is passed to it from the engine. Therefore the user and password have to be set within this callout handler. That is also why the UID reported in the error is 0.

ANSWER
Revise the code to create a new context with user/pwd as shown below: 

String host = "myservername.com";
int port = 9080;
String userId = "mdmadmin";
String password = "mdmadmin";
UsrHead usrHead = new UsrHead(userId, password);
Context ctx = new Context(host, port, usrHead);
