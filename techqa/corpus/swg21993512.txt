Title: IBM Failing to connect to EA Repository  (unknown) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We have previously been using Entity Analytics and are no longer able to connect. This is a client/server architecture. No software updates or system errors have occurred. 

SYMPTOM
[IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/NT64] SQL0204N "THISISME.SYS_PARAM" is an undefined name. SQLSTATE=42704


CAUSE
The credentials used to create the EA repository are not the same credentials being used to sign in (connect) to the EA repository.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Within the ea<number>.log the symptom is:
Failed to start web service on port: 1321, username=THISISME

Within the api_2216_20161021122804.SqlErr.log
10/21 12:28:09 [sql:5940:dbconnection=[1-2]] CRIT: Exception: SQL call failed.
42S02
[IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/NT64] SQL0204N "THISISME.SYS_PARAM" is an undefined name. SQLSTATE=42704


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are uncertain what user created the EA repository, the database name=Repository name.
Connect to the db2 database and review the objects within the database. The SYS_PARAM object is being qualified with the user name (credential used to sign in).
Finding this object should indicate what user created the EA repository. Then Connect to the EA repository using this credential.
