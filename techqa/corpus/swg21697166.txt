QUESTION
 Can the files under the Sterling B2B Integrator bin and properties backups directories be deleted? 

CAUSE
When the setupfiles.[sh|cmd] command is run, the setupfiles utility makes a backup copy of the associated bin and properties files and saves them to the respective backups subdirectory.

These backup directories are located in:

Windows:
<SI Install Directory>\bin\backups
<SI Install Directory>\properties\backups


UNIX:
<SI Install Directory>/bin/backups
<SI Install Directory>/properties/backups


Where <SI Install Directory> is the path, up to and including the install directory for where Sterling B2B Integrator is installed. (i.e. for Windows, C:\IBM\Sterling\SI525\install)



ANSWER
The content of the backups subdirectories can be safely deleted. Do not delete the actual backups directory. Just delete the contents within the backups directory. It is recommended you make a backup copy of these files prior to deleting them as they can help with troubleshooting or fixing issues after running setupfiles,
