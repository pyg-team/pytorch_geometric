PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why do my jobs stuck pending for a long time? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
My jobs have been in a pending state for a long period of time. What is keeping the jobs from running?You can type "bjobs -lp " to find out the pending reason. 

Usually what causes a job to pend for a long period of time is that the resource requirements are not met or LSF cannot find a matching host for your job. Since LSF has a default behavior of selecting the host with the same architecture, if you are submitting through a client host and you do not have a server host of the same type in your cluster, your job will pend forever. To solve this issue, you have two options: 
1. Add RES_REQ = type==any to your lsb.queues file. 
2. Add -R "select [type==any]" parameter to your bsub command line. 

Both of the above options will allow LSF to select any type of host in the cluster instead of the same host type as the submission host. 

Another common reason why jobs pend for a long time is that the scheduling threshold is set too low in the lsb.hosts or lsb.queues file. This will keep the job from getting dispatched. 

For more details on how to setup load indices, refer to lsb.hosts and lsb.queues file in your reference guide.
