APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is not possible to open the link module in read-only mode via
   GUI. This occurs when the link module is already opened in
   background with display set to false.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   - Create 2 modules, A and B
   - Create link from objects in B to A
   - Choose to use the default link module, when prompted
   - Save and close both modules
   - Open module A in Exclusive edit mode
   - Now, try to open DOORS Links link module in read-only mode
   Nothing happens, link module cannot be opened in read-only mode.
   If you go to "Tools -> Manage Open Modules", you'll observe that
   the link module is already open, with Displayed column set to
   No.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Select the link module on right pane of DOORS Explorer and run
   the following DXL:
   read(fullName(getSelectedItem), true)
