Title: IBM Set CDLIB authority for a User to send a file with Connect:Direct i5/OS - United States

user object authority; *CHANGE; *EXCLUDE; SETCDAUT; authorization list TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can Connect:Direct i5/OS user object authority be changed from *PUBLIC - *CHANGE to *EXCLUDE? 

ANSWER
A new command that is called SETCDAUT is added as an enhancement in the most recent PTF for 3.7 and 3.8 releases that make the CDADMIN the owner of all C:D objects. The new command assigns a "Group" user to all of the objects. Then, that "Group" user is set as the group user on all C:D user profiles, and *PUBLIC is set to *EXCLUDE on all C:D objects.

The SETCDAUT command must be run by the Connect:Direct Administrator User profile. Connect Direct must be down and all users logged off so that all objects can be updated. This command should be run to set the authority initially, but needs to be run again after any maintenance has been applied to the Connect Direct system. 
ENHANCEMENT 
*PUBLIC authority needs to be set to *EXCLUDE on all objects in the Connect:Direct library. 
Solution: A new command can be run that will modify the authority on all Connect:Direct objects. The Connect:Direct Administrator will become the owner, *PUBLIC will be set to *EXCLUDE and a specified 
group profile (ibm i user id of choice) will be granted *USE access. 
Object: SETCDAUT - (CMD) 
SETCDAUT SETCDAUTV - (CL) 
SETCDAUT - (PNLGRP) 

NOTE: IBM Engineers fully tested SETCDAUT, and it provides a way for Users with the new group authority to have access to the C:D objects. The use of authorization lists is not tested with the product.
