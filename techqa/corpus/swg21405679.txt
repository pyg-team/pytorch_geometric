Title: IBM Why does the preview of an archived email is being presented in plain text? - United States

ICC TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am using IBM Content Collector for Email to archive emails. When I am trying to view an archived email the email is being presented in plain text with all HTML tags.
But once i restore the same email to mailbox that email is presented normally. 

CAUSE
Having an email body with multiple MIME formats like plain/text and plain/html will cause this issue. Because IBM Content Collector for Email can only extract the plain text but not all MIME formats to ensure that no data is lost.

ANSWER
This is working as expected in this release of IBM Content Collector for Email 2.1.0.2.
