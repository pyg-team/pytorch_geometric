APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After you upgrade from IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.6
   to V8.5.7, a business process definition (BPD) application might
   show unexpected correlation validation errors in IBM Process
   Designer even though nothing was changed in the application.
   
   For example, after you migrate a BPD that has an event
   subprocess and a Start event that has a defined data mapping,you
   might see the following validation error for the mapping:
   
   "You must map the correlation variable to a local variable in
   event '<your_event_name>'."
