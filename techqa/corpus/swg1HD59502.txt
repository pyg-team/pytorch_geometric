ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENOVIA SESSION TIME-OUT IS NOT HANDLED
   CORRECTLY
   .
   ABSTRACT: ENOVIA Session Time-out Not Handled
   Correctly.........
   .
   Environment:
   Client OS and level: _____xp __
   Server OS and level: ___aix5.3.0____
   Database and level: __oracle____
   .
   Scenario:
   1. ORBIX Session time-out set to 3300000 (55
   minutes)
   2. Start LCA
   3. Wait for time-out
   .
   Observed behavior:
   Just starting LCA does not seem to respect the
   time-out parameter 3300000.
   When you activate an application and start some
   interaction it appears to respect the time-out.
   Log files will be attached when they have cleared
   our security process.
   We cannot stabilize our production environment
   with this type of application behavior that does not
   correspond with the configuration that we have put
   in place.
   .
   ORBIX timeout at the site is set to 55 minutes.
   Sessions are timing out in 20 minutes.
   What is controlling this unconfigured time-out.
   User cannot save work after timeout, resulting in
   hunderds of hours of lost time due to rework.
   'Server Manager Session Timeout retreived from
   environments variables:3300000 ms'
   and 'CATSrvKeepAlive is defined' appears in the
   trace files.
   At the time of this report our time-out was set to 55
   minutes.
   The documented procedure was followed for
   implementing this change.
   As you can tell in our log files, this is the time being
   reported by the server.
   At this time, we have increased our time out to 5
   hours.
   .
   The server, which we are using, is behind a firewall.
