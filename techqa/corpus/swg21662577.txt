CAMSOAMBDC CAMSOAALL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How are the SOA message headers removed completely from the WMB Message flows? 

SYMPTOM
After disabling, recreating the message flows, and un-installing the SOA D4 agent, running with TT Data Collector, the SOA headers are still present in the WMB Message flows.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Drop the entire WMB flow. Install a new fresh flow. Confirm SOA Agent is not installed at all in their system.

2. Checked original SOA v7.2 FP1 install and configuration directories make sure no remaining files present.

3. Enabled all KK3 UserExits on WMB Flows and Restarted WMB.
Navigate to /opt/IBM/ITM_TT directory showing in WMB environment variables
KKD3.dc.properties file there shows KD4 integration set to false
‘default.kd4.enabled=false’ 

4. Check for active SOA logs in /opt/IBM/ITM_TT KD4 log directories

5. From /var/mqsi/common/profiles/KK3UserExitProfile.sh, 
MQSI Exit Path set to /opt/IBM/IBM_TT

6. Stop/Start WMB. 

7. Result should be, No SOA in the header in the message flow.
