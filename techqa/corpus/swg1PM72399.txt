APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Changing Data Collector maintenance level using command line
   with multiple server instances failes.
   
   Example:
   6.Use this option to update Data Collectors with the new
   maintenance or reverting the update.
   
   
   The configuration utility prompts you for the WebSphere&#65449; server
   instance names.
   Input WebSphere Server Instance Name
   For example: cells/ITCAMCell/nodes/ITCAMNode/servers/server1
   (default is: ): Enter the full names of one or several WebSphere
   server instances for which you need to change the maintenance
   level. Separate multiple instances with commas (for example,
   cells/tivpc045Node05Cell/nodes/tivpc045test/servers/server1,
   cells/tivpc045Node05Cell/nodes/tivpc045test/servers/server2)
   
   The configuration will run without any error messages but will
   not perform the configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Change the maintenance level of one server at a time
   2. Use the GUI
   3. Perform silent config.
