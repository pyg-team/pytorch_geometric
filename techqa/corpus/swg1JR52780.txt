ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The issue is that the BPM is throwing an exception when trying
   to use the copy function to merge tracks using Process Designer
   8.5.5
   
   CWLLG2229E: An exception occurred in an EJB call.  Error: The
   source and target tracks were primed separately.

   This is a limitation and is that if a PA or TK is going to
   contain advanced content, it must be brought into IID to create
   the default library and module before any tracks are created in
   the PA or TK.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. In IID, bring the "Main" track into the IID workspace - this
      implementation does not contain any IID authored artifacts,
      only the IID representations of the PD artifacts. Only the
      'Site Request Fulfillment' is required.
   2. In the Business Integration view, ensure the 'Detailed Mode'
      display mode is selected.
   3. Select both the 'Site_Request_Fulfillment_Implementation'
      module and the 'Site_Request_Fulfillment_Library' library,
      then right-click and select 'Disassociate from Process
      Center'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   the following exception occurs:

   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   LOCAL FIX -
   Bring the project into IID and 'disassociate' the project from
   Process Center.
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   The issue occurs after importing a standard BPMN Process Center
   application into IBM Integration Designer (IID) at least once.
   By bringing the project into IID , even when the project does
   not include any advanced content, IID will convert the project
   to advanced.
   When trying to copy or create new tracks in Process Center, the
   function will fail due to the advanced content metadata.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A document APAR JR52780 was introduced to add additional text to
    the ?Copying changed assets from one track to another?
   document.
