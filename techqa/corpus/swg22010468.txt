PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When configuring SSL on the SDS, the IGI Broker connection to the LDAP might fail with an authentication error "Handshake failure". 

SYMPTOM
Logs might show a Communication Exception of a failed bind, with the following error explanation: 

[Root exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Server chose TLSv1.1, but that protocol version is not enabled or not supported by the client.] 


CAUSE
As per the error explanation, this is caused by a protocol version mismatch.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is possible to change advanced tuning parameters, including the protocol version, from the top-level menu of the Appliance Dashboard at Manage System Settings > System Settings > Advanced Tuning Parameters. 

Note that if you change the protocol version, you must ensure to have same protocol version on each external entity that is configured with SSL.
