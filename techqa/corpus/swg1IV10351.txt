APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Chinese characters in AEN event in "Historical Data Viewer"
   doesn't show correctly. Login to AEN client, right-click AEN
   icon, then click 'History...', all Chinese characters are
   displayed as square.
   
   
   Documentation should state clearly AEN is not fully globalised,
   the ability of displaying Chinese, Japanese and other national
   language characters in the real time and historical view are
   provided on a best-effort basis.
   
   We provide a workaround how to modify the font setting for the
   alert entry in the historical view via the AEN property file,
   the customer could try different fonts to find out the one fits
   their needs. Please refer to Local Fix for the workaround.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the following property: system.List.font=courier,BOLD,11 in
   AEN props file 'aen.properties' which is located in C:\Documents
   and Settings\<username>\.netcool\nco_aen_settings directory
