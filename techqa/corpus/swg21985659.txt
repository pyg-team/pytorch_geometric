PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why is IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3 Fixpack 7 not presenting a login popup after a session has expired in a Kerberos SSO environment? 

SYMPTOM
IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3 Fixpack 7 does not present a login popup after a session has expired in a Kerberos SSO environment.


CAUSE
This is the expected behavior. In a Kerberos SSO environment, if the user is not authenticated or their authentication has expired, WebSphere automatically negotiates or renegotiates the user's identity with the browser using SPNEGO. This happens inline to the ICN client request submitted through the browser. Neither the ICN client nor the ICN server application are involved with this renegotiation. When IBM Content Navigator deployed to use application server authentication in a Kerberos environment, every request that is delivered to the ICN server application is for an authenticated user. 

In a Kerberos SSO environment the container login is still valid, since WebSphere automatically negotiates or renegotiates the user's identity with the browser using SPNEGO. then when the session expires from inactivity the ICN server:

- Recreates the session
- Recreates the connections to SSO repositories in the desktop using the valid container login
- Continues handling the request

There should be no login prompt or desktop reload.


ENVIRONMENT
 IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3 Fixpack 7



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Working as expected.
