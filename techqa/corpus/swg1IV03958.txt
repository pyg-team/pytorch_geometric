ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OMNIbus: 7.3.1
   OMNIbus Log File Agent: 6.2.2. FP4
   Probe: nco_p_eif_probe 10.0.10
   
   Log file ----> Log file Agent 6.6.2 FP4 -----> EIF probe ----->
   ObjectServer
   
   Log File Agent read event from log file. The events that contain
   single quotations become double quotations in ObjectServer.
   
   LFA agent that escapes the single quote with a second single
   quote, because it is required  by the EIF protocol when sending
   messages to the EIF probe which contain quotes. When events such
   as these are sent to TEC, the second quote is restored to a
   single quote. However, when these events are sent to
   ObjectServer via the EIF probe, the double quote is not
   converted back to a single quote.
