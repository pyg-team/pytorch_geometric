QUESTION
 How can you identify an installation of the Strong Encryption Libraries in IBM Rational Performance Tester? 

CAUSE
You are asked to check if the Strong Encryption Libraries are installed on your IBM Rational Performance Tester workbench computer.

ANSWER
In IBM Rational Performance Tester you cannot find any indicator confirming that an existing installation of the Strong Encryption Libraries is present. 

Below is the procedure of checking two jar files and their date of modification: 

 1. Look for the files local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar. They are in:
    <Installation directory>\jdk\jre\lib\security folder respectively.
    
    
 2. Compare the date and time stamps of their respective installation with other installed IBM Rational Performance Tester files.
    If they are different, meaning that the date stamp is different from the actual installation date of IBM Rational Performance Tester itself then you might conclude that the Strong Encryption Libraries are installed. If their respective file sizes are known and the actual sizes differ then it is also an indicator that the Strong Encryption Libraries are on your system.
