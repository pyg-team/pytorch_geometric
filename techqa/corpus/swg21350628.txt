 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error encountered attempting to run IWR Report occurs every morning. Restarting the Cognos IWR Service Manager service would restore the ability to Run IWR Reports, but the issue recurs the next day. 

SYMPTOM
The server is not available to process your request. Enable the Impromptu Web Reports Server, and then resubmit your request.


CAUSE
The server is unable to concurrently run the number of IWR Reports it is configured to in IWR Server Administration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the number of request processes to 1, the maximum report processes to 7, and set the total of reserved processes to 7 or less. 

A total of reserve processes less than the maximum allows reports to execute a process that could otherwise be reserved for another queue but is unused. E.g. If you reserve processes in the Low queue, but have no reports configured to use the Low queue, those processes will never be used, limiting the number of Normal processes that can be run concurrently.

Steps:1. Open Cognos Server Administration, click Reports button and logon. 
2. Open the Report Servers folder, select the server name and and select Edit, Properties from the menu. 
3. Change the properties as indicated above. Note: The number of request processes recommended is 1 and maximum report processes usually shouldn't be more than 7.
