PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), you receive an invitation to collaborate on a task from a user who is part of the group tw_admins. When you accept the invitation, you see a "This task was claimed by another user. Ensure you are logged in as the correct user" error. You are then returned to the Work page in Process Portal. 

CAUSE
Collaboration is not supported for tasks that are implemented as client-side human services or heritage coaches. However, users in the tw_admins group can see the option to collaborate on such tasks, even though it is not supported.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The use of collaboration for tasks that are implemented as client-side human services or heritage coaches should be avoided.
