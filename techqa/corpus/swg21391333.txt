Title: IBM The use of the "show log" CLI command may cause the WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance to hang and reboot - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Issuing a "show log" CLI command when on the serial console or a slow SSH connection may cause the DataPower appliance to hang and reboot if there are many logs being generated. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issue has been resolved in the 3.7.3 firmware level. This was a change in core behavior and as such the fix will not be available for previous releases of the firmware. 

To avoid the issue in the previous firmware releases, do not use the show log CLI command, particularly if there are many logs being generated at the time the command is issued.
