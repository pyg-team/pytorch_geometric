APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When starting the node an error is seen in the logs and the node
   is marked as non-managed.  This results in the overridden
   endpoint (changed via admin console) to not take effect on this
   node.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  downgrade to version 6.0.2.2

   ****************************************************************
   During the process server startup there is a possible race
   condition that causes failure while loading certain Service
   Component Architecture classes, and later causes runtime
   issues when using Webservices binding and using the o
   verwridden endpoint reference.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Applying this interim fix resolves the startup issues and
   ensures that all the required Service Component Architecture
   classes are loaded correctly.
