APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the db2cfexp is used to export connectivity configuration
   information to an export profile, automatic value are exported
   as "AUTOMATIC" in dbm.cfg file.
   However when these are imported using the "db2cfimp" command,
   the values which were exported as "AUTOMATIC" are imported with
   minimum value possible.
   
   Test case  :
   
   ------------------------
   
   db2 reset dbm cfg
   
   
   
   db2 get dbm cfg(Before exporting) :
   ==>
   
    Agent pool size                        (NUM_POOLAGENTS) =
   AUTOMATIC(100)
    Initial number of agents in pool       (NUM_INITAGENTS) = 0
   
    Max number of coordinating agents     (MAX_COORDAGENTS) =
   AUTOMATIC(200)
    Max number of client connections      (MAX_CONNECTIONS) =
   AUTOMATIC(MAX_COORDAGENTS)
   
   db2cfexp dbm.cfg backup
   
   db2start
   
   db2cfimp dbm.cfg(After importing) :
   
   ==> automatic parameters have been changed
   
   
   
   Size of instance shared memory (4KB)  (INSTANCE_MEMORY) =
   AUTOMATIC(1)
   
   Priority of agents                           (AGENTPRI) = SYSTEM
   Agent pool size                        (NUM_POOLAGENTS) =
   AUTOMATIC(0)
   Initial number of agents in pool       (NUM_INITAGENTS) = 0
   
   Max number of coordinating agents     (MAX_COORDAGENTS) =
   AUTOMATIC(0)
   Max number of client connections      (MAX_CONNECTIONS) =
   AUTOMATIC(1)
   
   After this if you try :
   
   db2stop
   
   db2start
   
   
   db2 connect to dbname ==> will result in hang.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid using "AUTOMATIC" as a value in such cases.
   or
   Change the dbm CFG manually after they are imported.
