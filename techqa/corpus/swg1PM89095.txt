APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For PLI decimal and binary fields that do not include the
   attribute FIXED or FLOAT, the compiler decides based on the
   existence or otherwise of a specified precision.
   The CICS VT automapper does not handle these cases correctly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of CICS VSAM Transparency          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The automated mapper facility makes     *
   *                      incorrect assumptions when processing   *
   *                      PLI copybooks.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   There are discrepancies between the output produced by the
   automated mapper facility when processing PLI copybooks
   and the output for the same structures coded in COBOL.
   These occur when processing decimal and binary fields in
   PLI copybooks that do not specify FIXED or FLOAT.
   There is also no support for the PLI equivalents of COBOL
   REDFINES and OCCURS DEPENDING ON.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is changed to bring several aspects of PLI copybook
   processing into line with COBOL copybook processing.
   There are also changes to the way the automapper handles
   overlaid key and AIX fields.
