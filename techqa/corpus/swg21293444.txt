PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the error "ADMA0115W: Resource assignment of name dbColumnName and type java.lang.String, with JNDI name com/ibm/rpm/dbColumnName is not found within scope of module rpm-middleware with URI rpm-middleware-7.1.1.1.war,WEB-INF/web.xml deployed to target WebSphere:cell=<host_name>Node02Cell,node=<host_name>Node02 server=server1" occurs when using IBM® Rational® Portfolio Manager. The error message comes from WebSphere Application Sever. 

SYMPTOM
WebSphere Application Server error message: ADMA0115W

CAUSE
The WebSphere Application Server error message occurs because the environment variable dbColumnName is reserved for future release, therefore, it is part of the environment variable mappings when deploying middleware.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, the WebSphere Application Server error message ADMA0115W should be ignored. The root cause of this error message does not pose a threat to the current Rational® Portfolio Manager installation, since the environment variable that is causing this error message is not actively used at this time.
