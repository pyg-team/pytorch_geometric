Title: IBM WTX/ITX map gives different results if the XML is formatted (pretty-printed) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) map to transform XML, the results may differ is the XML has been formatted using the Eclipse XML formatting function.



The Eclipse XML formatting function (Ctrl+Shift+F) will sometimes introduce TAB characters into data areas of the XML (between the XML tags). This can radically alter the behaviour of a map (using text comparison functions for example). 

SYMPTOM
Output of the map may be different when the input XML is formatted using Eclipse with the Ctrl+Shift+F shortcut


CAUSE
This is a problem in the Eclipse XML formatter

ENVIRONMENT
WTX/ITX Design Studio on the Windows Platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A review of the XML before and after formatting will show Data discrepancies

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use an alternative solution for formatting the XML if required.
