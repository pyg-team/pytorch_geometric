PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A variable provided in a User Defined Function call is not received within the function action. 

SYMPTOM
The User Defined Function call is of the style: 

 * 
 * 


and MyResultSet was acquired in a previous GetBy - for example: 

 * 


and this was proven to have received a result: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Any attempt to use that value in the User Defined Function will report a NULL style error if it is not able to handle a null value or just simply fail to produce the expected results. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Assigning the variable prior to the function call will ensure that the value is passed to the User Defined Function. Using the above example we can rewrite this as: 




 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


This is similar to the behaviour and work-around recorded in the TechNote "Unsolicited SQL updates from User Defined Function" [ link below], which was recorded as IZ67227: "UNSOLICITED SQL UPDATE STATEMENT PRODUCED BY FUNCTION CALL WHEN LOOPING THROUGH GETBY* RESULT SET" [ link below].
