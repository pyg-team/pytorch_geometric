APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Sometimes, when the database is created, a segment of type
   'CACHE' is created.
   
   It is owned by 'SYS' and resides in the system tablespace.
   It can been found by querying DBA_SEGMENTS or USER_SEGMENTS for
   a segment_type of 'CACHE' and has one extent allocated but
   MAX_EXTENTS = 0.
   
   So if a database has the segment with max_extents=0, it
   causes the divisor is equal to zero error to occur when Oracle
   Extended agent queries RDB_Segment_Allocation attribute group.
   
   Query attribute group 'RDB_Segment_Allocation'
   ORA-01476 divisor is equal to zero
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Need a database that has a 'CACHE' segment and max_extents=0
   2. Configure an instance to monitoring this database.
   3. Start the agent.
   4. Query attribute group 'RDB_Segment_Allocation'
   
   Related Files and Output:
   
   ORA-01476 divisor is equal to zero

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Some time , When the database is created, a segment of type
   'CACHE' is created.
   It is owned by 'SYS' and resides in the system tablespace.
    It can been found by querying DBA_SEGMENTS or USER_SEGMENTS for
   a
   segment_type of 'CACHE' and has one extent allocated but
   MAX_EXTENTS = 0.
   
   So If a database have the segment that it's max_extents=0, it
   was uncovered that the divisor is equal to zero
   when oracle extend agent queries RDB_Segment_Allocation
   attribute
   
   Query attribute group 'RDB_Segment_Allocation'
   ORA-01476 divisor is equal to zero

   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following
