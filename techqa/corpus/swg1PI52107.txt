APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When debugging a program in Rational Developer for System z
   (RDz), the Debugger Editor allows the user
   to search for strings within the program source. If the user
   specifies a search string that is preceded
   by or ends with a blank space, the blank space is stripped off
   on repeated searches.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the find text function in the debugger editor,
   highlighted text is trimmed of any whitespaces before being
   added to the find text dialog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Whitespace is no longer trimmed.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
   IBM Rational Developer for System z V9.1.1.3 Fix Pack which
