QUESTION
 Why do BIRT Base Services reports only work on certain Fire Fox browser versions and in certain circumstances? 

ANSWER
There are 2 types of silent printing as follows:
1. Direct Print (DP) - - Prints the report only.
2. Direct Print with Attachments (DPA) -- Prints the report and any attachments on the record.

Active X controls are only used in the 2nd type of silent printing - and only if the attachment is a Microsoft Office document (like .doc, .xls or ppt). 
Users can attach other files, so if you use a non-Microsoft file ,e.g .PDF or .JPG -- Active X controls are not used and so DPA can execute from a Firefox Browser .

Summarizing:

Direct Printing with Attachments (DPA) does not work in a Fire fox browser in the following conditions - 

a. If you are using Direct Printing with Attachments and your Attachments are Microsoft Documents

b. Also, only certain Fire Fox versions are a supported browser to be used with Maximo and Birt as shown here in the matrix :
