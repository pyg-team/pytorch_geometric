QUESTION
 How to use and configure the RPT playback proxy settings, when used with the Robotic Response Time RRT (T6) agent? 

CAUSE
The RRT TEMA RPT playback proxy info is not used alone "by default"

ANSWER
1. Record your script using RPT Workbench and specify the proxy settings in the recording.

2. The RRT T6 playback proxy settings only need to be set in the RRT T6 configuration if the proxy information or authentication needed to be used during script playback will differ from the one saved into the RPT script.

3. The RRT T6 playback proxy settings configured in the T6 agent will be used after the RPT playback engine determines that it was unable to reach the proxy agent, or that the username/password configured do not succeed in the authentication to the proxy server.

Limitation: The playback engine will fallback to the T6 configured proxy details or the realm authentication credentials when it fails to playback a script. However, this attempt is only executed once, so either the proxy details or the authentication credentials will be used, but not both at the same time.
