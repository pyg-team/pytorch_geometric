APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running a v8.4.0.x arsdd to create a Production Data
   Distribution image (PDD) against a v7.1.2.x OnDemand server
   where the application group in the v7.1.2.x OnDemand server is
   defined with no Cache throws the following error when running
   arsdd:
   
   <> 1217796095: 178: LOAD STARTED FILE
   [2002.3.0.F005ARCH.F005A133.ind]
   <> 1217796100: 057: LOAD FAILED FILE

   arsload: Unloading of data was NOT performed
   An unexpected error occurred. Contact your System Administrator
   and/or consult the System Log.  File=arsadmin.c, Line=1862
   
   If the OnDemand server was v8.4.0.x and arsdd was v7.1.2x, there
   would not be a problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround is to temporarily define Cache in the Application
   Group just for the arsdd processing. This setting can be changed
   back when arsdd is finished.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Release 8.4.1.0
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Release 8.4.1.0
