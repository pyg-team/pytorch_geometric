 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I search for a string which has reserved words or characters when searching in documents in Atlas? 

CAUSE
There are specific options to use in oracle when you search for certain strings

ANSWER
When there is a "-" in a string you are searching for, you need to use "\" in front of the "-" 

For example - "String1-String2" should be searched as "String1\-String2" 

Please refer to the oracle documentation for Special Characters in Oracle Text Queries
