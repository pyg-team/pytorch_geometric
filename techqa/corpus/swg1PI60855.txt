APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is doing a TAKEUP diectly from the MVS Logstream
   and attempting to generate their daily CICS Reports for each
   region with a single pass of the MVS LogStream.  This
   eliminates the need to run a Record Selection Extract
   Jobs to build a separate extract file for each region.  In order
   to accomplish this, all JCL Statements and related CICS PA
   PARMs have to be included in a single job.  With a large number
   of regions, and 4 reports per region, the job has become
   excessive in size, not just in the number of statements (over
   3,000), but in terms of memory usage, causing the job
   to abend with a S878-10 (SOS below the line).

   CPASUMMF (Summary Performance) is running a 24-bit version of
   the SORT interface, as well as allocating work and I/O buffers
   from 24-bit storage, resulting in a below the line storage
   shortage.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR provides below-the-line storage constraint relief by
   implementing the following changes:-
   1. External sorting for CPASUMMF will run above the bar.
   2. Most buffers requested by CPASUMMF will be in 31-bit storage.
   3. I/O buffers for CPASUMMF will be in 31-bit storage.
