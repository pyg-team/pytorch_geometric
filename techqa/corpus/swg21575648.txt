 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

ABSTRACT
 Use this document to track lifecycle support for IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance hardware and firmware. 

CONTENT
IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance continues to provide functionally rich technology to the marketplace through newer, more capable appliances. As appliances mature, they are eventually retired and no longer supported. To minimize the business impact of change to customers, the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance End of Support policy exists to assist you with your planning. 
An IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance offering is comprised of a specific hardware type or model and firmware. The appliance lifecycle consist of a firmware end-of-support (EOS) date that marks the end of standard support for firmware on the appliance and an end-of-life (EOL) date that marks the end of all support (hardware and firmware) for the appliance. 
The IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Firmware End of Support policy:


 * Provides a minimum of five years device product technical support, starting at the General Availability of the new appliance offering. 
 * Publishes a notice of the end of standard support for firmware on the appliance at least 12 months before the effective date. 
 * Might make firmware support extensions available, for an additional fee, beginning with the EOS date until the appliance EOL date. 


You can use the end-of-service dates for hardware generation machine types [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845] support page to track IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance firmware EOS and EOL dates so that you can effectively plan your hardware investment, without any interruption in support. 

Besides IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance offerings, there might be new firmware releases and fix packs that run on the appliances. The latest firmware releases provide you with quality firmware release upgrades as well as cumulative maintenance fixes that are easy to install. Update to the latest release or fix pack to proactively avoid problems that are already resolved. 

For individual firmware releases, IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance provides a minimum of 2 years of support for each firmware release beginning at the general availability (GA) of the release. IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance will continue to support the latest three levels of its firmware even if some of those firmware levels have aged more than 2 years. Releases of the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance firmware that are older than 2 years and are not within the three latest levels of firmware are subject to support withdrawal at any time. Customers will receive a 12-month notice of this withdrawal for planning purposes. Announced EOS dates for firmware releases are available on the software IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/] page. 

You can use the following table to determine the supported hardware for each release of a particular firmware level. Using the information in this table, you can ensure that you have the most recent and accurate firmware level for your hardware, without any interruption in support. For general availability (GA) firmware, that level of the firmware is superseded by the specified fix pack. 

Note: The type 7199 appliances can have one of two machine types depending on when they were ordered. Type 2426, listed in parentheses, is the machine type model (MTM) if the appliance is ordered from Passport Advantage.
