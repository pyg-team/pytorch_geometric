 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   Linux OS File existence Situation is not firing as expected
   when situation uses SUBSTR operator against FILE attribute like
   in the following example:
   
   (STR(File) == 1,'nc136237' AND Path == '/opt/IBM/ITM/logs/')
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use SCAN function instead of SUBSTR in situation
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Linux OS Agent file existance situation is not firing as
   expected when situation uses substr.

   situation uses SUBSTR operator against FILE attribute. Here is
   an example situation:
   (STR(File) == 1,'nc136237' AND Path == '/opt/IBM/ITM/logs/')
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to correctly manage the SUBSTR operator.
   
   The fix for this APAR is going to be included in the following
