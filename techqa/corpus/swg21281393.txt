Title: IBM Error: JVM terminated. Exit code=1, starting RPT (or any Eclipse-based product) - United States

Text:
RPT; JVM terminated. Exit code=1; JVM terminated; Exit code=1; destroyAll; 1281393 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve the error, JVM terminated. Exit code=1, that might occur when using IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT). 

CAUSE
The class cache persists beyond the lifetime of any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) connected to it. It is impossible for the JVM to corrupt the cache itself (for example if the JVM crashes), but if there is a blue screen or a power cut, it is possible for the cache to be corrupted. A JVM will refuse to connect to a corrupted cache.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, adding "destroyAll" to the Java option below will destroy all shared class caches on the system, but is a utility option, so it will not start the JVM. If you want to do this, simply run Java "-Xshareclasses:destroyAll" from a command-prompt. If you want to add an option to the Eclipse command line to make the JVM clean an existing cache before starting, add "expire=0" to the option: java -Xshareclasses:singleJVM,keep,expire=0. 




Note: Please see the JVM user guide or the DeveloperWorks article for more details on command-line options: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ibmjava4 [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ibmjava4/]. 

 

Deleting the cache file
Another option is to manually delete the cache file. IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) has chosen to use the default location for the cache file, which is C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Local Settings\Application Data\javasharedresources\. This is also documented in the JVM guides. Navigate to the directory and look for a file called C23D1A32_sharedoc_<username>_G01 and delete this file. 


A third option add the following line in the eclipse.ini file (If its missing):

-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true
