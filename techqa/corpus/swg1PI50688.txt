ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM), you are creating a test
   case (or using other "Create New" dialog) and you click in the
   Description field but you cannot enter any text because the
   mouse click is not recognized.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Prerequisite:  Use RQM with Google Chrome (Chrome) Browser
   1. Navigate to the Test Cases List View
   2. Click the "Create Test Case" icon
   3. Click on the "Description" field on the "New Test Case"
   window and start to enter any text, e.g. "This is the test case
   description".
   Result:  No text is entered because the mouse click done during
   step 3. is not recognized.
   
   To work around this issue:
   1. Click in the upper portion of the field text box.
   2. Use Tab to navigate away and back to the field.
   3. Use either Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer as
   the browser.
