ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: CSQ1,ABN=5C6-00C51039,U=SYSOPR  ,
   CSQESTE ,M=CSQGFRCV,LOC=CSQELPLM.CSQESTE
   .
   00C51039 = CSQE_Unexpected_Error_from_IxlUsync.
   00000C48 = IXLRSNCODESUBJCONNNOTDEFINED
                (IXL_RSN_CODE from REG3)
   .
   In CSQESTE, the sequence of routines is Process_PeerFailure ->
   Queue_Usync_Request -> Issue_ProxyResponse_Usync.
   .
   The abend happened during mass shutdown/re-start of all queue
   managers for time change IPLs. 10 queue managers in the Queue
   Sharing Group (QSG) stopped within 50 seconds. 8 started within
   a 10-second period, and the other 2 started 4 minutes later.
   .
   In a CPU constrained environment (as exists during an IPL
   sequence) the communication between the queue managers is slow.
   Requests are queued while others are busy waiting for responses
   from other queue managers.  Proxy responses can be issued and
   can fail because another queue manager has already issued the
   proxy response and the connector is then no longer defined. The
   problem is the ABEND when the proxy response fails.
   *
   *
   Because all members of the QSG were stopped at the same time,
   there was no surviving queue manager to handle the Peer Level
   Recovery (PLR) events at that time. The events remained queued
   in the CF until the queue managers started again.
   .
   It is preferable to leave one queue manager up to handle all the
   PLR requests, so that when the queue managers are re-started
   they will only have to do recovery for themselves. This will
   speed up the process rather than having every queue manager
   handle recovery for every other queue manager.

   Code exists in module csqeste in the Issue_ProxyResponse_Usync
   procedure to set rc=0 rsn=0 on receiving a reason code of
   IxlRsnCodeSubjConnNotDefined from the IXLUSYNC proxy call when
   ALL the following conditions exist :-
   1: we are currently in PLR Phase 1 for a Usync which occurred
   at connect time..
   2: A new Recover Peer Event occurred.
   3: The new event is an Existing Connection event.
   4: The current Event Sequence is the SAME as that in PLR Phase 1
   These conditions are too restrictive because the dump for THIS
   problem shows that the new event received while we were in PLR
   Phase 1 is from a DIFFERENT qmgr and has a different event
   sequence number.
   The QMGR that was the source of this event has clearly
   disconnected as the subject connector is no longer valid, so we
   should not abend on this condition.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module csqeste has been changed such that
   IxlRsnCodeSubjConnNotDefined will not cause an Abend when
   processing a proxy IXLUSYNC response for any Recover Peer Event.
