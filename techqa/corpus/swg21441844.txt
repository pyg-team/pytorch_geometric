QUESTION
 Image Services supports Oracle Database server 11g Release 2 (11gR2 or 11.2.0) 

CAUSE
Image Services, a 32-bit application, now supports Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11gR2 or 11.2.0) on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), AIX (64-bit), Solaris (64-bit), and HP-UX Itanium. The support for HP-UX PA-RISC (64-bit) is only available on Image Services 4.1.2. Image Services 4.2.0 does no longer support HP-UX PA-RISC.
The supported editions are Oracle Client, Enterprise, and Standard on version 11.2.0.1.0 and its patchsets. 

Oracle does not support 32-bit Oracle Database server on Windows x64. For Image Services support of a local Oracle database on Windows 64-bit server, refer to Technote #1397958 for the specific procedure. 

For Oracle database remote to the Image Services server, Oracle Client 32-bit (NOT the Instant Client) is required to be installed on the Image Services server. 

The main difference between this Oracle release and the previous ones are that the 32-bit library $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 is not released with the database server on all UNIX platforms. Therefore, if Oracle database is collocated with Image Services server: Image Services requires the same version of Oracle Instant Client Package - Basic 32-bit to be installed in $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 directory. The 64-bit Oracle Instant Client is not supported. Oracle Instant Client is released as a separate package downloadable from the Oracle website. 



ANSWER
On all UNIX platforms if Oracle database is collocated with Image Services server, Oracle Instant Client Package - Basic 32-bit is required:



 1. Download Oracle Instant Client for the specific platform (32-bit). Image Services requires Instant Client Package - Basic.
    
    
 2. After Instant Client Package - Basic (32-bit) for Version 11.2.0 is downloaded, unzip the package into $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 as the Oracle user or the user who installed Oracle 11gR2 software, where $ORACLE_HOME is the path Oracle 11gR2 software installed.
    
    
 3. For Solaris and HP-UX platforms, make a soft link to $ORACLE_HOME/lib32/libclntsh.so.11.1:  1. cd $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 
     2. ln -s libclntsh.so.11.1 libclntsh.so
        
        
    
    

It is important to run fn_setup_rdb -f (for fresh installations) or fn_setup_rdb -u (for upgrades) after the Oracle database is setup/upgraded. 

It is also important to update .profile or .cshrc to reflect the new ORACLE_HOME for Image Services users on UNIX platforms.
