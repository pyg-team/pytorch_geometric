KMC MC Application Support App TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SDA maintenance was applied to both OMEGAMON XE for Messaging, WebSphere MQ (MQ) and MC. But after application, the application support for MC was not there. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere MQ Configurator (MC) does not support SDA. Installation of the MC application support is required to support the MQ Configurator product at the TEMS, TEPS and desktop client from the install image.
