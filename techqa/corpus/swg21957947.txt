QUESTION
 What is the policy for requesting critical fixes in IBM Cúram Social Program Management and IBM Smarter Care? 

ANSWER
A fix for an acknowledged defect can be requested to address a critical customer issue where, due to project deadlines, it is not possible to wait for the next scheduled Fix Pack. 

Supporting Information Required:
Before a release could be considered the following information should be provided to IBM Support:


 * Version of Cúram the fix is being requested on 
 * Detailed business impact of the issue in question 
 * Is this a production issue? 
 * Is the fix available on a later version of the product? If so, please refer to the IBM Smarter Care and Social Programs Policy for Backporting Fixes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697853] 
 * Does the project have a workaround for the issue? If so, details of the workaround should be provided 
 * Why is an immediate solution required? 
 * Information regarding why the project cannot wait for this to be addressed in a Fixpack release 
 * Project timelines  *  Development phase complete date User Acceptance Testing start and complete dates System Testing start and complete dates Production Roll-out date 
   
   

Criteria to be met: 

 * No viable work around is available 
 * Critical business impact 
 * Must be a Severity 1 or Severity 2 issue  *  Severity 3 or Severity 4 PMRs do not constitute a critical business impact 
   
   
 *  Immediate solution required



Declined request: 
If the above Criteria are not met, the expectation should be that your request will be declined and you will receive a PMR update similar to that below: 

“A fix will not be provided as it does not meet the criteria per the IBM Smarter Care and Social Programs Policy for interim fixes. It is not considered a critical business impact. It will be addressed in a future Fix Pack” 


Accepted request: 
If the above Criteria are met, then we will require the customer to agree to the following: 

The fix can be provided on the customer's version <X> provided that the project provide an update on the PMR containing the following information: 

Acceptance that fixes provided in a test fix undergo limited testing. The project accepts the risk of putting it into production and to mitigate this should move to a fully supported version of IBM Cúram at the earliest opportunity
