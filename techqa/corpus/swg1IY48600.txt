ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Access Manager 4.1 FP02
   IBM Directory Server 4.1
   When a user is deactivated by pdacld due to failed login
   attempts (via an application using the Java API), and the user
   is reactivated using pdadmin user modify account-valid yes,
   pdacld maintains the deactivated state of the account,
   preventing the user from logging in.  The user can log in via a
   separate WebSEAL server, confirming that the account has been
   enabled.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See problem description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following was added to the 4.1-TAM-FP07.README:
   
   7.24 Use of pdacld as an authentication enforcement server
        (IY48600)
   
   In typical configurations, the Authorization Server
   (pdacld) is used to proxy authentication and authorization
   requests for the Java Authorization APIs.   In addition it
   is used to proxy authorization requests for remote mode AZN
   applications.  In instances where pdacld is used to enforce
   login policy during user authentication, the pdacld server
   needs to be enhanced with additional privileges.  By
   default, the pdacld server is unable to update user login
   policy state information in the registry.  To correctly
   enforce login policy, the pdacld server should be added to
   the securitygroup using the "group modify" pdadmin
   command, Ex:
   
   pdadmin> group modify securitygroup add ivacld/<machine_name>
   
   The server name is located in the ivacld.conf file.
