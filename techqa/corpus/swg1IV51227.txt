APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Nessus scan imports fail and report an error message that a
   handshake error occurred, which prevents the scan data from
   being imported properly.
   
   This issue is due to the configured ciphers within the scanner
   module when making the connection to the remote Nessus host
   after an upgrade to Nessus V5.2.2 or V5.2.3.
   
   Administrators that use Nessus V5.2.2 or V5.2.3 can verify
   /var/log/qradar.log for the following error message:
   
   vis.scanners.nessus.NessusXmlRpcConnector: [ERROR] [IP
   address/- -] [-/- -]Error Connecting to URL [URL]::
   Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert:
   handshake_failure

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Nessus scan imports fail and report an error message that a
   handshake error occurred, which prevents the scan data from
   being imported properly.
   
   This issue is due to the configured ciphers within the scanner
   module when making the connection to the remote Nessus host
   after an upgrade to Nessus V5.2.2 or V5.2.3.
   
   Administrators that use Nessus V5.2.2 or V5.2.3 can verify
   /var/log/qradar.log for the following error message:
   
   vis.scanners.nessus.NessusXmlRpcConnector: [ERROR] [IP
   address/- -] [-/- -]Error Connecting to URL [URL]::

       at com.ibm.jsse2.j.a(j.java:9)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A Scanner RPM update was released that resolves an issue to
   properly set the requested SSL context to TLS instead of SSL.
   This update ensures that the scanner supports both SSL and TLS
   scan imports.
