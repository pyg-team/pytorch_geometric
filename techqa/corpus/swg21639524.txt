mdmrnv110 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Clicking Refresh on the Set Hierarchies view fails to reload the Hierarchy data. 

SYMPTOM
When viewing a set hierarchy, clicking Refresh causes the hierarchy to disappear. The hierarchy can be reloaded by navigating to another set and then returning. Other operations that would cause a refresh (such as moving nodes in a hierarchy) do not cause this problem.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The hierarchy can be reloaded by navigating to another set and then returning.
