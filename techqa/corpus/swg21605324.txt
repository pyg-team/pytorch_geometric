PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TCR is installed on a 64bit Linux server, Framework Manager installed on a 32bit Windows machine.
Framework Manager fails to connect to TCR even if the configuration seems to be correct. 

SYMPTOM
Framework Manager returns error message:
[ ERROR ] CAM-CRP-1132 An error occurred while attempting to request a certificate from the Certificate Authority service. Unable to connect to the Certificate Authority service. Ensure that the Content Manager computer is configured and that the Cognos 8 services on it are currently running. The HTTP result code '401' was returned from the server.


CAUSE
If Framework Manager is installed on a 32 bit Windows machine, it requires the installation of the Cognos Modeling Fix (FIPS) package only if it is expected to connect a 32 bit TCR. 

If Framework Manager is used with a 64bit TCR, FIPS is not needed.
If you installed FIPS on the Framework Manager, error CAM-CRP-1132 can occur if connecting a 64 bit TCR environment.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you need to use Framework Manager with a 64bit TCR and you have already installed FIPS, proceed as follow :
1) perform a full uninstall of the Framework Manager from the Windows machine
2) reinstall Framework Manager from scratch
3) DO NOT INSTALL Cognos Modeling Fix (FIPS) package
4) verify that Framework Manager is now able to talk with TCR as expected.
