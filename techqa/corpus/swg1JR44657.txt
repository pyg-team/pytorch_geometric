APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  USER AFFECTED:
   ==> IID users trying to use EJB Import Bindings
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   ==> User has session beans whose interfaces inherit from
   EJBObject, but not directly (there are subinterfaces in the
   middle). In this case, the user tries to add the java interface
   to an Assembly Diagram import, and tries to create an EJB
   Binding (with java interface). However, the resulting dialog
   does not let the user select the interface, as IID
   currently only checks immediate parents of the interface to see
   if its a valid EJB interface
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable to create EJB import binding if EJB java Interfaces does
   not inherit directly from the appropriate EJBObjects
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   IID users trying to use EJB Import Bindings
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   User has session beans whose interfaces inherit from EJBObject,
   but not directly (there are subinterfaces in the middle). In
   this case, the user tries to
   add the java interface to an Assembly Diagram import, and tries
   to create an EJB Binding (with java interface). However, the
   resulting dialog does not let the user select the interface, as
   IID currently only checks immediate parents of the interface to
   see if its a valid EJB interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix validates an EJB interface based on its ancestor
   interfaces, rather than just the immediate parents.
