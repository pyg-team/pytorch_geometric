ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity: 4
   Approver: GDC
   Compid: 5724C040U
   Release: 6.2.3
   Abstract: clarify how Unix OS Agent supports WPAR
   Environment: The Monitoring Agent for Unix OS 6.2.3
   
   Problem Description: ITM Unix OS Agent User's Guide contains the
   following info about WPAR support:
   
    "Ability to remotely deploy application agents that support
     workload partitioning (WPAR) environments. To use this
     capability, install the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS on
     all the WPARs that will be targets of remote deployment
     operations. Then run the tacmd addsystem command,
     specifying as the node the WPAR managed system."
   
   This test needs to be changed in order to clarify that OS Agent
   is supported on WPAR just to use the remote deploy functionality
   and it cannot be used to collect metrics.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install Unix OS agent on the LPAR to collect metrics for WPAR
   instances running under the LPAR.
