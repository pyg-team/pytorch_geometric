ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Title:  Anywhere Logs lost when application crashes
   
   Problem Details:
   
   An actual Windows tablet device is needed for to reproduce
   reported issue.
   
   Mobile application logs/traces are lost when the application
   hangs or
   crashes. This make almost impossible to troubleshoot problems in
   test/production environments.
   
   
   If an unexpected crashed/hangs of Work Execution app occurs on
   Windows 8.1
   tablet, then this problem does not allow us to send logs to IBM
   support.
   
   
   Expected behaviour:
   
   There should be a way to retrieve the logs if the application
   hangs or fails
   
   Actual behaviour:
   
   Logs are lost
   
   Steps to replicate:
   
   
   1. Login to WorkExecution application on Windows device
   2. Open Settings > Advanced Settings >Logging > Enable logging
   3. Go back to the work list screen and take some actions
   4. Traces are logged and can be seen from Settings > Advanced
   Settings
   >Logging
   
   5. Kill the WorkExecution app using Windows Task Manager (this
   is to
   reproduce a hang or crash of the app)
   6. Login to WorkExecution app
   7. Open Settings > Advanced Settings >Logging
   8. Old traces are no longer available so there is no way to
   troubleshoot the issue

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All Windows Tablet users.  Any Android or iOS users trying   *
   * to use the Logging panel of our application to debug         *
   * application crashes.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * On Windows, unlike Android and iOS, there are no persistent  *
   * logs created by running apps.  This means that customers are *
   * forced to use the built-in Logging panel of our application  *
   * to collect and email logs out after issues are being         *
   * experienced by the device.  This logging panel was not built *
   * to be persistent across application restarts.  This fix      *
   * makes these log entries persistent, so that if the           *
   * application crashes, when you restart it and go to the       *
   * logging panel, you can retrieve the logs from before the     *
   * crash.                                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to the latest iFix to receive this persistent        *
   * logging or to our latest release after 7.6                   *
