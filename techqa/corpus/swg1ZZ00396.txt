APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Per the Openstack specification, the user_data field of a
   Heat template can contain script code.
   Allowable headers are "#!" for bash, "rem cmd" for batch, and
   "#ps1" or "#ps1_systnative" for Powershell, Powershell 64,
   respectively.
   
   If you create a stack for a Windows node with a header for a
   Powershell script in user_data, it will work (execute the
   script
   code) if you submit it from the command line, but not when you
   do so through the BPM GUI, because ICO removes comment lines,
   except the one for bash scripts.
   
   Therefore, need to o update Yaml parser to not remove "#ps1"
   or "#ps1_systnative" for  Powershell, Powershell
   64,respectively, as that comment line tells HEAT what execution
   context to use.
   
   ENVIRONMENT:  ICO 2.4.0.1 with VmWare hypervisor

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Per the Openstack specification, the user_data field of a
   Heat template can contain script code.
   Allowable headers are "#!" for bash, "rem cmd" for batch, and
   "#ps1" or "#ps1_systnative" for Powershell, Powershell 64,
   respectively.
   
   If you create a stack for a Windows node with a header for a

   ENVIRONMENT:  ICO 2.4.0.1 with VmWare hypervisor
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  updated Yamlparser.js file in 70_SCOrchestrator_Heat_Support_Too
   lkit_2402_20150813.twx, to not remove "#ps1"
   or "#ps1_systnative" for Powershell or Powershell
   64 respectively, as that comment line tells HEAT what execution
   context to use.
