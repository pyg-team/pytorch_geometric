APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When viewing email from Workplace XT using the IBM Content
   Collector Document Viewer, the request sometimes fails.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Replace name of the object name with the GUID of the object
   store in the URL . Manually replace the p8ObjectStoreName value
   with the GUID of the object store.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you use the Document Viewer in Workplace XT and the viewer is
   configured to work with the Content Collector configuration
   database, the object store name that is given in the viewing
   request sometimes cannot be properly resolved. In this case, the
   viewing request uses the default repository connection that is
   specified in the Content Collector Web Application
   configuration.
   If the document cannot be found in that object store, an error
   is returned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 2.2.0.3 LA007 and
   IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 2, the object store
   names are properly resolved and the Document Viewer can work
   with different object stores provided they are registered with
   the primary IBM eDiscovery Manager repository, are all on the
   same machine, and use the same credentials.
