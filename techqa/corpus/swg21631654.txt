PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the run of MQ Series CSQUMGMB utility according to the WBIFN PIC (Appendix K. Migrating to WebSphere Message Broker V7.0), the following MQ error could occur:

"CSQU638E CSQUMGMB UNABLE TO MAKE SUBSCRIPTION REASON=2085" WHEN USING CSQUMGMB UTILITY 

ENVIRONMENT
z/OS

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is caused by MQ APAR PM84933. Please apply the MQ Series PTF for this APAR (UK94297 for MQ 7.01 or UK94298 for MQ 7.1)


Possible workaround:
-------------------------------- 

First de-register your event subscriptions and after the migration to Broker V7 create your subscriptions again.

For example, if with Broker 6 you registered to monitor all events of OU SYSOU by sending it to subscription queue prefix.DNI_N_EVENT
(reg -sq prefix.DNI_N_EVENT -ou SYSOU), de-register your event subscription 
(dreg -sq prefix.DNI_N_EVENT)
and after the migration to Broker V7 re-create your subscription 
(reg -sq prefix.DNI_N_EVENT -ou SYSOU).
