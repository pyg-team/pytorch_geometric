Text:
edit; widget; web gui TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After migrating data from an earlier version, one or more Web GUI widgets are missing the Edit option from the right-click Edit menu. How can I fix this? 

SYMPTOM
After initial installation of 8.1, all Web GUI widgets are fully editable. After migration of data from an earlier version, however, the Edit option disappears from the right click menu in Edit mode for one or more widgets. Web GUI widgets include widgets such as the Active Event List, Event Viewer, Event Dashboard and Inline Frame widget. 


CAUSE
The import of data from an earlier version has overwritten certain associations between roles and Web GUI portlets (widgets)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Firstly, ensure that your user is assigned the ncw_admin role.


Secondly, if the problem persists, open the widget via the Widgets page and run through the configuration wizard. Ensure that the wizard reports the ncw_admin role assigned to the widget with Editor privileges. 

Thirdly, if the problem still persists, 

- backup and edit <JazzSM>\profile\config\cells\JazzSMNode01Cell\applications\isc.ear\deployments\isc\isclite.war\WEB-INF\portletEntities.xml 

- locate the relevant definition for the widget that you are checking. For example, the Inline Frame widgets will have this:
uniqueName="item.portletDef.IFramePortlet"
- find the section below this relating to access-control
- ensure that the ncw_admin role is listed with Editor privileges
<portletentities:access-control application-role="ncw_admin" deploy-time="true" role-type="Editor"/>
