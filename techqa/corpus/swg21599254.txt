PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to execute the second test case in a test suite from IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) results in a Rational Robot crash. 

SYMPTOM
When the second test case in a test suite is executed from IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Robot stops working or crashes. 

Steps to Reproduce:


 1. Create a new Test Suite Execution Record which contains multiple test cases to run Robot script 
 2. Execute the test case from RQM 
    

Expected result: All test cases run successfully 

Actual result: Robot crashes/stops working when the second test case is run CAUSE
After each script execution, log is displayed. 


In case the log file already exists, a dialog box pops up to prompt you to accept the new log file to overwrite it; however, when the text case executed from RQM, you can not enter anything in this dialog box and it causes a hang or crash.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply the following steps to execute Rational Robot scripts through Rational Quality Manager:


 1. Select Tools > GUI Playback Options from the Rational Robot menu
    
    
 2. Click the Log tab
    
    
 3. Clear the Prompt before overwrite log checkbox
