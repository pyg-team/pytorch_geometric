APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. create content "ContentTest", publish it, and create a draft
   copy of
   it(click create draft button).
   
   2. Do a syndication, so both syndicator and subscriber have
   those draft
   and published content.
   
   3. Update the draft one(change the name) on syndicator, then
   published
   it. (So on syndicator, draft gone, published content get
   updated).
   
   4. Do a syndication, on subscriber, the draft one gone, but
   somehow the
   published one didn't get updated(still the previous name, and
   the lock
   mark didn't get removed).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The last modify date will be updated once the cancel the draft
   action done on the subsciber, which will prevent the publish
   content get updated because the last modify date is newer than
   the one on syndicator.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Reset the last modify date to the one before cancel draft in
   order to match the date of publish content on the syndicator.
