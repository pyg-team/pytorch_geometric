ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to Manage Policy Set attachment for a JAX-WS client
   whose project type is 'Java' will fail, as the option may be
   unavailable depending upon your runtime target.
   
   Problem:
   
   In some cases, you may experience an issue where you have JAX-WS
   client defined in your workspace, whose project type is Java,
   but you are unable to 'Manage Policy Set Attachments' for the
   client.  This can occur when the intended runtime target for
   your JAX-WS client is 'WebSphere v8.5'
   
   To reproduce:
   --------------
   (1) Create a new Java project
   (2) Select 'File ? New ? Other...' from the menu bar
   (3) In the 'New...' wizard, select 'Web Services ? Web Service
   Client'; click 'Next'
   (4) On the 'Web Services' page, specify the following:
   (4.1) In the 'Service Definition' field, specify a WSDL file
   (4.2) Under 'Configuration', ensure the Server runtime is
   'WebSphere Application Server v8.5'
   (4.3) Still under 'Configuration', ensure the Web service
   runtime type is 'IBM WebSphere JAX-WS'
   (4.4) Again, under 'Configuration', click the Client project
   link and select the Java project you created in step 1 above;
   accept all other defaults and click 'Finish'
   (5) Once the wizard is complete, expand your Web service client
   (Java) project's 'Services ? Clients' node, right-click on the
   Web service client.  Note several options appear in the context
   menu, but the 'Manage Policy Set Attachments' option does not
   appear
   
   This is caused by a bug in the code logic of whether or not to
   display the 'Manage Policy Set Attachment' option; this would
   only occur in the case of targeting a Java project (i.e. non-Web
   project) against WAS v8.5.
   
   Local fix:
   
   There is no known workaround at this time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In some cases, you may experience an issue where you have
   JAX-WS client defined in your workspace, whose project type is
   Java, but you are unable to "Manage Policy Set Attachments" for
   the client.  This can occur when the intended runtime target
   for your JAX-WS client is "WebSphere v8.5"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The 'Manage Policy Set Attachments' action should appear now.
   The fix for this APAR is included in Rational Application
   Developer v8.5.5.
