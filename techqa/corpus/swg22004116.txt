Title: IBM No software is discovered on UNIX systems with multiple mount points of root file system - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On some Linux or Unix operating systems LMT/BFI fails to discover any software despite successfully performing software scan. The problem occurs only with "Enable cache optimization" feature. Problem does not occur on Windows systems. 

SYMPTOM
"Initiate Software Scan" action results in empty scan files (no software discovered). LMT/BFI might not report any software discovery for given endpoint despite successful scan but only with cache optimization enabled and not on Windows operating system.


CAUSE
CIT APAR IV96406

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
No software discovered on an Unix/Linux endpoint in recent version of BFI/LMT (9.2.6 and upwards) or a major drop in discovery after manually applying scanner cache optimization.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to overcome this issue one must either upgrade to version 2.8.0.4000 release of CIT scanner, which will be available in LMT/BFI 9.2.8, or disable scan optimization feature using Configure Scan Cache fixlet. 




In order to do so follow the "Optimize the scanner cache" steps from product documentation 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JFY_9.2.0/com.ibm.lmt.doc/Inventory/planinconf/t_scanner_cache.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JFY_9.2.0/com.ibm.lmt.doc/Inventory/planinconf/t_scanner_cache.html] 

please uncheck the "Enable cache optimization" before applying the fixlet.

Outputs from subsequent scans will now contain entries about discovered components and discovered software will be reported by LMT/BFI after data import.
