ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Process Designer, it takes between 15 and 30 seconds to
   load the page when you try to debug a process or project or run
   a graphic user interface (coach view or human task) because IBM
   Business Process Manager (BPM) is retrieving all the favorites
   in the lsw_favorite table. IBM BPM searches all favorites that
   this user is eligible for.  For each favorite, IBM BPM must
   expand the objects stored in the favorite table.

   The following parameter introduced in interim fix JR52126 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52126]
   triggers the processing that causes the slow performance. The
   setting is "true" for this configuration parameter:
   
   <enforce-correct-service-type-for-execute-service-by-name>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Interim fix JR52126 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52126] uses a database query that is functionally
   correct but rather inefficient and, so, causes the performance
   issue.

 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.5 and in a IBM BPM V8.5.6
   cumulative fix.
