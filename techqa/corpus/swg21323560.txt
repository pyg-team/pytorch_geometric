QUESTION
 How do I specify the return of a triggered operation with Java? 

ANSWER


In Rhapsody in J, the reply of a triggered operation is specified with an assignment to params.om_reply. For example: For a triggered operation trg1 that returns a string, the statechart transition label would look like: trg1/params.om_reply = "Hello"; Calling trg1() will return "Hello" so System.out.println(myObj.trg1()); would print "Hello". 307 AnswerProduct versionPartner ContentInternal ContentCategoryReference ID
