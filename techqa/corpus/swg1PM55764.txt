ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  9.5.2 FP1??run into problems.  When a cell is highlighted and
   the user uses ctrl+c to copy and ctrl+v to paste, it only copies
   the portion of the value that is visible.  So when the new value
   is then double-clicked into for  ?editing, the user can update
   only a portion of the whole value.          ?Furthermore, the
   now truncated value gets passed into the process and set to the
   attribute (attribute in this case, but same when used as any
   variable in a TI).     ??
                                     ?A couple things about the old
   value cell:                                 ?- It is set to wrap
   text due to user-defined width and height   ?limitations of the
   TM1Web cells.                                          ?- In the
   video, I made sure the test value was longer than the length of
   the column so it would wrap.
         ?- We have two workarounds that we have told our users to
   use until we have a fix: ??1) double-click into the new value
   cell before ctrl+v. ?2) widening the new value column before
   ctrl+c will copy the whole value in.
