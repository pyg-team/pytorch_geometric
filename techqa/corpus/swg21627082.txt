 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is SHA-2 hashing algorithm in signing supported by IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS, Unix, Windows, i5/OS, HP NonStop and OpenVMS? 

CAUSE
SHA-2 is a set of cryptographic hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) designed by the National Security Agency (NSA).

Before z/OS V1R12, when using RACF to generate a CSR (issuing the RACDCERT GENCERT), the hashing algorithm signed the certificate by an RSA key and was always SHA1. Starting in z/OS V1R12, the hashing algorithm relies on the size of the RSA signing key:
- less than 2048 bits, SHA1 is used 
- greater than or equal to 2048 bits, SHA256 is used
