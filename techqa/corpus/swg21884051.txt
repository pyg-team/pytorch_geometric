Title: IBM Lookup values breaking in multiple lines - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may experience a scenario in Maximo, where you will see the values from the lookups breaking in multiple lines 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In Maximo, you will see the values from the lookups breaking in multiple lines even if the lookup column length has enough space or room for the full value, as you can see in the screenshot below : 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21884051&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21884051&aid=1]


In order to have any of the lookup fields with an increased length and with the value not having any line breaks, please do the following :

1. Configure Maximo not to wrap the text to be displayed.

You can set the webclient.wraplength property value to be wider, so more text appears in the field before truncating.

In the System Properties application select the webclient.wraplength property and set to your desired length say 100.

Then Save and Select the property checkbox and select Live Refresh from the toolbar. 

There is also a property to turn off the wrap functionality, webclient.wrapreadonlycolumns= false

NOTE : Restart your Maximo application server after that change.


2. In Application Designer, export your LOOKUPS.XML file and search for the line corresponding to your lookup and find the attribute line that you would like Maximo not to line break. (in this case, you can search for the Description attribute from the Assets lookup)

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21884051&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21884051&aid=2]

Make a backup of your LOOKUPS.xml file, then edit it by adding this to the end of the line : usefieldsizegroup="false" width="500"

The original line looks like this :
<tablecol dataattribute="description" id="asset_lookup_tablebody_col_2" mxevent="selectrecord" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" sortable="true" type="link"/>

You will change it to :
<tablecol dataattribute="description" id="asset_lookup_tablebody_col_2" mxevent="selectrecord" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" sortable="true" type="link" usefieldsizegroup="false" width="500"/>


Import the modified LOOKUPS.XML back to Application Designer.

After that, your lookup should now display all the data in one line and not break lines.
