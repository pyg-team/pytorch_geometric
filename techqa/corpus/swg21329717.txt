PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 region abends with an 0C4 / AKEA at offset X'11AC' in module DFHPIPM. This is followed by a severe error code X'0607' in module DFHPIIW. 

SYMPTOM
DFHPI0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhpi/dfhg4_dfhpi.html] An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'11AC' in module DFHPIPM.
DFHPI0002 A severe error (code X'0607') has occurred in module DFHPIIW.

CAUSE
Mixed maintenance levels between PI and XM modules.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can format out the dump of the 0C4 and look in the KE domain for the task that received the error. The failing instruction should be a 5020700C which is a store operation. CICS is trying to store the contents of Register 2 into Register 7 +C.


You can also look at the LD domain to check the level of maintenance you have on DFHPI modules and DFHXM. In particular, DFHXMTA and DFHXMAT. In this case, APAR PK56777 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK56777] ships changes to the PI domain modules as well as several XM modules, including the ones previously mentioned. If they do not have the correct level of maintenance applied to all modules, this would cause the problem you are experiencing


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure you have the right levels of maintenance applied. In this case, make sure that everything (all modules) changed by PTF UK33821 for APAR PK56777 has the correct maintenance.
