 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Using the Advanced Job Scheduler, how can a job be scheduled to run the first day of each month regardless of the day of the week? 

ANSWER
The schedule code for the job can be set to *DAY. Then, the first parameter value for Day of the month can be set to 01. The user can make the change to an existing job by selecting Option 2 to change the required job on a Work with Jobs screen produced by using the Work with Jobs JS (WRKJOBJS) command.
Using IBM i Navigator, you should do the following:

1. In IBM i Navigator, select Work Management 'Advanced Job Scheduler' Scheduled Jobs.
2. Right-click the job and select Properties.
3. Select Schedule tab.
4. Select Monthly from within Dates to run.
5. Select a month that has at least the first day of the month available. Days that are not available are shown as dark gray.
6. Select the day one of the month. This will cause the day to become green.
7. Select Specified days of each month under Details from within Dates to run.
8. Click OK when finished.
