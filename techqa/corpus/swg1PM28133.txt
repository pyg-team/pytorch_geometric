ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   *********
   
   Crash when performing custom model checks.
   
   Description:
   **********
   
   The attached model contains a profile called
   MBDA_Model_Checks_Profile that has a corresponding
   MBDA_Model_Checks_Profile.hep file. This is used to provide a
   plug-in to perform company specific model checks. This is a
   major problem because they are preventing the deployment of
   these model checks on a safety related model where the software
   development process demands that we employ model checks.
   
   Please refer to the attached document(Issue2.doc)

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Attached new code.
   Please understan the code.
   I am using now the orginal code and added check if the a
   list member points to deleted object (using the try catch).
   If you have problems in the check functionallity, please
   debug it. See ?Rhapsody?\Samples\ExtensibilitySamples\Simple
   Plug-in\How to create a plug-in.rtf about debugging plugins.
