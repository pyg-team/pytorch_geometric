ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Executing the addbundles command to install the Windows Itanium
   (WIA64) OS Agent package into the TEMS Depot will overwrite
   existing the Windows 32-Bit(WINNT) UE package contents.  After
   this overwrite has occurred, distributing the UE package to a
   Windows 32-Bit (WINNT) endpoint will result in an installation
   failure of the UE Component. The failure message that appears
   in the installation states that "the platform is not WIA64".
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   1. Install ITM 622 FP9 Windows TEMS
   2. Install ITM 622 FP9 OS Agent on Windows 2008 R2
   3. Execute addbundles -i <cd-image>/WINDOWS/Depot -t NT
   4. Execute addbundles -i <cd-image>/WIA64/Depot -t UE
   5. Execute addsystem -n endpoint:NT -t UE
   
   Observe timeout waiting for installation of UE to occur and
   failure message appearing in last line of installation log file
   on endpoint.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Two files are available from IBM Support for download:
   
   
   06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.zip
   
   06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.tar
   
   
   These are the step to follow.
   
   1. Since the current TEMS Depot has a WIA64 UE  Package which
      has overwritten the WINNT UE package, you will need to run
      the addbundles command again with the WINNT package to
      restore the WINNT UE package in the depot.
   
   tacmd addbundles -i /06.22.04.00_media/WINDOWS/Deploy -t UE
   
   2. Once the WINNT UE package is restored from your CD-Image into
      the TEMS Depot by (1) above, you will need to add the
      06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE package to the TEMS Depot.  This package
      will add the 06.22.04.00 WIA64 UE package to the TEMS Depot
      in the WIA64, not WINNT, directory.
   
     a. Uncompress the file downloaded from EcuRep into a temporary
        directory
   
       (Unix/Linux TEMS)
   
        tar -xvf  06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.tar
   
       (Windows TEMS)
   
        unzip 06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.zip
   
     b. Add the uncompressed package to the TEMS Depot.
   
        tacmd addbundles -i <temporary>/WIA64/Deploy
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions (UE)
   Descriptor file (KNTWIA64.dsc) was generated specifically for
   the Windows Itanium (WIA64) architecture. Rather the Windows
   OS Agent 32-Bit package (KNTWINNT.dsc) Descriptor file  was
   shipped for the
   WIA64 architecture. So when the user attempts to install
   the Windows OS Agent package on a Windows Itanium plaform,
   the installation fails.
   
   In the 06.23.00.00 Release of IBM Tivoli Monitoring, a separate
   Descriptor file
   was created for the WIA64 architecture. In doing so, the WINNT
   architecture binaries no longer overwrite the WIA64 binaries in
   in the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server Depot.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Two files are available from IBM Support for download:
   
   
   06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.zip
   
   06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.tar
   
   
   These are the step to follow.
   
   1. Since the current Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
   Depot has the WIA64 UE Package installed, it has already
   overwritten the WINNT UE package in the Depot. You will need
   to run the addbundles command again with the WINNT package to
   restore the WINNT UE package in the depot.
   
   tacmd addbundles -i /06.22.04.00_media/WINDOWS/Deploy -t UE
   
   2. Once the WINNT UE package is restored from your CD-Image into
   the TEMS Depot by (1) above, you will need to add the
   06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE package to the TEMS Depot.  This package
   will add the 06.22.04.00 WIA64 UE package to the TEMS Depot
   in the WIA64, not WINNT, directory.
   
   a. Uncompress the file downloaded from EcuRep into a temporary
   directory
   
   (Unix/Linux TEMS)
   
   tar -xvf  06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.tar
   
   (Windows TEMS)
   
   unzip 06.22.04.00_WIA64_UE.zip
   
   b. Add the uncompressed package to the TEMS Depot.
   
   tacmd addbundles -i <temporary>/WIA64/Deploy
