LINUX RHEL7 OMEGAMON z/VM agent TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing the OMEGAMON XE on z/VM and Linux agent on a RHEL 7 system you will encounter the following error:

Select one of the following:

1) Install products to the local host.
2) Install products to depot for remote deployment (requires TEMS).
3) Install TEMS support for remote seeding
4) Exit install.

Please enter a valid number: 1

Initializing ...
install.sh failure: KCI1138E could not determine the machine's architecture.

To circumvent this problem enter the following command prior to installation:

setarch $(uname -m) --uname-2.6

This will place you in a 2.6 version shell which will allow you to complete the installation. When you have completed the installation enter "exit" to leave the shell.

When you start the agent you will need to be in the 2.6 shell. Once again enter:

setarch $(uname -m) --uname-2.6

before starting the agent. 


CAUSE
RHEL7's architecture level is not recognized by ITM and OMEGAMON
