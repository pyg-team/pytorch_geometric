Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you test only the manually explored pages with IBM Security AppScan Standard or IBM Security AppScan Enterprise? 

CAUSE
When running a scan with manually explored pages, by default, AppScan performs automatic exploration (which may add new pages) before the pages are tested. 

ANSWER
To test only the manually added pages, perform as follows: 

In AppScan Standard: 

Start the scan with Scan > Test Only.

In AppScan Enterprise: 

If the scan is created from an AppScan Enterprise native template, select Explore Options > Specified URLs limit ... No spidering in Job Configuration, and then run the scan.

If the scan is created from an AppScan Standard template, or it is transferred from AppScan Standard, open the scan configuration in ADAC (AppScan Dynamic Analysis Client) and select Job Properties > Test Only. Then save it, and run the scan.
