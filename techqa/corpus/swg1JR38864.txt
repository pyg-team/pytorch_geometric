APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS USER ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Setting up MS Active directory for authenticating users through
   LDAP using simple bind, the following tests are performed
   
   LDAP Account valid, password valid, in role. - Allows log in.
   LDAP Account valid, blank password, in role. - Allows log in
   LDAP Account invalid, blank password, not in role.  - Does not
   allow log in.
   LDAP Account valid, password invalid, in role. - Does not allow
   log in.
   LDAP Account valid, blank password, not in role. - Does not
   allow log in.
   LDAP Account valid, password valid, not in role. - Does not
   allow log in
   
   The only unexpected scenario is that an user, who has the
   desired role with blank password is also allowed to log in. This
   behavior needs to be properly addressed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use other type of bind method
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  It should be entirely LDAP server responsibility to manage
   authentication and client should  not add its own mechanism in
   between. There are situations where a customer might want few
   users an access without passwd and configure LDAP to do that...
   changing client's logic would simply override this.
   In cases like yours however, if you can not enforce such policy
   at the server side (which is generally recommended), we would
   recommend to modify your login scripts to suit the specific
   needs that  you have (that's the very reason PIM login mechanism
   is written in scripts and exposed, so that it can be tweaked
   easily per implementation) . In this context, I have reviewed
   your change and it looks good to me.
   Rolling such changes in the product would create confusion among
   others who otherwise expect the behavior similar to LDAP server.
