LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Application          *
   *                  Server V8.0 administrative console using    *
   *                  LogViewer to read logs generated by a       *
   *                  server switched to High Performance         *
   *                  Extensible Logging (HPEL) mode.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Applying a filter to include loggers    *
   *                      while log and trace is disabled         *
   *                      causes an error message to be           *
   *                      reported.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  You can avoid this problem by emptying the  *
   *                  "Include Loggers" field when you have the   *
   *                  "Logs and Trace" checkbox unselected.       *
   ****************************************************************
   When viewing HPEL logs in the administrative console leaving
   some entries in "Include Loggers" and unselecting the "Logs and
   Trace" checkbox results in an error message "Sorry, an error
   occurred" reported if both "System Out" and "System Err"
   checkboxes are selected as well. The DeploymentManager log will
   contain an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception stack with
   the top method LogFilterBean.getQuery(LogFilterBean.java:137)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR change ensures correct handling of this condition
   and ignores values in the "Include Loggers" field when the
   "Logs and Trace" checkbox is unselected.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.0.0.3.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
