APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM API Management V2, instead of being able to connect to a
   HTTP endpoint in an assembly resource, the call fails and
   returns a 500 internal server error to the user.
   On further investigation, the connection to the endpoint is
   failing and re-directing the call to a login page.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is resolved with an APAR fixed in WebSphere Cast
   Iron.
   In IBM API Management, we make use of WebSphere Cast Iron for
   the assembly capabilities. There was a defect in the WebSphere
   Cast Iron code which meant that not all preemptive basic
   authentication requests would succeed.
   We needed to specify the protocol when performing the preemptive
   authentication. The APAR fix resolves this.
   The related WebSphere Cast Iron APAR is LI77785 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LI77785]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is targeted for inclusion in IBM API Management fixpack
   V2.0.0.3
