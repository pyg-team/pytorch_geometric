ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENV:
   
   We use Windows Server 2008 R2 on all included Servers, Citrix
   XenApp 6.5, Lotus Domino 9 and Lotus Notes 8.5.3 within the
   Citrix sessions. The users are mostly working on thin clients,
   so there is no local installation of Notes. Therefore we have
   installed the notes\data components on the users home drive.
   It's an network share which resists on an two node Microsoft
   Cluster.
   
   DESC:
   
   Now the problem is, if we switch over from one MSCS node to
   another, there is an interruption of nearly 40 seconds. Every
   network share keeps connected and can be accessed after the
   switchover is finished. But if the user tries to interact with
   the Notes client (open e-mail, calender etc) he gets the error
   message "The specified network name is no longer available"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restarting the Notes client. But this cannot be the solution.
   I thought of something like increasing some kind of time out
   value in notes.ini or the registry, if something like that
   exists?
