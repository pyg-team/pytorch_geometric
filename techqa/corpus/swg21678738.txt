QUESTION
 What are some periodic maintenance recommendations for WebSphere in a DataStage environment? 

ANSWER
As an example here is the path to the default profile named InfoSphere: 

 IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere


Stop the Application Server: 

Execute: ./stopServer.sh <server_name> from BM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/bin/
Ensure there are no outstanding WebSphere java processes active 


Cleanup the temporary cached areas for the AppServer's profile: 

Delete all of the contents (files and sub-directories) of the following directories: 

 
- Delete all contents in the IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/wstemp/ folder 
- Delete all contents in the IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/temp/ folder 
- Delete all contents in the IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/config/temp/ folder 


Rename or delete the pre-existing jvm logs and ffdc logs for the Application Server jvm: 

- Delete all contents in the IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/logs/ffdc/
- Delete all contents in the IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/logs/<server_name>/


Clear the java shared class cache for the Application Server: 

Execute: ./clearClassCache.sh from AppServer's IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/bin/ 


Afterward, check if the /javasharedresources/ sub-directory exists:

under /tmp/ filesystem: 
/tmp/javasharedresources/ 

 

If the /javasharedresources/ sub-directorystill exists please remove the entire 'javasharedresources' 
sub-directory (it will be recreated upon WebSphere jvm restart) 


Reinitialize the osgi configuration for the AppServer:

Execute: ./osgiCfgInit.sh from IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/bin/ directory


Start the WebSphere Application Server jvm:

Execute: ./startServer.sh <server_name>.sh from BM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/bin/ 


Log into the Admin Console using the WebSphere primary admin user
