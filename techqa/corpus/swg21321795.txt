Use this collector for general IBM Installation Manager issues. This can be used to collect information when running into install issues on products that leverages IBM Installation Manager as an install platform. 

What are the information being collected? 

This collector gathers the following information: 

 * Collects collector execution information. 
 * Determine where IBM Installation Manager is installed. 
 * Determine location of IBM Installation Manager Application data , as defined in <install_path>/eclipse/configuration/config.ini 
 * Collects all contents in the Application data directory, excluding:  * Image files (*.jpg, *.gif, *.bmp) 
    * lock files (*.lck , *.lock) 
    * archive files (*.jar, *.zip, *.tar) 
    * */bundles/* are also ignored.
   
   
 * Collect osgi data if available under <install_path>/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/ 
 * Windows: Collects ciclogs at <user home>/Local Settings/Temp/ciclogs*/*.xml 
 * Linux: Collects: ${user.home}/.ibm/InstallationManager. This is stored into IM/USER_HOME/_ibm_InstallationManager if available.


The information collected is used for initial assessment of the problem regarding to installation issues.

Data Upload 

When the collector is completed, it will request feedback about ISA or ISA Lite. Select Yes, to provide feedback. Select No to continue. You'll also be provided with data upload options. This will allow you to send the collected data to IBM or another location via FTP or HTTPS. 

 

IMPORTANT: To upload information to IBM, you'll need to have a PMR number. This is obtained when you work with our support team. If you do not have a PMR number, but do have support contract, you can leverage the Software Support page to open a service request and included the collected data with the service request. 

 * 
 * https://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/


The upload options are: 

 * Send the Logs to IBM using secure transfer (HTTPS). You'll need an PMR number to transfer the data to IBM. This sends the collected data to IBM Support team through the HTTPS protocol. 
 * FTP the Logs to IBM Support (not encrypted). You'll need an PMR number to transfer the data to IBM. This sends the collected data to IBM Support team through the FTP protocol. This is a less secure option. 
 * FTP the Logs to a Different Location (not encrypted) This allows you to send the collected data to another location via FTP. You'll need to provide the target FTP location and appropriate authentication to access it. 
 * Do Not FTP the Logs. Do nothing. 


Click OK to continue. If you choose options other than 4 above, you will need to fill in additional information required to complete the upload.  

When the collector completes, the .zip file is created at the location specified in Output File name. You can use any unzip tool to extract the files to examine the content of collected data
