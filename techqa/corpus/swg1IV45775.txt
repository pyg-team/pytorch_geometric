APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The documentation for nco_confpack does not clearly define what
   happens when nco_confpack is used on tools that are renamed.
   
   If a customer have identical object servers (one in prod and one
   in dev) and they rename a tool in the second object server and
   use nco_confpack to export that object server. When they import
   the confpack to the first object server, they will see two
   copies of the tool.  One with the original name and one with the
   new name.  This is causing the customer confusion since the
   documentation does mention using nco_confpack to REPLICATE
   object servers but clearly, it is not replicating but adding to
   an existing object server.
   
   So the documentation should have something to let the customer
   know what nco_confpack will do in such situation.  Maybe a
   warning or caveat.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer currently needs to log back into the production object
   server and removed the OLD tool.
