APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In some cases selecting value in Coach dependent dropdown
   doesn't lead to change of the value of binded variable, so
   other widgets that are binded to the same var are not updated
   with selected value.
   
   
   This is a bug in the controls/bindings area. The coach
   framework is not sending events when it should be.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The coach view that has unresolvable data binding remains "dead"
   forever even if the data binding turns to be resolvable later.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard and Express user who
   has complex object as variable, some coach view binds to the
   property of complex object, the complex object itself may turn
   to null.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:This is complicated scenario, here
   is an example to describe the details:
   
   -Select control "Child" has "object.object.child" as the value
   of "Selected Item" configuration option.
   -Text control "value" binds to "object.object.child.value".
   -When Select control "Child" receives its new list through Ajax
   service as the result of Selection change in Select control
   "Parent", Select control "Child" sets its selectedItem to null.
   Namely,  the object represented by "object.object.child" becomes
   null.
   -Then, "object.object.child.value" is not resolvable. As the
   result, coach framework isolates Text control "value".
   -When user makes selection in  Select control "Child", the
   object represented by "object.object.child" gets its value.
   However, the isolated Text control (the one binds to
   "object.object.child.value") is never woke up to update itself.
   
   Solution:
   Try to rescue the coach view instances that has a meaningful
   binding string but no binding object (failed to resolve the
   binding previously) when there is a proper chance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is fixed by enhancing 3 javascript files in coach
   framework.
