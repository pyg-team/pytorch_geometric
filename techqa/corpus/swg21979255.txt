QUESTION
 What are the Red Hat release requirements for me to use the IBM Netezza enhanced cryptography feature? 

ANSWER
If you are currently using or planning to use the enhanced cryptography features of the Netezza Platform Software (NPS) release, note the following important information related to the IBM PureData System for Analytics OS Security program. 

In addition to the minimum releases required for entrance to the RHEL Security patch program [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21979254], there are also NPS release requirements. Red Hat 5.11 and Red Hat 6.6 upgrades detect whether the NPS level is supported before permitting an operating system upgrade.
