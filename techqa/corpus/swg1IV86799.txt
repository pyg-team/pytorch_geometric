APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As described in the ISIM 6.0 Java API docs, invoking the
   createAccess()
   method of the AccessManager class returns a List object
   containing
   Request objects. When I invoke the getID() method on any one of
   these
   Request objects, I get back a request ID that is not the the
   process ID
   of the access request workflow which is initiated by the
   createAccess()
   method call. In fact, the request ID returned by getID() does
   not
   correspond with any request that I can determine. If I directly
   query
   ISIM's database PROCESS table for requests matching the ID
   returned by
   getID(), I find nothing.
   
   To what request does this ID correspond? How can the actual
   request ID
   of the access request workflow initiated by
   AccessManager.createAccess()
    be obtained?
