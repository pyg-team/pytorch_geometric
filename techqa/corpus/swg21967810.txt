 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After configured TSA+HADR successfully, we should have item like " Change failover policy for the current instance " when rerun db2haicu to go into maintenance mode to modify the failover policy , however we couldn't see such option . 

ANSWER
The failover policy type is not applicable to HADR configurations. It is applicable to shared disk configurations where we have a choice between Round Robin, Mutual Takeover, M+N, etc... There is no option to change the failover policy for automated HADR configurations, because there is no other option other than the default HADR failover policy which db2haicu will configure for us. It is not possible to change the failover policy for an automated HADR configuration(db2haicu ,or db2haicu+XML) and it is not possible to retrieve the failover policy type because for HADR there is only one failover policy type, which is the HADR failover policy.
