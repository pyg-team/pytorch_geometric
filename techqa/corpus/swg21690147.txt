PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Some widgets in DASH do not show correctly. They show only as a placeholder, as if they were not correctly installed or corrupted. 

SYMPTOM
Some widgets do not show correctly in the UI, they show up like the RaveWidgets in this example, only as placeholders: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21690147&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21690147&aid=1]


CAUSE
The exact cause is unknown, but possible problems during the install process may have corrupted these widgets. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if this directory exists: 

 
<snip>\IBM\JazzSM\profile\config\cells\JazzSMNode01Cell\applications\isc
.ear\deployments\isc\dash.ravewidget.war\WEB-INF\classes\com\ibm\tivoli\tip\RaveWidget 

Does this directory exist? Does it include RaveWidget.class and an nl subdirectory full of RaveWidgetResource_*.properties files? 

If above directory is empty or does not contain the files mentioned, it would indicate that something went wrong during the install process. 

Please note: Above directories and files are for the example of the corrupted RaveWidgets, other widgets will be located in different directories, but with the same structure.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform a rollback of the current install and reinstall JazzSM 1.1.1 that includes DASH 3.1.1.
