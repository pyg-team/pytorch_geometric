Title: IBM WebSEAL receives POST requests from Internet Explorer without data. - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSEAL returns a "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" with error "DPWWA1238E An HTTP message body sent in a response by a third-party server is too short" to POST requests from Internet Explorer without a request body.. 

CAUSE
Internet Explorer expects that an HTTP server will maintain a persistent connection for 60 seconds. When a connection is closed prior to this, and Internet Explorer receives a TCP Reset from a POST request on the closed connection, Internet Explorer retries the POST on a new connection without the POST body. This is discussed in Microsoft Support article 895954.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As suggested in the Workaround of Microsoft Support article 831167, increase the WebSEAL [server] persistent-con-timeout to 61 seconds. 

In Access Manager 7.0 WebSEAL and the Access Manager Reverse Proxy, a separate cache is used for idle persistent connections, without using additional worker threads. It may be necessary to increase the [server] max-idle-persistent-connections value. 

In Access Manager 6.1.* WebSEAL, each persistent connection uses a worker thread, so it may also be necessary to increase the [server] worker-threads value as well.
