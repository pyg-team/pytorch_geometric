APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are attempting to install a CICS Bundle which includes a JVM
   server resource and a JVM profile resource. The .jvmprofile is
   stored in a subdirectory within the CICS Bundle. The bundle is
   installed, but on attempting to start the JCM server you receive
   message
   DFHSJ0210 applid An attempt to start a JVM for the JVMSERVER
   resource jvmserver has failed. Reason code: JVMPROFILE_ERROR.
   .
   An INQUIRE JVMSERVER against the JVM server shows that the
   Bundle root directory is being used as the JVMPROFILEDIR,
   instead of the subdirectory when the JVM profile is stored.

   ****************************************************************
   A CICS BUNDLE containing a JVM server, and a JVM profile is
   installed into CICS. An ENABLE request is issued for that
   BUNDLE, and CICS attempts to enable the JVM server. CICS is
   unable to find the specified .jvmprofile file, and so the JVM
   server fails to enable. The bundle remains in a DISABLED state.
   This occurs when the .jvmprofile file is in a sub-directory
   within the bundle, rather than in the bundle root directory.
   .
   CICS issues exception trace entry SJ 0247, and the following
   message:
   DFHSJ0210 date time applid An attempt to start a JVM for the
   JVMSERVER resource jvmserver has failed. Reason code:
   ENCLAVE_INIT_FAILED.
   .
   The following may be seen in SYSPRINT:
   date time UTC jvmserver *Exc*: Attempt to open JVM profile
    jvmprofile has failed. Runtime error message = EDC
   5129I No such file or directory.
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSJJS has been updated to ensure that the JVM profile
   directory is built correctly when the .jvmprofile file is stored
   in a sub-directory within the bundle root structure.
