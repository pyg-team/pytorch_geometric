Title: IBM FileNet Workplace XT logon page is missing all graphics post redeployment. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Workplace XT logon page is missing all graphics and attempts to logon fail without exceptions or errors in the web application server’s log. 

SYMPTOM
Attempts to log on to the character based logon screen fail with “error on page” in the browsers lower left corner. No errors or exceptions are generated in the web application server’s logs.


CAUSE
The “Everyone” role was not selected during redeployment

ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere 6.1.0.x

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. In the IBM WebSphere console, navigate to Enterprise Applications > Workplace > Map security roles to users/groups 
 2. Verify that the All Authenticated? column is checked for the "All Authenticated" role, and that the Everyone? column is checked for the “Everyone” role.  * If the Everyone? Column was not checked for the Everyone role, place a check in the box. 
     * If the Everyone role is already checked, follow steps below to redeploy.
    
    
 3. Save to master 
 4. Stop and restart the Workplace XT application and test logon.


If the Workplace XT login page is still not displaying graphics correctly or if the check boxes were already checked: 
 1. From the WebSphere console, undeploy Workplace XT 
 2. Following the Workplace XT Installation Guide, redeploy Workplace XT:  * At the bottom of the first page of the redeployment (Step 1), select “Show me all installation options and parameters” 
     * When presented with the option to set roles in Step 8 of the deployment, make sure to check the Everyone? Column for the “Everyone” role and the All Authenticated? column for the "All Authenticated" role. 
     * Save to master when the deployment is complete.
    
    
 3. Start the Workplace XT application and test logon.
