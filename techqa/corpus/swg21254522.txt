 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I get the following error messages when I load my line data documents into DB2Â® Content Manager OnDemand using ARSLOAD:
0425-408 A VIRTUAL STORAGE REQUEST WAS UNSUCCESSFUL - REQUEST SIZE 
524288 RETURN CODE 5. 
0425-410 AN ACIF STORAGE REQUEST WAS UNSUCCESSFUL - REQUEST SIZE 544 
GETMAIN RETURN CODE 5. 
0425-441 ACIF AT PK10069 HAS COMPLETED ABNORMALLY WITH RETURN CODE 16.

These are my ACIF parameters:
CC=YES
CCTYPE=Z
CONVERT=NO
CPGID=850
MCF2REF=CPCS
TRC=NO
FILEFORMAT=STREAM,(NEWLINE=X'0A')
TRIGGER1=*,3,X'7E7E7E',(TYPE=GROUP) /* ~^~ */
FIELD1=0,14,8,(TRIGGER=1,BASE=0)
FIELD2=0,7,6,(TRIGGER=1,BASE=0)
INDEX1=X'5265706F72744E616D65',FIELD1,(TYPE=GROUP,BREAK=YES) /* ReportName */
INDEX2=X'5265706F727444617465',FIELD2,(TYPE=GROUP,BREAK=YES) /* ReportDate */
DCFPAGENAMES=NO
UNIQUEBNGS=YES
IMAGEOUT=ASIS
INDEXOBJ=ALL
INDEXSTARTBY=1
INSERTIMM=NO
RESTYPE=NONE
OUTEXIT=/usr/lpp/ars/bin/rptout
INPEXIT=/usr/lpp/ars/bin/apkinp

My document is long, so I use an input exit to insert page breaks into it. Why does my load fail? 

CAUSE
The APK408S error message usually signifies a problem with carriage control (CC). Assuming the CC type is correct, then your problem may come from the CC placement for page breaks in your document. ACIF reads one page at a time into memory and writes the current page to *.out when finds a new page. If ACIF cannot find the page break for the next page, it will continue to read lines into memory until there is no more memory left.

ANSWER
You can try to use LINECNT instead of CC to divide your document into pages because you are not converting the input data to AFP. You can also try to correct your input record exit to output correct data. To verify the processed data from your input record exit, run ARSLOAD with the -i parameter. After ACIF fails, try to find *.out in the same directory. That *.out contains the input after it has been processed by your input record exit. Examine the *.out file to verify if your input exit is working correctly.
