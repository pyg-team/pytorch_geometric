APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In an observed case, an LDAP environment with over 1 million
   entities exposed this problem.  This problem presents itself in
   two ways:
   1.  During installation on a domain member server, installer
   times out during the TIP configuration stage, logging the
   following messages:
   BPCIN0004E An error occurred during the installation of the The
   following error occurred while executing this line:1 million
   F:\Program Files\IBM\TPC\config\install\tpcshared.xml:566:
   BPCIN0031E The configuration of Tivoli Integrated Portal failed.
   Review the installation log file.. Review the log files for more
   information.
   2.  After manual workaround to extend timeout values within the
   installer to allow for the extended LDAP searching, configuring
   TIP for LDAP authentication will also time out and not complete.

   2.  After manual workaround to extend timeout values within the
   installer to allow for the extended LDAP searching, configuring
   TIP for LDAP authentication will also time out and not complete.
   This APAR gives users a better option for performing installs on
   domain member systems to avoid the excessively long LDAP
   searches that happen in the current design
   RECREATE STEPS:
   Install TPC on a domain member server with a very large LDAP
   environment.
   Configure TIP for LDAP authentication as a post-install step.
