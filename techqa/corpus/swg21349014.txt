 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When opening a CSV file created with Report Studio or Impromptu in Excel format, any zeros that were at the beginning of a value are lost. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Excel automatically removes the leading zeros of a value. To ensure that there are zeros on a fixed length number, right-click on the cell in Excel and click the Format?Cells option. Create a Custom Category that has a type of the specific number of zeros required.

The CSV file can also be opened using notepad instead of Excel, this will show the leading zeros.
