ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  R#33997
   
   Customer says that when downloading files/attachments from
   Telelogic
   Change associated to a task, they click on the download link
   they gets the File Donwload dialog which displays,
   
   the file Name with Open, Save and Cancel buttons.
   
   The issue is in the file Name: If the file Name is
   "download_file.sh"
   it is diaplayed in the dialog as "download_file&#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;.sh" and
   
   And when they click Save, the file get saved with the name
   "download_filep&#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;.sh
   
   Because of this, they have to rename the file each and every
   time after
   the file is saved.
   
   
   Client Business Impact:
   
   The customer tells that there is no significant business impact,
   only
   thing is the users have to rename the file each and everytime
   they
   download the file. Hence the severity is 3.
   
   
   Other Questions/Concerns:
   
   - - - NIL - - -
   
   
   
   The customer said that this was encoutered on all the machines
   and it is
   not machine specific.
   
   In this regard, Support has done the following test:
   **********************************
   Tested the following setup:
   Telelogic Change 4.7 patch 18
   Telelogic Synergy 6.5 SP - 01
   OS platform = Windows XP Professional - SP3.
   Package Installed = dev_process
   Internet explorer = IE7
   
   Support created attachments with the file name
   'abc_def_ghi.xyz.lmn.sh' as
   mentioned in the PMR description.
   Support did not come across the issue that the customer was
   currently
   experiencing.
   Downloading the file to the same location prompted us to replace
   the
   existing file, which confirms that the name of the file did not
   add a
   &#65517;1&#65529; to the second download attempt.
   
   Note: The IE version was IE7..
   
   ******************************************
   
   On further testing it was found that:
   
   The attachment file has multiple ( .dot) extensions.
   ----------------------------------
   TSTMT_ISS_DESC_LINE_FR.TD.post.sh
   ----------------------------------
   Upon download , the first dot in the extension that Internet
   explorer
   encounters is replaced by "&#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;".
   
   Here are few more observations with respect to IE and firefox.
   
   On Internet Explorer:
   
   1) The file name "TSTMT_ISS_DESC_LINE_FR_TD_post.sh" did not
   have any
   issues (Here the type of the file is .sh, as this saved as the
   type sh
   
   type).
   2) "TSTMT_ISS_DESC_LINE_FR.TD.post.sh" did have "&#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;"
   attached in
   the
   file name during the download operation.
   
   On Mozilla Browser:
   
   The same when tried to download on a Mozilla browser did not
   have any
   issues in downloading.
   If "TSTMT_ISS_DESC_LINE_FR.TD.post.sh~6"  is downloaded there
   are no
   '&#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;' attached, but at the end of the filename "%7E" gets
   appended, i.e this file gets saved as
   "TSTMT_ISS_DESC_LINE_FR.TD.post.sh%7E6", this is because the "~"
   symbol
   is getting converted
   to its corresponding "ASCII" value.
   
   *************************************************
   
   Based on these, here are the customer inputs:
   
   They were experiencing this issue in IE 6.0sp2 and NOT in IE
   7.0. With IE
   7.0, there are no '&#65490;1-&#65490;1-' attached.
   Also, with Firefox v3.0.8, I don't see what you mentioned. The
   file
   gets
   downloaded as is without any additional characters.
   So, the issue at Support's end is only with IE6.0.
   *************************************************
   
   
   
   1) Whenever a customer tries to download any attachments from a
   CR with
   multiple extension or multiple dots in the file name, the file
   gets
   downloaded with &#65517;1&#65529;&#65517;1&#65529;'s appended to it. Because of this the
   customer
   has to rename the file each and everytime she downloads a
   attachments
   with multiple extensions.
   
   2) Support has also tested the same behaviour in our test
   environment and
   were able to reproduce it.
   
   As per the Supported browsers change 4.7 has the following list
   of
   supported browsers:
   
   Operating System   Browser
   Windows Vista ->  Internet Explorer 7.0
   Windows XP    ->  Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 or 7.0
   Windows 2003  ->  Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 or 7.0
   Windows 2000  ->  Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1
   Red Hat Linux ->  Firefox 2.0
   Solaris       ->  Firefox 2.0
   HP-UX         ->  Firefox 2.0
   IBM AIX       ->  Firefox 1.5
   
   2) As per the customer they are not seeing the issue is IE 7.0
   and
   Firefox.
