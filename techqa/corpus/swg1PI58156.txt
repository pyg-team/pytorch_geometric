APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Calculating tuples in a crosstab report will throw an error when
   using Preview mode in Cognos Workspace Advanced.  This happens
   with Dynamic Cubes and/or TM1 cubes in V 10.2.2 FP4 with DQM.
   
   Error: XQE-PLN-0093 The argument at position 2 of 'rolevalue'
   from the data item '(Central Europe, (E-mail)) + Central Europe,
   Telephone' is a 'tuple' expression, which cannot be coerced into
   a 'set' expression.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  create the calculation manually with a query calculation and the
   tuple function; i.e. tuple ([Products],[Americas])
   +tuple([Products],[Europe])
   or
   creating the report in "Design Mode"  instead of  "Preview Mode"
   or
   creating the report in Report Studio (which is the "same" as
   running the report in CWA in Design Mode)
