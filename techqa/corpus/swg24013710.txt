ABSTRACT
 The Adapter for JD Edwards OneWorld, version 2.0.3 has been updated 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION



 * 83725/JR23529 The adapter did not correctly handle errors encountered during event processing. If the adapter encountered an error while processing an event, it generated an exception and returned an empty business object to the broker. In addition, the status of the event remained set to 3.
   Now, when an error is encountered during event processing, the adapter sets the status of the event to -1 and does not send a business object to the broker.
   
   
 * 83894 The adapter should work for the version of PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne/JD Edwards OneWorld 8.95 
   The adapter must be tested to make sure the all functionality is intact
   Now, Adapter enables this support. 
   
   
 * 84824 Some sample programs did not compile. 
   The sample programs written in C that demonstrate JDE events for V8.9 did not compile successfully on the UNIX platform.
   The programs have been modified and now compile successfully.
   
   
 * 85852 Code optimization has been introduced for event business functions.
   Some declared variables were never used and some were not initialized in the event C functions. Also, JDB_InitEnv() and JDB_InitUser() did not need to be called to create a connection to the database.
   Now all declared variables are being initialized and unnecessary code has been removed.
