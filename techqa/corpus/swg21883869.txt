QUESTION
 How can I change the install location of the Deployment Engine (DE) ? 

CAUSE
Sample scenario: 
DE home was initially installed as /opt/IBM/netcool. Afterwards the UNIX administrator moved all the home directories to /home/netcool , so the DE source target changed.


ANSWER
Since this is the DE's install discriminant that needs to be changed, please perform the following steps: 


1. Take backup of the existing DE, run the following command: 

acsi/bin/de_backup -bfile <path>/<backup file name> 
Important: choose a location for the backup outside of DE install location

2. Uninstall the existing DE using:

acsi/bin/si_inst.sh -r -f 

3. Reinstall a fresh DE. Start the installer for the product and exit once DE install step is complete.

4. Restore backup taken in step 1: 

acsi/bin/de_restoreDB -bfile <path>/<backup file name>
