APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Master reset event not clearing situations opened from
   previously active hub monitoring server in a hot-standby
   scenario.
   
   Recreate:
   - Customer configured hot standby for HTEMS
   - Have a sampled situation that is TRUE.  Event is received
   correctly in OMNIbus.
   - Perform a failover of the HTEMS.
   - The newly active HTEMS sends a master reset event to OMNIbus
   - Events previously opened from the original HTEMS should be
   closed, but they still remain open.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Master reset event sent not clearing situations in ONMIbus
   opened from previously active hub monitoring server in a
   hot-standby scenario.
   
   In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment, the Event Synchronization from the IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring (tec) 6.3.0 FP7 install image needs to be installed.
   See the "Install Actions" section of the APAR conclusion for
   more details
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed so the master reset event triggers the
   closing of the situations from the previously active hub.
   
   Install Actions:
   ----------------
   This fix for this APAR requires the Event Sychronization from
   the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (tec) 6.3.0 FP7 install image to be
   installed.   Once installed the updated itm_event.rules file
   should be copied from the <Event Synch Install
   Directory>/omnibus directory to each Netcool/OMNIbus
   ObjectServer, to the $OMNIHOME/probes/<archictecture> directory.
   
   If you have previously customized the itm_event.rules file,
   determine what customizations were made to the file and merge
   your customized rules for IBM Tivoli Monitoring events into the
   itm_event.rules provided with this update.
   
   The EIF probe should then be restarted to pick up the changes.
