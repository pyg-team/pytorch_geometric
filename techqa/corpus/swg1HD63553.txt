   PART LEVEL.
   .
   SCENARIO:
   0) Start CATIA.
   1) Open the file: "N54.CATProduct".
   Workbench: "Product Structure".
   2) Double-click " Part.1 (Part1.1) / Part.1" on the
   tree. A work bench changes to "Part Design".
   3) " Extrude.1 object / Upgrade" is selected from
   the context menu of "Geometrical Set.1 /
   Extrude.1". "Intersect.1" becomes the waiting for
   updating.
   4) Double-click "Product.1" on the tree. A work
   bench changes to "Product Structure ".
   5) A work bench is changed into "Assembly
   Design".
   6) Click "Update All" command. Update processing
   is started. However, even if 10 minute passes,
   processing does not finish. Processing takes time
   too much. This is Problem. When "Part.1" is in an
   edit state, updating processing is finished in about
   2 seconds.
