ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In high load situations copies of an event being processed can
   reside in a queue prior to being placed in the EventReader
   EventQueue and this pre-queue is not searched by the
   UpdateEventQueue() function.
   
   This is an issue when one is wishing to prevent unnecessary
   multiple reprocessing of the same event, due to it being
   captured multiple times by the EventReader prior to the first
   copy of the event being processed, by using the UpdateEventQueue
   () function to delete latter copies from the EventQueue.
   
   When a copy of the event resides in this pre-queue the function
   is unable to find & remove it and, some time later, this copy of
   the event is then processed.  This undesireable second
   processing of the event is a cause of concern for our
   customers and can result in, at best, replication of work or
   even undoing of previously performed tasks.
   
   The capability of the UpdateEventQueue() function need to be
   increased to encompass this pre-EventQueue queue to help prevent
   such scenarios.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Additional event flag setting & checking can prevent
   reprocessing from proceding further than a few lines into a
   Policy, but it would better if the unnecessary processing did
   not occur in the first place and as high a number of threads as
   possible were working on actual, desired processes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This APAR is fixed in 4.0.2-TIV-NCI-FP0001
