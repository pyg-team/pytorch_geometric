PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may experience slow response times and an elevated CPU usage depending on the workload and IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) functions you use. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Additional database indexes can improve the response time of your IBM BPM system. Creating the following indexes depending on which version of IBM BPM you are using can significantly improve performance.



IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.x
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IX_BPDIVAR_BPDI ON @SCHEMA@. LSW _BPD_INSTANCE_VARIABLES ("BPD_INSTANCE_ID")
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IX_SBO_BPDI ON @SCHEMA@.BPM_SHARED_OBJECT ("BPD_INSTANCE_ID")

IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5.0
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IX_BPDI_T_ES_SN_CBVI ON @SCHEMA@.LSW_BPD_INSTANCE("TIP","EXECUTION_STATUS","SNAPSHOT_ID","CACHED_BPD_VERSION_ID")

IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5.0 databases running on Oracle
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IDX_UX_UNAME ON @SCHEMA@.LSW_USR_XREF(UPPER("USER_NAME"))



IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6.0
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IX_BPDI_T_ES_SN_CBVI ON @SCHEMA@.LSW_BPD_INSTANCE("TIP","EXECUTION_STATUS","SNAPSHOT_ID","CACHED_BPD_VERSION_ID")
CREATE INDEX @SCHEMA@.IDX_TI_IID_TID_CR_ST_ATP ON @SCHEMA@.LSW_TASK("BPD_INSTANCE_ID","TASK_ID","CREATED_BY_BPD_FLOW_OBJECT_ID","STATUS","ACTIVITY_TASK_TYPE")

IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6.0 databases running on Oracle
