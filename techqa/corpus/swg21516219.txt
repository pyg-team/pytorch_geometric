QUESTION
 What SAP authorizations do I need to use IBM InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP Applications 7.0? 

ANSWER
 The following predefinedauthorization profiles are shipped with the product and can be deployed on the SAP system using a transport request: 

 * Z_DS_PROFILE is the "runtime" profile and contains the authorizations that allow you to run Pack for SAP Applications jobs. 
 * Z-DS_LOAD is the "design" profile and contains the authorizations that allow you to design and run Pack for SAP Applications jobs.


These authorization profiles contain the required SAP authorizations to use the ABAP, BAPI, and IDoc stage functionality. Authorizations required for the Rapid Modeler are not part of these authorization profiles. For information about how to adjust the design-time profile for the use with the Rapid Modeler, refer to section Additional authorizations for Rapid Modeler below. The Pack also requires the following SAP-defined profiles: 

 * S_IDOC_ALL and B_ALE_ALL to use the IDoc stage 
 * The authorization profile for any BAPI that you called by using the BAPI stage 
 * S_TMW_CREATE to use the CTS functionality in the ABAP Extract stage 

To load ABAP programs into SAP using CTS requests, the SAP user must be registered as a developer. To register a new user, perform the following steps: 

 1. Log on to the SAP Online Support System (OSS) and select the appropriate SAP installation number. 
 2. Go to Register > Register Developer and enter the SAP user name. 
 3. Save the 20 character access key you receive from OSS. 
 4. Create a dummy ABAP program using the SAP GUI. 
 5. When the system prompts you for a developer key, enter the key you saved. The system will confirm the key and register the user as a developer.


Creating the authorization profiles manually 

If needed, you can create the SAP authorization profiles manually as follows: 
Z_DS_PROFILE contains the following SAP authorizations:



Authorization

Create an authorization profile containing the above mentioned authorization objects listed in the tables in your SAP system (SAP transaction SU02) .
