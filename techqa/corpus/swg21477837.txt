Title: IBM Using a stratification or clustering variable as a predictor in SPSS Complex Samples - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using SPSS Complex Samples with data from a complex design involving stratification. I've successfully created an analysis plan file, but when I try to specify my analysis, SPSS won't allow me to specify a stratification or clustering variable as a predictor in my analysis. I don't think this should cause a problem for the variance estimation with my design. Can I get SPSS to allow me to include this predictor? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The SPSS Complex Samples procedures do not allow you to use design variables as predictors or dependents in an analysis. In cases where you are certain that this is reasonable to do, you can get SPSS to use the desired values by simply creating a copy of the appropriate variable and denoting it with another name
