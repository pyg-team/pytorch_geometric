QUESTION
 Does DB2Â® Table Editor have the functionality to compare two tables? 

ANSWER
DB2 Table Editor does not have an explicit compare function. However, its companion product DB2 Web Query Tool, does have a dedicated compare function. 

You can use other DB2 Table Editor functions to achieve the same or similiar results. With DB2 Table Editor, you can: 

 * Run SQL queries using UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, and FULL OUTER JOIN to present results that compare contents of two tables. 
 * Display multiple list controls to allow users to manually inspect table contents. 
 * Display multiple list type controls to allow users to select records from one table and view corresponding records in a second table.
