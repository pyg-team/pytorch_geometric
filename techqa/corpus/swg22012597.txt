 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When transfer a workflow, the user might encounter the following exception:
FNRPE2131090427E Transfer failed; Exception: The blob size of 1,084,448 exceeds the maximum allowed of 1,048,576,When transfer a workflow, the user might encounter the following exception:

FNRPE2131090427E:Transfer failed; Exception: The blob size of 1,084,448 exceeds the maximum allowed of 1,048,576 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The current size of the BLOB size for the Process Engine is printed, when you run the vwtool command "config". One of the first lines printed has the BLOB size.


This exception was due to a limitation with the BLOB size of a work item. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To address this problem, you can adjust to increase the blob size limit in the following way: 

1. Back up your PE database 
2. From the PE Process Task Manager, right click on the server node to stop the server. 
3. Select "Process Engine" node, and click on the "Advanced" tab. 
4. Add (if not already exists) a property with a name "MaxBlobSize" and set its value to 2048 (KB default) (or a smaller value, see Important Note below) 
5. Apply to save the setting. 
6. Restart the server. 

Important Note:
1. Be very careful about this - after the max blob size is increase, you can not go back, so the memory consumption will increase. 
2. Be sure to backup the PE database in case you need to revert back the change. 
3. The maximum size possible is 10 MB.
