 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What steps could be taken to resolve the following error?

Front side protocol handler: processing failed. Could not find named reply2QM [XYZ.NODE2.MANAGER] 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following describe a few scenarios in which this error might be seen along with the remedial action that can be taken to resolve the error. 


1) If an MQMD.ReplyToQ value exists and MQMD.ReplyToQMgr’s value is different than the qmgr name configured in the MQ QM object, DataPower will route the message based on MQMD.ReplyToQ and MQMD.ReplyQMgr. 

However, the processing will fail as the respective queue manager object is not configured in DataPower or respective queue does not exist in MQ server. 

In order to route the message to the configured destination, use the following extension function calls in a custom stylesheet to set DataPower's internal headers to an empty string in the request rule or response rule based on your processing requirements:


 * DataPower’s internal header “ReplyToQM” may be set to an empty string using:
   <dp:set-response-header name=“’ReplyToQM’” value=“’’”/> 

 * DataPower’s internal header “ReplyToQ” may be set to an empty string using:
   <dp:set-response-header name=“’ReplyToQ’” value=“’’”/> 



2) If the MQMD.ReplyToQ value is not populated and MQMD.ReplyToQMgr’s value is different than the QMgr name configured in the DataPower MQ QM object, DataPower will not route the message. MQMD.ReplyToQMgr only take effect when MQMD.ReplyToQ is present. 


3) If the MQMD.ReplyToQ value exists and MQMD.ReplyToQMgr’s value contains same name as configured in the MQ QMgr object - DataPower will route the message based on MQMD.ReplyToQ. 

However, the processing will fail as the respective queue does not exist in MQ server 

To route the message to the configured destination, the following extension function may be called in a custom stylesheet to set DataPower's internal header “ReplyToQ” to an empty string: 

<dp:set-response-header name=“’ReplyToQ’” value=“’’”/>
