ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you have Java agents in a database where there is no
   source code
   (such as when taken over from a vendor template such as IBM
   Content
   Collector for Mail) then simply opening such an agent in
   Domino designer modifies (resets) the "Base Class" property in
   the
   agent. I.e. the agent is modified even if the user only opened
   it and
   did NOT save it. Just opening it is sufficient to find it
   modified by
   Designer afterwards.
   
   Also, it is not possible to correct the "Base Class" in
   Designer to the
   required value because the source code is missing and Designer
   thus
   does not find it and again resets the value when saving.
   
   Environment:
   ICC 4.0.0.3
   Domino 9.0.1 FP2
   CM 8.4.3
   ICC Notes Client Extension not installed
   Windows 64 bit
