APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Cast Iron Studio does not display DB2 column alias
   name correctly.
   
   For example:
   If querying the database with SQL statement as below:
   
   select APPLICATION_ID as ID ,APPLICATION_NAME as NAME from
   TEST.APPLICATIONS
   
   We expect to see ID and NAME in map output schema, however
   Studio shows APPLICATION_ID and APPLICATION_NAME
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  We discovered a defect in the WebSphere Cast Iron code. When
   column alias are used in a query statement for DB2, the alias
   names are not used in the display of output schema in map
   output.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to use the column alias if
   specified, else it will use the column name to display it in the
   output schema.
   
   The fix has been targeted for WebSphere Cast Iron fix packs
   6.3.0.2 and 6.1.0.15
