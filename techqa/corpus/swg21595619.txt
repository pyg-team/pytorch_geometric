PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 For a Case Manager V5.1 installation with Single Sign-On (SSO), installing Business Space 7.5.1 iFix 2 disables SSL redirection, which causes solution deployment from Case Builder to fail. 

SYMPTOM
After Business Space 7.5.1 iFix 2 is installed, Case Builder solutions deployments fail.


CAUSE
The installation of Business Space 7.5.1 iFix 2 makes SSL redirection unavailable. When the SSL redirection does not occur, the Case Manager API fails to connect to Business Space. This connection failure causes solution deployment in Case Builder to fail.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the instructions indicated in the following IBM Business Process Manager Info Center documentation to enable SSL redirection:
