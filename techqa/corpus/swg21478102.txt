Title: IBM Error message "Cast from String "" to type 'Double' is not valid" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using Amos. When I tried to estimate a model, the following error message occurred:

" cast from string "'" to type 'Double' is not valid. "

and then ...

" error. no model has been specified "

Why is this occurring? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These messages will occur when, in the Analysis Properties - Output dialog box, you've checked the Modification Indeces box but left the Threshold for Modification Indeces box empty. Insert a number to indicate the threshold and the model should then run without those error messages
