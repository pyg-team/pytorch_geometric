When your FTP Poller is polling for files that have an Input File Match Pattern of . *(.zip$|.ZIP$), (for instance looking for all .zip files), and you want to keep the same file name in propagating to the target directory, this is best accomplished by specifying a dynamic back-end on the multi-protocol gateway web configure page and using a stylesheet. In using the stylesheet, you would assign your back-end value (which would include the file name) to the DataPower variable var://service/routing-url. The attached DataPower configuration, using an FTP poller associated to a multi-protocol gateway, is an example of how this can be accomplished.
