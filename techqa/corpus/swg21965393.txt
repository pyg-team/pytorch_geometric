PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The event list in the Event Viewer is not updated when clicking on gauges in the Netcool Health Dashboard when using Internet Explorer 9 or 10. When using IE11 or Firefox the problem is not seen. 

SYMPTOM
Step to reproduce: 

1. Log into DASH and open the Health Dashboard
2. Ensure that the event list shown is the Event Viewer, not the AEL
3. Ensure that the active view is the Self Monitoring view
5. Click on a selection of gauges.

Expected result: The event list is updated to show the events which match the related filter (if any such events exist).

Actual result: No update from the Event Viewer. The same events are showing.


CAUSE
This third party API:

var xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject( "Microsoft.XMLDOM" );

in /ibm/console/webtop/scripts/ajax.js causes an exception with some IE9/IE10 browsers.
Stepping over the above line throws the following exception:
eventTransformer: Exception caught while attempting to read payload. Error was:Automation server can't create object

The issue is caused by configuration changes on some Windows machines and is not a defect in OMNIbus Web GUI.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Go to: 

" IE9/10 > Internet Options > Security > Custom Level" and set
1. "Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins" to Enable
2. "Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting" to Enable
