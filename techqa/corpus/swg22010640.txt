 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is changing in the Informix Tools support experience? 

CAUSE
We are always striving to seek new and better ways to improve our communications and the support we offer. With that in mind, we’re excited to announce we’re launching a new Support Community/Experience for a select number of IBM products, Informix Toolawill be one of these products going live with this new technology in the coming weeks. 

ANSWER
Our new community will provide you enhance transparency into your ticket resolution workflow along with improved self-service options. You can see a quick video overview of the initial experience here: https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/t/1_hjcvgybl [https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/t/1_hjcvgybl] 

The move to this new support experience should be seamless for you. Specifically:
· Your bookmarks and existing access methods will automatically connect to the new Support Community once you’ve selected Informix as a product.
· The same URLs you currently use will continue to work, or you can use a new URL to reach the new Support experience directly: www.ibm.com/mysupport [http://www.ibm.com/mysupport]
· Any existing PMRs will be automatically converted to “Cases” in the new tool. Simply choose “cases” from the Informix support landing page to see status or make updates 

We know you may have other IBM products and those too will be migrating to this new experience over time. Please note that you may receive other communications notifying you of the plans for other IBM products. Your experience with Informix support will continue to evolve as well. Among other improvements, we’re incorporating IBM Watson technology, and providing a truly “one-stop shop” for Customer Support related information for Information Server.

You will know Informix has migrated once it appears in the product selection area on the new Support Community.
