APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A TPC 4.x or 5.1 customer who has LDAP and DS8000 Single SignOn
   implemented and has not migrated the DS8000 credentials prior to
   deleting the existing TIP Server will become locked out of the
   DS8000 Storage Manager.
   The Installation Guide documents the requirement to migrate the
   credentials prior to upgrade.  The upgrade process involves
   deleting the existing TIP Server before the new JazzSM
   infrastructure is installed.  Customers who choose to uninstall
   the previous version of TPC prior to fresh installing TPC 5.2
   are also susceptible to this scenario if they do not read the
   TPC Installation Guide.
   This migration step needs an additional warning within the
   installer for cases where the user has not followed the
   documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the user does not follow the migration procedure and gets
   locked out of DS8000 Storage Manager they will need to engage
   IBM Hardware support to have an IBM CE log into the DS8000 HMC
   and reset authentication to the default ID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Those upgrading from TPC 4.x to 5.1.x to 5.2 while storage   *
   * subsystems use LDAP authentication through Authentication    *
   * Services Server in TIP                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * -  Customer has installed TPC 4.2.2  (which installs TIP     *
   * 1.1)  or  TPC 5.1.x  (which installs TIP 2.2)                *
   * -  Customer has configured their TPC 4.2.2  or  TPC 5.1.x    *
   * system for LDAP authentication                               *
   * -  Customer has configured storage subsystems (DS8K or SVC   *
   * or Storwize V7000) to use LDAP authentication through the    *
   * Authentication Services Server that runs within TIP;  a      *
   * customer would do this in order to enable single sign on     *
   * between the TPC Java GUI and the storage subsystem element   *
   * managers                                                     *
   * -  Customer upgrades to TPC 5.2 and during that upgrade to   *
   * TPC 5.2, the customer chooses to uninstall TIP               *
   * -  After the upgrade to TPC 5.2, the customer can no longer  *
   * access the storage subsystems that were configured to use    *
   * LDAP authentication through the Authentication Services      *
   * Server that runs within TIP  because TIP (and the            *
   * Authentication Services Server) was uninstalled during the   *
   * upgrade to TPC 5.2                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Apply fix maintenance when available.  It will provide a     *
   * warning message specific to this situation.  If not          *
   * possible, use the following workaround:                      *
   * In order to prevent this situation, the customer should      *
   * reconfigure the storage subsystems not to use LDAP           *
   * authentication before upgrading to TPC 5.2 and uninstalling  *
   * TIP.                                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix does not change the authentication of the storage
   subsystems.  Rather, it displays a warning message informing the
   user to reconfigure the storage subsystems not to use LDAP
   authentication before upgrading to TPC 5.2.1 and uninstalling
   TIP.
   When you uninstall Tivoli Integrated Portal, the Authentication
   Services Server is also uninstalled. If you have storage
   subsystems that are configured to use LDAP authentication
   through the Authentication Services Server, reconfigure the
   storage subsystems so that these subsystems do not use LDAP
   authentication before you upgrade Tivoli Storage Productivity
   Center and uninstall Tivoli Integrated Portal.
   The fix for this APAR is targeted for the following maintenance
   package:
   
   | refresh pack | 5.2-TIV-TPC-RP0001 - target March 2014
   
   The target dates for future fix packs do not represent a formal
   commitment by IBM. The dates are subject to change without
   notice.
