APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an object store is offline, it is not possible to access any
   storage areas in object stores which were created after the
   offline object store using Content Consistency Checker.
   
   So for example, given a domain which has 50 object stores os1,
   os2, ... os50 and each object store has a file storage area. If
   a problem prevents os1 from being accessed and it is offline,
   then the storage areas in os2 through os50 also cannot be
   accessed in Content Consistency Checker, even though those
   object stores are currently online.
   
   Consistency Checker allows the storage area to be selected for
   validation, but when you click Start to validate an error is
   thrown:
   
   "Validation was stopped due to an error. Exception:
   java.lang.Exception: Fatal Error - no Storage Areas were found
   to work on."
   
   Logs show that a request for the table definition for os1 fails
   because object store os1 cannot be accessed, although the system
   was performing a consistency check on a storage area in os2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Correcting the connectivity problem to the offline object store
   allows the other storage storage areas to be accessed via
   Consistency Checker.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of the Consistency Checker in any version prior to     *
   * 5.0.0.3-P8CE-FP003                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * If an object store is offline, it is not possible to access  *
   * any storage areas in other object stores (created after the  *
   * offline object store) with the Consistency Checker tool      *
   * which prevents running consistency checks on any of those    *
   * storage areas even though they are online.  The Consistency  *
   * Checker allows the storage area to be selected for           *
   * validation, but when you click Start to validate the         *
   * following error is displayed:                                *
   * "Validation was stopped due to an error. Exception:          *
   * java.lang.Exception: Fatal Error - no Storage Areas were     *
   * found to work on."                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.0.0.3-P8CE-FP003 or a later release to get the  *
   * fix for this issue.                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If the object store is offline (unavailable) an exception was
   being thrown (and not handled correctly) preventing the building
   a the list of storage areas to process.  The list was empty and
   therefore no check ran on selected storage area(s).  A fix has
   been applied for this problem in the Content Platform Engine
   Consistency Checker tool release 5.0.0.3-P8CE-FP003.
