QUESTION
 How do I to configure LDAP strong authentication (SSL) in IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control ? 

CAUSE
LDAP servers can be configured to disable support for simple bind requests, imposing the use of strong authentication. When the LDAP server is configured in this way, the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control LDAP authentication must be configured to use SSL.

ANSWER
Complete the following steps to configure this capability: 

1. Obtaining the LDAP certificate: The first step is to obtain the certificate from your LDAP server so that it can be added to the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control server truststore. 

 * Log on to your domain controller, as Administrator 
 * Open the certificates snap-in (computer account) 
 * Expand the certificates tree and locate the appropriate certificate 
 * Click the certificate in the right panel, and select All tasks>Export 
 * When the wizard window opens, click Next 
 * Select Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) and click Next 
 * Provide a name for the certificate and the directory that you want to save it to.

Note: If the option to also export the private key is offered, select “ No, do not export the private key”

2. Copy the exported *.cer file to the remote control server. 

3. Importing the LDAP certificate into the remote control keystore:  * On the remote control server, run the ikeyman tool 
   
   path to ikeyman: <INSTALL_DIR>\server\java\jre\bin
   
   where <INSTALL_DIR>\ is the remote control server installation directory
   
 * Click Key Database Type > Open (default password is TrCWebAS) 
 * Ensure that JKS is selected as Key Database Type 
 * Browse to the key.jks file.
   
   The default location is:
   <INSTALL_DIR>\server\wlp\usr\servers\trcserver\resources\security\ 
   
   If a different keystore is being used, edit the ssl.xml file to determine the location of the key.jks file.
   The ssl.xml file is in the following directory.
   
   <INSTALL_DIR>\server\wlp\usr\servers\trcserver\
   
   Search for the <keyStore> tag. The location attribute provides the path to the keystore.
   For example:
   <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="TrCWebAS" type="PKCS12" location="C:\certs\server.p12"/>
   
   If the property does not contain a location attribute, the keystore file is in the default location. 

 * Select signer certificates (default is personal certificates) from the combo box in ikeyman 
 * Click Add and browse to the directory that you copied the exported *.cer file to. (you will be prompted to select an *.arm certificate but you can still select your Base-64 encoded X.509 certificate (*.cer) in the next window) 
 * Provide a label, a meaningful name that will help you to easily identify the certificate is recommended. 
 * Close ikeyman
   

4. Configuring the ldap.properties file: 
 * Ensure that the ldap.connectionURL property includes the correct port for SSL:
   
   ldap.connectionURL= ldaps://<my_ldap_server_url>:636
   
 * Click Submit
   

5. Restart the remote control server service.
