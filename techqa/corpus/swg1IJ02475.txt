   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Failover was working in an Impact cluster with the rba       *
   * add-on installed.                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * This issue was more of a procedural issue.                   *
   * The documented method of installing the rba add on into an   *
   * impact cluster was not correct.                              *
   * The rba docs will be updated in line with the release of     *
   * Impact 7.1 FP13.                                             *
