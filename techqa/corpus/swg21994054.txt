Title: IBM Applying patches to Cognos outside the TCR upgrade process - United States

Text:
gen_lightweight_ear restore.sh TCR Cognos patch independent TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is there a way to apply Cognos patches independent of TCR upgrade process? 

SYMPTOM
The execution of restore.sh failed with Target "gen_lightweight_ear" does not exist in the project
"CognosReportNetJ2EE"


CAUSE
JazzSM/reporting/cognos/war/p2pd/build.xml file do not have target to build gen_lightweight_ear.

For e.g., 
<target name="gen_lightweight_ear" depends="gen_lightweight_war,ear"
/><target name="gen_lightweight_ear"

ENVIRONMENT
TCR 3.1.2.1

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify if JazzSM/reporting/cognos/war/p2pd/build.xml has target for gen_lightweight_ear after issetup was successfully completed. It is possible that issetup in some Cognos fixes can override build.xml to remove the target for gen_lightweight_ear.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The smart upgrade process is introduced in TCR 3.1.3.0 to upgrade Cognos independent of TCR upgrade.
This process is documented in
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/tcr_original/ttcr_cognos_out_tcr.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/tcr_original/ttcr_cognos_out_tcr.html]

Prior to TCR 3.1.3.0, the process documented in the following technote can be used to patch/upgrade Cognos independent of TCR. 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967299 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967299]

If restore.sh fails can fail with the following error
BUILD FAILED
Target "gen_lightweight_ear" does not exist in the project
"CognosReportNetJ2EE

One of the ways to rectify is to take a back up of JazzSM/reporting/cognos/war/p2pd/build.xml before running issetup and restored it before running restore.sh if the target to build gen_lightweight_ear is removed by issetup.
