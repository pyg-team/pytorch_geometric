IBM PureApplication System; bash; bash bug; shellshock SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM PureApplication System. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6271 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error when evaluating specially crafted environment variables passed to it by the Bash functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7169 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, and the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96209 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96209] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7186 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7186]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7187 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7187]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an off-by-one error when handling deeply nested flow control constructs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277]

DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, and the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

 * IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs 
 * IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs 
 * IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to apply the fixes with the following direction: 
PureSystems Managers:

The PureSystems Managers on all IBM PureApplication System versions are affected. Upgrade the IBM PureApplication System to the following interim Fix (iFix) levels:


 * IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs:  * Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.0.0.4 iFix 9
   
   

 * IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs:  * Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.1.0.4 iFix 4
   
   

 * IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs:  * Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V2.0.0.0 iFix 2
   
   


Deployed Virtual Machines: 

Deployed AIX virtual machines are not affected. Upgrade all deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machines by using an emergency fix (eFix) provided by IBM: 
 * Download the eFix from IBM Fix Central (see the following link):
   
   http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=RedHat_Image_Bash_Vulnerability&includeSupersedes=0 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=RedHat_Image_Bash_Vulnerability&includeSupersedes=0]

 * Import the eFix into the IBM PureApplication System Emergency Fix catalog.

 * Apply this Emergency Fix on each deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machine. Bash is upgraded to version bash-4.1.2-15.e16_5.2. 



Images: 

For images, you can use the new default image, or you can extend and capture the existing image by using the following general procedure: 
 * Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.

 * From the image catalog, select the image and click "Extend."

 * After the image extend operation completes succcessfully, click Service from the deployed virtual machine.

 * Apply this emergency fix.

 * From the image catalog, capture the image.


Use this newly captured image for future deployment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
