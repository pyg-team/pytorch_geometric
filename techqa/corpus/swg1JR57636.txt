LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  You experience this issue when one of the process applications
   on the system contains an undercover agent (UCA) that is set to
   fire each first Monday within each year at 09:00.
   After the UCA fired on 01.01.2017, it failed for some reason.
   The UCA was converted to a ReplayOnHoldTask, which is scheduled
   for 01.02.2099.
   In the Event Manager Monitor (in Process Admin Console), the
   UCA's next schedule time is to be displayed, which would be
   04.01.2100. However, to stop computing next schedule times with
   invalid definitions all dates after 31.12.2099 return null,
   causing a NullPointerException if the schedule definition
    contains a "first day" specification.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be available in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.06
    that handles "first-day" specifications correctly.
