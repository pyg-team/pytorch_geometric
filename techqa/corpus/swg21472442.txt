ANSWER
Please follow the steps below: 


1) Run db2 command GET DB CFG 
2) Determine the current values for LOGFILSIZ, LOGPRIMARY, LOGSECOND fields.
3) Increase any or all of the them to satisfy the upgrade process.
Make sure you have enough disk space before increasing these.

from the Command Window :

Increase the size of the transaction log files, for example:

db2 connect to maximo 
db2 update db cfg using LOGFILSIZ 5000 
db2 connect reset

Increase the number of primary logs, for example:

db2 connect to maximo 
db2 update db cfg using LOGPRIMARY 50 
db2 connect reset

Increase the number of secondary logs, for example: 

db2 connect to maximo 
db2 update db cfg using LOGSECOND 50 
db2 connect reset

4) Stop and restart the database to put these into effect by running the db2 commands DB2STOP then DB2START.
