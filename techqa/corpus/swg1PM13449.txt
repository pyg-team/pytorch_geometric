APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  THis coccurs during testing SOAP services via the Web Services
   Explorer (WSE) component.
   1) Select the correct WSDL
   
   2) Add necessary Endpoint
   3) Populate test data
   4) Click Go
   5) Enter authentication Userid/Password
   6) Check result of test
   7) Fix any problems
   8) repeat steps 4, 6, 7.
   
   If step 7 takes any length of time, clicking Go,
   nothing happens. The only way to recover from this is
   to completely close WSE and start the whole process again.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Close WSE and start again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   All users whose web service calls take longer than the default
   timeout value.
   
   ****************************************************************
    PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   ****************************************************************
   If a user?s web service call session in Web Services Explorer
   takes longer than the default timeout value, the service fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Resolution:
   The hidden preference:
   org.eclipse.wst.ws.explorer.sessionTimeout
   was added.
   
   This preference represents the session timeout of the web
   service explorer in minutes.  Entering a negative value will
   disable timeouts completely.  If the
   preference is not set the default is still 30 minutes.
   
   This preference is not exposed through the user interface, but
   it can be set in three ways:
   at the product level you can edit your plugin_customization.ini
   file to add the
   line: org.eclipse.wst.ws.explorer/sessionTimeout=<timeout value>
   
   or at the workspace level you can add a line to this file (or
   create it if it does not exist)
   <workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.setting
   s\org.eclipse.wst.ws.explorer.prefs
   that contains this line: sessionTimeout=<timeout value>
   
   You can also set it via the config.ini.  If for any
   reason both a "hidden preference" and a config.ini property are
   both set, the config.ini property will take precedence.  The
   property to set in the
   config.ini is org.eclipse.wst.ws.exlorer.sessionTimeout
   
   e.g. org.eclipse.wst.ws.exlorer.sessionTimeout=60
