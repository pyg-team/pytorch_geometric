   1. Installation Manager rollback to previous version does not
   reinstall the IFixes which were deleted during the Fixpack
   upgrade. Review the installation history and reinstall all the
   IFixes which were associated with the previous version

   If you rolled back to a version earlier than V8.5.6 (V8.5.0.x
   or V8.5.5), then, before you can start the deployment
   environment, you must define a JVM argument for the WebSphere
   server JVMs that run Business Space. In the administrative
   console, go to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application
   servers. For each IBM BPM application cluster member (IBM BPM
   Advanced and IBM BPM Standard), or for the single IBM BPM
   application server (IBM BPM Express), perform the following
   steps:
   
       In the Name column, select the server link.
   
       In the Server Infrastructure section, expand Java and
   Process Management and select Process definition.
   
       In the Additional Properties section, select Java Virtual
   Machine.
   
       If "-Declipse.bundle.setTCCL=false" is not shown among the
   existing entries in the Generic JVM arguments field, add it to
   any existing entries and save your changes.
   
       Synchronize your changes to the managed nodes.
   
       To pick up the configuration changes, restart the IBM BPM
   application cluster (for IBM BPM Advanced or IBM BPM Standard)
   or the single IBM BPM application server (for IBM BPM Express).
   ============
   
   3. Add cross reference for rollback instructions between
   Install TAb and Profile upgrade TAB .
