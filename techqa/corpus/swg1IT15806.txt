APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using IBM MQ Version 7.5.0.6, a memory leak was observed
   in the amqrmppa process, when a SSL / TLS channel connection
   fails in a loop, for example due to an expired certificate in
   the key database of the queue manager. In this case the channel
   security handshake failed and the channel would reconnect and
   fail again and continue to do so in a loop. As a result the
   amqrmppa process continued to grow in memory consumption (swap
   space).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using SSL channels with applications often connecting and
   disconnecting to/from the queue manager.
   
   Scenarios in which SSL connections repeatedly fail and are
   rapidly retried, for example due to a configuration error, are
   more likely to experience this issue.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This problem occurred due to a timing window which could cause
   internal resources to fail to be cleaned up when multiple
   threads were starting and ending SSL sessions concurrently.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ queue manager has been updated to correctly clean up the
   internal resources in this scenario, preventing the memory leak.
