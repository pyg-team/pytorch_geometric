Title: IBM How to update the CPE 5.2.x Legacy Component Manager's JRE - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I update the Legacy Component Manager's JRE? 

CAUSE
Periodically, Oracle and IBM issue new JREs that contain critical Security fixes (PSIRT resolutions). These updated JREs must be made available to customers as quickly as possible. 

ANSWER
While the Case Foundation product provides a JRE that can be used with the Legacy Component Manager functionality, there have always been provisions for using other JREs. 

If a site installs their own JRE, they must test the JRE in a non-production environment with the Legacy Component Manager software before deploying the JRE for production use. 

While the the Case Foundation product supplies a Java 6 JRE, you can upgrade to a Java 8 JRE if one is available for your platform. Oracle, for example, no longer makes public updates to Java 6 or Java 7 JREs. 

The Legacy Component Manager was qualified with 32-bit JREs and you should continue to use a 32-bit JRE, as that is what has been qualified and tested.

Downloading the current Java 8 32-bit JREs

The latest Java 8 32-bit JRE for Linux is available from IBM here: 
https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/downloads/sdk8/ [https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/downloads/sdk8/]

Expand the Java SE Version 8 tree and click the Download Now button for the 32-bit platform. 
You will need an IBM ID to download the AIX JRE. 

The latest Java 8 32-bit JRE for Windows is available from Oracle here:

Use the Linux on z Systems 31-bit set of JREs and select Simple unzip with license (InstallAnywhere root not required)

Installing the new JRE for use by the Legacy Component Manager

Go to a server where the Legacy Component Manager is running. 
Often this is a Workplace or Workplace XT system. 


 1. If the Legacy Component Manager is running, go to the Process Task Manager application and stop the Component Manager software, and then close Process Task Manager.
    
 2. If on Windows, stop the service: From the Windows Services Console, stop the
    "Process WP XT Services Manager" (for Workplace XT) or the 
    "Process Application Engine Services Manager Service" for Application Engine.
    
 3. Important: All FileNet P8 Java processes must be stopped before proceeding with the installation.
    
 4. Create a backup the contents of the Router directory on the server where the Legacy Component Manager is running. 
    Example locations for the Router folder: 
    Workplace
    <install_path>/FileNet/AE/Router (UNIX)
    <install_path>\FileNet\AE\Router (Windows)
    Workplace XT:
    <install_path>/FileNet/WebClient/Router (UNIX)
    <install_path>\FileNet\WebClient\Router (Windows)
    
 5. Rename the current .../Router/java folder to .../Router/javabackup
    
 6. Install the updated JRE in a new .../Router/java folder. 
    
 7. When properly installed, there should be a .../Router/java/jre/bin folder containing the java executables. 
    
 8. If on Windows, restart the service: From the Windows Services Console, restart the 
    "Process Workplace XT Services Manager" (for Workplace XT) or the
    "Process Application Engine Services Manager Service" (for Application Engine).
    
 9. Restart Process Task Manager and Component Manager.


Repeat this procedure on all servers that are running the Legacy Component Manager software. 

The Legacy Component Manager is a deprecated feature of Case Foundation and CPE 5.2.1. Sites still using the Legacy Component Manager should be working towards putting their custom component code into the custom component framework that shipped with CPE 5.2.0 back in March 2013.
