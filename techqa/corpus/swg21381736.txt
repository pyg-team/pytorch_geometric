Title: IBM Password Change window does not appear after logon when password expiring with IBM Filenet IDM Web Services - United States

Text:
login; password; expiration; expire TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When setting an IBM FileNet Image Services password to expire after a certain date, a warning window appears when the user logs in through IDM Web Services. Clicking OK should bring up a window to change the password, but in this case the window fails to appear. No error messages are generated. 

CAUSE
This occurs when the user did not initially go to the home page for IDM Web Services, but started it up by calling an image directly. The docview.asp page does not support password expiration as part of logon.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the URL calling IDM Web Services. Logon is normally done through home.asp. If you are trying to logon through DocView.asp, then this problem will occur.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is fixed as of IDM Web Services 4.0.2 Fix Pack 5. The latest Fix Packs can be downloaded from Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].


Until the Fix Pack can be installed, a workaround is to logon through the home page whenever it is necessary to change the password.
