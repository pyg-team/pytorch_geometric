QUESTION
 Is ITCAM for J2EE supported with TCsite Tacton Configurator Server? 

ANSWER
TCsite Tacton Configurator Server (TCsite) is a product used to configure the Tomcat6 server and other applications, it runs on the Tomcat6 J2EE server. 


At this time, the TCsite Tacton Configurator Server product is not supported for use with ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1. 

However, we've seen the TCsite Tacton Configurator Server (tcserver) work with the ITCAM for J2EE product and the bundled Tomcat server successfully get configured... its just not a supported configuration at this time.
