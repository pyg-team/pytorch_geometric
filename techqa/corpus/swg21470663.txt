Title: IBM SAP Adapter throws SelectorException during migration from WBIA to JCA - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After migrating the artifacts from WBI mySAP Adapter on ICS to JCA SAP Adapter on WebSphere Process Server V7.0, the SAP Adapter throws an exception during runtime. 

SYMPTOM
The following exception is thrown during runtime:

Caused by: com.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: 
commonj.connector.runtime.SelectorException: Business object 
definition 
for 'sap_xyz' in namespace 
'http://www.ibm.com/websphere/crossworlds/2002/BOSchema/sap_xyz'
not found.. The adapter has not been configured for the IDoc Type... 


CAUSE
 WBI mySAP Adapter business objects did not contain the prefix "sap_", which is set by default when creating business object definitions with SAPODA. Thus it causes the JCA aAapter to throw a SelectorException during runtime as it expects "sap_" as the prefix of the business objects. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A new property "Default BO Prefix" has been introduced in the SAP JCA Adapter .


If you do not have any prefix or custom prefix set during discovery using SAPODA for the bo names, you can change this value as desired. 
The property is listed under the Advanced section with Group name Properties for migrated artifacts.

The allowed values are:
1. sap_ is the default value.
2. You can edit the field and provide your own prefix.
3. If the prefix needs to be empty or blank, Select "No Prefix" from the drop down.

Here is a screen shot of the property from the Properties tab:

- Adapter will use the changed prefix/no-prefix for business objects from the new property and use it during runtime to find the business object definitions. 

NOTE: This property only appears if the artifacts are imported using the migration tool. As of now this property is introduced only for an ALE interface.
