Title: IBM 'Audit As' property missing in Property Definition object in Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE). - United States

Text:
ACCE TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) when trying to configure "property auditing" as per the documentation in IBM knowledge center you can't configure step 4 as the property requested is located under 'More' tab which was included in Fix Pack 3 and above.

Step 4 in the documentation:
4. On the PropertyDefinition object, set its AuditAs property to the PropertyTemplate object that you used to create the custom PropertyDefinition object on the event class.

Steps to reproduce the issue:
1) Create a document class named TestDoc.
2) Create a custom property template named genericPropAuditTemplate.
3) Assign genericPropAuditTemplate to Creation, Deletion, Update event class under Property Definitions Tab.
4) Create a custom property template named TestProp.
5) Under Property Definitions for TestDoc class Add TestProp template.
6) Click on the template added and select More.
7) Set the value of "Audit As" to genericPropAuditTemplate.

In the 'PropertyDefinition' object, 'More' tab is missing preventing a user from accessing an 'AuditAs' property when using ACCE. 

CAUSE
'AuditAs' property was introduced in CE 5.2.1 FixPack 3.

ANSWER
Update Content Engine to 5.2.1 FixPack 3.
