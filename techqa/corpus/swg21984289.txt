PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) Repotools rebuidIndices fails with a ORA-02429 error if an Oracle Database is implemented. 

CAUSE
Rebuilding indexes fails during migration with the following error:


Rebuilding indices...
CRJAZ0577I The following SQL query did not execute properly on the server:
DROP INDEX TJTSDB.PRCSSPRCSSPRCSSRNTRNLDMNSHNDLD
java.sql.SQLException: ORA-02429: cannot drop index used for enforcement of unique/primary key at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:440) 

This is an Oracle issue


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the rebuild indices log the following SQL Errors occur: 


java.sql.SQLException: ORA-02429: cannot drop index used for enforcement of unique/primary key
at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:440)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A script called FixOraclePKIndexOrderProblem was made available by Development (through Support) and this tool repaired the problem within the database. 

However since Defect 180771 was fixed and resolved in CLM V4 this script is no longer required to workaround the problem and the issue should not occur post CLM V4 releases.
