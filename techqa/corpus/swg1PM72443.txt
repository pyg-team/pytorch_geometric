ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PE73718
   After upgrading your DFHCSD file to CICS version 4.2,
   you have applied PTF UK73718. You are now sharing
   the DFHCSD with CICS 3.2 regions.
   
   In the CICS 3.2 region startup, you have added RDO group
   DFHCOMPE in your Group List.
   
   You expect your CICS 3.2 region to install the DFHMIRS program
   definition from group DFHCOMPE, but it is being installed
   from Group DFHISC with the CICS 4.2 DFHMIRS definition.
   
   Your CICS 3.2 region receives the same symptoms as
   reported in apar PM46402 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM46402] because the wrong version of
   the DFHMIRS program definition has been installed.
   
   APAR PM46402 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM46402] fails to give required action information to
   run the RDO utility program DFHCSDUP to generate the
   DFHMIRS program definition into group DFHCOMPE.
   
   Additional Symptoms and Keywords: KIXREVEPH
   
   Message:

   DFHMIRS term <AAA. Updates to local recoverable
   resources will be backed out.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the RDO utility program DFHCSDUP specifying
   UPGRADE REPLACE to generate the DFHMIRS program
   definition into group DFHCOMPE.

   The CTS 3.2 region started to received abend AZI2 when doing
   function ship to a region which upgrade to CTS 4.2 and share
   CSD between each other. The problem is described by PM46402 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM46402],
   but the corresponding PTF UK73718 did not include a ++HOLD
   statement to tell user to run a CSD UPGRADE to pickup the
   change made to DFHCURDX.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  UK82075 UK73718
   Create a change in DFHCURDX and add a ++HOLD statement
   to indicate that a CSD UPGRADE is required for the fix in
   PM46402 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM46402] to take effect.
