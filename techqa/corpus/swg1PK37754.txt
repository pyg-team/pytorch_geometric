ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Window displaying a child record in ClearQuest Web is too small
   to view entire record without resizing or scrolling
   2003.06.15 and 2003.06.16
   In ClearQuest web, if you click on a child record from the paren
   t record, the child record pops-up in a separate window, but he
   size of the window is smaller than the record and requires the u
   ser to re-size the window or use the scroll bars to see the enti
   re record.
   This can be reproduced in the Defect Tracking schema with the SA
   MPL database.
   Steps to reproduce in the SAMPL db:
   Add a Customer record to one of the Defect records in the SAMPL
   database,
   and then open it in New CQ Web, you must scroll
   
   horizontally to see the full width of the record.
   
   I thought that this Could this be related to PK02928, but after
   showing this behavior to Shreedhar he indicated this is a differ
   ent issue and to submit a defect.
   FYI, this works ok in 7.0.
   I have attached a picture of what I mean.
   
   I am using Internet Explorer V6.0.2900.2180 with SP2.
