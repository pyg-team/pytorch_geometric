Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you increase the session timeout duration in Cognos Disclosure Management. 10.2.1 (and above)


CAUSE
When leaving the computer unattended for extended periods the CDM session will expire and error "Unknown Error has occurred" is received.
Any unsaved work will be lost. 


ANSWER
CDM does not auto save and un-saved work. 

All work should be saved and checked in if leaving the application unattended for extended periods. 

The session timeout can be increased to alleviate the issue. The default session time out is 2 hours. 

 

To change the time-out settings: 

1. Edit the file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\CognosDM Server\config\CDM.config. 

2. Locate the xml configuration element <SessionExpiraton>

<SessionExpiration enabled="true" timeAfterLogOn="1.00:00:00" acceptedIdleTime="02:00:00">

3. Increase the 'acceptedIdleTime' attribute to desired level.

4. Save and Restart the Application Server
