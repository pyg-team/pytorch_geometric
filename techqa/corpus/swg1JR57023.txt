APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you define a business process definition (BPD) or process
   with a system task in a lane that is not marked as a system
   lane, you see the following warning in the SystemOut.log of the
   server:
   
   Could not resolve a valid user for system task. Defaulting to
   user '<username>'
   
   This warning appears when none of the defined system lane users
   of your system are members of the default lane team that
   contains the system task.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the system creates a system task in a non-system lane, it
   incorrectly checked the members of the default lane team to look
   for a matching system lane user.
   
   In a non-system lane, system tasks must be owned by the first
   system lane user. The system lane users are defined in the
   Authentication Alias settings for the IBM BPM deployment
   environment in the WebSphere Application Server administrative
   console.
   
   In a system lane, system tasks must be owned by a system lane
   user who is found in the default lane team of the system lane.
   If that team does not contain any of the system lane users, the
   first system lane user owns the task and a warning is logged in
   the SystemOut.log file of the server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that corrects the logic to check only the default lane team for
   system tasks that are in a system lane.
