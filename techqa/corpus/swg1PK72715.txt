ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You attempt to run the CINB CICS IA background transaction from
   a terminal and receive message:
   .
   CIU3311E  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid Transaction CINB must be
                                      initiated by transaction CINT
   .
   The JESMSGLG also contains the following messages:
   .
   DFHAP0001 applid   An abend (code 0C7/AKEA) has occurred at
                      offset X'0000060C' in module CIUCINB1
   DFHME0116 applid
   (Module:DFHMEME) CICS symptom string for message DFHAP0001 is
   PIDS/5655M1500 LVLS/650 MS/DFHAP0001 RIDS/DFHSRP PTFS/HCI6500
   AB/S00C7 AB/UAKEA RIDS/CIUCINB1 ADRS/0000060C
   .
   The S0C7 data exception occurs on a SP instruction at offset
   X'5DE' into CIUCINB1 due to the TIME_LAST_SAVE packed field
   not being initialized. The INIT routine issues calls the
   CALL_CIUMSGM subroutine to issue the CIU3311E message and upon
   return branches unconditionally back to its caller at offset
   x'2F8' where the MAIN routine is then invoked.  As the CIU3311E
   message does not result in an abend, the RETURN at offset x'2F8'
   in CIUCINB1 should be an EXEC CICS RETURN or the CIU3311E should
   be modified to produce its own abend code.
