APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In data marshalling library shipped in WAS (marshall.jar), it
   has been using the same code to convert DBCS EBCDIC strings
   to/from COBOL/C/PL/I programs running on z/OS (MVS) ever since
   Java 2.  The issue comes in when using Java 8 and a 'null'
   terminated string on the host that needs to be converted to a
   Java string on the client.
   
   This is expected behavior from IBM JDK 8 which is inline with
   the Cp935 converter specification.
   
   Older JDK releases (before IBM Java 8) use IO converters and the
   behavior observed with those releases is due to a bug with IO
   converters.
   
   This means the marhall.jar needs to provide a
   -Dsome.java.system.property so that the Java 8 behavior can be
   tolerated by existing applications.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Data marshalling null terminated DBCS   *
   *                      EBCDIC strings contain Unicode          *
   *                      replacement characters                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Running under Java 8, using the marshall.jar library to data
   marshall null terminated DBCS EBCDIC strings from
   COBOL/C/PL/I programs running on z/OS, the strings are returned
   with Unicode replacement characters where the null characters
   are in the data stream. Prior to Java 8, the null characters
   were removed from the returned string.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A behavior change the Java 8 runtime has been accounted for,
   and a fix is provided.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.13.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
