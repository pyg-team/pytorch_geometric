 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You attempt to install a Sync Manager from iNotes by click "Install Subscripton". However the installation stalls with the error message: 

"Unable to download file Korean.DAT The Korean language resources are not supported by the server."


CAUSE
By default the Domino Off-Line Services (DOLS) installer checks the operating system to determine the language to install. When you launch the DOLS installer, a pop-up menu appears with several options, including installing a subscription and choosing a language. If no language is specified, the default is the language of the operating system.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the Language Setting of International in iNotes Preferences from Korean to English.

Install the Korean language pack on Domino server.
