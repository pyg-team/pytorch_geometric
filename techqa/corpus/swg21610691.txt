PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to access IBM Rational Team Concert results in performance degradation, hung threads and 'Rootservices has not been defined' errors. 

SYMPTOM
This behaviour will be seen across the IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) suite, including IBM Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) and IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC). 

The following error will be logged in the IBM WebSphere Application server SystemOut.log:
webcontainer E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.WebContainer handleRequest SRVE0255E: A WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle /<CLM_application>/rootservices has not been defined

Additionally, the following behaviors may be encountered 

 * Hung thread messages in the WebSphere Application Server SystemOut.log
   
   
 * The WebSphere Application server becomes hung and unable to process any new or existing requests 
   
   
 * Performance Degradation


CAUSE
During the authentication process, the CLM applications generate an internal HTTP request. If this HTTP request fails, there will be delays in completing the authentication process which causes a bottleneck. The bottleneck can cause threads to hang and eventually exhaust the webcontainer thread pool.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modify the alias used in the WebSphere Application Server virtualhost (that was configured for the CLM application) to use a"*" instead of the public url.
