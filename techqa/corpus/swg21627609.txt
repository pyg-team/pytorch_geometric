QUESTION
 Implementing Content Search Services (CSS) and the need to re-index P8 content even if indexes were already created using Legacy Content Search Engine (LCSE) 

ANSWER

IBM Content Search Services 

The intent of this document is to address implementing Content Search Services (CSS) and the need to re-index P8 content even if indexes were already created using Legacy Content Search Engine (LCSE). 

Content Search Services is an IBM developed indexing engine and application that is functionally equivalent to Legacy Content Search Engine. Content Search Services is based on Lucene technology whereas Legacy Content Search Engine is based on Autonomy K2 technology. Therefore, existing content indexes cannot be used by Content Search Services. 

IBM introduced the Content Search Services component as part of the IBM FileNet Content Manager 5.0 release. Content Search Services is a replacement for Legacy Content Search Engine. The last IBM FileNet Content Manager release to include Legacy Content Search Engine as a component is 5.2. Support for Legacy Content Search Engine stops in June 2015. Specific information about the deprecation of Legacy Content Search Engine can be found at this URL

To utilize Content Search Services installation and configuration is required to index all the object store content that will be the subject of content-based retrievals. Further, all custom applications that make use of content-based retrievals, must be modified to comply with Content Search Services query requirements. 

Question and Answers 

 * Why the shift to Content Search Services, CSS?  * 
    * 
    * Which version of CSS should be used? 
    * The recommended minimum level of CSS is 5.1.0.0-P8CSS-IF002 which should be installed with Content Engine 5.1 and Fix Pack 1 (5.1.0.1-P8CE-FP001). You are encouraged to stay current on all FileNet components including CSS so that you can take advantage of fixes, and new features and functionality. 
    * Additional information can be found in Tech Note 1574850 at this URL, 
    * http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21574850 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21574850] 
    * Are dissimilar versions of CSS and Content Engine compatible? 
    * Currently CSS and Content Engine must be on the same software release. For a list of compatible versions refer to the FileNet Fix Pack Compatibility matrices which can be downloaded from the following URL: 
    * http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg27014734 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg27014734] 
    * What is Migration? 
    *  Migration is the process of Indexing content using Content Search Services Updating applications that use content-based retrieval to use the query syntax required by Content Search Services 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Why must the migration occur?  * 
    * 
    * Are any fix packs or Interim Fixes needed for migration purposes? 
    * You are always recommended to install the latest versions of both Content Engine and Content Search Services. 
    * The minimum recommended software levels are detailed in Tech Note 1595156: 
    * http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21595156 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21595156] 
    * Will P8 platform versions beyond 5.1 support Legacy Content Search Engine? 
    * No, IBM FileNet Content Manager 5.1 is the last release that supports Legacy Content Search Engine. To avoid periods without content-based retrieval support, generate Content Search Services indexes using the IBM FileNet Content Manager 5.1 software before upgrading to newer releases. 
   
   
 * How much the time is needed for migration or how can I estimate the time required for the migration to complete?  * 
    * 
    *  Number of object stores with content that requires indexing Quantity of existing content objects that require indexing Ingestion rate and size of new content during indexing period Hardware resources dedicated to Content Search Services Time required to update applications used for content-based retrieval 
    * 
    * 
    * To generate an estimate for regenerating the CSS indexes, test the index generation in a non-production environment, but with production data.
   
   
 * What is the space needed for migration or how can I estimate the space required for the migration to complete or what is the average size of a CSS index?  * 
    * 
   
   
 *  Is the migration process specific to a single object store, multiple object stores or all object stores?  * 
    * 
    * Can a migration job be stopped? 
    * You can not cancel or delete a migration job once it starts. It can be paused via the scheduling process, which means it could be paused indefinitely. The migration is started when you enable CSS (via FEM). When this happens FEM prompts the user to let them know that enabling CSS will cause the migration to start. 
   
   
 * Can I configure a brand new object store to use CSS if I have other existing object stores that are currently configured for indexing using LCSE?  * 
    * 
    * Which clients, Workplace, Workplace XT, and IBM Content Navigator are functional with CSS? 
    * Support for Content Search Services indexes was introduced in 
    *  Application Engine 4.0.2 FP12 Workplace XT 1.1.5 IBM Content Navigator 2.0.0 
    * 
    * 
    * IBM Content Navigator bundles IBM Content Analytics, but IBM Content Analytics has no compatibility with any aspect of Content Search Services. Separate indexes need to be created for Content Search Services and IBM Content Analytics. 
    * What are the other P8 components that require fix packs or new releases for CSS compatibility? 
    * All 5.1 core P8 platform components are CSS compatible. Also, the following add-on components with the noted fix packs are CSS compatible: 
    *  Sharepoint Webparts 2.2.2 GA Quicker 1.1 Fix Pack 2 CMIS 1.0 Fix Pack 2 Application Engine 4.0 Fix Pack 12 ICC for Files / ICC for email 2.2.0 Fix Pack 2 IBM Enterprise Records 5.1 Fix Pack 1 IBM Case Manager 5.1 FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office 1.1.5 Fix Pack 5 eDiscovery 2.2 Fix Pack 3 
    * 
    * 
    * If validation or testing of the migration process is desired, testing of the migrated content can be achieved via the use of a compatible client such as Workplace XT 1.1.5. However there are likely to be some discrepancies in the results generated by Legacy Content Search Engine and Content Search Services. The discrepancies are caused by the differences in the search engines and the query syntax. Detailed information regarding the differences can be found in the P8 5.1 Information Center under the SQL Syntax Reference topic. 
    * New object store considerations 
    * New object stores can be created and indexed using CSS only even though other object stores are currently using LCSE or if the migration process is invoked for other object stores. Also, any new object stores configured for content based searching must be configured to use CSS, even if there are other existing object stores which are currently using LCSE. 
    * Is the shut down of the Legacy Content Search Engine specific to all object stores or can it be accomplished against individual object stores? 
    * Shut down of LSCE can be done at the object store level and at the document class level. However, it is recommended that shut down only occur at the object store level. 
    * Can LCSE be restarted once it is turned off? 
    * LCSE cannot be restarted. The design that has been implemented prohibits the restarting of LCSE, therefore testing of migrated content needs to be accomplished prior to the shut down of LCSE for any object store.
