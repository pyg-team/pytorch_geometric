Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is installed on the operating system shipped via IBM Service Delivery Manager. IBM Service Delivery Manager has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2105 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2109 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2109]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error. By reading specially crafted ASN.1 data from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available resources and exhaust memory.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112857] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2176 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2176]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, by sending an overly long ASN.1 string to the X509_NAME_oneline () function, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to return arbitrary stack data in the buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112858] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
