QUESTION
 Does ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1 support WLS 12.1.1? 

CAUSE
According to the Software Product Compatibility Report for ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1- 
http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/prereqsForProduct?deliverableId=1369837892213&osPlatforms=AIX|HP|Linux|Solaris|Windows&duComponentIds=S000&mandatoryCapIds=62|26&optionalCapIds=30|132|223 [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/prereqsForProduct?deliverableId=1369837892213&osPlatforms=AIX|HP|Linux|Solaris|Windows&duComponentIds=S000&mandatoryCapIds=62|26&optionalCapIds=30|132|223]

Weblogic 12.0 is shown as being supported but not 12.1

ANSWER
Yes, despite what the Compatibility Report shows, WebLogic 12.1 and it's future fix packs are supported. There mostly likely is a typo in the report as there is only a WebLogic version 12.1, version 12.0 does not exist.
