APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I created a pattern with the ODR dynamic cluster advanced option
   selected.  The pattern is 1 dmgr, 1 custom node, 1 IHS node, 1
   ODR node.  Elasticity is enabled.
   
   I deployed the virtual system and set min instances to 2 for the
   ODR dynamic cluster (OdrDC).
   
   I accepted the runtime task to add a VM.
   
   The runtime task fails and I see that there is now a new VM
   added to the dynamic cluster and the server is in stopped state:
   OdrDC_CloudBurstNode_5_1
   
   Since the server is in stopped state, I get another add VM
   task.
   
   There is also a stand alone ODR server that is in started
   state. This server should not get created at all.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5.5                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Elasticity adds On demand router to     *
   *                      dynamic cluster, but is not started     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A virtual system is deployed with a pattern including a
   dynamic cluster of On demand routers (ODRs). The ODR is
   created but not started. Therefore, another new ODR is
   created, again in a stopped state. This could go on
   indefinitely.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was updated to properly add and start ODRs to achieve
   a dynamic cluster's minimum instances.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
