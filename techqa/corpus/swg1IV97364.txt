APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Determining the displayed FQDN" documentation (
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPLFC_7.3.0/com.ibm
   .taddm.doc_7.3/AdminGuide/c_cmdb_fqdn.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPLFC_7.3.0/com.ibm.taddm.doc_7.3/AdminGuide/c_cmdb_fqdn.html] ) describes 6 methods
   for FQDN determination. But both code review and delivered APAR
   IV68846 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV68846] suggest that they are now 8 instead 6. The full
   documentation section should be reviewed and corrected to
   describe the current status.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The "Determining the displayed FQDN" section in Admin guide

   now 8 instead 6 methods. The two new methods should be added to
   this section.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The section:
   Administering > TADDM overview > Discovery process overview >
   Determining the displayed FQDN
   modified to add Method 7 and Method 8.
