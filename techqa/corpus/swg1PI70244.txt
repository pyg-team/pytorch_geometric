   selector (or some other combination) impacts the search result.
   
   Test case 1 - multi user/group selector
   
   1. Create Administration -> Users, groups and domains ->
   Workflow, reporting and Others -> Add group MG_NA, and 2 group
   MG_CA and MG_US under MG_NA, create a user MG_U1 for MG_CA and
   user MG_U2 for MG_US
   2. Open Administration -> Users, groups and domains -> Security
   Domains -> Associate MG_NA to group, Assign MG_NA to OpenPages
   Modules - All Permission
   3. Administration -> profile -> SOXTask -> Action Assignee ->
   set to Multi user/group selector
   4. Create Action item and set Action Assignee to MG_NA
   5. Login as MG_U1
   6. Open Remediation -> Action Items -> My Action Items (
   existing filter) => noticed the record with MG_NA as Action
   assignee does not return
   
   Expect the record with MG_NA as Action assignee return.
   
   Test case 2 - Single user/group selector
   
   1. Create Administration -> Users, groups and domains ->
   Workflow, reporting and Others -> Add group MG_NA, and 2 group
   MG_CA and MG_US under MG_NA, create a user MG_U1 for MG_CA and
   user MG_U2 for MG_US
