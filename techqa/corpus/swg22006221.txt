What is Migration? Migrating involves collecting the configuration information from a previous release of a WebSphereÂ® Application Server and merging it into a configuration for a new release. 

The goal of migrating your application servers to a newer version of WebSphere Application Server is for the migrated servers to behave as closely as possible to how they behaved in the previous release. 

After you migrate the servers, you can further configure them to take advantage of the new version's features. 

Applications that are installed in the old environment are redeployed to the new application server without any changes. To use new technologies that are available in the newer (migrated) version, you must update your applications. 

WebSphere Application Server Version 9.0 provides migration tools which support migration strategies such as: 

 

 *   * Local or remote:  * Migrating within the same host or machine, or migrating to new ones 
      
      
   
    *  Standard or clone (V9.0 Feature):  * Disable the old profile after migration, or keep the old profile functional 
      
      
   
   

Regardless of the type of migration, you can use the command-line or GUI tools to migrate your product configuration to a newer version.
