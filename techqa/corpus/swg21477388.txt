Title: IBM Doing a means test on a categorical variable in Custom Tables - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am creating a table using IBM SPSS Statistics Custom Tables. I have a categorical variable (5-point scale, for example) in the stub, and a categorical variable in the banner. I would like to display the mean of the stub variable, but also test that mean for significant differences. IBM SPSS Statistics does not allow me to do this, though, since it only tests means on scale variables. I get an error message that says: 

"Pairwise comparisons are requested but no eligible subtables are found in table '1'." 

If I make the stub variable a scale variable, then I lose the categorical information. What can I do to get the significance of the column means ? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM SPSS Statistics Custom Tables allows you to use the same variable as both a categorical and summarized, or scale, variable. In your example, place the variable in the Rows banner as a categorical variable. Then, in the variable list window, right click on the variable and select Scale from the pop-up menu. Put that variable in the Rows dimension as well, placing it under the categorical variable. (You may want to set the Position in the Summary Statistics to "Rows." This will put the count and the mean in one column rather than the count in one column and the mean in a separate column.) Now, in the Test Statistics window, you may select the Compare Column Means (t-test) check box. You will then get a table that has the categorical information for that variable as well as column means and the significance testing for those means
