Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in MD5 Signature and Hash Algorithm affects Sterling Integrator and Sterling File Gateway (CVE-2015-7575) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The MD5 “SLOTH” vulnerability on TLS 1.2 affects Sterling Integrator and Sterling File Gateway. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Sterling Integrator 5.1 

Sterling File Gateway 2.1

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The following table provides instructions on how to make configuration changes to Sterling Integrator 5.1. After making the necessary changes, you will need to stop and restart Sterling Integrator in order for these changes to take effect. 

 

If you use: Then do this: Sterling Integrator 5.1 or 
Sterling File Gateway 2.1  1. Upgrade to Sterling Integrator 5104_9 if Sterling Integrator version is lower than 5104_9
    
 2. Put following entries in customer_overrides.properties

IBM recommends the use of strong ciphers in the configuration for adapters and services. 

WSMQ adapters and services
MQFTE adapters and services
CD:Server adapters and services IBM recommends the use of strong ciphers in the configuration for adapters and services and not to use the cipher with MD5. You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the MD5 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
