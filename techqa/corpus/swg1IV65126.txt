APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   ITM 6.3.0 environment with Agents only and Agents with TEMS
     to which they connect. The behavior seems to be different when
     TEMS is present in the environment.
   Problem Description:
     When reconfiguring an agent with a secondary TEMS connection
   the
     HotStdby column on Manage Tivoli Enterprise Services
   Monitoring
     (MTEMS) does not indicate Yes, it does not change. The
   behavior
     changed between 6.2.3 and 6.3.0. On 6.2.3 adding a secondary
   TEMS
     connection changes the HotStdby column on MTEMS from No to
   Yes.
     However, on 6.3.0 when a secondary TEMS connection is enabled
   the
     HotStdby column does not change.
   Recreate Instructions:
     Example that shows the HotStdby column correctly.
     ITM release is 6.3.0 GA or any 6.3.0 fixpack.
     1.  Install a HUB TEMS that has at least a Windows OS Agent
         connected to it.
     2.  Do NOT configure the Hub TEMS for failover or a secondary
         TEMS.
     3.  On the Windows OS agent Reconfigure and select "Optional
         Secondary TEMS Configuration"
     4.  Configure Secondary TEMS Configuration
     5.  Enter the protocol and hostname and/or IP Address and
   press
         OK and then OK to accept the changes.
     6.  Observe the MTEMS and you will see that the HotStdby
   column
         will change from "NO" to "YES".
     Failing Scenario
     1.  Install just the Windows OS agent.
     2.  On the Windows OS agent Reconfigure and select "Optional
         Secondary TEMS Configuration"
     3.  Configure Secondary TEMS Configuration
     4.  Enter the protocol and hostname and/or IP Address and
   press
         OK and then OK to accept the changes.
     5.  Observe the MTEMS and you will see that the HotStdby
   column
         does NOT change from "NO" to "YES".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no workaround for this issue. The setting is purely
   cosmetic.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  HotStdby column of Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services
   is not correct.
   
   
   Agents can be configured with Hot Standby or Secondary TEMS
   (Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server).  When configured this
   way, the HotStdby column of Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
   Services (MTEMS) always shows "No" when the value should be
   "Yes".  The underlying configuration file for the agent is
   correct.  The MTEMS just shows the wrong value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to display the correct value.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-IT
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  To verify the true setting, select the agent on the MTEMS,
   right-click, and select "Reconfigure".  If the check box
   "Optional Secondary TEMS Connection" is selected, then the
   setting is in effect.  Once the setting is verified, cancel
   the reconfigure.
