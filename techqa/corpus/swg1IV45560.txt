APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM: When Forgot your password link is directly accessed as:
   http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=l
   oad&j_username=<user> [http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=load&j_username=<user>]
   then  for the first time the request is forwarded to Self
   Service UI Logon page with the error as:
   CTGIMU566E:A required field does not have a specified value.
   Whereas subsequent calls to this url works properly and request
   is forwarded to "Forgot your password" page.
    STEPS TO DUPLICATE:
   1. Close all browser windows (Internet Explorer or Firefox).
   2. Open a new browser window.
      Put:
   http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=l
   oad&j_username=<user> [http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=load&j_username=<user>]
      into the URL field (insert your ISIM server address and a
      valid username) and press enter.
   3. The request is forwarded to  the Self Service UI Logon page
      with the error that value for the "User ID" is missing:
      ---
      CTGIMU566E
      A required field does not have a specified value.
      ---
   4. Open a new browser tab and close the first one. Try the same
      scenario. This time the "Forgot Your Password" page is
      displayed.
   
   DESIRED BEHAVIOR: When Forgot your password link is directly
   accessed as:
   http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=l
   oad&j_username=<user> [http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=load&j_username=<user>]
   then for the first time request should be forwarded to "Forgot
   your password" page.
   This problem may also cause the failure when
   resetting the password through WebSeal.
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create one user in ISIM withe two accounts, an
   ITIM and SAM.  The ITIM account should be enabled as change
   password with next logon.
   2. Try to login to ISIM self service UI through WebSeal.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  While calling 'Forgot your password' link the from a custom
   page, pass the additional parameter 'browserOffset' in query
   string as below:
   http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=l
   oad&j_username=<user>&browserOffset=<offsetvalue> [http://<hostname>/itim/self/Login/ChallengeResponse.do?command=load&j_username=<user>&browserOffset=<offsetvalue>]
   
   The value of browserOffset will be the time difference between
   the GMT and client's local timezone in minutes.
