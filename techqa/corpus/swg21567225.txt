SYMPTOM

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. From FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) - change the Default Storage Area and/or Policy of the Preferences Document Class to the desired Database Store. 
 2. Log into WPXT as an administrator and open Site Preferences. 
 3. From FEM - select object store where the preferences files resided - Root Folder - Preferences folder and delete existing WPXT preferences. 
 4. Select Apply in WPXT and save the site preferences which generates a new preferences file and stores it into the database store.
