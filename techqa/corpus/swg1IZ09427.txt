APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The manner in which the probe is shut down is what is causing
   the lack of probe watch messages. When the probe is started
   and not put in the background, stop the probe with Ctrl+C, you
   will get the probe watch message "Going Down". As far as I know,
   Ctrl+C is the same as kill -2 (interrupt).
   .
   However, if you just kill the PID you gets no messages and the
   log file terminates abruptly. W
   .
   The reason no probe watch messages are found for the probe for
   stopping under PA is probably due to the fact that PA uses a
   kill also.
