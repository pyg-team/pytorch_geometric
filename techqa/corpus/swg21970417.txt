ABSTRACT
 The Netcool/OMNIbus Socket Java Probe will be available to download from December 10, 2015. 

CONTENT
 

This is a new socket probe that can be configured to work in either Client mode or Server mode. In Server mode, the probe is a multiheaded probe that acts as a single process concurrent server which accepts multiple client connections. In Client mode, the probe connects to a socket to which a device writes its events.

This probe has been created to address the following enhancement requests:

 * RFE 43179, RFE 50920, RFE 61527: A secure connection can be established using the new Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) feature. This probe supports TLSv1 protocol.
 * RFE 36469: The ParserElementDelimiter property now accepts Java Regular Expression, allowing users to specify multiple characters as delimiters. This enhancement is also applicable to the new ParserNVPDelimiter property to tokenize name-value pairs.
 * RFE 53841: The probe can now be configured to receive heartbeat messages to avoid entering into the Inactivity state.
