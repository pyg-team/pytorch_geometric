PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to run an IBM Rational Jazz Team Server (JTS) "Common" job fails with an error "java.lang.IllegalStateException: This service proxy does not have a reference to the most current instance in the service manager". 

SYMPTOM
Steps to reproduce:



 1. Migrate data warehouse to a different database, for example, from Derby to IBM DB2
    
    
 2. Run the JTS Common job using the WebUI:
    
    https://[your-server-name]:[port]/jts/admin#action=com.ibm.team.reportsManagement.etlConfig


The job fails and the following error message appears in the JTS log file: 


 WARN internal.registry.AbstractActivationManagerOwner - An error occurred while trying to execute a service method java.lang.IllegalStateException: This service proxy does not have a reference to the most current instance in the service manager. If you hit this problem, your code is most likely holding onto a stale service reference and using it after it has been deactivated. 


CAUSE
The root cause of this problem is the change in the database settings for data warehouse connection.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SOLUTION 

Restart the JTS server to prevent the errors.
