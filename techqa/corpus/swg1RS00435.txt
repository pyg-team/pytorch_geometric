APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  QP presolve may not properly handle a model with
   an indefinite Q matrix with zeros in the diagonal
   and the associated variables being fixed.  The most likely
   scenario for this involves the fixed model associated
   with a MIQP with binaries, since CPLEX can convexify the
   objective and handle the MIQP part.
   
   Example:
   
   
         enter bug
   #       Minimize
   #        obj: z + [
   #             4704 x(5.5) * x(6.1)
   #             + 3696 x(5.5) * x(6.2)
   #             + 756 x(5.5) * x(6.3)
   #             + 13664 x(5.5) * x(7.1)
   #             + 10736 x(5.5) * x(7.2)
   #             + 2196 x(5.5) * x(7.3)
   #             + 6344 x(5.5) * x(7.4)
   #             + 16836 x(5.5) * x(7.6)
   #             + 13664 x(5.5) * x(7.7)
   #             ] / 2
   #       Subject To
   #        defobj:     z  = 0
   #       Bounds
   #             x(5.5) = 0
   #             x(6.1) = 1
   #             x(6.2) = 0
   #             x(6.3) = 0
   #             x(7.1) = 0
   #             x(7.2) = 1
   #             x(7.3) = 0
   #             x(7.4) = 0
   #             x(7.6) = 0
   #             x(7.7) = 0
   #             z Free
   #       End
   #       opt
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For MIQPs, use can do the convexification themselves, i.e.
   add X^2 - X for the binary variables to the objective to turn
   the indefinite Q matrix into a definite one.   However,
   recommend downloading 12.2.0.1 instead.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  With an MIQP with binary variables, QP presolve may crash if all
   the diagonal elements of the Q matri are 0.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Workaround exists, but is somewhat cumbersome.  Fix provided in
   fixpack 12.2.0.1
