APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM SPSS C&DS 6.0 FP1 does not display double-byte Chinese
   characters well within the Deployment Manager (web client) >
   Model Management panel.
   
   This occurs even if the OS region settings have been set to use
   China as the location of the host machine.
   
   Problem appears when Chinese characters are used for the stream
   and repository folder name. Instead of the expected characters,
   either question marks or gibberish.
   
   End-user would expect to see the appropriate double-byte Chinese
   characters used for their stream and repository folder name as
   it is displayed when using Deployment Manager thick client.
