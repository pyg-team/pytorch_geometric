PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to manually explore HTTPS pages in IBM Security AppScan Standard result with a blank page being displayed. 

SYMPTOM
 

When manually exploring the application (or recording a login sequence) through HTTPS, AppScan browser shows a blank page. The same happens when using any external browser with proxy settings to AppScan. However, the same external browsers running as a stand alone, show correctly the pages.  

The traffic log from Manual Explore may end with the following request/response:
Request:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Response:
HTTP/1.1 0 Unknown
Content-Length: 0


CAUSE
AppScan is trying to negotiate the protocol by sending ClientHello in SSLV2 with a hint that can also communicate with protocols SSLV3 and TLSV1. However, the Server rejects clients sending requests with SSLV2 protocol. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Whireshark tool may help diagnosing the problem. 

In this specific case, the server was accepting only TLS 1.0 protocol and rejecting any other protocols.
The Wireshark log shows that a stand alone Internet Explore (displaying correctly the pages) is using the TLS 1.0 protocol: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616440&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616440&aid=1] 

 

AppScan is trying to negotiate the SSL version 2.0 protocol first, however, the server reject the connection with a "Handshake Failure": 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616440&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616440&aid=2]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Select the protocol accepted by the server with option: Tools -> Options -> SSL Support 


For example, if your server supports only the TLS 1.0 protocol, choose as follows: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616440&amp;aid=3]
