Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In some cases, you might have to perform some setup before you can connect to an Oracle database by using the Oracle OCI Default driver. 

SYMPTOM
You might see the following error: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: ocijdbc10 (Library is already loaded in another ClassLoader).


CAUSE
The PATH environment variable and jar list are not set up correctly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the PATH environment variable is set as indicated below. Set the JAR list as indicated when you create the connection to the Oracle database. 

Oracle 11 - Oracle 11 OCI Driver Default: 

 * PATH contains$ORACLE_HOME\bin 
 * Jar list contains$ORACLE_HOME\jdbc\lib\ojdbc6.jar or $ORACLE_HOME\jdbc\lib\ojdbc5.jar


Oracle 10 - Oracle 10 OCI Driver Default:  * PATH contains$ORACLE_HOME 
 * Jar list contains$ORACLE_HOME\classes12.jar or $ORACLE_HOME\ojdbc14.jar


Be sure to remove other JAR list entries that point to other versions or copies of the JAR files. Stop and restart the product after you change the PATH environment variable. RELATED INFORMATION
