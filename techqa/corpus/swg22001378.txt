Title: IBM ITX 9.0.0.x PARSE() function generates corrupted output data - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using the IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) 9.0.0.x PARSE() function may generate corrupted output from the map. This issue is similar to the issue in https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21989892 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21989892]. 

SYMPTOM
Information from prior rules (earlier in the card / map) may be 'overlaid' onto part of the output from the PARSE() function.

Example expected output:

UNB+UNOA:3+STYLUSSTUDIO:1+DATADIRECT:1+20051107:1159+6002'

...corrupted in output to:

UNB+U{London|623621564,......ADIRECT:1+20051107:1159+6002'


CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR PI78461

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) 9.0.0.x on any execution platform, where the map uses the PARSE() function.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using the result of the PARSE() in a later rule shows different output (uncorrupted) and can be used as a check.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Obtain and apply fix for APAR PI78461
