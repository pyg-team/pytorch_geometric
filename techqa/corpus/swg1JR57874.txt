APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you did not specify the targetNamespace attribute for your
   schema in your process applications, you see an exception
   similar to the following exception at the Support cluster while
   running Business Process Choreographer Explorer because the
   components of the schema don't have a targetNamespace:
   
   Error reading XML
   org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource$IOWrappedException:
   Feature 'XXX' not found.
   
   You also see the following exception in the SystemOut.log file
   at the Support cluster, indicating that the SomeSchema.xsd was
   not specified with a targetNamespace attribute:
   
   BOCore        W   Exception occurs when loading XML schema
   https://<Application Server
   Name>:<port>/RemoteALWeb/artifacts/<URL>/SomeSchema.xsd
   BOXMLSerializ E com.ibm.ws.bo.service.BOXMLSerializerImpl load
   All options used were:
   BOXMLSerializ E com.ibm.ws.bo.service.BOXMLSerializerImpl load
   Key: USE_XML_NAME_TO_FEATURE_MAP Value:
   ...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Artifact Loader can build an index for a "NULL"
   targetNamespace in its catalog, but an issue occurs when the
   remote Artifact Loader serializes and deserializes the catalog
   containing the "NULL" targetNamespace when it downloads the
   catalog from the Application cluster to the Support cluster.
   This issue prevents artifacts with "NULL" targetNamespace from
   being searched and loaded at the Support cluster.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that ensures the remote
   Artifact Loader can handle the "NULL" targetNamespace correctly.
