 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 If your Workplace XT installation is not automatically configured by the Case Manager configuration tool, you might need to manually configure access to Process Designer. 

CONTENT
For the Workplace XT instance in a development environment, additional configuration is required. These changes apply to the instance of Workplace XT that is used by Case Manager Builder. 

If your Workplace XT is in the same application server instance as IBMÂ® Case Manager, the IBM Case Manager configuration tool can make these configuration changes for you. If you want to use the configuration tool, skip this task.

To configure Workplace XT for a development environment:


 1. On the IBM Case Manager server, navigate to the CaseManagement/WorkplaceXTConfig directory. 
 2. Copy the following files:  * ICMSolutionEdit.jar 
     * jaxb-api.jar 
     * jaxb-impl.jar 
     * weblogic.xml (only for WebLogic Server environments) 
     * weblogic-application.xml (only for WebLogic Server environments)
    
    
 3. On the Workplace XT server, navigate to WebClient/WorkplaceXT/WEB-INF/lib directory. 
 4. Paste the following files in the directory:  * ICMSolutionEdit.jar 
     * jaxb-api.jar 
     * jaxb-impl.jar
    
    
 5. For WebLogic Server systems, navigate to the WebClient/WorkplaceXT/WEB-INF directory and paste the copy of the weblogic.xml file into the directory. 
 6. For WebLogic 10.3.4, 10.3.5, or 10.3.6 systems where Workplace XT will be deployed as an EAR, navigate to the WebClient/deploy/META-INF directory and paste the copy of the weblogic-application.xml file into the directory.
