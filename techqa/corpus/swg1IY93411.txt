ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ==ENVIRONMENT==
   Environment 1(test):
   Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition
   ITM61 FP2 base install: Applied FP3
   All components TEMS, TEPS, WPA, S&PA
   Protocol 1: IP.PIPE
   Protocol 2: SPIPE
   Encyption key set manually when installed
   Agents use silent_install to set key.
   
   Environment 2(to be production):
   Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition
   ITM61 FP2 base install: Applied FP3
   Components TEMS, TEPS, WPA, S&PA
   Protocol 1: IP.PIPE
   Protocol 2: SPIPE
   
   Encyption key set manually when installed
   Agents use silent_install to set key.
   AIX 5.3 TL4 RTEMS
   
   ==PROBLEM==
   CR is able to connect his Unix OS agent from one
   ITM 6.1 FP0003 environment (where the default encryption was
   used) to another where he had set up a different encryption key.
   He has some post FP0003 patches for TEPS etc. - but that need
   not be relevant because I can easily reproduce this at the
   FP0003 (fresh install) level using a Windows OS agent.
   
   Steps to recreate are very simple:
   1. Environment 1 with a certain encryption key (in our case -
   the default ie. IBMTivoliMonitoringEncryptionKey)
   
   2. Environment 2 with a different encryption key
   3. Point an agent from Environment 1 to the HUB TEMS on
   Environment 2 ensuring that IP:SPIPE is selected as Protocol 1,
   and NO additional protocol selected on  bothTEMS, and agent (and
   of course TEPS too)
   
   4. Agent is ABLE TO CONNECT! (and data can be seen in TEP)
   I see cmvc items: 18392 "agent can be connected by ssl in
   different EncryptionKey" but thats for ITCAM for SOA. and 33248
   "SOA : agent can be connected by ssl in different EncryptionKey"
   but they are for ITCAM for SOA.
   
   Problem has been recreated in LAB with 6.1 Fp03 + LA0006 TEMS /
   TEPS patch installed by the FE team JA. The customer has also
   recreated the problem after FP04 upgrade.
   
   The CR stated that a fix is needed by end of Jan 2007. The APAR
   has 1 month delay.
   
   ==QUESTIONS==
   
   cmvc 9814 "Default encryption key different for aix and
   windows" does not really match this problem.
   
   1) Since the issue was not addressed in FP04, it has been
   advised by BG (L3) to raise a Sev2 APAR
   
   Thank you very much for your help in advance. Kind regards, Ivan

   The code is currently working as designed. The use of encryption
   was only intended on connections between the TEP/TEPS and the
   TEMS where human interaction plays a role.  Agents report data
   to a TEMS without human interaction so no encryption was deemed
   necessary.  The customer may open an enhancement request to add
   the use of encryption for signon processing between agents and
   the TEMS.  Note that this will still not prevent agents from a
   Test environment from signing on to a production environment if
   they have the correct ID and password.  A firewall should be
   implemented for that type of protection.
