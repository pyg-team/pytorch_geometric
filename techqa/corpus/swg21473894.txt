On April 5, 2011, IBM announced IBM Business Process Manager [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/business-process-manager/], which is a single unified Business process Management (BPM) platform that is designed to support the entire range of business process improvement projects.
IBM Business Process Manager is the replacement product for Lombardi Teamworks, which is a BPM platform that was formerly offered by Lombardi Software prior to its acquisition by IBM in January 2010. It is also the replacement for its successor, WebSphere Lombardi Edition, which is currently offered by IBM.

You can replace your current Lombardi Teamworks or WebSphere Lombardi Edition product entitlements with corresponding IBM Business Process Manager licenses, beginning June 3, 2011. If you are interested, contact your IBM sales representative for assistance.

IBM will continue to support the various Lombardi Teamworks and WebSphere Lombardi Edition releases according to the schedule that is shown in the following table. This schedule gives you time to plan and complete your migration to IBM Business Process Manager. The End Of Support dates specify when standard support will no longer be available for these product releases.

Note: If you licensed WebSphere Lombardi Edition from IBM under the terms of the IBM International Program License Agreement, optional extended support is available beyond the standard support date. For information on the IBM Software Support Lifecycle for WebSphere Lombardi Edition, refer to the IBM Software Support Lifecycle Policy [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/].
