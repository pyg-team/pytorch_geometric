About this script package


This script package enables FIPS 140-2 mode on the operating system and the Java runtime for the VM in a pattern instance, and then restart the VM. After FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, the system will only be able to use a subset of cryptographic algorithms that are approved by the US Government. Insecure algorithms (such as MD5) will be unusable after FIPS 140-2 mode has been activated.
