Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Security scans often report that there are Commerce Session cookies and JSESSIONID do not have the HTTP Secure Flag set. Is this a security concern? 

CAUSE
When looking in the browser, you notice many cookies without the HTTP Secure Flag set, resulting in these cookies being allowed to be sent over non-SSL or non-TLS.

ANSWER
For users to access secure pages, clients need to have both the WC_AUTHENTICATION cookie along with other session cookies like WC_USERACTIVITY. We only require that the WC_AUTHENTICATION cookie have the secure flag set, as without this cookie, no secure pages can be accessed. So long as you are noticing that WC_AUTHENTICATION has the secure flag set, then this is the designed behavior, and is expected.

For more information on our cookies both secure and non-secure cookies, you can refer to the following page:
