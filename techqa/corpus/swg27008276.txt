1. ABOUT THIS RELEASE 
===================================================================== 

This readme file contains installation information for IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Pack for SWIFTNet FIN version 4.2. 

Refer to the product Web site (www.ibm.com/software/integration/wtx) to view the Release Notes and hardware and software requirements. The Release Notes contain the most current information about the release, including additional requirements, configuration instructions, and known issues. 


===================================================================== 
2: NEW AND CHANGED BEHAVIOR 
===================================================================== 

This release is available and supported on 3 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Platforms: 

WTX 7.5.1 
WTX 8.0.1 
WTX 8.1.0 

Note that all 3 versions are identical EXCEPT in one important aspect: 

The Java Validation Component (JVC) is only available on WTX 8.1.0. 
This is because the JVC has been refactored to use the IBM JRE v1.4.2, and all 3rd party software has been removed, namely: 
jaxen-full.jar 
jdom.jar 
log4j-1.2.3.jar 
saxpath.jar 
xalan.jar 

The IBM JRE is supplied with WTX 8.1.0

3: INSTALLATION NOTES 
===================================================================== 

IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender products include a simple installation program. Procedures differ slightly based upon the product being installed and the platform being used. However, specific instructions in the installation program lead you through the details of the installation. 

Note: In all installation instructions, "install_dir\" is used to indicate the path where the product is installed. The default path for Windows is "C:\Program Files\IBM\IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender n.n" where n.n represents the version number of the release. 

Note: Before you begin installing an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender product, close any other programs that may be running on your computer. Having other programs running may cause installation errors. 


INSTALLATION PREREQUISITES 
-------------------------- 

The IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender must be installed before installing the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Pack for SWIFTNet FIN. 


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 
------------------------- 

There are two different ways in which you can install the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender products: 

- From the Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) site 
- From the CD-ROM 

From the ESD Site 
----------------- 

To install IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender products from the Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) site: 
 1. Download the file from the ESD site.
    
 2. If you are installing on a different machine, transfer the file (in binary mode) to the target machine.
    
 3. On Windows, run the corresponding .EXE file.
    OR
    On UNIX, untar the image and run DSTXINST.
    
 4. Follow the instructions presented in the installation program.



From the CD-ROM 
--------------- 

Instructions are presented by platform (either Windows or UNIX). 

Windows Platform 
----------------- 

To run Windows-based IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender products, your computer system should meet the following minimum requirements: 
 * personal computer (Pentium III-based processor with a monitor and a mouse or compatible pointing device) with at least 1 GB of hard-disk space and 256 MB of RAM
   
   Note: Depending upon the product components you choose to install and the size and complexity of your data and maps, additional RAM or hard disk space might be required. Additional system requirements, if any, are listed in the documentation for each product component.


To install an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender product on a Windows platform: 
 1. Insert the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender product CD into the CD-ROM drive.
    
 2. If the installation program starts automatically within a few moments, skip to Step 4.
    or
    If it does not start within a few moments, from the Start menu, select Run.
    
 3. Enter D:\setup.exe to execute the installation program in the root directory of the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender product CD where D: represents the appropriate letter of your CD-ROM drive.
    
 4. Follow the instructions presented in the installation program.



UNIX Environment Variable Setup Program 
--------------------------------------- 

The environment variables required to execute an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender map or system must be set prior to execution. You can set the environment variables (PATH, Shared Library Path, MERC_TMP_DIR, MERC_HOME_DIR) by running the setup program. 

Before executing an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender map or system (using the Launcher) and after login, execute the setup program in the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender installation directory. This sets the required environment variables for this session only; you may want to add this to the .profile script so that these are set for each session. 

Note: The following command procedure assumes that your UNIX command line environment is the Korn (ksh) shell. 

Execute the command as follows: 

. /install_dir/setup 

where install_dir represents the directory in which you have installed your products. 

NOTE There must be a space between the initial period (.) and the command path. 


===================================================================== 
4: UNINSTALLATION INFORMATION 
===================================================================== 
 * To uninstall IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Pack for SWIFTNet FIN product components from Windows platforms, from the Start menu, select Settings > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs. Highlight the product component to be uninstalled and click Add/Remove.
   
 * To uninstall IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Pack for SWIFTNet FIN products from UNIX platforms, your current directory must not be within the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Pack for SWIFTNet FIN installation directory tree. The uninstall script does not delete the main installation directory itself. This installation directory must be manually removed.


For example, if the product was installed into directory /Program Files/IBM/IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender n.n, you could do the following: 

cd /IBM 
rm -rf ./IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender n.n 

Either individual components or the entire IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender installation can be removed. Below the directory in which the products are installed is a subdirectory named /dstx_install that contains the uninstall scripts. To remove the product or a component, execute the corresponding uninstall script (from a directory outside the /install_dir/directory) by providing the full path, similar to the following command: 

install_dir/dstx_install/item_to_be_removed.uninstall 

where install_dir is the directory in which IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender n. was installed and item_to_be_removed is the component or product to be uninstalled.
