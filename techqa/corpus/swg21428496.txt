Title: IBM In a silent installation on Windows (setup -u) the CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE is ignored if it specifies a file on a remote network drive. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you install using a response file in which the CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE keyword specifies a file with a path on a network drive, the profile is not applied. 

SYMPTOM
When you do a silent installation of DB2 on Windows (by running the setup [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0011768.html] command with the -u option) and the CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE keyword in the response file specifies a file with a path on a remote network drive, the installation does not apply the profile described in that file. 

In the installation log file you will find messages like these:
1: ERROR:A Response file error occurred. The value "F:\profile_path\DB2.INS" is not valid for the keyword "DB2_01.CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE".

1: ERROR:One or more errors occurred while checking the syntax of the response file "C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\response_file.RSP".
Correct the errors and run the install again.

where 
DB2_01 is the name of the DB2 copy that you are installing, 
F:\profile_path\DB2.INS is the value of the CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE keyword, and
response_file.RSP is the name of the response file..


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, choose one of the following options:


 * Put the client profile file in a local directory (not a directory on a remote network drive).

 * Put the client profile file in the same directory as the response file that you use to do the silent installation, and set the value of the CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE keyword to just the client profile file name not including the path. 

 * 
 * 
 * DB2_01.CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE = F:\profile_path\DB2.INS
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * DB2_01.CLIENT_IMPORT_PROFILE = DB2.INS
 * 
 *
