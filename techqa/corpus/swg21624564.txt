PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your message producer is not able to connect to the JMS destination in your Service Integration Bus for WebSphere Application Server and throws a CWSIA0069E error. 

SYMPTOM
The following errors are thrown in the JVM logs (SystemOut.log): 

 javax.jms.JMSSecurityException: CWSIA0006E: The authorization for the supplied user name was not successful.

CAUSE
CWSIA0069E indicates that the application does not have authorization to create a producer for the requested JMS destination.

The primary reason for an authorization failure on a destination is that the user is
not in the relevant role for the destination being accessed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that user has the proper authorization to access that destination as per this table. 

 

Access Authorizations Destination type Access roles queue sender, receiver, browser, creator port sender, receiver, browser, creator webService sender, receiver, browser, creator topicSpace sender, receiver foreignDestination sender alias sender, receiver, browser 

After this you have to restart the messaging engine for these changes to take effect. Some times you may have to sync the servers in case of clusters to push this information to all members of the clusters.
