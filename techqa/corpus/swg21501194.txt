QUESTION
 How do I add the Application Optimization feature to an IBM WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI52 appliance?

The following document provides assistance on upgrading a DataPower Integration Appliance XI52 appliance to add the Option for Application Optimization feature. 

ANSWER
To add the Application Optimization feature: 

 *  The appliance must be a DataPower Integration Appliance XI52 appliance running firmware 4.0.0.0 or later. You purchased the feature and received a letter that contains the Controlled Access Key to download the firmware image. 


Part 1: Accessing the Web site that contains the firmware image. 
Using your IBM account and Controlled Access Key, access the Web site to download the firmware image that contains the Application Optimization feature. 
 1. Identify the serial number for your appliance  * From the WebGUI, click Status -> System -> Version Information. 
     * From the command line, issue the show version command.
    
    
 2. Follow the instructions in the Authorized Feature Download letter to access the WebSphere DataPower Registered Downloads portal [http://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?lang=en_US&source=swg-datapowerapps]. 
 3. Sign in using your IBM user ID and password. Register, if you do not have an ID. 
 4. Enter the Controlled Access Key in the letter to access the Web page containing the firmware images. Ensure that the first 7-characters of the Controlled Access Key in the letter matches the serial number for the appliance that you obtained in step 1.


You are now ready to continue to Part 2 to download the firmware image. 

Part 2: Downloading the firmware image. 
 1. Download the image. 
 2. Do not transfer the image to the appliance at this time. You will install the image in Part 4: Installing the firmware image. 


Part 3: Preparing for the firmware upgrade. 
Review the installation instructions and prepare your appliance for the firmware upgrade. 
 1. Read the upgrade documentation in the version-specific DataPower information center. Instructions for accessing the correct information center is in the [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21377654]IBM WebSphere DataPower Product Documentation Portal [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21377654] technical flash. The steps in this flash provide additional information to use with the upgrade documentation in the information center. 
 2. Save the current configuration.  * From the WebGUI, click Save Config. 
     * From the command line, issue the write memory command. 
    
    
 3. Create a backup of the entire system, and store the configuration in a safe location off of the appliance. 
 4. Confirm that you have a working admin account and a back up privileged account that can change the password for the admin account, if needed. 
 5. Make sure that the passwords for both accounts were recently changed.


Part 4: Installing the firmware image. 
Install the firmware image. Each firmware image uses the serial number of the appliance as the key. 
 1. Remove appliance from production. 
 2. Following the instructions upgrade documentation in the information center:  * Remove extraneous files 
     * Reboot the appliance to release temporary storage 
     * Transfer the firmware image to the appliance 
     * Install the firmware image
    
    
 3. Verify that the appliance has the Application Optimization feature.  * From the WebGUI, click Status -> System -> Device Features. The list includes:  * Option for Application Optimization support
       
       
     * From the command line, issue the show features command. The list includes:  * AppOpt
       
       
    
    


If the installation is successful and the list does not include the Application Optimization feature, the most likely reason is that the firmware image was for a different appliance. Each firmware image to add the Application Optimization feature uses the serial number of the appliance as the key. If you install a downloaded image to a different appliance, you will notice that the firmware is upgraded to that firmware level and that the Application for Optimization feature is not available. 

If you accessed the download site using the Controlled Access Key and installed the downloaded image to the appliance with the matching serial number and the feature list does not include the Application Optimization feature, contact IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]. 

Contacting IBM Support 
When reporting the problem to IBM Support, the representative will need your Controlled Access Key in addition to the standard information to include. Go to Contacting IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliances Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322].
