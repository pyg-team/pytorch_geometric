APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Receive the following error when I trying to run a job via dsjob
   command:
   
   dsjob -run -local bidw_dev CopyOfPrepChanlDim
   
   -local option can only be used if the project is the current
   working
   directory
   
   
   Status code = -9999 DSJE_DSJOB_ERROR
   
   
   This issue appears related to having a project that is a
   symbolic link.
   
   Information Server 8.1 FP1
   AIX 6.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use symbolic links or apply patch:
   
    8100, 8101 AIX platform
   
   
   patch_JR38363_server_aix_8100-1.tar
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the project directory has a symbolic link in its path,
   the dsjob test to see if the current directory is the same as
   the project directory will fail because getcwd returns the
   absolute path, not the pathc with the symbolic links which was
   saved to the repositoy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed the current directory check to file ID information
   instead of doing a path string compare.
