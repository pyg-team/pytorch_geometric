Title: IBM Can IBM SPSS Statistics properly analyze data from the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)? - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I need to analyze data from the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by the CDC. I see that their web site has the data available in .sav format. Can IBM SPSS Statistics handle these data properly, accounting for the complex sampling design? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The YRBS is based on a three stage cluster sample design with stratification at the first stage. The analyses done by the CDC itself do not treat this design fully. The data files made available by the CDC are designed to be specified in software as covering a single stage design with stratification and clustering, and using the WR (with replacement) estimation method (producing underestimates of variances of 3-10%, according to the CDC). This is easily handled in IBM SPSS Statistics if you have the Complex Samples module. The following command syntax will create an appropriate plan file (you will likely want to add a fuller path specification to the PLAN FILE subcommand):

CSPLAN ANALYSIS
/PLAN FILE='YRBS.csaplan'
/PLANVARS ANALYSISWEIGHT=weight
/PRINT PLAN
/DESIGN STRATA= stratum CLUSTER= psu
/ESTIMATOR TYPE=WR.

Once this plan file has been created, whenever you want to perform analyses on these data, you simply reference this plan file, and the complex sampling aspects of the data are automatically handled. You can also create a plan file via the graphical user interface, by simply specifying the stratum variable as a Stratification Variable, the psu variable as a Cluster Variable, and the weight variable as the Sample Weight variable. Click Finish, and you're done
