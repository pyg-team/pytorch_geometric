ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XDE and SoDA 2003 (Tested with XDE JAVA).
   WORD 2000
   WIndows 2000 sp3
   
   Subject:
   Not possible to extract specific elements from diagrams in XDE,
   to get related attributes.
   TEXT:
   It's very common that customers want to list e.g. the classes
   only from  a class diagram after showing the diagram image in
   IBM Rational SoDA(R).
   In IBM Rational XDE(TM) with Soda 2003 this is not possible.
   The only command that seams to work is to extract ALL elements.
   If we try to extract e.g. elements where is a class, use-case or
   actor, nothing is returned.
   This is a VERY important feature that is commonly used with SoDA
   and Rose today.
   This customer that has this problem will be moving from Rose to
   XDE but they need to be able to do this in SoDA with XDE since
   it's done today with Rose.
   This issue also creates a problem with extracting the desired
   information on the actuall elements.
   If you in XDE repeats on classes you have the option to extract
   e.g. stereotype and many other things, with this issue, sicne
   ELEMENTS is the only thing that works, all elem,ent type
   specific attributes etc fails to be extractable since on
   elements you can jsut get basic info like NAME.
   You can see that the REPEAT Element, a Element, using
   Diagram.ContainedElements   command only has a very low number
   of display options....
   So - Not possible to extract specific elements on diagram, which
   leads to problems showing the important attribute data on e.g.
   classes/use-cases.
   The example attached includes a XDE model a template and a
   example report, if you generate the report it's easy to see what
   is missing and what commands that fails.
   Also if you repeat for element you get an extra "PRINT" element
   returned which i can't see anywhere in the diagram - perhaps
   another defect??

   - RETURNS NOTHING)
      DISPLAY Actor.Name

LOCAL FIX
 *  One thing that could work as a hard workaorund is to have one
   package for each diagram and the extract the classes from the
   package. But that might mean redesign of the whole model..
   None availaable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Added a new relationship on the XDE Diagram called
   ContainedModelElements.  This relationship returns the model
   elements corresponding to each view retuned by the
   ContainedElements relationship.  The tricky thing to remember
   here is that ContainedElements is a general relationship
   introduced by the Element artifact type.  It simply returns the
   elements that any given element owns.   In the case of diagrams,
   this relationship returns the views contained by the diagram.
   The new relationship, ContainedModelElements, returns the model
   element for each view found with ContainedElements.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in XDE 2003.06.13
