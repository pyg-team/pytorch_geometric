PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The new option is added to panel ADB2CEX1 'Run a Change'
   and to the CM batch interface.
   
   Documentation for the new CM Batch do_runtime_analyze parameter:
   
   The do_runtime_analyze parameter specifies whether to perform a
   runtime analyze before a change is run.  The runtime analyze is
   a safety check to ensure a change being run will be based on
   the latest DB2 catalog information.  If the latest DB2 catalog
   information is not used, implementing the change could cause
   SQL errors or result in unintentionally undoing SQL changes
   made outside of the DB2 Admin Change Management process.
   The runtime analyze process does not change any of the
   artifacts, such as Work Statement List (WSL), created when the
   change was analyzed.
   
   Values: Y, N
   Y
   Do a runtime analyze.  If the product detects that the
   latest DB2 catalog information is not used but is needed, the
   run process will fail with an error.  The change will need to
   be analyzed again before it can be run.
   
   N
   A runtime analyze is not done before a change is run.
   
   Default: Y
