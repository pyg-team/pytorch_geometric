QUESTION
 How can I install Datacap Taskmaster into a folder other than c:\Datacap? 

ANSWER
During installation, enter the UNC path or drive letter and folder on a local disk where you want to install Datacap. After the installer completes, edit the Windows Registry and update two values to point to the selected folder. 
1. Select Start, and then Run. 
2. Enter regedit and press Enter. 
3. Navigate to the following registry key: 

 * 64 bit Operating System
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\Application\Location 
 * 32 bit Operating System
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\Application\Location

4. Double click the TopPath string to edit its value. 
5. Delete the existing value and type in the full path to the file Datacap.xml, which resides in the folder where you installed Datacap. 
6. Navigate to the following registry key:  * 64 bit Operating System
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\RRS\locations 
 * 32 bit Operating System
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\RRS\locations

7. Double-click the rrs string to edit its value. 
8. Delete the existing value and type in the full path to the RRS folder inside the folder where you installed Datacap. 

Note: You must login as a local administrator on the computer in order to edit the registry. 

If you want this computer to access your Datacap application(s) from a shared location, enter the shared Datacap.xml path instead of the locally installed path in step 5 above. 

The sample and foundation applications require adjustments to function properly after you install Datacap to a nonstandard location. Those adjustments are outside the scope of this TechNote. RELATED INFORMATION
