APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ version 8.0.0.2 (from pattern type version 1.0.0.2) cannot be
   selected in the virtual system pattern editor when MQ FixPack
   pattern type version 1.0.0.6 (or later) is added to the PureApp
   catalog.  The earliest version of MQ that is displayed is
   8.0.0.4.  This is true even when the later FixPack pattern type
   is disabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove all later versions of the MQ pattern type from the
   PureApplication System catalog to re-enable the hidden MQ base
   version in the pattern editor.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern
   Type 1.0.0.2 and later..
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64, AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   MQ version 8.0.0.2 (from pattern type version 1.0.0.2) cannot be
   selected in the virtual system pattern editor when MQ FixPack
   pattern type version 1.0.0.6 (or later) is added to the PureApp
   catalog.  The earliest version of MQ that is displayed is
   8.0.0.4.  This is true even when the later FixPack pattern type
   is disabled.
   
   A defect in the MQ Pattern Type metadata prevented the older MQ
   base version (8.0.0.2) from being displayed in the PureApp
   pattern editor when a newer base version of MQ (8.0.0.4) was
   loaded into the PureApp catalog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The defect has been addressed so that the older MQ base version
   is displayed in the pattern editor when the newer FixPack
   version is disabled in the PureApp catalog
