QUESTION
 How do you configure an additional dropins directory in Eclipse? 

ANSWER
Set the System property org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory to point to a directory that you want to watch for plug-ins. 

You can configure the property the following three ways: 

 1. Start Eclipse with an additional command line argument:
    for example:
    eclipse.exe -vmargs -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=C:/dropins 
 2. By adding the following line at the end of eclipse\eclipse.ini file:
    -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=path/to/directory 
 3. By adding the following line to eclipse\configuration\config.ini file:
    org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=path/to/directory 


The property can point to only one directory.  

You must also notice that several Eclipse based products set this property to point to the directory which is necessary to start the product. Reconfiguring this property leads to corruption of the installation (it might cause the product to crash at startup or disable major features). Examples of products which set this property are the IBM Rational products installed by IBM Installation Manager, including, but not limited to: IBM Rational Software Architect, IBM Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software, IBM Software Architect Real Time Edition, IBM Rational Application Developer for Websphere Software.
