PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a Common Event Infrastructure (CEI) problem in WebSPhere Process Server. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the WebSphere Process Server Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collect troubleshooting data for CEI problems in WebSphere Process Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support helps familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and saves you time. 




Setting the trace string 

Set the following trace string, then reproduce the problem. For instructions, see the main WebSphere Process Server MustGather document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239895#instructions]. 


CEI server: 
com.ibm.events.*=all 

CEI client application or emitter: 
com.ibm.events.*=all 


Note: Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction timeouts and errors. 

Required diagnostic information 
Gather the following information and files: 

General diagnostic information  * Problem description 
 * Environment description 
 * Server logs: All files from the following directories:
   <profile_root>/<profile_name>/logs/<server_name>
   <profile_root>/<profile_name>/logs/ffdc 
 * Project interchange (PI) or enterprise archive (EAR) file from the relevant applications

Collecting diagnostic information 
For instructions about collecting the general diagnostic information, see the "Manually collect troubleshooting information" section in Collecting troubleshooting data for WebSphere Process Server Version 6 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239895#instructions]. The server logs and some of the environment details can be collected with ISA Lite [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24020510]. 

Note: If a problem occurs during the CEI configuration, gather both the deployment manager and the target servers logs. 

What to do next 
 1. Review the logs and traces at the time of the problem to try to determine the source of the problem.
    
    
 2. Use IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to search for known problems in the information center, forums, and technotes.
    
    
 3. If you cannot find related problems or cannot solve the problem, send the information that you collected to IBM by following the instructions in Exchanging Information with IBM Technical Support. [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html]
