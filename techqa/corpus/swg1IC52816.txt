APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Receive the following error:
   AMQ9219: The TCP/IP listener program could not create a new
   connection for the incoming conversation.
   EXPLANATION:
   An attempt was made to create a new socket because an attach
   request was received, but an error occurred.
   ACTION:
   The failure may be transitory, try again later. If the problem
   persists, record the return code 4120 and tell the systems
   administrator. It may be necessary to free some jobs, or restart
   the communications system.
   Recreate steps:
   1. Create two queue managers. (One is for SDR and the
      other is for RCVR)
   2. define a channel
   3. ALTER MQS-TCPLIS00, ARGLIST  to use conventional
      TCP/IP process.
   4. Start the channel
   5. SCF PRIMARY PROC $<tcpip proc> , CPU x
   6. The channel will be aborted and then fails to restart
      since listener process does not exist.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   The PAthway listenerprocess did not restart
   when it exited on a error condition.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Modify code to cause a OSS Pathwayprocess
   to be restarted when a error condition is encountered that
   should cause a restart.A Guardian Pathway process restarts as
   expected.
