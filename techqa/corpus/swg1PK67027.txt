LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects users who are reading     *
   *                  the documentation for the Java Platform,    *
   *                  Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application    *
   *                  clients in the Information Centers for      *
   *                  WebSphere Application Server Versions       *
   *                  6.0.x and 6.1.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An application uses the Application     *
   *                      Client for WebSphere Application        *
   *                      Server. However, when the application   *
   *                      connects to a database, the             *
   *                      connections are not pooled. The         *
   *                      documentation does not state whether    *
   *                      the Application Client supports         *
   *                      connection pooling.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The "J2EE application clients" topic does not state that the
   Application Client does not support connection pooling.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following text will be added to the "J2EE application
   clients" and "Connection pooling, Connection pool settings,
   and Tuning connection pools" topics for WebSphere Application
   Server Versions 6.0.x and 6.1:
   
   Attention: Connection pool is not supported in application
   client. The application client calls the database directly,
   without a data source. If you want to use the getConnection()
   request from the application client, configure the JDBC
   provider in the application client deployment descriptors,
   using Rational Application Developer or assembly tool. The
   connection is established between application client and the
   database. Application client does not have connection pool,
   but JDBC provider configuration is available in the client
   deployment descriptors.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the September
   2008 update to the information centers.
