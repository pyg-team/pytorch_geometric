APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I clean installed a Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit on my test client.
   When log on
   iNotes with IE8 which is default installed for the first time,
   and open iNotes
   Preferences or create a new mail message, I was prompted to
   install ActiveX
   control which is correct behavior, but after I confirm to
   install and follow
   the steps to install the control, it always prompts a dialog box
   like below,
   which said "The installation of Lotus iNotes 8.5 Control has
   been blocked or
   declined by the user."   To check the IE8 add-on, there is no
   iNotes control
   installed.
   
   
   I have tried several ways as below but still can not resolve the
   problem.
   1. Uncheck "Turn on pop-up blocker" in IE8 Internet Options
   2. Add the server I accessed to allowed site in Security tab in
   IE8 Internet
   Options
   3. Change UAC setting on Windows 7
