LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Server dashboards for ITM 6.3 FP1 can be installed as pristine
   or upgrade.  ITM 6.3 FP1 introduces upgrade scenario for server
   dashboards. In ITM 6.3, when launchpad starts IBM Installation
   Manager (IIM), it goes directly to the feature tree for pristine
    installation. To perform upgrade, user has to start IIM already
    installed on OS, configure it with ITM 6.3 FP1 offering
   location, then perform upgrade.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Launchpad base installation scenario was modified.  When user
   starts installation, main IIM panel is displayed and user can
   decide if he or she wants to perform pristine or upgrade
   installation. IIM is preconfigured with ITM 6.3 FP1 dashboard
   offering location so user can go directly to perform the desired
    operation (install or upgrade).
