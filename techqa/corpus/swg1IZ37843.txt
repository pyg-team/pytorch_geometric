APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Current HOWTO_SecureMode3x.txt documentation still describes the
   setting of obsolete properties, document requires updating.
   
   The ImpactServer properties:
   
   impact.authentication.objectserver.host
   impact.authentication.objectserver.port
   
   are no longer referenced by either a DataSource or EventReader
   when configuring connection to a single or failover pair of
   SecureMode ObjectServer(s).
   
   Current documentation requires updating to reflect current
   configuration requirements to achieve connection to a single or
   failover pair of SecureMode ObjectServer(s).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  I'm creating a DCF TechNote to provide information on how to
   connect to a pair of SecureMode ObjectServers.
