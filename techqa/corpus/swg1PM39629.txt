APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HealthCenter recently changed it's default communication
   behavior to using an ORB for communication. This change in
   behavior interferes with applications that run a customized
   ORB, such as WebSphere Application Server on z/OS.
   
   This APAR will document the changes in the HealthCenter
   documentation in the Info Center, which includes setting the
   following JVM customer property in a WebSphere Application
   Server on z/OS environment:
   
   com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.agent.transport=jrmp
   
   This APAR will also document the Service Refresh level in both
   Java 5 and Java 6 that introduce the change in default behavior.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In order to use the Health Center (level 1.3.0 and up) with
   WebSphere on z/OS, the following environment variable must be
   set:
   
   com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.agent.transport=jrmp
   
   This value can be set in the healthcenter.properties file.
   
   The 1.3.0 level of the Health Center changed the default
   behavior to use an ORB instead of JRMP by default. The ORB
   created by the Health Center conflicts with the customized ORB
   required by WebSphere Application Server for z/OS. This property
   instructs the Health Center to use JRMP, which will avoid the
   creation or use of an ORB.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Health Center version 1.3.0 Requires:
   
   com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.agent.transport=jrmp
   
   The 1.3.0 level of the Health Center is shipped by default with
   the following versions of Java:
   Java 6 SR 9
   Java 5 SR 12 FP 4
