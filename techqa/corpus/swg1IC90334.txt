APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating an adapter artifact as well as the adapter files a
   set of xsd schema's are created. These xsd's may contain
   qualified names for global elements which must be unique in the
   scope within which they are referenced.
   If an inadapter and outadapter are created, in different
   libraries, for the same IDOC then these can not be referenced in
   the same application since they will contain qualified names
   which clash. This can result a BIP5035E exception such as:
   
   BIP5035E: The XMLNSC validator signalled that an error occurred
   at line 17 while validating a XML schema. The file being
   processed was SapMatmas05IDocBO.xsd in library SAP_IDOC_IN. The
   message from the XMLNSC validator is: sch-props-correct.2: A
   schema cannot contain two global components with the same name
   this schema contains two occurrences of
   'http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/j2ca/sap/sapmatmas05ido
   cbo, SapMatmas05IDocBO'
   (http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/j2ca/sap/sapmatmas05ido
   cbo, SapMatmas05IDocBO%27).
   Errors have occurred during the validation of a XML schema.
   Review and resolve the problems that are indicated in the
   message from the XMLNSC validator.
   .
   Infocenter topic bc23062_ describes the restriction but does not
   explicitly mention that this can be caused by generating xsd
   artifacts for inbound and outbound SAP operations in different
   libraries.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not package inadapters and outadapters for the same idoc in
   different libraries referenced from the same application.
   Instead use one of the following configurations: 1.
   Two separate applications for inbound and outbound and two
   separate adapter libraries for them. 2. A single
   Adapter library with both inbound and outbound adapter
   having common BO schema and used in two separate
   applications(one having inbound flow and one having
   outbound). 3. A single Adapter library with both inbound
   and outbound adapter having common BO schema and used in
   a single applicationhaving both flows (one inbound and
   one outbound). 4. Two separate applications having their
   own BO schema, adapterand flows.

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When creating an adapter artifact as well as the adapter files a
   set of xsd schema's are created. These xsd's may contain
   qualified names for global elements which must be unique in the
   scope within which they are referenced.
   If an inadapter and outadapter are created, in different

   the same application since they will contain qualified names
   which clash. This can result a BIP5035E exception such as:

   Infocenter topic bc23062_ describes the restriction but does not
   explicitly mention that this can be caused by generating xsd

   libraries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  InfoCenter topic bc23062_ will be updated with the following
   text:
   
   A consequence of this restriction is that .inadapters and
   .outadapters for the same SAP operations in separate libraries
   can not be referenced in the same application. Instead both
   the .inadapter and the .outadapter must be contained in the same
   library.
