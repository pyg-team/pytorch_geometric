APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a cluster queue is set to PUT(disabled) and messages
   are in transit the target queue manager can throw an FDC
   "Incorrect application process opener context stored in
   MQopen for MQPUT" or the cluster channel to this queue
   manager may be terminated.
   .
   FDC:
     Probe Id   :- QS220012
     Component  :- qslHandlePut
     Comment1   :- Incorrect application process opener
                   context stored in MQopen for MQPUT
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   Channel termination and occasionally
   creation of FDC with probeID 'QS220012' (Component
   qslHandlePut) happen when PUT(disabled) on a cluster
   queue is performed while messages are in transit. The
   target cluster queue and the SCTQ of the target QMGR
   have to reside on different queue servers. No DLQ has
   to be configured on the target QMGR. There is another
   cluster queue like the target queue in the cluster.
   The likelihood of FDC creation increases when the
   queue servers on target QMGR manage many queue opens.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Problem has been solved. After the cluster
   queue is PUT(disabled) the messages are rerouted to the other
   cluster queue without channel termination.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *   Assign the cluster queue and the SCTQ of the
   target QMGR to the same queue server.
