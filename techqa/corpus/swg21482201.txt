Title: IBM We are receiving a message stating that the transaction logs are full. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Our SQL Server log files on the database servers are growing out of control. Do Clementine streams commit? Our sql servers are set to simple mode and use small transaction logs. How can we make Clementine work in this environment without overloading our logs? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
By default Clementine will commit every 10000 rows. This is indicated in the "Advanced" tab of the ODBC output node located within Clementine "Export" tab of the pallete. You can change that default to something smaller.

Ensure the level of SQL Server ODBC driver being used is at the supported level for the version of product that is bing ran. This can be verified via the SPSS technical support webpage. Sign in and select the Clementine product. Then view the "Compatibility" link.

If the presumtion is being made that the rows may not be committing and causing virtual log portion of the SQL server you are trying to get rid of to still be active, then the rows that are not committed should not be showing (visible) from another database session. If the records you expect to be in the database are there then the rows are being committed and something else is going on with the SQL Server log issue and it is not related to committed records. This has not been an issue in the past but is placed here for insight.

Please reference the SQL Server DBA guide for rules and processes to truncate and shrink SQL Server transaction logs
