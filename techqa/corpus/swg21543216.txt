Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS VB 4 bytes TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am transmitting from Windows to a z/OS variable blocked (VB) dataset using Sterling Connect:Direct. Why am I required to add an extra 4 bytes to the record length for the VB dataset? 

ANSWER
In a VB data set, the records can have different lengths. The first four bytes of each record contain the Record Descriptor Word (RDW) which describes the length of each record that follows.
