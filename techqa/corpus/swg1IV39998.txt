APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENV:  ITNM 3.9 FP3 This APAR is created as AE/MDV APAR with
   "MDVPARTL" class
   | MDVPARTL 3.9.0-TIV-ITNMIP-FP0003 |
   
   Currently the ITNM WebGUI is not translating mainNode only
   views into aggregated NmosObjInst filters, this is causing a
   functional issue whereby device specific views are not
   generating alerts on each devices containment, rather just on
   the device itself. There is also a knock-on performance problem
   whereby, when endNodes="true" is set the generated filter is
   based on the full set of device containment as NmosEnityId
   rather than the more efficient NmosObjInst.
