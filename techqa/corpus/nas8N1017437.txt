RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Can OS/400 STRPCCMD CL command be used to display HTML and HTM files in a Web browser on a PC running an IBM i Access 5250 emulation session? Can STRPCCMD open these same files in edit mode? 

The STRPCCMD command can be used to display HTML and HTM files on a PC running an IBM i Access 5250 emulation session. STRPCCMD can also be used to open these files in edit mode.

Syntax:

STRPCCMD PCCMD('"Drive:\Path\ApplicationName" Drive:\Path\FileName')

Examples

Opening an Internet URL in Internet Explorer:
STRPCCMD PCCMD('"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE" http://www.as400.ibm.com' [http://www.as400.ibm.com'])

Opening an HTML file located on the PC hard drive, for display in Internet Explorer:
STRPCCMD PCCMD('"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE" C:\My HTML.HTM')

Opening an HTML file located on the PC hard drive, so that it can be edited:
STRPCCMD PCCMD('"C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\NOTEPAD.EXE" C:\My Documents\My HTML.HTM') 

Note: The STRPCO CL command must be issued from the 5250 emulation session before running the STRPCCMD CL command.
