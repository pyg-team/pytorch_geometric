QUESTION
 How do I download and restore an IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Fix Pack repository to the IBM i IFS to update my IBM i WAS product? 

ANSWER
1) Open a web browser and visit the following URL to display the "Recommended fixes for WebSphere Application Server".
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]

2) Click on the WAS version you wish to update.

Example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&amp;aid=1]

3) Click the the "Fix Pack X" link (where X is the fix pack number) under the "Fix" column to download the latest WAS Fix Pack for the version selected. 

Example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=2]

To download previous WAS Fix Pack versions, click on the link, "Fix list for WebSphere Application Server Vx.x.x", at the bottom of the table under "Additional Information". Click on the specific WAS Fix Pack version you wish to download and then click on the "Download Fix Pack X.X.X.X" link to access the specific WAS Fix Pack version's informational document.

4) After clicking on the "Fix Pack X" or "Download Fix Pack X.X.X.X" link, this will direct you to the specific WAS Fix Pack version's informational document. Locate the "WebSphere Application Server full profile" section under the "Download package" topic.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&amp;aid=3]

5) Identify the edition of WAS currently installed on your IBM i server.

Log into a 5250 emulation session with a user profile with explicit *SECADM and *ALLOBJ special authorities.
STRQSH
cd /QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools
./imcl listInstalledPackages -long

The above command will display a detailed list of the currently, installed WAS software packages.

Example:
> cd /qibm/proddata/installationmanager/eclipse/tools
$
> ./imcl listInstalledPackages -long 
/QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager/eclipse : com.ibm.cic.agent_1.8.4001.20160217_1716 : IBMÂ® Installation Manager : 1.8.4.1
/QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/AppServer/V85/Express : com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v85_8.5.5009.20160225_0435 : IBM Web Enablement for IBM i : 8.5.5.9
$

In the output of the "imcl listInstalledPackages" command, locate your installed WAS software product. The edition of the product will be in all capital letters just like the bolded example above. In the example above, the installed WAS edition is WEBENAB = Web Enablement for IBM i. Other editions may include the following:

EXPRESS - Express (com.ibm.websphere.EXPRESS.v85)
BASE - Base (com.ibm.websphere.BASE.v85)
ND - Network Deployment (com.ibm.websphere.ND.v85)

6) Once you have identified the currently installed WAS edition, go back to your browser page from step 4 and select the appropriate link for your WAS edition under the "Download Links (Fix Central)" column under the "Download package - WebSphere Application Server full profile" section.

For WEBENAB (Web Enablement for IBM i) editions, click on the download link next to the "Web Enablement for IBM i local repository ZIP file" Download Description.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=4]

For EXPRESS, BASE, and ND editions; click on the download link next to the "Application Server local repository ZIP files for Base, Express, ND, Developers, NDDMZ (with Java SDK 6)" Download Description.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=5]

7) You will then be prompted to select your fixes. Ensure the necessary packages are checked and click on the "Continue" button.

8) Sign in with your IBM ID. If you need to create an IBMid, click on the "Create new IBMid" link or you can click here [https://www.ibm.com/account/profile?page=reg&okurl=www-947.ibm.com%2Fsupport%2Fentry%2Fmyportal%2Ffixcentral_redirect&failurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2FUS&cancelurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2FUS&lang=en_US].

9) Once you are logged in, you will be prompted to download the WAS Fix Pack zip file(s). 

The default download option is to use IBM Download Director. A Java-enabled browser version (Firefox or IE) is required to use the IBM Download Director utility. This is the preferred download method since it is a multi-threaded download utility and will download the WAS Fix Pack file the fastest.

If you experience issues using the IBM Download Director utility, you can change your download options by clicking on the "Change download options" link under the "Download options" section on the right-hand side of the page.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&amp;aid=6]

You can then proceed to select the "Download using bulk FTP" or "Download using your browser (HTTPS)" download option and then click the "Continue" button to proceed with the download.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=7]

10) You will then be presented with specific information based on the download option selected.


 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] If you selected the "Download using Download Director" download option, click the "Download now" button to begin the download process. 
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=8] 
   

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] If you selected the "Download using bulk FTP" download option, you will be presented with an informational page describing how to obtain your files using FTP. 
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=9] 
   

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] If you selected the "Download using your browser (HTTPS)" download option, you will be presented with a "Download files using HTTPS" page containing hyperlinks you can click on to download the ZIP file(s). 
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=10] 
   


11) The WAS Fix Pack zip file(s) will be downloaded to the specific download directory on your PC based on the download option you selected. 

For the IBM Download Director download option , a Download Director window will open displaying the download progress of the WAS Fix Pack file(s). You can identify the location where the files were downloaded by looking at the "File" value in the Download Director window. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&amp;aid=11] 

For the bulk FTP download option, the file(s) will be downloaded to the local current directory specified on the FTP session. If the LCD command was not executed, this will be the current directory on the DOS command prompt when the FTP command was executed. 

For the HTTPS download option, you will need to click on the WAS Fix Pack download link(s) to download each file. The file will then be downloaded to the PC directory specified by your browser. Typically, this is the "C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\" directory. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=12] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021349&aid=12] 

12) Once the download has completed and you have identified where the files were downloaded on your PC, you will need to first create or clear the /WASFixpack directory in your IBM i IFS. NOTE: If the /WASFixpack directory already exists, it is a good idea to verify its contents before deleting the directory's contents. 

STRQSH 
mkdir /WASFixpack 

OR 

STRQSH 
rm -r /WASFixpack 

13) FTP/Transfer the WAS Fix Pack file(s) from your PC to the /WASFixpack directory on your IBM i server. 

Example: 
Open a DOS command prompt. (Start -> cmd) 
cd "C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\Downloads\DownloadDirector" 
ftp <IBM i server> 
Log in with your IBM i user profile and password. 
bin 
cd /WASFixpack 
put 8.5.5-WS-WAS-FP0000009-part1.zip 
put 8.5.5-WS-WAS-FP0000009-part2.zip 
quit 

14) Extract the WAS Fix Pack ZIP file(s) into the /WASFixpacks directory. 

STRQSH 
cd /WASFixpack 
jar xvf 8.5.5-WS-WAS-FP0000009-part1.zip 
jar xvf 8.5.5-WS-WAS-FP0000009-part2.zip 

15) Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and restored an IBM WAS Fix Pack installation repository to your IBM i server. The IBM i IFS directory, /WASFixpack, will be your WAS Fix Pack installation repository directory path supplied during the WAS Fix Pack installation. RELATED INFORMATION
