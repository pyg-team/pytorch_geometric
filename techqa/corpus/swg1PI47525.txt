ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a job on System 1. I have promoted it on System 2, which
   is configured for 'Recommended', meaning 'Promote resource
   definitions where no identifier or name conflicts exist in the
   target repository.'
   
   When I run the job on System 2, it fails with error:
   
   java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for
   bundle java.
   util.PropertyResourceBundle, key
   39000037308173520000014eca05dae23673
   
   This happens if a Server Definition or an ODBC credential has
   the same name on source & destination systems. In the case of
   the ODBC credential, the job will show as being in a a
   conflicting state from the start. (which usually occurs when the
   user modifies a job step without saving)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Point to the resource definition with the same name on the
   destination system, instead of the promoted resource definition.
