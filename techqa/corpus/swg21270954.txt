 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have added three applications to an existing application group. When I tried to add the fourth application, I receive the following error:

An application cannot be added to the selected application group 'TestAppl'. 

Why can't I add another application to this existing application group? 

CAUSE
You have used all the database values that OnDemand can use to identify an application in this application group.

ANSWER
To add the fourth application to this application group, do the following: 

1. Log on to your OnDemand server with the administration client. 

2. Find the application group in question, right-click it and select Update. 

3.Click the Field Information tab, click the Name drop-down menu, and select the field that has been defined as the Application ID field. 

4. In the Mapping section, type in new values for the Database Value and Displayed Value fields for the new application to be added to this application group. Click Add when you are finished. 

5. Click OK to accept the change made to this application group. 

 

You can now proceed with adding the fourth application to this application group.
