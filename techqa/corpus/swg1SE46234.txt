ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Since migrating to WebSphere MQ v7.0.1.3 the enduser is
   experiencing connection failures for a Java application. The
   following error messages are logged in the WebSphere MQ
   error log, along with a FDC report.  Then enduser is attempting
   to perform data conversion from CCSID 1208 (Windows) to CCSID 37
   (iSeries).
   .
   WebSphere MQ Error logs:
   AMQ9208: Error on receive from host xx.xx.xx.xx.
   EXPLANATION:
   Cause . . . . . :   An error occurred receiving data from
   xx.xx.xx.xx over TCP/IP. This may be due to a communications
   failure.
   Recovery  . . . :   The return code from the TCP/IP read() call
   was 3426 (X'X'00000D62''). Record these values and tell the
   systems administrator.
   .
   AMQ6048: DBCS error
   EXPLANATION:
   Cause . . . . . :   WebSphere MQ is unable to convert string
   data due to a DBCS error. Conversion is from CCSID 1208 to
   CCSID 37.
   Recovery  . . . :   Check the WebSphere MQ Application
   Programming
   Reference Appendix and the appropriate National Language Support
   publications to see if the CCSIDs  are supported by your system.
   .
   AMQ9492: The TCP/IP responder program encountered an error.
   EXPLANATION:
   Cause . . . . . :   The responder program was started but
   detected
   an error.
   Recovery  . . . :   Look at previous error messages in the error
   files to determine the error encountered by the responder
   program.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   WMQ users utilizing pre V6 java clients attempting to connect
   to a V701 server
   
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When a pre-V6 java client attempts to connect to a V701 server,
   WMQ is incorrectly negotiating options that are not available
   to that client. This is resulting in conversion errors such as
   AMQ6048.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WMQ server code has been modified to accommodate pre-V6 java
   clients so that the appropriate options are negotiated.
