APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When setting up a WAS85 or WAS855 profile with profile
   augmentation scripts for Decision Server Rules, the XU resource
   adapter "Isolate this resource provider" is not checked,
   contrary to what is recommended in manual installation steps of
   the XU.
   This may in particular lead to ASM library incompatibility
   issues such as an exception java.lang.
   IncompatibleClassChangeError: org.objectweb.asm.ClassVisitor
   during ruleset parsing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When using WAS 8.5 or WAS 8.5.5 modify [WAS]
   \AppServer\profileTemplates\rules\actions\scripts\was\install_
   app.py to change the line:
       params =  [ '-rar.name',  applicationName, "-rar.desc",
   "JRules XU Resource Adapter"]
   to
       params =  [ '-rar.name',  applicationName, "-rar.desc",
   "JRules XU Resource Adapter", "-rar.isolatedClassLoader",
   "true"]
   Then proceed to create/augment the profile
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Scripts are missing a  parameter so that the setup works
   properly on WAS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  scripts are modified
