APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Both CICS and z/OS Explorer have been installed into a common
   environment using IBM Installation Manager. It is not possible
   to apply an update to one without also applying a corresponding
   update to the other.
   If only one of the products is installed then it can be updated
   successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When CICS Explorer has been installed (or the RCP downloaded) it
   is not possible to then upgrade  IBM Explorer for z/OS (z/OS
   Explorer), without upgrading CICS Explorer as well.
   The situations that didn't allow you to upgrade z/OS Explorer
   separately of CICS Explorer:
   1) The CICS Explorer RCP
   2) Installing CICS Explorer into Eclipse
   3) Installing CICS Explorer into RAD
   4) CICS Explorer pre-installed into RD/z
   Attempts to perform these upgrade paths will produce an error
   similar to the following:
   CRIMA1069E: Updating IBM Explorer for z/OS to 2.1.0.y is not
   allowed; the package is not compatible with IBM CICS Explorer
   SDK 5.1.1.x
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR alters the relationship between CICS and z/OS
   Explorer.
   After applying this CICS Explorer fix pack:
   1) If you make a new install of the CICS Explorer RCP, it will
   be possible to apply an update to z/OS Explorer independently of
   updates to CICS Explorer.
   2) If you have installed the CICS Explorer RCP, the z/OS
   Explorer will need to be explicitly installed into the existing
   package group before updates can be applied.
   3) If CICS Explorer was installed into any Eclipse base (thereby
   indirectly installing the z/OS Explorer) then the z/OS Explorer
   will need to be explicitly installed into the existing package
   group before updates can be applied.
   4) All future attempts to install the CICS Explorer using IBM
   Installation Manager will require that IBM Explorer for z/OS is
   also explicitly selected for installation.
   5) This CICS Explorer fix pack will be included in a future
   release of Rational Developer for System z.
   This fix will be made available in Version 5.1.1.5 of the CICS
   Explorer.
