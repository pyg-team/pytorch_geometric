PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When combining multiple repositories users are locked out of both Maximo and WebSphere when a single repository is marked down. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to use the application or log in to the WebSphere console to determine cause of failure


CAUSE
The cause for this failure is due to a setting in WebSphere that will mark all repositories in a realm down when a single repository fails. This will lock out all Maximo and WebSphere users in both file based and LDAP repositories. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem you must log in to the WebSphere console and perform the following steps.

1. Expand Security and click on Global Security. 
2. Click on Configure beside Federated Repositories
3. Check the box 'Allow operations if some of the repositories are down' as seen below.

4. Apply the changes, perform a full node synchronization and restart the WebSphere services. 

Now when a single repository is marked as down the other repositories in the realm will continue to function and authenticate users.
