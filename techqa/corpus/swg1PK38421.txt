ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Application Developer
   ------------------------------
   Installation Guide (GI11-8352-00
   The Installation guide is not clear about the supported platform
   for Rational Agent Controller on RHEL4 64 bitplatform.
   1. In the Software reference RHEL4 does not indicate 32 or 64
   bit as the other versions do. This is confusing and customers
   will believe that both 32 and 64 bit mode is supported.
   2. I also checked out the section for additional software that
      includes platforms for Rational Agent Controller.
      Notice that under the Supported Platforms that for RHEL
      version 3 and 4 32 or 64 bit support is not indicated, where
      it is specifically indicated for SUSE or Red Hat Client.
   3. I was told we should check to see what JVM platforms are
      supported, which I believe is a leap of faith to really think
      our customers will knowto do this. Under that section only
      Linux for Intel IA32 is listed.
