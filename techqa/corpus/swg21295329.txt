QUESTION
 Why does the "Terminate" action provided by WebSphere Application Server debugger not allow you to terminate WebSphere Application Server v6.x when started in debug mode? 

ANSWER
There has been a behavior change in terms of debugging WebSphere Application Server v5.x and v6.x: 

When debugging WebSphere Application Server v5.x you can select any suspended thread, and invoke the "Terminate" action to terminate the server JVM. 

However, when debugging WebSphere Application Server 6.x the "Terminate" action will only terminate or disconnect the WebSphere Application Server debugger. It will not terminate the WebSphere Application Server 6.x JVM process.
