APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempting to configure or test connection of RZ agent to
   Oracle 9i installation will fail with messages indicating the
   OCI library failed to load:
   krzdynamiclib.cpp,132,"krz00_DynamicLib::Load")
    Fail to dynamically load library libclntsh.so,
    return code 8
   krzdynamiclib.cpp,218,"krz00_OCI_Lib::Init")
    Try to load another possible Oracle OCI library
   krzdynamiclib.cpp,132,"krz00_DynamicLib::Load")
    Fail to dynamically load library libclntsh.so.10.1,
    return code 2
   krzdynamiclib.cpp,222,"krz00_OCI_Lib::Init")
    Try to load another possible Oracle OCI library
   krzdynamiclib.cpp,132,"krz00_DynamicLib::Load")
    Fail to dynamically load library libclntsh.so.11.1,
    return code 2
   krzclient.cpp,333,"Main") Loading Oracle OCI library failed!
   .
    The RZ product documentation lists only Oracle 10 and 11
    in the section titled:
    Application versions monitored (compatible but not required)
   .
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/co
   m.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.3/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcama.doc_6.2.3/oracledatabaseextendedagent.html]
   .
    The section stating (compatible but not required) means the
    RZ agent only supports the Oracle version in the list and the
    compatible version.
    For example, 10.2.0.4 is compatible to 10gR2,
                 11.1.0.6 is compatible to 11gR1.
   .
    The RZ agent does NOT support Oracle 9i and cannot load
    and OCI library from Oracle 9i files as the RZ agent
    binary files are compiled and linked with OCI library
    from Oracle 10gR1 level.
   .
    Oracle does not support loading a lower level OCI library,
    so it's impossible to support Oracle 9i with the ITM RZ agent.
   .
    ITM product documentation should be clarified to indicate that
    Oracle 9i is unsupported with RZ agent, and the failure message
    attempting to load OCI library is a symptom of attempting to
    connect to an unsupported release of Oracle.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure RZ agent to connect to supported Oracle release.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  *************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   ITCAM Extended Agent for Oracle Database 6.3.0
   *************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The prerequisites page of infocenter contains a desctription
   of 'Compatible but not required' that confused the customer

   support
   level of Oracle Database Server.
   
   *************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   Remove description of 'Compatible but not required' and add
   a note to requires the mininum level of Oracle Database Server.
   *************************************************************
