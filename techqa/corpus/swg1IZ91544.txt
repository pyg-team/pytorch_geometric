APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When sending RFH2 messages from WebSphere MQ v7.0 to v6.0
   queue managers the data may become corrupt if the any of the
   NameValueLength fields, that describe the length of the RFH2
   folders, are not a multiple of 4.
   
   The symptoms of the problem are that one or more of the head
   characters of the message data, and/or the NameValueLength
   field of one or more RFH2 folders contains spurious space
   characters.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users who send RFH2 messages from a WebSphere MQ v7.0 queue
   manager to a v6.0 queue manager which happen to contain one or
   more folders with a length which is not a multiple of 4 bytes.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The documentation for WebSphere MQ v6.0 specifically required
   applications to ensure that the length of folders, described
   by the NameValueLength field, were a multiple of 4 bytes.
   
   This requirement was relaxed as WebSphere MQ v7.0 tries to pad
   out folders so that they end up being a length which is a
   multiple of 4 when being transferred to a back-level queue
   manager. A coding error caused the padding operation to
   potentially overwrite folder and message data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed so that the operation to pad the folders
   to a multiple of 4 bytes will not overwrite any following
   bytes with spaces.
