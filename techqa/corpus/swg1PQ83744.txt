APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Various new features of DB2 for z/OS Version 8 SQL, such as
   multiple-row FETCH, multiple-row INSERT, and longer names for
   SQL identifiers, table names, and column names do not work
   with the SQL coprocessor (SQL compiler option).
   These features need to be enabled in the Enterprise COBOL
   for zOS 3.3 and 3.2 compilers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Enterprise COBOL for z/OS users who want to  *
   *                 take advantage of SQL features that are new  *
   *                 to DB2 for z/OS Version 8.                   *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The interface between COBOL and DB2 V8  *
   *                      changed slightly late in development    *
   *                      cycles, so this APAR is required to     *
   *                      complete DB2 Version 8 support in       *
   *                      Enterprise COBOL for z/OS V3.2 and 3.3  *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF and recustomize       *
   *                 compiler options.                            *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Various new features of DB2 Version 8 SQL, such as multiple-row
   FETCH, multiple-row INSERT, and longer names for SQL
   identifiers, table names, and column names will not work with
   the SQL coprocessor (SQL compiler option) unless this APAR
   is installed on Enterprise COBOL 3.2 and 3.3
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IGYCDOPT and IGYTSQL2 were changed to enable the Enterprise
   COBOL compiler to correctly compile programs with the new level
   of SQL functionality available in DB2 Version 8.
   
   This APAR changes the Modification level of the compilers in
   order to provide an external indication that a compiler has the
   necessary PTFs installed to handle DB2 Version 8 SQL.  After
   this APAR fix is applied, the compilers will have a 1 as the
   mod level, so that the product ID on the listing headers will
   change as follows:
   
   Enterprise COBOL for z/OS and OS/390 3.2.0  will change to:
   Enterprise COBOL for z/OS and OS/390 3.2.1
   
   Enterprise COBOL for z/OS 3.3.0  will change to:
   Enterprise COBOL for z/OS 3.3.1
   
   V3R2M0 becomes V3R2M1, and V3R3M0 becomes V3R3M1
   
   ++HOLD information:  Customized default compiler options
   must be recustomized after the PTF for this APAR is applied.
   If you have customized your installation default compiler
   options, then this APAR fix will undo your customizations.
   Save your customizations before your APPLY, then re-customize.
   Simply rerun IGYWDOPT job in SIGYSAMP using instructions in
   the job.
