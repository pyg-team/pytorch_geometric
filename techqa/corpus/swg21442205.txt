See the screen shot of the stack message below.

CAUSE
The FileNet® P8 eForms 4.0.2 was installed in a different directory path than the FileNet® P8 Application Engine.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The class that is referenced in the java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError exception is contained in the commons-httpclient-2.0.2.jar file. This jar file should have been installed with the FileNet® P8 eForms 4.0.2. 


First, take a look at ...FileNet\AE\Workplace\WEB-INF\lib directory to see if the commons-httpclient-2.0.2.jar file exists. If it does not exist, it might indicate that there was a problem with the FileNet® P8 eForms 4.0.2 installation and a reinstall might be required. 

If you do not see the ... FileNet\AE\Workplace\WEB-INF\lib\commons-httpclient-2.0.2.ja file in the lib directory, do you see other files such as eforms.jar, eforms-resources.jar, commons-io-1.3.2.jar etc... ?

If the commons-httpclient-2.0.2.jar file does exist in the ..\WorkplaceXT\WEB-INF\lib directory, then there might have been a problem with the deployment. In this case, go to the ..\FileNet\AE\deploy directory and run either create_app_engine_ear.bat and create_app_engine_war.bat or create_app_engine_ear.sh and create_app_engine_war.sh files depending on your platform to recreate the ear and war files. Then, redeploy either ear or war file that was generated using the instructions documented in IBM FileNet P8 Platform Version 4.5.1 Installation and Upgrade Guide GC19-2802-02 at http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/c1928022.pdf [http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/c1928022.pdf]. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this particular case, the customer installed the FileNet® P8 eForms 4.0.2 to a different directory path than the FileNet® P8 Application Engine. That explains their problem because the jar files were not included in the war or ear files for deployment. Once they re-installed the FileNet® P8 eForms 4.0.2 in the same directory path as the FileNet® P8 Application Engine and redeployed the FileNet® P8 Workplace, everything started to work as expected.
