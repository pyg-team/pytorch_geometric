Title: IBM Security Bulletin:	IBM Tivoli Monitoring CPU utilization (CVE-2014-0963) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Tivoli Monitoring is affected by a problem related to the SSL implementation which, under very specific conditions, can cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0963 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]
DESCRIPTION: 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex. 

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM Tivoli Monitoring components.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92844 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92844] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076]
DESCRIPTION: An attacker running a program on the same machine as where the victim is running a program could use CPU timing information to discover key information about certain kinds of binary type Elliptic Curves used in Digital signatures during signing operations. Although GSKit only generates Prime type Elliptic Curves, externally generated keys may be imported in GSKit.

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
