Title: IBM Need a driver for Oracle 11.2 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The SPSS drivers download site has only SPSS Data Access Pack 6.0 Service Pack 1 drivers. Specifically, this is sufficient for Oracle Wire Protocal 11g R1 (11.1). I have Oracle 11g R2 (11.2). According to the Data Direct Web site I need the Oracle Wire protocol 6.0 Service Pack 2 drivers for this. Will the SPSS Data Access Pack pick up the version 6 Service Pack 2 driver for Oracle 11.2? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development and new driver will be package with the next Statistics release. We are really apologizing for any inconvenience - No Workaround Available
