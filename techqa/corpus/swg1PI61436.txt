ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS VR 5.1
   We applied some maintenance about 7 days ago to our production
   system.
   This included a fairly old PTF UI21582. With this PTF applied
   when we run 6 batch streams in parallel each night we get
   an expected temporary logger error message :
   DWW838I date time A TEMPORARY ERROR CONDITION OCCURRED DURING
   SYSTEM LOGGER OPERATION IXGWRITE FOR LOG STREAM logstream.
   SYSTEM LOGGER RETURN CODE CODE 00000008 REASON CODE 00000868
   ...but now reason code 865
   and
   
    DWW282I MAXIMUM POOL SIZE REACHED IN LSQA STORAGE
   
    Explanation:  CICSVR found that LSQA subpool used for VSAM
          logging buffers in CICSVR address space, is about full.
   
    System action: CICS VR terminates VSAM Batch Logging for
                   the job.
   
    Operator response: Decrease the number of concurrently
                       running batch jobs that use CICS VR
                       VSAM Batch Logging.
   
    System programmer response: Ensure that logstream offloading
                                parameters do not prevent logging.
   Before PI22190/UI21582 was applied only see the logger temporary
   error message was received but now with PTF UI21582 applied
   the logger task terminates which causes extended application
   recovery actions required to recover from this CICS/VR abend.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects CICS VR 5.1 and 5.2 users  *
   *                 that exploit DASD-only logstreams for        *
   *                 stressed VSAM batch logging.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Improved calculation of available CICS  *
   *                      VR Address Space private storage for    *
   *                      VSAM batch logger buffers.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   CICS VR is enhanced to use for VSAM batch logger buffers almost
   all available private space (except some amount of storage
   reserved for internal server support).
   This can reduce the risk of "out of storage" errors in CICS VR
   server when DASD-only logstreams are temporary unavailable.
