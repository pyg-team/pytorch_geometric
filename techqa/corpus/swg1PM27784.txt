   Backport of .get issue where temp files are not deleted by
   the agent.
   
   crf comments from fix:
   First pass at fixing the temp file leak when using streamed
   tags.
   This should fix it for all UNIX/Linux except i5OS.  I don't
   know
   how to fix it, there, because I don't know how to obtain the
   desired
   user and group ids.  Windows is also unaffected by this
   change, and
   I don't know yet whether or not this is an issue.
