ABSTRACT
 This page provides links to the recommended maintenance packages that are available for IBM WebSphere Process Server. 

CONTENT
Software maintenance updates for WebSphere Process Server are supplied in the form of cumulative fix bundled packages, which are called fix packs or refresh packs. These are summarized in the tables below, which are organized by release. The packages are cumulative, so that each new package has all of the fixes that are contained in the previous package, in addition to the new fixes. Therefore, always install the latest package to bring your installation up to the specified version.


Note: Software maintenance updates for WebSphere Process Server includes WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus maintenance. Therefore, if you apply a fix pack or refresh pack on top of WebSphere Process Server, you don't need to apply the same set for WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus separately. Please install the fix pack or refresh pack shipped for WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus if you need to upgrade WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus only.
