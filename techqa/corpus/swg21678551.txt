 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I deploy another instance of the search application or analytics application? I use WebSphere Application Server with my Content Analytics with Enterprise Search (Watson Content Analytics) system. 

ANSWER
To apply a different configuration to the provided search application or analytics application: 

 1. Edit the ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/searchapp/search/config.properties file or ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/searchapp/analytics/config.properties file and set the value of the ignoreMasterConfig property to true (ignoreMasterConfig=true). 
 2. Configure properties as appropriate in the ES_INSTALL_ROOT/installedApps/search.ear/search.war/WEB-INF/config.properties file or ES_INSTALL_ROOT/installedApps/analytics.ear/analytics.war/WEB-INF/config.properties file. 
 3. To specify which collections can access the application, follow the instructions for associating applications with collections [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5RWK_3.0.0/com.ibm.discovery.es.ad.doc/iiysatappcol.htm].


To create another instance of a search application or an analytics application in WebSphere Application Server: 
 1. Manually deploy the search.ear file or analytics.ear file to WebSphere Application Server. Be sure to use a different application name and context root, and place the files in a different installation directory, such as MyInstalledApps. 
 2. Edit the ES_INSTALL_ROOT/installedApps/search.ear/search.war/WEB-INF/config.properties file or ES_INSTALL_ROOT/installedApps/analytics.ear/analytics.war/WEB-INF/config.properties file and change the value of the ApplicationName parameter to the application ID that you created. Use the administration console to associate this application ID with one or more collections (see associating applications with collections [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5RWK_3.0.0/com.ibm.discovery.es.ad.doc/iiysatappcol.htm]). 
 3. Make sure that the default application ID ("Search" or “Analytics”) is mapped to All collections. Otherwise, other web applications that you deploy with their own application IDs will not be visible. 
 4. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, assign individual user IDs to the appropriate context root URLs. Note that LDAP groups cannot be assigned. 
 5. Restart the Watson Content Analytics system.
