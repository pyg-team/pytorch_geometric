PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading an IBM Business Process Manager installation from one product edition to another, the Windows Start menu items for starting and stopping the server and administering the profiles are missing. 

SYMPTOM
This issue occurs when you upgrade from IBM Business Process Manager Standard to IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, IBM Business Process Manager Express to IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, or IBM Business Process Manager Express to IBM Business Process Manager Standard. If you try to start or stop the server, or access the administrative console for previously configured servers using the Windows Start menu, you cannot find those program shortcuts in the Start menu.


CAUSE
The upgrade process uninstalls the IBM Business Process Manager Standard or IBM Business Process Manager Express products, which removes Start menu items. It installs the IBM Business Process Manager Advanced or Standard product, which does not re-create the Start menu items for previously created profiles. The profiles themselves are kept and not removed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To start or stop the server, use the appropriate start and stop commands in the <existing_profile_root>\bin\ directory.

To access the administrative console, put one of the following URLs (depending on whether you are using security) in the address field of a browser:


 * http://hostname:admin_port/admin 
 * https://hostname:admin_secured_port/admin


Alternatively, Start menu items for existing profiles and administrative consoles in the WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Start menu group also work.
