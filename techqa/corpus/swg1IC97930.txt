APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading to major release 5.0.0.x, 6.0.0.x or 6.0.1.x,
   higher latency might occur compared to previous firmware
   versions. The latency is seen in the sixth position of the
   DataPower latency log and might show a higher value than
   observed in previous firmware versions.
   
   
   For example, in a firmware prior to 5.0.0.0, the latency values
   might read as follows:
   
   [latency][info] xmlfirewall(Test_XMLFW): tid(579923): Latency:
    0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0
   [http://ip:port/uri]
   
   After upgrading or applying 5.0.0.x, 6.0.0.x or 6.0.1.x, the
   latency values might now show higher values:
   
   [latency][info] xmlfirewall(Test_XMLFW): tid(41433504):
   Latency:   0   0   0   0  180  179   0  180   0   0   0  180
   0   0   0   0 [http://ip:port/uri]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.12, 6.0.0.4 and 6.0.1.1.
