ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description&#65496;
   We had an issue earlier today where one of the monitored
   servers on our
   UK Control Center environment continually would appear to go
   down and
   up due to an invalide XML character.  In order to resolve this
   issue, I
   normally right click on the monitored server and pause
   monitoring.
   Once it goes to a paused state, I resome monitoring at the
   "now" point
   because I don't want Control Center to "see" the invalid XML
   character.  When I tried to do this today, I accidentally chose
   "remove
   server" instead of  "resume monitoring".  I didn't get a warning
   message askin me if I was sure.  Control Center then proceeded
   to
   remove the monitored server, I tried to cancel the action, but
   then my
   console locked up.  I opened a new console and when it came up,
   the
   monitored server was removed.  I then added the server back to
   Control
   Center.
