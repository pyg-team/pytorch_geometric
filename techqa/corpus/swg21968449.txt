QUESTION
 What are the fixes and known issues included in IBM Security Network Protection firmware update 5.3.1.5? 

ANSWER
Description
IBM Security Network Protection firmware version 5.3.1.5 is a firmware update for the XGS NGIPS network protection platform. These release notes address compatibility, installation, and other getting-started issues. 

Fixes
Firmware update 5.3.1.5 provides fixes for the following issues in the IBM Security Network Protection firmware Version 5.3.1: 

 * 64621 - The value of the SSL Connection Statistics graph for date range is shown as a floating point value, which is the incorrect type. This is corrected by changing the type to an integer value. 
 * 69647 - System alerts FNXSY0003I and FNXSY0004I are not generated when there is unanalyzed traffic in 5.3. 
 * 73870 - When a defective Network Interface module is installed in a running system, the inspection engine crashes, which can cause a kernel segfault.
   System alert GLGHW9008E is logged in System Events, which includes the serial number and the bank of the failed NIM. 
 * 74300 - CLI no longer displays Invalid arguments when the user cancels the Services > Restart command. 
 * 74813 - Fixed an issue in which average and maximum latencies for 3100 and 4100 onboard ports were adversely affected. Latencies are now in line with the datasheet. 
 * 74881 - Because IBM Security Network Intrusion Prevention policy accepts any input and VLAN regardless of its case, some upper and lower case combinations of the 3 letters can cause migration to incorrectly migrate the VLAN policy. 
 * 74963 - NTP policy does not accept NTP server names that begin with a number. 
 * 75006 - HTTPS traffic is not captured by the user authentication portal when Outbound SSL Inspection policy is not configured. This fix displays the user authentication portal when a user attempts to access an HTTPS site whenever the Unauthenticated User NAP rule is configured, whether or not outbound SSL inspection is enabled. 
 * 75079 - Cannot change the number of FNXSI1001E messages (VLAN tagged outbound SSL traffic is skipped) that are shown in system logs.
   Added the following advanced tuning parameters*:
   alpsd.ssl.event.throttle = 10 Per Interval for system. If 0 then disables throttling altogether.
   alpsd.ssl.event.interval = 60 In Seconds 
 * 75124 - When an address list object is imported via the Merge or the Migrate to Repository commands in SiteProtector, the VLAN value is changed from a blank to a 0. 
 * 75129 - Fixed an issue that caused the inspection engine to crash (alpsd, signal 11), resulting in no System or IPS events being generated. 
 * 75141 - When the primary inspection engine process is shut down, Primary lcores are resuming is incorrectly recorded to (syslog|messages log).
   This message will no longer appear. 
 * 75299 - Fixed a problem where non-sequitur events needed to be reported right away instead of waiting for the current packet to finish being analyzed. 
 * 75413 - Update to the latest GKSit to add LMI access using Firefox when appliance is FIPS enabled and ALPN is enabled in Firefox. 
 * 75730 - Trigger a system event when a fan or power supply goes bad.
   System event GLGHW0101E is now triggered. 
 * 75771 - Some hardware events have incorrect IDs. 
   Added GLGHW0011W and GLGHW0012E to the event ID list 
 * 75774 - The log no longer displays TEMP: messages when debug logging is at default level. 
 * 76027 - Remove unwanted information and add result debug level information to the CLI analysis commands output. 
 * 76366 - Add tuning parameters to specify URL to be used to redirect both the authentication request and block pages.
   Added the following tuning parameters*:
   tune.block.redirect.url = http://<url> Redirects blocked sites to an external customer block page instead of system injected block page.
   tune.auth.redirect.url = http://<url>/script?orig= Redirects user to an external customer authentication portal for login. 
 * 76653 - ICMP-based events are reported against the default IPS object instead of the one from the matching NAP rule. 
 * 76721 - Traffic by User and Application graphs display a straight line in the LMI, instead of rising and falling traffic levels. 
 * 76768 - Process hangs in soft bypass mode are not always detected and logged correctly, causing difficulty in diagnosing crash data.
   This fix improves support oriented crash data generation.


* Important: Change advanced tuning parameter values only under the supervision of IBM Customer Support.
