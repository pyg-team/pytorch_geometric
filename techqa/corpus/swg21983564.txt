Title: IBM Custom Properties for improving application startup in WebSphere Application Server - United States

Text:
WASV9RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In WebSphere Application Server traditional V9.0, Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 1.2 is enabled by default. Enablement of CDI 1.2 might increase unnecessary performance overhead if the application does not use CDI. 

SYMPTOM
 The application starts slowly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Disable CDI processing steps for applications or archives that do not contain CDI content, and for which the steps are unnecessary. The following Java custom properties and manifest attributes are introduced to disable CDI processing steps: 

 * 
 * Name:
 * 
 * 
 * Allowed Values:
 * 
 * 
 * Default Value:
 * 
 * 
 * Description
 * 
 * com.ibm.ws.cdi.enableImplicitBeanArchives
 * 
 * beans.xml
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Name:
 * 
 * 
 * Allowed Values:
 * 
 * 
 * Default Value:
 * 
 * 
 * Description:
 * 
 * com.ibm.ws.cdi.enableCDI
 * 



In addition to these Java custom properties that impact all applications that are deployed to the target server, the following properties can be set in the server-wide amm.filter.properties file and as manifest attributes of application archive files. 
 * System Property Name:
 * 
 * 
 * Property and Manifest Attribute Name:
 * 

 * System Property Name:
 * 
 * 
 * Property and Manifest Attribute Name:
 * 


Note:  * The amm.filter.properties file is located at WAS_HOME/properties/amm.filter.properties. 
 * Manifest attributes are set as main manifest attributes in Java EE-related application archive files, such as EAR, WAR, RAR, and JAR files. 
 * The Enable-CDI property affects an entire application. Set this property on the Manifest.mf file of the application. Setting this property only for a module archive has no effect. 


In this way, the property value from the least enclosing scope is used. An attribute value on a module manifest takes precedence over the attribute value on the application. The attribute value on the application takes precedence over a java custom property value. The java custom property value takes precedence over a property value set in the amm.filter.properties file.
