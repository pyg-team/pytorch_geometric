APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has downloaded and installed Modeler Client Trial 17.1
   on their Windows Server 2012R2 machine. Installation is
   successful (ran as Admin) and no errors appear in the logs.
   
   When starting Modeler Client, we can see the modelerclient.exe
   process in Task Manager for a few seconds and then it
   disappears/crashes.
   
   Modeler Client logs do not show any errors.
   MS Win Event Viewer logs do not show any errors.
   There are no dump/core/trace files placed in Modeler\bin or
   %temp% directories during the crash.
   
   Even though installing Modeler Client Trial 17.1 on a Windows
   Server 2012 R2 is not supported (single license used instead of
   a concurrent license), the Modeler Client UI should appear and
   an error message is expected.
