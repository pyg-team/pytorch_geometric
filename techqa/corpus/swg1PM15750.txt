APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Static file requests were recorded in the
   ServletActivityReport of a System Management Facilities (SMF)
   120 record with the name being the actual file that was
   requested.  Previous to this, the name section was filled with
   "SimpleFileServlet". Customers would like an option to retain
   this behavior.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Application Server    *
   *                 V7.0 for z/OS                                *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a static resource, SMF 120 record   *
   *                      displays more detailed data in          *
   *                      WebSphere Application Server V6.1 and   *
   *                      later                                   *
   *                                                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In WebSphere Application Server 5.1, the SMF 120 data
   displays a "SimpleFileServlet" in the name field of a static
   file report.  However, WebSphere Application Server 6.1 and
   later display the actual name of the static resource.  For
   example,
   
   In 5.1:
   Triplet #: 4.1; Type: ServletActivitySection;
     Name: SimpleFileServlet;
     ResponseTime: 1  sec*10**-3 ;
     ......
   
   In 6.1 and later:
   Triplet #: 4.1; Type: ServletActivitySection;
     Name: /simple.html;
     ResponseTime: 3  sec*10**-3 ;
     ......
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebContainer code was modified to allow a user to
   customize the detail of the SMF 120 data.
   
   In order to display "FileServletWrapper" in place of the
   static resource name, set the WebContainer custom property:
   
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.FileWrapperEventsLessDetail = true
   (default is false)
   Note: In WebSphere Application Server Version 6 and later
   SimpleFileServlet was replaced by FileServletWrapper
   
   To display the static resource name, set the WebContainer
   custom property:
   
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.FileWrapperEvents = true (default is
   false)
   
   Note that the latter custom property was introduced by PK70152 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK70152].
   
   Please refer to the following technote for instructions on
   enabling WebContainer custom properties:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rss=180&uid=swg21284395 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rss=180&uid=swg21284395]
   
   APAR PM15750 requires changes to documentation.
   
   NOTE: Periodically, we refresh the documentation on our
   Web site, so the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line
   documentation, go to the product library page at:
   
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   
   The following changes to the WebSphere Application Server
   Version 7.0 Information Center will be made available in
   June, 2010.
   
   The topic "Web container custom properties" will
   be updated to include the following description of the
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.FileWrapperEvents custom
   property:
   
   Customizing the content of your SMF type 120 record
   
   Starting with Version 6.1, the SMF type 120 record
   displays the name of the static resource instead of
   FileServletWrapper in the name field of a static file
   report. If you migrated to from an earlier version of
   the product, and want your SMF type 120 record to
   display FileServletWrapper in the name field of a static
   file report, add the
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.FileWrapperEventsLessDetail  custom
   property
   to your Web container settings and set it to true. The
   default value for this property is false.
   
   Name                                                  Value
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.FileWrapperEventsLessDetail  false

   Level (Fix Pack) 7.0.0.11 of WebSphere Application Server V7.0.
