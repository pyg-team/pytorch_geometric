ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   This doesn't have a problem to configure/run the agent against
   Server 2000 systems.
   However, it has a problem to configure the SQL 2005.
   This problem didn't exist in 6.1.0-TIV-ITM_SQL-LA0024.
   This is because of the missing code pieces in omdbcom_FP1A
   module.

   Server agent that is monitoring SQL Server 2005.
    ITM 6.1 MSSQL agent , FP01. with 6.1.0-TIV-ITM_SQL-LA0025
   
   
   Related Files and Output:
   -   Log files are located in $CANDLEHOME/logs on UNIX/Linux and
   %CANDLE_HOME%\tmaitm6\logs on Windows.
