APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When importing, if a timeout occurs after an artifact has been
   staged in codestation, the artifact will remain in codestation
   after the import tries again. The artifact exists in codestation
   with size and md5sum matching the original artifact, even if the
   import failed though UCD.  The artifact is never "cleaned up"
   using disk space unnecessarily, UCD doesn't see it valid, and
   the import is shown as failed.
