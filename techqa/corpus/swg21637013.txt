Title: IBM Logs created in /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach not removed on Launcher stop - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When stopping the IBM WebSphere TX Launcher (killing process) these log files are not removed anymore. 

SYMPTOM
When starting the IBM WebSphere TX Launcher processes on Unix platforms, some log files may be created in the sub-directory /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach. These log files are not removed on Launcher stop. 

These logs should be disabled by default, when using the JVM supplied with the WTX product (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407964 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407964])


CAUSE
Using an alternative JVM where this option may not be disabled by default.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere TX Launcher on Unix platforms

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Disabling logging option is possible, when using Java system property: Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no

This change needs to be made in the launcher.sh and dtx.ini files:

Line 102 of launcher.sh from

$JAVA $WTX_JES_HEAP_OPTIONS
com.ibm.websphere.dtx.launcher.core.EventServerManager &
to
$JAVA -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no $WTX_JES_HEAP_OPTIONS
com.ibm.websphere.dtx.launcher.core.EventServerManager &

and

Options in dtx.ini:

[JVM Options]
option1=-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no
;option2=
