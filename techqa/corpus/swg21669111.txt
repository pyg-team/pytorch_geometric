 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a problem related to SCA, SIB or the Failed Event Manager in IBM Business Process Manager. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Business Process Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


SETTING THE TRACE SETTING

Set the following trace string and then reproduce the problem. 
 * For SCA and SIB-related problems:
   *=info:SCA.*=all:SIBMessageTrace*=all:SIBCommunications=all

 * For Failed Event-related problems:
   *=info:Recovery=all


Note: Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction timeouts and errors. 

To set the tracing and generate a new set of logs and traces, complete the following steps:  1. Under ​Troubleshooting​ ​>​ ​Log and Trace​, select the server where you want to change the settings. ​
    
    
 2. Click Change Log Detail Levels​.
    
    
 3. Select the ​configuration tab to set the tracing. This change takes effect after the next server restart and a completely new set of log files can be collected. Optionally, select the runtime​ tab to dynamically set the tracing.
    
    
 4. Enter the trace string and click OK.
    
    
 5. If you selected the configuration tab, stop the server.
    
    
 6. Archive and delete the current log files, traces, and ffdc from the following directories:  * install​​_​​root​​/​​profiles/profile​​_​​name​​/​​logs​​/​​server​​_​​name 
     * install​​_​​root​​/​​profiles/profile​​_​​name​​/​​logs​​/ffdc
       
       
       Note: The install​​_​​root,profile​​_​​name,and​​server​​_​​namevalues are specific to your environment.
       
       
    
    
 7. Start the server and check the trace.log file to make sure that the correct tracing is set.
    
    
 8. Reproduce the problem and gather the complete server log files and ffdc directory.
    
    
 9. Delete the trace string from the Log Detail Level for your server.
    
    


Note: Ensure that you have set the Maximum trace file size (recommendation: 20MB) as well as the number of historical trace files (recommendation: 10) to an appropriate value. You can find those values at Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service.
