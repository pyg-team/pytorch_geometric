Any of the following may be noticed-


 * There may be errors in some of the log files (eg. /tmp/guard_stap.stderr.txt on the DB Server ) that state that the KTAP file is missing.

 *   * /dev/guard_ktap: No such file or directory
    * 
   
   
 * In the guard_tap.ini file on the DB Server the following parameter may be set as 0

 *   * ktap_installed=0 
    * 
   
   
 * The inspection engine will not have all of the required settings.
