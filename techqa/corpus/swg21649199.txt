 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You see the following in the online/message log:



17:39:39 WARNING! Physical Log size 1048576 is too small.

Physical Log overflows may occur during peak activity.

Recommended minimum Physical Log size is 80 times maximum concurrent user threads.





What are issues/concerns to having an undersized physical log. If you hit the limit in the Physical Log, does this mean that transactions will be blocked during a checkpoint.

Could this cause significant delay in responses which could be an issue at our application. Is it possible that this can possibly cause CORRUPTION of the database.








CAUSE
Physical log size is too small 



ANSWER
There are drawbacks to having an undersized physical log.



 * Checkpoints firing too frequently due to small physical log hitting 75% full mark often 
 * Checkpoint blocking due to physical log filling during a checkpoint 
 * Fast Recovery can take longer if physical log is not large enough 
   


Start with 1 GB and go from there if you not sure of a starting point for the Physical Log. 
Use onparams to change the physical log.


onparams -p -s <size> -d phydbs 

informix> onparams -p -s 2097152 -d phydbs will create a 2 GIG Physdbs
