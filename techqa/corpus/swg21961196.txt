QUESTION
 Is using WebSphere Extreme Scale (WXS) v8.6 with ITCAM for Applications v7.2 supported? 

ANSWER
As of 2H2015, the WebSphere eXtreme Scale (WXS) v8.6.x product is not supported with ITCAM for Applications V7.2 nor is it supported with ITCAM for Application Diagnostics v7.1. Only WXS v6.1 is supported with ITCAM for App Diagnostics v7.1.x.x at this time.

However, WXS 8.6 support is being tracked via APAR PM92340 (ITCAM TEMA MISSING QUORUMACTIVATIONSTATUS ATTRIBUTE) and is targeted for 7.1.0.4 and 7.2.0.0.6, expected to be out very soon within 2 months or earlier.

Should you need support before then, you can open a new pmr and request a hotfix and we'll try to get to you one from our L3.
