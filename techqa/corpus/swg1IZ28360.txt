APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TIP team needs a fix to address a problem in TEP they found.
   Briefly, the TEP has 3 different places where we
   programmatically insert additional system properties.  The
   pattern we use is to first capture the current set of system
   properties, insert the additional properties we need, then set
   the updated set of properties back into the System object.  This
   technique appears to have the unexpected side-effect of removing
   and/or resetting system properties that already exist before the
   update takes place.  Since TIP uses a number of system
   properties to control and configure its operation, the reset
   and/or loss of these properties when interfacing with the TEPS
   Data Layer API is causing all sort of serious problems
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Java System properties are being lost when interfacing with
   the TEPS Data Layer API.
   
   When using the TEPS Data Layer API, the construction of a
   TEPDataProvider instance is resulting in the loss of any
   previously established Java System properties.  Since these
   properties are often crucial to the execution of the application
   using the TEPS API, their removal is resulting in unexpected and
   incorrect behavior in the consuming application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The TEPS Data Layer API was modified to ensure that any new
   properties added programmatically by that API layer does not
   result in the loss of any existing System properties.
