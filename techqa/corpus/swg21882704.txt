Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects the IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository component of IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Users are already protected from this issue if they: 

 * Have already applied WebSphere Application Server Interim Fix PI36563 to mitigate against the "FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys". This fix removes RC4 from the default cipher lists. 
 * AND are not using a custom WebSphere Application Server cipher list that includes the RC4 cipher


If WebSphere Application Server Interim Fix PI36563 has not yet been applied, users should follow the advice contained in the following linked WebSphere Application Server security bulletin: [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613]http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613]. 

 

If a custom cipher list is being used, users should verify that RC4 is not one of the listed ciphers, and remove it if it is. 


You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
