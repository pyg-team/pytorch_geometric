PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Installation Manager has IPv6 limitations with FTP addresses and floating license servers. HTTP access using IPv6 is supported. 

SYMPTOM
Within in the Installation Manager, choosing to add a new repository (File > Preferences > Repositories) with an ftp address using IPv6 will cause an error when attempting to access the repository. Using an IPv6 address for a floating license server will not work (Manage License Wizard). 

CAUSE
IPv6 is supported for the HTTP repositories but not for FTP or floating license server addresses. 

Additional public information about IPv6 compliance can be found at:

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You will see error messages similar to: 

 * 
 * Downloading ftp://[2002:92c:801:17:9:34:114:102]/ftpusers/ipv6/pu/repository/repository.xml.
 * 
 * com.ibm.cic.common.transports.commons.net.FtpException: FTP reply=501.501 you are on IPv6 connection, use EPSV instead\n
 * 
 * com.ibm.cic.common.transports.commons.net.FTPClientUtil.checkNegativePermanent(FTPClientUtil.java:27)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Move the repository server to an http:// repository or an ftp:// repository on an IPv4 ftp server. Host the license server on an IPv4 server.
