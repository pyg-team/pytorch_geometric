APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The OUTBOUND_ACHFILEIDMOD is used for the value to use for the
   File ID Modifier that is part of the filename.  This is used to
   provide for a unique file name when sending multile files to
   the same partner.  The ORIGIN_RT value that is used in an ACH
   file can be configured at multiple places, one of which is at
   the Transmission Definition.  When configured at the
   Transmission Definition this value takes precedence over the
   normal value that is used.  However the value configured at the
   Transmission Definition is not being used in the
   OUTBOUND_ACHFILEIDMOD table.
