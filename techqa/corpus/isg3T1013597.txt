PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I change resource preemption to License Maximizer? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change Resource Preemption to License Maximizer

Marketing changed the name of the feature to "License Maximier" sometime after 4.1 was released. Our code, license key, documentation (soft and hard copies) need to reflect that change.
Please download patch 23641.
