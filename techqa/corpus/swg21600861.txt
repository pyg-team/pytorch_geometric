Text:
TSM restart ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_ REQUIRED TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Tivoli Storage Manager server is upgraded to version 6.3.0.0 but the upgrade fails with the ACUOSI0050E error message and return code 3010. 

CAUSE
Windows system reboot is required

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The installation logs from the failed upgrade are available at : 

C:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\logs.zip.

In the logs.zip file, review the ia\log.txt file. It shows the following error :

Fri Jul 06 19:38:25.463 CEST 2012 : STDOUT : There were problems installing the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Server. See C:\Program Files\Tivoli\TSM\_uninst\plan\logs\tsm_server.log for details.
Fri Jul 06 19:38:25.478 CEST 2012 : FINE : PlanStepEventOccurred(Failed target 'step_00001_TSM_Server_1_1') (from com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.COIWrapperPluginImpl$SimpleListener.eventOccurred)

The error indicates that the upgrade failed on the Tivoli Storage Manager step.
From the same logs.zip file, review the "coi\plan\install\MachinePlan_localhost\00001_TSM_Server_1_1\logs\[INSTALL_date_time]\TSM_Server_1_1.log" file. It shows the following error :

ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 3010. Invocation string: [cmd.exe, /c, install.bat], com.ibm.ac.common.hosts.UpdateFailedException: : ]

From the above error message. The return code 3010 is a return code returned by Windows which means a "restart is required to complete the install".
Still from the same logs.zip file, review the coi\plan\tmp\installFixPack.log file. It shows the following messages :

MSI (s) (38:BC) [14:49:40:210]: Windows Installer requires a system restart. Product Name: DB2 Enterprise Server Edition - DB2TSM1. Product Version: 9.7.400.501. Product Language: 1044. Manufacturer: IBM. Type of System Restart: 2. Reason for Restart: 1.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reboot the Windows system and rerun the upgrade after the reboot.
