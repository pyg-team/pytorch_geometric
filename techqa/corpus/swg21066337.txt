PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message DFHXS1201 and incorrect double-byte character set (DBCS) format when CICS is checking a bad userid in a VERIFY PASSWORD command. This problem also happens with message DFHSN1101. 

SYMPTOM
DFHXS1201


CAUSE
An application is passing a USERID that is not printable.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This error occurs because the USERID passed on EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.applicationprogramming.doc/commands/dfhp4_verifypassword.html] is non-printable and includes X'0F' (DBCS shift in). The USERID value (in hex) is '1B0F3B5E7087090F'. By the time the dump is taken, the password information has been destroyed by CICS. 


DFHMEFO is expecting to receive a displayable USERID insert but has been passed non-displayable characters. Normally you would see a DFHXS1205 [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhxs/XS1205.html] message for a bad userid. The fact that you are getting a DFHXS1201 [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhxs/XS1201.html] (invalid password) suggests that the password length was 0 (meaning all blanks).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the application to pass a valid userid and password on the verify password call.
