ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR introduces Data Masking stage to Information Server
   9.1 or above. Data Masking stage provides capability to mask
   sensitive data in DataStage ETL processing.
   
   Data Masking stage internally calls Optim Data Privacy Providers
   (ODPP), which is a library to mask privacy data. To use Data
   Masking stage, you need to install Optim Data Privacy Providers
   (ODPP) on the DataStage engine machine. Please refer to the
   prerequisite described below.
   
   Previous version of Data Masking stage was released as a part of
   'DataStage pack for Data Msking (PDM)' version 8.5.
   The new Data Masking stage delivered in this APAR has the
   following new functions compared to the previous version of Data
   Masking stage.
   
     - Support Optim Data Privacy Providers (ODPP) version 9.1
       PDM version 8.5?supports only ODPP version 1.0.
       The new Data Masking stage enables you to use ODPP version
   9.1 in addition to ODPP version 1.0.
   
     - Support Hash masking policy
       Hash data masking policy is newly introduced. Hash data
   masking policy generates Hash key values from input records and
   allows you to do look-up processing on the separated downstream
   stages to perform hash lookup.
