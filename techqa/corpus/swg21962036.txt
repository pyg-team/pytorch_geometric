EA; SP TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you manually generate debug logs for SiteProtector's Event Archiver component? 

CAUSE
The SiteProtector Event Archiver is responsible for archiving event data from SiteProtector to flat files for backup purposes. If an issue occurs with the Event Archiver, IBM Support might require debug logging to investigate the problem.

ANSWER
Follow these instructions to generate and collect the logs:


 1.  Download the udrc.zip file that is attached to this article.
     udrc.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962036&aid=2]udrc.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962036&aid=1]
     
 2.  Extract the file that is named .udrc into the following directory on the Event Archiver server:
     
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Archiver\
     
     Note: The Windows operating system does not allow users to create a file name starting with a period. Because of this, Support provides the .udrc file to customers in a compressed file. Users should not attempt to rename the file because the operating system will not allow it to be changed back to its original form that begins with a period.
     
 3.  Locate the following file and open it with a text editor:
     
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Archiver\EventArchiver.xml
     
 4.  Locate the line that looks like:
     
     <Logging level='ERROR'>
     
     And change it to:
     
     <Logging level='DEBUG'>
     
     Save and close file.
     
     Note: The original version of the line might have a value other than ERROR, depending on modifications that previous users have made to the system.
     
 5.  Open Windows Services and restart the SiteProtector Event Archiver service.
     
 6.  With logging now enabled, gather the relevant data by doing the following:  1. Replicate any errors that you are experiencing. 
      2. Wait 5 minutes to ensure that you get a full capture of logs.
         
     
     
 7.  Add the following files to a single compressed file:
     
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Archiver\.udout
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Archiver\EventArchiver*.log
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Archiver\*.xml
     
 8.  Delete the .udrc file and revert the changes that were made in steps 3 and 4.
     
 9.  Restart the SiteProtector Event Archiver service.
     
     Important: Failure to follow steps 8 and 9 will result in large log files. This can lead to disk space issues on the system.
     
 10. Send the compressed file containing the logs to Support by using Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep) [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/index.html].
