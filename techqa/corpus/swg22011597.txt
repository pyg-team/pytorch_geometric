Title: IBM time difference between Source and Target replication - United States

Text:
Timezone; time difference TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How can I find out what is causing a time difference between my Source and Target Agent. 

SYMPTOM
Replication Problem if date / time column is used. 
E.g. Failed to update a row in table 


CAUSE
The issue was caused by a UTC vs DST (Daylight Saving Time) configuration issue. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verification of Timezone settings on Source and Target Operating Systems show: 
Windows with SQL Server: UTS -6 
Target with DB2 : UTC -5 
Access Server on same machine as Target.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1.) test if a simple restart of all CDC agents helps. If there was a DST change but the session was not ended, then the new correct time is not yet reflected as long as the session has not been ended and the CDC agent not been restarted. 
2.) add the system parameter db_system_timezone_override=UTC to the source instance. Then restart your agents on source and target and restart replication.
