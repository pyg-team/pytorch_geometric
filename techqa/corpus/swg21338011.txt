PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Environment:
Windows 2000 
Upfront Series 7 
Internet Explorer and Netscape

Description:

Is it possible to change the functionality of the browser back button when coming from an external site to Upfront?

There is a link from an Intranet (or Extranet) website to Cognos Upfront. OS signons are used such that users are brought directly to the Upfront home page. When the back button is clicked, the page simply refreshes and the location does not change.

Solution:

The back button simply refreshes the page as the previous page is in fact itself. The process of entering Upfront is as follows:

1. Click an Upfront related URL, or type it in address/location bar of browser (Page 1)
2. Upfront checks if a session cookie has already been assigned, since this is a first time entry with no session cookie, the page redirects to Upfront login (Page 2)
3. Upfront login page then checks for OS signons or prompts for login. Since OS signons are being used, 
the page redirects to Upfront Home - upfcgi.exe (Page 3).
4. Upfront home page then performs another check(layout check) on itself, before being redirected to itself (page 4).

In summary, clicking on a link from an Intranet using OS Signons site actually goes through 4 pages. Therefore, the history has 3 &#34;hidden&#34; Upfront pages. Clicking the back button at this point goes back to the same page(where it checks itself).

Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the history of a Browser. This is considered a security breach. Some browsers like Netscape(not Internet Explorer), provide functionality to disable this security policy using JavaScript so the entire history can be accessed. 

As a workaround, it is possible to add a custom button, or URL, in the tree.utml(or other) Upfront template to go back 4 pages. For example:
<A href=&#34;javascript:history.go(-4)&#34;><-- Back</A>. 
Note, however, that such code would have to also check if this is the 
first login (see step 2 above). 

If planning on using a customised environment, ensure that a proper back up of tree.utml has been made and copied to a secure location. 

Other alternatives include appending entries to the Upfront session cookie.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The back button simply refreshes the page as the previous page is in fact itself. The process of entering Upfront is as follows:

1. Click an Upfront related URL, or type it in address/location bar of browser (Page 1)
2. Upfront checks if a session cookie has already been assigned, since this is a first time entry with no session cookie, the page redirects to Upfront login (Page 2)
3. Upfront login page then checks for OS signons or prompts for login. Since OS signons are being used, the page redirects to Upfront Home - upfcgi.exe (Page 3).
4. Upfront home page then performs another check(layout check) on itself, before being redirected to itself (page 4).

In summary, clicking on a link from an Intranet using OS Signons site actually goes through 4 pages. Therefore, the history has 3 "hidden" Upfront pages. Clicking the back button at this point goes back to the same page(where it checks itself).

Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the history of a Browser. This is considered a security breach. Some browsers like Netscape(not Internet Explorer), provide functionality to disable this security policy using JavaScript so the entire history can be accessed.
