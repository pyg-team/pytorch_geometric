QUESTION
 How to control user timeout session in Application Engine and Workplace XT when deployed in a Weblogic server environment? 

ANSWER
This is configured using the Weblogic server Session Timeout settings. 

Session Timeout 
You can specify an interval of time after which HTTP sessions expire. When a session expires, all data stored in the session is discarded. You can set the interval in either the web.xml or weblogic.xml: 


Weblogic.xml
Set the timeout-secs parameter value in the session-descriptor element of the WebLogic-specific deployment descriptor, weblogic.xml. This value is set in seconds. For more information, see session-descriptor. 

 

Web.xml
Set the session-timeout element in the J2EE standard Web application deployment descriptor, web.xml.
