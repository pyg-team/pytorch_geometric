ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CEC agent dumps core with the following stack trace.
   (dbx) where
   execute_memLPARstruct(cmd = "/usr/bin/ssh -l hscroot
   nzlchm3.nndc.kp.org "lssyscfg -r lpar -m
   \"Server-9119-595-SN025A68E\"
   -F lpar_env:lpar_id:state" "), line 1264 in "HMCQuery.c"
   getHMC_lparstat(total = 0x203f9ae8), line 427 in "HMCQuery.c"
   gather_hmc_info(arg = (nil)), line 108 in "HMCQuery.c"
   (dbx)
   It could happen because of the following reasons:
   1. Wrong CEC specified using key.pl
   2. Command "/usr/bin/ssh -l <hmc user> <HMC name> "lssyscfg -r
   lpar -m < CEC name > -F lpar_env:lpar_id:state"", when run from
   agent machine, returning message

   CEC name > -F lpar_env:lpar_id:state"
