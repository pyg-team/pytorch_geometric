RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Upgrade FileAgent to latest version.

The Java stack trace shows use of JRE version 1.4.2 as you can see below:

1XHFULLVERSION J2RE 1.4.2 IBM AIX build ca142-20060824 (SR6)

We have not used that in FileAgent since the days of version 1.1.

JRE 1.6 as used in later File Agent versions has significant improvements around memory management and should 
address this issue.
