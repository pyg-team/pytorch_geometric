APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The next auto-reminder date is being calculated from the date
   the custodian was removed and re-added to a hold notice instead
   of using the most recent date the auto-reminder notice was sent
   to the larger custodian list.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a new recipient is added to a hold notice after the
   initial notice is sent, the auto-reminder next date is
   recalculated incorrectly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.7.
