APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In our KC page on preparing a Linux system for installing IID,
   we list here:
   
   ...
   7. Set the umask value to 077 using the following command:
   
       umask 077
   
   The value 077 is the most restrictive value that IBM
   Integration Designer will tolerate. You can optionally choose
   to set a less restrictive umask value for the following access
   levels:
   
       037 for read-only access for a group of human
   administrators and tools
       027 for read and write access for a group of human
   administrators and tools
       007 for read, write, and execute access for a group of
   human administrators and tools
   ...
   
   
   12. If you are using DB2, make sure that all your DB2
   parameters meet the DB2 naming rules.
   
   
   However, if you are installing DB2 along with IID for the UTE
   you will get a DB2 install error due to incorrect permissions.
   This is because DB2 requires a umask of 022 instead:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961672 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961672]
   
   We should either put in a note for option 7 that if you are
   installing the UTE you need a umask of 022 or add that in as a
   note for option 12.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When installing the UTE with DB2, you need to use a umask of
   022. That IID page currently only lists the permission the IID
   alone needs and thus is deceptive if you use it when installing
   the UTE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  The documentation about preparing a Linux   *
   *                  system for installing IID does not specify  *
   *                  that a umask value of 022 is required for   *
   *                  a UTE with DB2 installation. The user will  *
   *                  get a DB2 installation error due to         *
   *                  incorrect permissions if this information   *
   *                  is not included.                            *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Add a note to the "Preparing Linux systems for installation
   (deprecated)" topic
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFTN5_8.5.7/com.
