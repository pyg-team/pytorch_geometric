 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does IBM® WebSphere® Message Broker support a Resource Registry file from IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker? 

ANSWER
WebSphere Transformation Extender maps that are called from WebSphere Message Broker can use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry. WebSphere Message Broker itself does not provide any facility for working with resource registries in areas of the message flow outside of the WebSphere Transformation Extender plugin. 

In the WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker documentation, the following sentence in the topic "Setting resource registry on execution groups:" 


Configure WebSphere Message Broker to use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry by setting the resource configuration (.mrc) file on execution groups. 




Should read: 


Configure WebSphere Transformation Extender for Message Broker to use the WebSphere Transformation Extender Resource Registry by setting the resource configuration (.mrc) file on the WebSphere Message Broker execution groups.
