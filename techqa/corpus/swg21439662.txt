Title: IBM CWSIT0088E: There are currently no messaging engines in bus twprocsvr_bus running - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You connect to bus and twprocsvr_bus failed in the bootstrap server with endpoint BPMDEVTW2:7277:BootstrapBasicMessaging with reason: CWSIT0088E: There are currently no messaging engines in bus twprocsvr_bus running. You receive Error 0000002a SibMessage W CWSIT0009W. 

CAUSE
The above error may occur in the SystemOut.log on WebSphere 6 when using the JMS subsystem (for example when connecting to the server with the Authoring Environment). Each messaging object has a unique identifier associated with it that is called a UUID. When the WebSphere 6 messaging engine is created and first accesses the database, the messaging engine registers its UUID in the database SIBOWNER table. When a database has been marked in such a way, it cannot be used by another messaging engine. TeamWorks instructs WebSphere to use TW process and performance datasources to store messaging engine data. Thus, there are several SIB* tables created in process and performance databases on TW server startup. When re-configuring and re-deploying TW on WebSphere Application Server 6 against the same set of databases, the SIB* tables mentioned above do not get deleted. The re-created twprocsvr_bus can not use the same SIB* tables because the UID is different.
So far we have only seen this problem after TeamWorks servers have been re-configured and re-deployed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Assuming that you do not need any data that might be present in these JMS tables, the easiest solution is to remove the SIB tables and allow them to be recreated on startup. Please note that we do NOT recommend using the following method on production system databases as the SIB* tables may contain production data that needs to be processed. To delete the SIB tables:

1. Stop the process and performance servers.
2. Backup the process and performance databases (optional)
3. DROP the tables with names starting with SIB in both process and performance databases
4. Start the process and performance servers. A new set of SIB* tables should be created upon restart
