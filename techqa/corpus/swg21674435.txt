Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a class loader manipulation vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2014-0114) that affects WebSphere Lombardi Edition and IBM Business Process Manager. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-0114 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0114]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Struts 1.X might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by the failure to restrict the setting of class loader attributes. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter of an ActionForm object to manipulate the class loader and execute arbitrary code on the system. There is partial impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

The affected products can be vulnerable in up to the following two different scenarios: 

The product bundles WebSphere Application Server. The Integrated Solution Console in WebSphere Application Server V7 and earlier uses a vulnerable version of the struts library. For these products you need to apply a fix for WebSphere Application Server. WebSphere Lombardi Edition and IBM Business Process Manager include various user interface components that make use of an additional instance of the vulnerable library and, therefore, need their own fix. AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
