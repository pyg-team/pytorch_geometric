1.1.0.1-IBM-IMA-IFIT06285 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FOther+software%2FMessageSight&fixids=1.1.0.1-IBM-IMA-IFIT06285&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After performing a firmware upgrade, pristine install, or device
   reset of an IBM MessageSight appliance, it was possible that you
   may not be able to successfully log in to the WebUI. Upon
   entering correct user details on the WebUI login page, the
   following message may be displayed:
   
   "Login Failed. Enter a valid user ID and password"
   
   Alternatively, the WebUI login page may fail to load at all.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  From the MessageSight CLI, users can issue the
   "advanced-pd-options _startldap" command to restart the internal
   LDAP server. Once this command has completed, users should be
   able to successfully log in to the MessageSight WebUI.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MessageSight appliance who
   have performed a firmware upgrade or pristine install to
   V1.1.0.1 and users of the V1.1.0.1 appliance firmware who
   perform a device RESET.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   There was an error in the platform services handling which
   prevented the internal LDAP server from starting correctly after
   a configuration reset, or modification of the firmware. When the
   internal LDAP service is not running, the WebUI is unable to
   authenticate users.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The post-update processes have been updated to ensure that the
   internal LDAP server is correctly started after an update or
   restart operation has occurred.
