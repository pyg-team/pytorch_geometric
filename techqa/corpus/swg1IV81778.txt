ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The responded number of nodes does not match the number of nodes
   in the
   collection when there is/are new nodes added into the
   collection. There
   is no condition been set on the collection.
   
   Symptoms:
   
   1. Open the 2 Event Viewers. One with "Un-acknowledged" filter
   and the
   other one "Acknowledged" filter.
   2. Acknowledge a node in "Un-acknowledged" Event Viewer. This
   will
   acknowledged the node and the node suppose to be added into
   "Acknowledged" Event Viewer on next refresh.
   3. On next refresh on "Acknowledged" Event Viewer, the total
   number of
   rows remain same, however the Severity summary did updated
   correctly.

   Investigation:
   
   1. The issue only start to occur after applied DASH Version:
   3.1.2.1
   Build Number: cf011242.02, 201508201935 (201511301851) Build
   Date:
   10/17/12, 8/20/15.
   2. The behavior is working good on DASH Version: 3.1.2.1 Build
   Number:
   cf011242.02, 201508201935 Build Date: 10/17/12, 8/20/15
   3. The "filteredRows" and "numRows" was returned as 10 while
   "totalRows" was correct at 11. This is puzzling since we does
   not
   impose any condition filtering on the collection. Full request
   and
   response below.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  DASH development working on a test fix
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The CURI code was using a too aggressive caching approach and
   was not accounting for cases where the dataset was being updated
   in terms of origin (root) nodes in the dataset.  The fix will be
   included in the next release but will also be included in
   Cumulative Patch 5 for DASH 3.1.2.1, when available, at
