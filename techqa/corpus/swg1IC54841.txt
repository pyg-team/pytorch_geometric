LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   endmqm is making a invalid call to function
   aocDeleteTemporaryQeueues. This function should only be called
   strmqm.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   A routine was setting a value during endmqm
   that indicated tha queue manager was starting. This caused the
   aocDeleteTemporaryQeueuesfunction to be executed. Corrected the
   routine to set the value only on strmqm.
