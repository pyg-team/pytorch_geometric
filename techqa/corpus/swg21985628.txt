QUESTION
 Is using Apache Tomcat v8 supported by the new ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0 agent? 

ANSWER
Sorry at this time (2Q2016), the Apache Tomcat v8 is not supported with the new ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0 agent. However, we have got it to work with the J2EE agent (v7.1.1.0.3) and it appears to work in on a Windows platform with JRE 1.8. This configuration has not been fully tested/certified yet, so its not officially supported. If things change, this technote will be updated to reflect the new support changes. 

If monitoring Apache Tomcat v8 is required, you should consider using the new IBM Performance Management suite of products. See the link here [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLNR_8.1.3/com.ibm.pm.doc/welcome.htm] for more information.
