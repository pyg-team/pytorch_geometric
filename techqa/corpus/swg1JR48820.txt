APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The REST API call is made from the DocumentList Coach Control
   in order to build a map of user ids to user names. This map is
   used to display the user name in the 'creator' column of the
   control. And it still looks like all LDAP
   users are returned in output.
   Similar to JR48022 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR48022]
   
   The slow REST call looks like this:
   /rest/bpm/wle/v1/users?includeTaskExperts=true&sort=true&include
   InternalMemberships=true&parts=all
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using a document list control with a large list of users, a
   REST call takes too long.
   
   EDITIONS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard, and Express
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   When using a document list control, a REST call is made to
   retrieve a map of user IDs to user names, which is used to
   resolve the ?Modified by? column in the list. However, this call
   can take a long time when the list of users is large.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 is available that removes the
   time-consuming REST call from the document list coach view and
   introduces a server script in the default Enterprise Content
   Management (ECM) search service. The server script maps the IDs
   to the user names. Because this script runs on the server only
   for the specified set of IDs, the query is fast and the data
   that is returned is concise.
   
   The fix for V8.5.0.1 has been included with superseding fix
   for APAR JR50346 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR50346]. On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fix
   central), search for JR50346 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR50346]:
   
   1. Select the product group, product, installed version, and
   platform, and click Continue.
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR50346 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR50346], and click Continue.
   
   When downloading fix packages, ensure that you also download the
   readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for additional
   installation instructions and information about the fix.
   
   This fix changes the default ECM search service in the Content
   Management toolkit. When working with the document list coach
   view, this service is called to perform the search to populate
   the documents table. It is standard practice, shown in the
   documentation, to copy this service from the Content Management
   toolkit into the current process application and configure it to
   use the ECM server that is required.
   
   Note: If you have a previous version of the service copied into
   the process application, you will not see the fix working. For
   evidence that the fix is working, copy the fixed default ECM
   search service into the process application, configure this
   search service, and set the document list to use this search
   service.
