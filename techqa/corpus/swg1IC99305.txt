APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM WebSphere DataPower M/T 9235 appliance might incorrectly
   report the failure of two power supplies. This message is not
   reported on all appliances.
   
   When this issue occurs, the following messages are present in
   the DataPower logs:
   
     System power supply #2 has failed.
   
   or logging event code:
   
     0x80400022 System power supply #2
   
   To check if this is a problem, issue the following CLI commands
   on the appliance:
   
     co
     test hardware
     exit
   
   The following output from the test hardware command confirms
   this problem:
   
     [failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not
   present.
     [failure] Power supply '2' has no AC input power, or is not
   present.
   
   Other results in the test hardware command might also show
   incorrect values.
   
   This problem does not affect the operation of the appliance
   other than the continuous reporting of the power supply failure
   message.
   
   Note: A working power supply has a green LED.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Issue the "shutdown reboot" command.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customers with 9235 hardware platforms might experience the PSU
   sensors error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.13 and 6.0.0.5.
