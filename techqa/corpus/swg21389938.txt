PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message CNX0106E Connect failed with error 'NOTAVAILABLE, CPSMAPI'. You are using IBM CICS Explorer and have configured a CICS Management Client Interface (CMCI) connection to a CICS region that is not managed by CICSPlex SM. This means, you are using the System Managed Single Server (SMSS) capabilities of the CMCI. 

CAUSE
In order to use the SMSS capabilities of the CMCI [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_setup.html], the CICS DFHRPL must contain the CICSTS41.CPSM410.SEYULOAD (or the equivalent for your release) dataset and the CICS STEPLIB must contain the APF authorized dataset CICSTS41.CPSM410.SEYUAUTH.

ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer and CMCI users that are sending requests to a CICS that is not managed by CICSPlex SM. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the CICS DFHRPL concatenation to include the CICSTS41.CPSM410.SEYULOAD (or the equivalent for your release) dataset.

Also, ensure that the CICS STEPLIB concatenation includes the APF authorized dataset CICSTS41.CPSM410.SEYUAUTH.
