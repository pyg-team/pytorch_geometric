AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

Principal Product and Version(s) IBM Explorer for z/OS V2.1 and V3.0.1 REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM has provided patches for the affected versions.

Installation instructions and the IBM Explorer for z/OS Version 2.1.0.13 update can be obtained at the following location:
Downloads for older releases of IBM Explorer for z/OS and IBM CICS Explorer [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031508]

Mainframe Development - Download Eclipse Tools [http://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/products/downloads/eclipse-tools/]

For users of CICS Explorer, V5.3.0.12 or higher should also be installed (if using CICS Explorer 5.2, V5.2.0.8 or higher should also be installed). CICS Explorer was rebuilt as a result of the affect this security vulnerability had on IBM Explorer for z/OS 3.0 (and V2.1), upon which CICS Explorer is built. CICS Explorer itself was not affected by the security vulnerability so there was no associated APAR. There were no updates to the CICS Tools plug-ins that are associated with this security vulnerability. See Latest version of CICS Explorer and CICS Tools plug-ins for CICS Explorer [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404312].
