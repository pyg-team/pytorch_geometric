APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Administrative Console for Content Engine (ACCE) to
   create a new Object Store, ACCE asks details on the Storage Area
   that it should create for storing the documents. When a Customer
   chooses to have a Fixed Content Area created, that uses a Tivoli
   Storage Manager Fixed Content Device, this choice is accepted by
   ACCE. When the Create Object Store wizard completes, it has
   created a Database Storage Area instead.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create a Fixed Content Area separately, and substitute the Fixed
   Content Area in the Storage Policy that ACCE has created for the
   Database Storage Area. Then rename the Database Storage Policy
   to reflect this change.
