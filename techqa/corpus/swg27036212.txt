Title: IBM Detailed System Requirements for the Data Privacy Components of IBM InfoSphere Optim v9.1 - United States

 DETAILED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ABSTRACT
 The system requirements for the Data Privacy Components of IBM® InfoSphere® Optim™ v9.1 are compiled in this document. 

CONTENT




The data privacy components provide support for data masking in addition to the data masking abilities supported through the use of column maps. There are three data privacy components: 

 1. A data privacy application that provides a graphical user interface to mask data in CSV and XML files and a command line interface to mask data in CSV and XML files, as well as data originating in a Hadoop environment.
 2. A stand-alone API (Optim data privacy providers or ODPP) that provides a flexible and extensible means of accessing pre-defined and user-developed data masking services with no need to install the Optim Test Data Management Solution. Functions in this API can be called from user-developed applications as well as from column map exits and Lua scripts for column map procedures, providing consistent, repeatable data masking results regardless of the application or platform. Note that column map exit and Lua support for these functions is an integral part of the Data Privacy option for the Test Data Management solution; you need not install the API separately to use this support.
 3. User defined functions (UDFs) for databases can be included in SQL scripts or statements to dynamically mask data within the framework of the DBMS server so that the data is masked in place without leaving the database.

MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
Minimum hardware requirements for using any data privacy component are:

If downloading an electronic version, 
2 GB of temporary disk space is needed. A DVD drive is required if installing from optical disk. In addition, 
2 GB of disk space is required for component package installation. IBM Installation Manager, if not previously installed, requires at least 100MB of disk space.
