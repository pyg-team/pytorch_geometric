ABSTRACT
 This short demo shows how to use the IBM CICS Explorer with CICS Tools to perform threadsafe analysis. CICS Performance Analyzer for z/OS (CICS PA) highlights optimization opportunities and shows the gains when changes have been made. CICS Interdependency Analyzer for z/OS (CICS IA) provides the deep insight into the program structure to identify obstacles to threadsafety.
