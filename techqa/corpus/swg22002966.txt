 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Version 6, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0 used by IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21, 22, 23, and 24. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in Jan 2017. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-5548 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5548]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120864 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120864] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-5549 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5549]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120863 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120863] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-5547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5547]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE Java SE Embedded and Jrockit related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service resulting in a low availability impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
