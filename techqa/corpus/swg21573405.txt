QUESTION
 How do I create an IBM Mantra health check? 

ANSWER
An IBM Mantra health check is a collection of performance information about the IBM Mantra appliance. Most commonly, the health check is run as part of a scheduled command job, with the results sent to IBM Support staff and system information event recipients. The status snapshot recorded in the health check is necessary to help IBM Support troubleshoot issues. 

You can, however, generate a health check on demand. This may be necessary, for example, if the automatic health check has been disabled or you need to generate a health check immediately for Support. To generate a health check from the CLI of the appliance, follow these steps: 

1. Start a Console session and select theSystem Configapplication from the main Navigation Bar. 

2. Select theCLItab to gain access to the appliance's command line interface. 

3. At the prompt, generate a health check as follows:
host> enable
host # configure terminal
host (config) # debug generate health-check


If outgoing email is enabled on the appliance, you can add a recipient to the health check by including the optional recipient argument. For example: 
host (config) # debug generate health-check recipient quality@netezza.com 


4. The completed health check is located in/var/opt/tms/sysdumps, named with an associated date-time stamp (for example,sysdump-mantra-20080413-235001.tgz). For information on SCPing the file off of the appliance, refer to the related document below.
