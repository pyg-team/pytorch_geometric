 2. Collect log traces for the Application Server  * For WAS, those are theSystemOut.log,SystemErr.logandtrace.logfound under<WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\<your server>. 
     * Send the full content of the log folder so we also see the trace of the last server start. 
     * Also include the full content of the corresponding FFDC folder,<WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\ffdc. 
     * See Collecting Data: reporting a problem with IBM Rule Execution Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653982] if the issue occurs when testing rules with the Decision Validation Services feature.
       
       
    
    
 3. Collect log traces for the database usage:
    If you detect an issue with the database provide the SQL queries log using DCLogger. For instructions read Decision Center: Backend trace collector [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21977917]
    
    
 4. Provide step by step instructions to reproduce the problem  1. If DC is customized please describe the customization. 
     2. Provide screen shots of display issues and logs for any other issues.
