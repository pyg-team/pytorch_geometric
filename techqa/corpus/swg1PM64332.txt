PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Distributed Data Facility (DDF) users.   *
   *                 Specifically where a DB2 10 for z/OS server  *
   *                 is accessed by remote clients using SSL      *
   *                 client (mutual) authentication.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Additional enhancements to              *
   *                      DB2 10 for z/OS digital certificate     *
   *                      authentication support.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   DB2 10 for z/OS APAR/PTF PM53450/UK77746 provided additional
   enhancements to support remote clients using the DRDA Transport
   Layer Security Client Certificate Authentication Security
   (TLSCCASEC) mechanism when accessing DB2 using digital
   certificates.
   Changes made in APAR PM53450 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM53450] to support the DRDA TLSCCASEC
   security mechanism required the DB2 server to have a trusted
   context defined for the user ID associated with the client
   certificate. This requirement imposed an unnecessary restriction
   for users that choose to use the DRDA TLSCCASEC security
   mechanism to access DB2, especially when the user ID associated
   with the client certificate is designated as the authorized
   ID to access DB2. Therefore, if a trusted context has not
   been defined for the user ID associated with the client
   certificate at the DB2 server, remote clients that attempts
   to access DB2 using the DRDA TLSCCASEC security mechanism would
   be denied access to DB2 (until the trusted context has been
   defined). This added layer of security does not provide
   additional benefit to the already secure nature of the TLS/SSL
   connection that is being established between the remote client
   and the DB2 server. Hence, this APAR will relax the requirement
   for a trusted context to be defined for the user ID associated
   with the client certificate when DRDA TLSCCASEC security
   mechanism is used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  DB2 10 for z/OS remote connection authentication processing has
   been changed to no longer require a trusted context to be
   defined for the user ID associated with the client certificate
   when the DRDA TLSCCASEC security mechanism is used.
