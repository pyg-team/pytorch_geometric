Text:
SP 3.0.0.3; XPU FIX README

ABSTRACT
 This update addresses several known issues in IBM Security SiteProtector 3.0. See below for a list of issues covered. 

CONTENT
Update to JRE 1.7.0 SR6 FP1

The JRE for SiteProtector has been updated to version 1.7.0 SR6 FP1.


SP Workitem 50605 / APAR IV58800

When changing between multiple analysis views in the SiteProtector Console and then changing the view by modifying only the date, the view may not be updated with the new date filter information and instead continue to display the previous filter.

The affected audience is anyone who uses analysis views and changes only the time filter.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly update the date filter when only the date filter is modified.


SP Workitem 51507 / APAR IV58801

If a sensor sends an event that contains detail information with the same name as one of the reserved column names in SiteProtector (such as a second "Time" column, for example), it may not be possible to create a ticket on that event.

The affected audience is anyone who has events with duplicate reserved column names and who wants to create tickets on those events.

This update allows SiteProtector to create tickets on events where sensors have supplied a duplicated column name of one the reserved column names in SiteProtector.


SP Workitem 50576 / APAR IV59050

If a sensor sends an event that contains detail information with the same name as one of the reserved column names in SiteProtector, it may not be possible to create a detail analysis view report containing that event.

The affected audience is anyone who has events with duplicate reserved column names and who wants to create detail analysis view reports on those events.

This update allows SiteProtector to create reports with events where sensors have supplied a duplicate column name of one of the reserved column names in SiteProtector.


SP Workitem 50575 / APAR IV58802

When loading and re-saving a detail view multiple times, it may be possible to corrupt the view that gets saved if certain kinds of events with certain column names are present when the view is saved. Although using a corrupted view in the Analysis tab has no obvious effect, it can cause errors if a scheduled report is run on the corrupted view.

The affected audience may be anyone who loads and re-saves views multiple times, and runs scheduled reports on those views.

This update contains a fix to prevent view corruption specifically related to loading and re-saving views, without other column modification. The fix applies only to new views created.


SP Workitem 50470 / APAR IV58804

When viewing charts for analysis reports in a locale that uses a period as the thousand separator, the chart may be generated incorrectly when displaying event counts in the thousands.

The affected audience is anyone using a locale with a period thousand separator, and using analysis view reports with charts.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly generate analysis report charts in locales that use a period as the thousand separator.


SP Workitem 53173 / APAR IV58799

When applying an XPU and attempting to view the release notes from the Console, instead of seeing the release notes you may see an error:

Failed to download file <ReadmePath>,Error: An unexpected exception was caught. [ID=0xc742003f]

The affected audience are users who use the View Release Notes button in the Console to view release notes when applying XPUs.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly download release notes again.


SP Workitem 48959

When applying multiple sequential XPUs to an Agent Manager or an Event Collector, the Sensor Controller service may encounter problems and stop working while attempting to send the XPU files if a previous update is still applying.

The affected audience are users who try to apply several Agent Manager or Event Collector XPUs in a row.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly handle errors encountered while attempting to send multiple XPU files to the component.


SP Workitem 52256

When starting the Sensor Controller service, it may be possible for it to stop again if parts of it do not finish initializing before it attempts to perform other actions.

The affected audience may be anyone encountering Sensor Controller stops soon after startup.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly handle cases where the Sensor Controller is not fully initialized during startup.


SP Workitem 51598

When downloading XPU files, if multiple XPU requests for the same file are performed at the same time, it may be possible for the download to fail.

The affected audience may be anyone downloading XPUs using the X-Press Update Server.

This update allows SiteProtector to better handle verification of XPUs when multiple requests of the same file are being made.


SP Workitem 50323

It may be possible for SiteProtector to process an XGS policy under the incorrect version (for example a firmware 5.1 policy versus a firmware 5.1.2 policy).

The affected audience may be anyone encountering errors editing XGS policies.

This update allows SiteProtector to select the correct XGS policy version for editing policies.
