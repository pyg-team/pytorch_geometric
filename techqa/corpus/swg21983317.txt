 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
On AIX 7.1 Technology Level 4 (TL4), when you start the IBM Domino Server using the following command, the following error might appear: 

On the command line, start IBM Domino 9.0.1 by entering this command:
> /opt/ibm/domino/bin/server 

Result:

:
The -Xlp option above requests the JVM to allocate the Java object heap and JIT code cache memory with large pages. This error means that the specified option is not supported by the current hardware or operating system configuration. As a result, the JVM ends.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Configure the system to use large pages by completing the steps in this procedure: 

 http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.performance/sys_config_large_pages.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.performance/sys_config_large_pages.htm]

On the command line, enter the vmo command. For example, enter
vmo -r -o lgpg_regions=64 -o lgpg_size=16777216 

Note: If the vmo command fails with the following errors, go to step 2.

Tunable lgpg_size is not supported on this hardware architecture
Tunable lgpg_regions is not supported on this hardware architecture

2. Consult an AIX Administrator to adjust your hardware or operating system configuration to support this option.

Warning! The following is a guideline only. Consult an AIX Administrator to perform these tasks. These tasks configure the system to have dedicated memory, and to enable large pages (vmo command)
