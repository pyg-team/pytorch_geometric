APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the z/OS Comm Server TCPIP Resolverneeds to use its MVS
   local host data sets for name or IP address resolution it will
   dynamically allocate them if data sets are allocated by JCL DD
   statements.
    This can lead to JES spool output problems for long running
   applications. The JES spool will contain numerous allocation
   messages similar to the following.
   .
   IEF237I 04FE ALLOCATED TO SYS00xxx
   IEF285I   yyyyy.HOSTS.SITEINFO                         KEPT
   IEF285I   VOL SER NOS= CPDLB0.
   IEF237I 04FE ALLOCATED TO SYS00xxx
   IEF285I   yyyyy.HOSTS.ADDRINFO                         KEPT
   IEF285I   VOL SER NOS= CPDLB0.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the IBM Communications Server   *
   *                 for z/OS Version 1 Releases 4, 5, and 6 IP:  *
   *                 Resolver                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Resolver's dynamic allocations of local *
   *                      host files causes JES spool to fill up  *
   *                      with IEF237I and IEF285I messages       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Each time Netview issues a ping, the resolver is called with a
   new OMVS PID.  Thus, the resolver has to re-initialize its
   processing environment all over again.  Hence, no cache records
   can be used and local host datasets need to be re-allocated.
   Therefore, with each ping the following set of messages are sent
   to the JES spool:
        IEF237I 04FE ALLOCATED TO SYS00xxx
        IEF285I   yyyyy.HOSTS.SITEINFO                         KEPT
        IEF285I   VOL SER NOS= CPDLB0.
        IEF237I 04FE ALLOCATED TO SYS00xxx
        IEF285I   yyyyy.HOSTS.ADDRINFO                         KEPT
        IEF285I   VOL SER NOS= CPDLB0.
   This eventually causes JES spool output problems.  These
   dynamic allocations happen even if the datasets are
   pre-allocated via DD statements in the JCL.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This problem has been rectified via an operational circumvention
   and the APAR will close without a PTF, as agreed with the
   submittor.  The customer suppressed the dynamic allocation
   messages by specifying MSGLEVEL=(1,0) in the JCL.
   
   Requirement MR0708044837 has been submitted to address the issue
   with dynamic allocations of local host datasets that are
   pre-allocated via DD statements in the JCL.
