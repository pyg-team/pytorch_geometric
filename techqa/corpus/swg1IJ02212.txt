APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At seasonality event in Event Analytics, I did as follows.
   Step 1. Selected shown evnet in event table.
    Step 2. Selected "Show event pn history" from right click menu.
   But
   history event was not shown.  No error was shown on screen, but
   "no
   shown targets" was shown.
   
   Note: When Impact patch version was FP06, Syntax Error had
   occurred.
         So Customer applied FP10 on 2017 Jul.
         However Customer applied FP10 to solve Syntax Error, but
   Customer
         suspects that the above issue occurs by different reason.
         In FP10, Syntax Error does not occur, but Customer seems
   like
         '\N' string is handled as CR code in SQL.
   
   
   \n will be included as string in the event. Therefore, I believe
    that
   the correct operation is \n will be recognized as a string and
   if we
   process   àÂ View Historical Events àÊ  from the right click
   menu of
   Seasonal Event Analysis, the historical events will be
   displayed.
