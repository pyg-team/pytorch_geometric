APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have generated a CRT tree with the Decision Trees procedure
   (TREE command) in SPSS Statistics. You requested that node
   numbers and predicted values be saved, using the Save dialog or
   /SAVE subcommand. You also requested that SPSS syntax rules for
   assigning to terminal nodes be printed in the output. You copied
   these rules to a syntax window and ran the commands for the same
   data set that produced the tree. However, the counts in the tree
   diagram and saved node numbers  were very discrepant from the
   counts in the nodes assigned by the rules syntax.
   are the tree diagram and /save results in error or the scoring
   rules or both?
   This problem was observed in one dataset and referred to
   Development as a defect for investigation.
