Title: IBM Tivoli Directory Server support for NIST SP 800-131A - United States

Text:
support for NIST SP 800-131A; Suite B mode; support for the TLS 1.2 protocol PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

ABSTRACT
 This tech note describes the configuration that is required in IBM Tivoli Directory Server V6.3.0.17 (and later fix levels) for the transition to NIST SP 800-131A. 

CONTENT
Overview 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-131A guidelines provide cryptographic key management guidance. These guidelines include: 

 * Key management procedures. 
 * How to use cryptographic algorithms. 
 * Algorithms to use and their minimum strengths. 
 * Key lengths for secure communications.


Suite B mode is a restrictive subset of the SP 800-131A specification. Suite B defines the cryptographic algorithm policies to use with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for national security applications. 

Government agencies and financial institutions use the NIST SP 800-131A guidelines to ensure that the products conform to specified security requirements. 

Support for the transition to NIST SP 800-131A 
For the transition to NIST SP 800-131A guidelines, IBM Tivoli Directory Server V6.3.0.17 (and later fix levels including the latest recommended fix level) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27009778#ver63] supports:  * The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 protocol. 
 * Disabling protocols other than TLS 1.2. 
 * Public keys with the following key strengths:  * The RSA keys with a minimum size of 2048 bits. 
    * The elliptic curve (EC) keys with a minimum size of 160-bits or curve p160.
   
   
 * Certificates with the RSA keys 2048-bits or higher or with the EC keys 160-bits or curve p160 or higher. 
 * Digital signatures with a minimum of SHA2 encryption algorithm. 
 * Setting the TLS 1.2 signature and hash algorithm restrictions. 
 * Suite B mode.
