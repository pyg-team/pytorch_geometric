Title: IBM Database Connection Problems Upgrading to Worklight Studio 5.0.6 - United States

Text:
IMF50 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There are no scripts to upgrade the database schema after a Worklight Studio upgrade. If there is a change in the database schema between one Worklight Studio version and another version, you encounter problems working with your updated Worklight project on the old database schema. 

SYMPTOM
Within Worklight Studio, errors are seen that are related to the Javaâ„¢ Persistence API (JPA) or connecting to the database, depending on the database vendor.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If your project works with HSQL you need to delete the WorklightServerHome folder in your workspace to clean the HSQL schema. If your project works with other database vendors (DB2, Oracle or MYSQL), you need to delete all tables from the Worklight database. When you use Worklight Studio, if those tables do not exist, they are recreated first time the embedded Worklight Server starts.
