PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to install the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.2 Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting. You are running the install script in the ZERO_HOME directory when you receive messages CWPZI8951, CWPZI8965, and CWPZO8974 with RC 610 (RC=610). You are following the steps in the CICS information center under "Installing the feature pack". 

SYMPTOM
Here are the detailed messages that you are receiving:

CWPZI8951E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.smash.doc/messages/CWPZI8951E.html]: An exception is caught, java.io.IOException: EDC5124I Too many open files 
CWPZI8965E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.smash.doc/messages/CWPZI8965E.html]: The update failed. RC:610. 
CWPZO8974E: update or install of zero natives failed, RC: 610. initializing the zero.cics.cli.failed.


CAUSE
According to the error messages, an IO exception happened when Dynamic Scripting v1.1 copied files into the z/OS UNIX System Services directories during installation. The return code of 610 (RC610) indicates "Failed to copy files". 

The failure is occurring because there are two system-wide and processing-level limits that contain values that are too low. The two limits are MAXFILEPROC and MAXMMAPAREA. 

MAXFILEPROC [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.bpxb200/mxflprc.htm?]is used to set the maximum number of file descriptors that a single process can have open concurrently, such as all open files, directories, sockets, and pipes. 

MAXMMAPAREA [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.bpxb200/maxmm.htm#maxmm]specifies the maximum number of data space pages that can be allocated for memory mapping of z/OS UNIX files. Storage is not allocated until memory mappings are active.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the current values for MAXFILEPROC and MAXMMAPAREA are set too low, you can use the MVS system command SETOMVS [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.ieag100/setom.htm#setom] to increase the values. These options are originally set in [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.ieae200/iea2e2c159.htm#wq237]the by the SYS1.PARMLIB member BPXPRMxx during initial program load (IPL).

In order to view the current limit values for MAXFILEPROC and MAXMMAPAREA on your systems enter the following command from the console: 

/d omvs,options
