APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A map that has a call to an Oracle Stored Procedure may have
   errors such as the following:
   
     The Move input or output object
   null[1]/SCHEMAX/TABLENAME/COLUMNNAME could not be found.
   
   When the map is opened in the Mapping Editor, connections for
   the Stored Procedure do no connect to their original source.
   The error occurs for a connection that comes from a
   SYS_REFCURSOR.  The SYS_REFCURSOR is an OUT parameter of the
   Stored Procedure.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Graphical Data Mapper V1.0 running maps that
   call to an Oracle stored procedure which returns a
   SYS_REFCURSOR.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a Graphical Data Map calls an Oracle stored procedure and
   that procedure returns a SYS_RECURSOR, transformations may be
   connected to the contents of the SYS_REFCURSOR.  Those
   connections were not stored correctly in the .map file. As a
   result the mappings are not restored when the map is reopened
   and an invalid connection error may be reported for them.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The  Graphical Data Map editor is corrected to ensure that the
   mappings with connections from SYS_REFCURSOR are stored
   correctly in the .map file.
