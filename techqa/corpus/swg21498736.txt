PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)

SYMPTOM
When logging into the Jazz Repository, 'Remember my password' is selected and the password is shown as encrypted.

The saved passwords are found under Preferences -> General -> Security -> Secure Storage and will be shown in plain text.

CAUSE
The encryption is set to false, therefore passwords will not be encrypted in the Secure Storage Area. 

 

This behavior was documented on jazz.net in Task 112627: PasswordUtil needs to encrypt password. [https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz%20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=112627]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, upgrade the eclipse client to Rational Team Concert 3.0 iFix 1 [https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/releases/3.0iFix1] or later.
