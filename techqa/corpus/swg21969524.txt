PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to use Eclipse Internal Browser to perform Administrative Console tasks using IBM Rational Application Developer 9.x may not work when on Windows platform with Internet Explorer 11+ 

CAUSE
The reason for this issue is that Internet Explorer 11 and newer versions have changed the way in which older web pages are displayed and that does not work with WebSphere Application Server Administrator Console. For more information, refer to Microsoft Page
Browser Emulation [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation]

ENVIRONMENT
Eclipse Internal Browser in Rational Application Developer
Microsoft Windows Platform
Internet Explorer 11 and newer 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you use Internet Explorer 11 and newer version outside Rational Application Developer (RAD) or Eclipse environment, as in External Browser, the issue can be resolved by adding the address of WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Administrator Console to the list of trusted web pages in Internet Explorer Security Setting.

This external browser problem should also be resolved with the latest WebSphere Application Server (WAS) server updates as per this APAR:
PI13887: SEVERAL CONSOLE PANELS DO NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 11 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI13887]
, if using an external IE 11 or newer version. If this does not help, engage IBM Support for WAS.




 
If you are using Rational Application Developer or other Eclipse Environment Internal Browser, the problem can be resolved by adding the following line in the
eclipse.ini file right after the line which contains "-vmargs":
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.IEVersion=9999 
This will use IE 9 standards mode,as explained in:
Microsoft (MSFT) Page: Internet Feature Controls (B..C) - Browser E [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation]mulation

If this does not help when using RAD, engage IBM Support for RAD.

Other Information: 

RAD v8x/9x uses IE as the Internal Browser on Windows 7.
When in doubt, a good way to check is to open up the browser window in RAD and enter this url
