QUESTION
 Can we have same name for the package when both are saved into the same Content store. 

ANSWER
The model files are never stored in the content store. When we publish the package from that Model at that time the package and it's related metadata is stored in the Content Store. 

While publishing a package we need to specify the location where the package is placed and where it can be viewed in Cognos Connection. We cannot have the same package name at one location in Cognos connection. We can publish the package with the existing package name in a different folder or location in Cognos connection.

For example :- Lets consider that you want to publish a package 'Go Sales (query)'. Assuming that this package is already existing at Path "Public Folders > Samples > Models". Now if you try to publish the package having name as 'Go Sales (query)' at path "Public Folders > Samples > Models" it will not allow you to publish the package and return with message saying that it already exist. However if you try to publish the package having name as 'Go Sales (query)' at path "Public Folders > Samples" it will allow you to publish the package. In other words you can publish the package having same name but at different Path/location in Cognos connection
