QUESTION
 This technical note includes processes and notes on how to configure Active Directory and LDAP Authentication for QRadar 7.2.4 and earlier or QRadar 7.2.5 'local' LDAP configurations. 

CAUSE
QRadar provides authentication options for both local and external authentication methods, such as Active Directory or LDAP. To decipher how the authentication works, the following document will provide some answers to how local LDAP authentication works.

WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT FACTS I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT QRADAR LDAP AUTHENTICATION?


When QRadar authentication method is changed from local to external by choosing either Active Directory or LDAP, the following changes occur within QRadar: 

 1. When creating an user with Admin Role, the local QRadar password must be set. This requirement is for users with Administrative rights within QRadar: The remote authority is checked first for the username/password. If the remote authority is not available, the local password is then checked to allow the administrator access to QRadar and perform their functions. The password requirement is only for users with Administrative rights and not for regular QRadar users.
    
    
 2. When creating a user with a non-admin role, the password is not filled in and is left blank. Regular QRadar users will only authenticate their username/password to the remote authority. If the remote authority is not available and/or the username/password pair is rejected (bad password or user related account issues), the user will not be allowed to login to the host.
    
    
 3. The QRadar Administrative roles have both the external and local authentication methods available in case the external authentication method fails. If the remote authentication fails, the Administrative users can login using the local password.
    
    
 4. Only Administrative roles have the password stored locally that is not sync'ed with the remote password. Thus, Admin users must remember to update their QRadar password when updating the remote authentication password. Otherwise, not having a unified password could present problems logging into QRadar in the event the remote authentication source has failed.
    
    
 5. When an External Authentication method is configured within QRadar, this will enable the primary authentication method for remote authentication provided there is not a catastrophic failure within the plugin. This fallback is only for the Administrative users within QRadar.
    
    
 6. The default Admin user role cannot be modified in the QRadar User Interface. By default, the administrative user has access to all screens and options in QRadar.
