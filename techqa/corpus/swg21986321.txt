QUESTION
 How do I preserve confidential access control during AtlasExtensions Matter Loader ? 

CAUSE
Matters are always imported with the confidential access option set to "No"

For Matters imported using the Atlas Extensions, you can set the "CONFIDENTIAL" column to "Y" when you select from the atlas_matter or the source table in the MatterDBPullerAgent.xml file found in /Atlas/Properties/defaultimpl/db folder.

A restart of the Atlas application server is required after you make the change
