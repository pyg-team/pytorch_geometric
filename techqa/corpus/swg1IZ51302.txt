APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a failover pair, if a table to be replicated has WITH
   NORESYNC set, then the failover gateway when it is restarted
   will send an insert rather than an update when the first update
   is made to the Primary ObjectServer.This may cause the error
   "Attempt to insert duplicate row" to be reported by the Backup
   ObjectServer, in which case the update won't be applied.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of ObjectServers that are configured as a failover pair
   and have the 'WITH NO RESYNC' option set on one or more
   replication entries.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In a ObjectServer failover pair, if a table to be replicated
   had WITH NORESYNC set in the table replication definition file,
   the error "Attempt to insert duplicate row" could be reported
   by the backup ObjectServer when the failover gateway was
   restarted. This error occurred because the first update to a row
   in the affected table on the primary ObjectServer was sent by
   the gateway as a new insert to the backup ObjectServer.
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   Upgrade to one of the listed maintenance packages as appropriate
   for the version of OMNIbus you have installed.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
