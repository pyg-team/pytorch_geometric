 * After IBM Process Center is successfully upgraded, update your process applications to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels so you can integrate the latest improvements and defect fixes associated with the toolkit objects. After you update to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels, you might notice small behavior changes in your process application, such as to the user interfaces, which you might need to modify.
   
 * Installing cumulative fixes can modify the existing system toolkits for the associated version. If your applications are associated with the latest system toolkits, they will automatically include the changes.
