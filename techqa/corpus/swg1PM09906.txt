APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If there are portlets in the Portlet Palette for which a user
   does not have access a message like this will be logged to
   SystemOut.log
   QueryPortletC E com.ibm.wps.command.portlets
   .QueryPortletCommand
   AbstractCommand.throwMissingAccessRightsException EJPPD0002E:
   User uid=<id>,... is not authorized to execute the command
   QueryPortlet.
   
   The message is actually a warning and does not indicate an
   error if the portlets are indeed visible to users who should
   see them. This APAR is to suppress the message.
