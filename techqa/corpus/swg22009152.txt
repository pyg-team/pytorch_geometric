Title: IBM SKLM and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Compliancy - United States

Text:
SKLM FIPS compliant level 3 ISKLM TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What verisons of SKLM are FIPS 140-2 Level3 compliant 

ANSWER
None , because IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager itself does not provide cryptographic capabilities and therefore does not require or obtain, FIPS 140-2 certification. However, IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager takes advantage of the cryptographic capabilities of the IBM JVM in the IBM Java Cryptographic Extension component. The capabilities allow the selection and use of the IBMJCEFIPS cryptographic provider, which has a FIPS 140-2 level 1 certification.
