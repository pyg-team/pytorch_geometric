Installing the application  * If you use Windows 7, enable Virtualization Technology (VT-X) in the BIOS of your computer. 
 * If you use an older toolbox-based version of Docker, uninstall it before you install the Trial application. 
 * If you have other containers that run on your laptop, stop them before you start the installation process of the Trial application, as your laptop might have resource constraints. 
 * The Trial application pulls a Docker container during the installation process. The installation takes about 5 to 10 minutes on a standard network speed of about 15-20 Mbps. A typical corporate VPN is likely to limit the download speed. Consider it while you wait for the installation to finish.
