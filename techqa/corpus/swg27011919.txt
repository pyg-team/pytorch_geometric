ABSTRACT
 This document contains the system requirements for WebSphere MQ V7.0 on z/OS. 

CONTENT
 

Please read first [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * For software requirements, the Program Directory shipped with the product contains the latest level of information, particularly concerning APAR or PTF levels of supported products. 
 * z/OS includes appropriate levels of Language Environment, TCP/IP, VTAM, SMP/E, TSO/E, JES, C/C++, DFSMS / DFP, Security Server, High Level Assembler, ISPF, and ICSS. 
 * The product versions listed here represent the minimum level of that product that is supported, unless otherwise stated. 
 * For installation, the only requirement is the level of operating system listed below, which will include the pre-requisite level of SMP/E. 
 * Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself. 

Hardware requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * Any IBM OS/390 or zSeries 900 processor capable of running the required level of a compatible operating system with enough storage to meet the combined requirements of the programming prerequisites, WebSphere MQ for z/OS, the access methods, and the application programs.

Operating Systems [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * z/OS V1.8 or later [see section note 1]


Notes:  1. WebSphere MQ V7.0 has a hard pre-requisite on z/OS V1.8, so prior versions of z/OS are not supported.

For C/C++ applications [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * Any C/C++ compiler that generates calls to WebSphere MQ using the standard linkage convention [see section note 1]


Notes:  1. To take advantage of the new Version 7 functionality from a C application, you must use a compiler that supports the long long integer type.

For PL/I applications [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * Any PL/I compiler that generates calls to WebSphere MQ using the standard linkage convention

For COBOL applications [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1]  * Any COBOL compiler that generates calls to WebSphere MQ using the standard linkage convention

For Javaâ„¢ applications using the WebSphere MQ classes for Java or JMS [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27011919&amp;aid=1] 31-bit: [see section note 1]  * IBM SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.4.2 
 * IBM SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0 
 * IBM SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 6.0 
 * IBM Runtime Environment, Java Technology Edition 7.0 and future fix packs. 


Notes:  1. ASF adapter is supported on the following 64-Bit JREs, when it is loaded into WAS:  * IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.4.2 
     * IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0
