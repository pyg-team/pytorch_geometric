APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a user has opened up an IBM Case Manager client page with a
   Form widget configured, and the Form widget is displaying an IBM
   Form, while the IBM Form is still displayed the user logs out of
   IBM Case Manager client, an extra popup logon box will be
   displayed by the browser upon logout.
   
   Steps to reproduce
   1) Login to IBM Case Manager client to a solution that will
   display an IBM Form
   2) Open the page that displays the Form widget with the IBM Form
   (e.g. Case Details, Work Details, etc)
   3) While the IBM Form is displayed, click on user > logout from
   the ICN toolbar
   4) The logout action will bring the user back to the ICN logon
   page, but there will be an extra authentication dialog that will
   popup for the user.
   
   This is an UI annoyance and does not affect functionality.  The
   user should just ignore the extra popup and close it.
