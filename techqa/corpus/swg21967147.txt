QUESTION
 Is using other monitoring agents like Dynatrace, SiteMinder and CA Wiley supported with ITCAM for AD/J2EE? 

ANSWER
No sorry if you're using more then one monitoring tool like CA's SiteMinder Agent or BMW Wiley or AppDynamics or Dynatrace, this won't work with ITCAM for AD or ITCAM for J2EE on the same JVM or server. 

This is not supported, and while it will work in some cases, you might need to do some manual adjustments to get it to work. Sorry, we don't support using ITCAM with other monitoring tools as they tend to lead to classloader and other conflicting issues. At this time, this is not a supported and recommended configuration. 

Also, please see this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699264] which indicates ITM itself is not supported with SiteMinder agent.
