APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The member EZAPPCSI is used as placeholder for a static copy
   of IGGCSI00 in both FTP and NPF. PTF's UQ56499 & UQ56753 each
   ship EZAPPCSI for their respective products. This has caused
   application problems because they both have to be applied at
   the same time. We need 2 new PTF that supersede the original
   and coreq each other to avoid the problems and confusion in
   applying the original PTF's.

   PTF's UQ56499 & UQ56753 each ship EZAPPCSI. If the NPF function
   is installed or PTF UQ56753 is applied after UQ56499, then the
   function will steal the ownership of the part from FTP. The next
   time FTP is compiled EZAPPCSI will not be linked in. Although,
   this will cause an error, it is not always noticed. If UQ56499
   is applied after UQ57753 then, because the part is not owned by
   FTP, it will not be linked in, and the resulting error may be
   missed. The first symptom may be when FTP ABENDS because
   IGGCSI00 did not get linked in correctly.
