QUESTION
 In an effort to provide you with the most current service technology, IBM Assist On-site (AOS) replaced RSV-XCEL as the tool used by support for live remote screen viewing. AOS is a secure web based application that provides you with the same functions as RSV-XCEL. You would like to know, how does AOS work and can you use AOS? 

ANSWER
Refer to IBM Assist On-site [http://www.ibm.com/support/assistonsite/] for an overview, general information, and FAQs about AOS. 

Note that RSV-XCEL required a leased line for access. AOS does not have this requirement, so you might be able to remove the leased line if only used for this service.

Feel free to contact Mark Fyffe [fyffe@us.ibm.com?subject=RSV-XCEL%20replacement], US Program Manager - SoftwareXcel, if you have any questions.
