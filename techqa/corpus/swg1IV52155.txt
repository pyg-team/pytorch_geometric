ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TSAM 7.2.3 + NetApp Storage Extension - cannot create
   filesystem greater than 1024 GB
   .
   RECREATION
   ===========
   Logon to TSAM SSUI
   Storage Management > Create Storage Project
   ProjectName = Test001
   Team = <default>
   Duration = <default>
   Click Next
   Click Add Storage
   Export = export001
   Storage Type = NETAPP
   Storage Pool = <default>
   Number = 1
   Size = 1025 GB
   ERROR - CTJZE1003E
   .
   The size of a file system must be a number greater
   than 1 GB and lower than the storage pool maximum.
   In any case, you cannot decrease the size of
   provisioned file systems.
   .
   Why is there a 1024 GB / 1 TB limit on the create
   storage file system option? This limits the size
   of the storage project which cannot exploit the
   volume size that has been configured.
