QUESTION
 Is Microsoft Active Directory supported in an IBM Smart Analytics System for AIX? 

ANSWER
At this time we have not formally tested the use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Microsoft Active Directory for users/groups in an IBM Smart Analytics System environment but that does not mean it is not supported. It does mean that there is work involved to set it up and test it before implementing in a production environment.

Here are some important details that the customer should consider when looking to implement LDAP: 

 1. The preferred model during our discussions at this time is to setup the operating system to use both local files and LDAP in a hybrid approach. Defining the operating system (OS) to use LDAP and then having other components benefit from the OS doing the LDAP authentication is sometimes called 'transparent LDAP'. The users and groups that are shipped with the IBM Smart Analytics Systems remain managed by the OS, while the customer-added users and groups are managed via LDAP. 
 2. The most common user/group combination is going to be for access to the core database. This means setting up the core instance so that DB2 can use LDAP authentication via the operating system. However it is recommended to have the pre-configured database users, instance owner, instance group, fenced owner, fenced group defined in the local OS registry versus the LDAP registry.
    
    The DB2 Information Center provides instructions on how to setup DB2 so that it will work when the underlying OS is setup for LDAP authentication. 
 3. The Application Server module, if they have one, has one user, <dweadmin>/<dweagrp> that accesses the core database for Infosphere Warehouse (ISW) metadata information and also authenticates with Websphere Application Server (WAS) for access to ISW Administration Console. ISW has some limited instructions on how to setup LDAP for use with the Application server, these instructions rely on setting up WAS to go directly against LDAP versus the local OS.
    
    In practice, we have managed to set up WAS on IBM Smart Analytics Linux systems to access LDAP via the OS authentication by copying the DB2 PAM configuration file to a new file that WAS uses to access PAM, which then uses the OS and LDAP. This allows the hybrid approach where the users and groups shipped with the IBM Smart Analytics System are managed locally, while customer-added users and groups are managed via LDAP. 
 4. For customers still using Performance Expert (PE), they will need to follow the DB2 Information Center instructions to make the PE DB2 instance running on the management node work with LDAP via the OS.
    
    Most Smart Analytics PE deployments use the PE user only to access the PE Performance database, and use the instance owner to capture data from the core database. In the hybrid LDAP/local OS model, it is still recommended to maintain the PE user/PE group, PE fenced user and PE fenced group locally defined. Additional users can be defined in LDAP. 
 5. For customers who upgrade to Optim Performance Manager (OPM), they will need to check the version of OPM, V4 or V5, and some work will be required to see how OPM works with LDAP. OPM still includes a PE server and DB2 database, but it also includes an application server uses a local internal user registry. According to the OPM 5.1 Information Center, enabling the local DB2 instance for LDAP is all that is required and it supports the transparent LDAP approach. 
 6. IBM Director supports LDAP authentication directly but does not indicate whether it supports transparent LDAP. 
 7. Customers need to consider the following design points:
    - LDAP tuning
    - LDAP in a High Availability environment
