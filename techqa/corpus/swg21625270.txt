 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you enable the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY database table to gather additional information about task execution? 

ANSWER
By default, the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY is disabled so the LSW_EM_TASK_HISTORY table is empty. This table collects additional information that is useful in determining why scheduled tasks do not fire or fail. Complete the following steps to enable this table: 

 1. Locate the 80EventManager.xml file.
    
    
 2. Uncomment the <task-execution-listener> line, which is typically near the bottom of the file.
    
    
 3. Restart the server.
