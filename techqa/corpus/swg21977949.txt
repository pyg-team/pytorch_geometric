Title: IBM Explanation of Security Action graph - United States

Text:
ISAM Appliance TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 There is a "Security Action" graph widget on Appliance Home tab. However, there is no explanation of this. What does this graph means ? What are filtering checkboxes ? 

ANSWER
The vertical bar of graph means number of PAM events instead of number of HTTP requests. Capturing PAM events is enabled after configuring Web Content Protection.
Also, some of PAM events increases multiple points because these reissues sub events internally with more complete information.
Example: two points against one HTTP_URL_repeatable_char event.

The PAM events are stored in internal database. But, digest of events are logged in pam.log.

The detail of each filter checkboxes are as follows.
- Drop checkbox
Counts of blocked events that stopped a request reaching a resource.
This hit events defined as "block" in Web Content Protection

- Block checkbox
Counts of Quarantine events.
The Quarantine events are the same as block, but the quarantine period
dictates that only one event is logged to the log after the period ends
(to the graph too). (Hitting the page 100 times in 60 seconds, only
logs the event once as to not overload the log).
This hit events defined as "quarantine" in Web Content Protection

- Ignore checkbox
Count of other events such as action="No Action" or "Ignore".
Ignore events allow the resource to be accessed, ignore the PAM issue,
but log on the ignore graph only.

- Audit checkbox
Unfortunately, we could not get enough information. This filters audit
type events in PAM database. But, this type of events seems not to be
used on ISAM.
