 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to use the Text Import Wizard to import a text file (.txt) into SPSS/PASW Statistics and I am receiving the message "variable name does not match the conventions for SPSS variable names."

Error. Command name: GET DATA
(2278) A variable name does not conform to the rules for variable names. 1
Execution of this command stops. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following rules apply to variable names:

Variable names can't start with digits. 
Each variable name must be unique; duplication is not allowed.
Variable names can be up to 64 bytes long, and the first character must be a letter or one of the characters @, #, or $.

For more information on the rules that apply to variable names, open PASW Statistics.
Use the Help -> Topics menu to search for variable names.

Check the the variable names in the wizard after starting with the template. Edit the variable name in the wizard, save a new template, and go from there
