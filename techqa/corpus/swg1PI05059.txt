APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Fail to login to an application with exception:]
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j:
   PKIX path building failed:
   java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find
   valid certification path to requested target.
   
   The application relies on the fact that the Liberty profile
   server sets a SSLContext created with the default SSL
   configuration as the process's default.  When running in just
   a Liberty Profile server all is okay.  When they run in a
   collective a cert path error is hit.  This happens because the
   default SSL Configuration is being used when the app make it's
   httpsURLConnection call.

   ****************************************************************
   This problem was caused because the code setting the
   SSLSocketFactory for the entire JVM which resulted in
   failure to login to an application with the following
   exception:
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j:
   PKIX path building failed:
   java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find
   valid certification path to requested target.
   This can also be caused by application code doing the same
   thing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We now have instance base setting of the SSL Socket factory on
   the JMXConnector.
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.2. Please refer to the Recommended Updates
