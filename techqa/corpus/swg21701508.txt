 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Changing IBM Systems Director user's password fails to change or the account gets locked 

SYMPTOM
You ran the "miauth" command to change the password for System Console component user and it fails 

Example:


 * $ miauth -pw -p os -u dirinst1
 * 
 * 
 * The password change was successful for the user 'dirinst1' on resource 'server25'.
 * 
 * Changing the password for user 'dirinst1' on resource 'server7'.
 * 
 * The password change was successful for the user 'dirinst1' on resource 'server7'.
 * 
 * Changing the password for user 'dirinst1' on resource 'server5'.
 * 
 * The password change was successful for the user 'dirinst1' on resource 'server5'.
 * 
 * Updating the password in the database for user dirinst1.
 * 
 * The password was successfully updated in the database.
 * 
 * Notifying Systems Director of a password change for user dirinst1.
 * 
 * Unable to start the director server
 * 
 * Password change notification to Systems Director failed for nodes 172.23.1.1.
 * 
 * The script was executed with following status:
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * SCHEMA::CHPW::LOGICAL_NAME::STATUS(PASS/FAIL)::DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * CHPW::server13::FAIL::notify_director_server Password change failed for resource(s) server13.
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Cannot change the password for the user .


CAUSE
Possible cause: 

 

 * Director may not be started 
 * Password security or encryption not permitting the change


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1) Login to the Management node primary 

2) Verify IBM Director is "Active" 

 * 
 * # smstatus 
 * 
   This command should return "Active" indicating that Director is active (running), a message such as "Inactive" or any other message will not permit a successful password change


2.1 If Director is not active, start it issuing command "smstart"  * 
 * 
 * 


Changing the password of the System Component user  * 
 * 
 * 
 * /etc/security/login.cfg
 * 
 * pwd_algorithm
 * 
 * 
 * 2) Change the user's password 
 *  
 *  
   # miauth -pw -p os -u <username>  
   
   Note: The above command will change the user's password on all the nodes/servers
   
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * /etc/security/login.cfg
 * 
 * pwd_algorithm
 * 
 *  
 * 4) Verify the password is sync across all nodes 
 *  
 *  
   # validate_passwords -a -l 
 * 
 * The above command should should a report as the following 
 *  
 *  $ validate_passwords -a -l
