WebSphere Transformation Extender hypervisor SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Bash and GNU C Library vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock”, a heap-based buffer overflow, and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash and glibc are included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux which is shipped with WebSphere Transformation Extender with Launcher Hypervisor Edition. WebSphere Transformation Extender is not directly affected by any of these reported vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6271 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271]
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error when evaluating specially-crafted environment variables passed to it by the bash functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 10.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96153] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277]
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6278 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278] 
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to the parsing of user scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7169 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169]
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-5119 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5119]
DESCRIPTION: The GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by an off-by-one error in the __gconv_translit_find() function. By setting the CHARSET environment variable to a malicious value, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 7.2

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7186 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7186] 
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 10

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7187 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7187] 
DESCRIPTION: GNU Bash could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an off-by-one-error when handling deeply nested flow control constructs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 10
