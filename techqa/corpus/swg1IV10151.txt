ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The issue is that the BIRT reports have to be Dynamic Text in
   HTML
   format to display the rich text correctly, but this forces plain
   text
   to be rendered incorrectly. Changing this setting to Auto
   doesn't work
   because BIRT will always choose plain text unless the text
   starts with
   <html> and the long description in rich text format just starts
   with a
   <p> tag. In order to fix it, we had to duplicate the long
   description
   field on the report and modify visibility to hide the plain text
   form
   of the long description if it started with a <p> tag and hide
   the the
   visibility of the rich text form of the long description if it
   didn't
   start with a <p> tag. This works, but obviously is extremely
   time
   consuming given the sheer amount of reports.
