Title: IBM Addendum: Oracle pre-requisite patches for 11g R2 with WebSphere Lombardi Edition - United States

Text:
Teamworks Lombardi Oracle 11.2.0.2 opatch 11gR2 9278351 9294110 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What Oracle version should I be on if I want to run WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE)? 

ANSWER
Depending on the host OS of the Oracle database, the instructions in the Install and Config Guides state the following: 

 * 
 * Oracle Enterprise 11g Release 2 requires the July 2010 Critical
 * 
 * Patch as documented in 
 * Support Note 
 * 1114533.1.
 * 

May not be sufficient. The version of Oracle (obtained by the "opatch" command) should state 11.2.0.2.xxx 

Specifically, the 11.2.0.2 release is known to contain patches for Oracle bugs:  * 9294110 
 * 9278351


The key requirement is that you should be on Oracle 11.2.0.2 (not 11.2.0.1.xxx).
