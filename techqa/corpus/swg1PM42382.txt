ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Portals Server V7.0 support.  See defect 211853.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The support for WPS7.0 was supposed to be in FP1, but there were
   some issues. I sent the customer 8 xml files needed for the
   agent to be configured on WPS7.0 from defect 211853.
   
   Put the following 5 files in DC_HOME/itcamdc/etc/cfg
   
   cfg_aix_wps_7.xml
   cfg_hp-ux_wps_7.xml
   cfg_linux_wps_7.xml
   cfg_sunos_wps_7.xml
   cfg_windows_wps_7.xml
   
   Next, have the customer create a directory called 'wps7' in
   
   DC_HOME/itcamdc/etc/was
   
   Put the following files in the newly created wps7 directory
   
   reqaggr_config_wps7.xml
   toolkit_config_wps7.xml
   toolkit_wps7.properties
   
   **Note: The directory and file permissions need to be set
   correctly after moving the files as stated above.
