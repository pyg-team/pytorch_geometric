IE; IDM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Will Internet Explorer 10 and 11 be supported on IDM Web Services version 4.02 or 4.03? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
During the qualification of Internet Explorer10, a few issues were encounter due to Internet Explorer10 . After upgrading IE10 to IE11, those issues got resolved and hence IBM FileNet IDM Web Services is directly qualifying IE11 instead of IE10. 

The IE11 will be qualified with IDM 403/FP5 and IDM 402/FP15. And the tentative ETA for this will be end of May,2014.
