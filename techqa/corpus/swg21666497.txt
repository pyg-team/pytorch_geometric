QUESTION
 How do you remove the object server authentication from WebGUI? 

ANSWER
 

To properly remove the Object Server authentication source from WebGUI it must be removed from two locations in the ISC/WebSphere Admin Console. The "Federated repositories" menu and the "Manage repositories" menu both have an entry for the Object Server that must be fully removed. 

NOTE: Before attempting to re-run the "confvmm4ncos.sh" to update the Object Server authentication information/configuration both of the above entries need to be fully removed. 

Steps to Remove: 

Entries from the Global security > Federated repositories menu need to be removed first: 

1) Open the ISC console 

2) Expand Security and click on Global security 

3) Click the Configure... button 

4) Click the check box to the left of the ObjectServer Repository and click the Remove button 

5) Click the save link at the top of the screen 

Now Remove the "Manage repositories" entry 

6) Click the Manage repositories link on the bottom right 

7) Click the check box next to the Object Server entry and click the delete button 

8) Click the save link at the top of the page 

9) Restart TIP for the changes to take effect 

 

NOTE: Before running the "confvmm4ncos.sh" script make sure that there are not object server entries in either location.
