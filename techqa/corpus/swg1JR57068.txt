APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Process instances or tasks are not retrieved when you search by
   using Microsoft SQL Server as the IBM Business Process Manager
   (BPM) database and a JavaScript object of type TWSearch that
   specifies the date value or date values as a search parameter,
   even though the value or values match existing process instances
   or tasks.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you store time values in process variables that are marked as
   visible in IBM Process Portal, the time values include
   fractions of a second, you use Microsoft SQL Server as the IBM
   BPM database, and you run a search specifying an exact match
   filter with a time value that includes fractions of a second, an
   empty result might be returned.
   
   On Microsoft SQL Server, IBM BPM stores searchable variables of
   type "time" in columns of type DATETIME. During insertion, the
   value is rounded to increments of .000, .003, or .007 seconds.
   If the search value has fractions of a second that do not
   exactly match the rounded value, the comparison fails. As a
   result, corresponding process instances or tasks cannot be
   retrieved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be available in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that casts the search value to DATETIME before the comparison
   is done.
