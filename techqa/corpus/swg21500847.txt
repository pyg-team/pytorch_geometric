PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS pooled JVM fails to start and you receive message DFHSJ0900. Your program abends with abend code ASJJ (abendASJJ). This occurs when attempting to run a CICS Java program in a pooled JVM in CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.2. This could also occur during CICS startup or when you enter CEMT SET JVMPOOL START in an attempt to start JVMs in a JVM pool. 

SYMPTOM
You see this message in the MSGUSR when starting the Pooled JVM. 

DFHSJ0900 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsj/SJ0900.html] applid Illegal Java version. CICS requires Java version 6.0.1 but has found Java version x.x.x 

Where x.x.x is some version of Java other than 6.0.1.


CAUSE
Attempting to start a Pooled JVM using 64-bit Java V5 or V6 instead of the minimum supported level of Java which is V6.0.1.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS Java Technology Edition, Version 6.0.1 with CICS TS 4.2. You can download this from the main website for Java Version 6.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/tools/java/products/sdk601_64.html].
