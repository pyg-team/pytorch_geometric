Title: IBM Use IBM Content Navigator plugin to make the viewer tabs wrapping - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I customize the viewer tabs to wrap in IBM Content Navigator 3.0.1? 

CAUSE
By default, the viewer tabs are displayed in a single line with navigator buttons on the left and right.
It may not work well when there are a lot of tabs to navigate, and it could be customized to make the tabs simply wrapping instead. 


ANSWER
Create an IBM Content Navigator plugin, and set below attribute to true: 

ecm.widget.dialog.contentViewerWindow.wrappingTabController=true 

This property file is newly added in IBM Content Navigator 3.0.1.
