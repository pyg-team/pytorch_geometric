 WebSphere administrative secuirty needs to be disabled and the admin console is not accessible.

This can be caused by several reasons eg... server will not start with security enabled, forgot administrative password, etc...

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

To disable security, please perform the following steps via wsadmin:


 1. <WAS_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/>wsadmin -conntype NONE 
 2. wsadmin>securityoff 
 3. wsadmin>exit 
 4. Restart the servers. 
 5. Enable the security from administrative console.

NOTE: To restart the servers, you will first need to manually kill the java process since security is still enabled in the currently running process.
