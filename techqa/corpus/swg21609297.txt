QUESTION
 How can you pass the URL of a failed transaction to Omnibus from the RRT_Robotic_Playback_Events_Sampled event? 

ANSWER

When a verification point failure event or URL unavailable error occurs, you want to forward the URL of the failing transaction to Omnibus. 

You can use two different event classes to raise alerts on verification point failures and URL unavailable errors:

Event Class: RRT Robotic Playback Events
Situation:RRT_Verification_Point_Failure
Event Type: Pure 

Event Class: RRT Robotic Playback Events Sampled 
Situation:RRT_Verification_Point_Sampled
Event Type: Sampled 

When a verification point failure or a URL unavailable error occurs, the Additional_Details column in these event classes identifies the URL of the failed transaction. 

However, the ITCAM for Transactions event system does not export the Additional_Details column in sampled events to Omnibus directly. You need to map this attribute to another slot. Refer to the description of these pure and sampled event classes in the ITCAM for Transactions User's Guide.

The sampled event class is often the preferred event class, because sampled situations can be configured to ignore false alarms. In comparison, the pure event class raises an alert every time the event occurs. 

Also, sampled situation events are automatically removed after the event evaluates false. Pure situation events, on the other hand, have to be manually deleted, or you have to use the Until clause in the situation to configure the event lifetime. 

The attached PDF shows you how to use the RRT_Robotic_Playback_Events_Sampled class to export the URLs of failed transactions to Omnibus from a sampled situation.
