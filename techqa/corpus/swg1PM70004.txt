   Three issues:
   
   The main issue here - We should during the import, filter
   out the invalid double-quotes("") for a list property
   (consider it as nothing). This way the file can still be
   imported completely and no invalid definitions will be
   created.
   
   During CSV import, the double quotes becoming single quotes
   for a text property.  If you have "" in a TEXT property, we
   should import it that way, because that is legal in a TEXT
   property.
   
   The fact that a comma needs to be added to the end of the
   line if clearing out the last field.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Issue #1:
   Fixed so a property value of "" will always be treated as
   empty.
   
   Issue #2:
   If in the CSV, for a test property we have:
   -  "", that translates now to nothing,
   - """", that translates into one double quote ("), and not 2
   single quotes as stated in the summary
   - """""", that translates into 2 double quotes("")
   - single quote, single quote ('') is kept as such
   
   If I edit the object in SA and in the text property I enter
   "", when I export, in Notepad the file shows """""" (6
   double quotes). Excel works the same if I edit the CSV file
   and I type ""...
   I am not sure now that the 4 double quotes should translate
   into something else other than the one double quote...
   Interestingly, if I edit the file in Excel and I type 2
   single quotes, the file will only be saved with one. As soon
   as I click away from the cell, the value gets translated
   into '...I guess in Excel single quote has no other meaning
   than apostrophe.
   If in Notepad I enter 4 double quotes, Excel translates that
   into one double quote.
   So seeing that we in fact behave just like Excel does, there
   is no defect to address here.
   
   Issue #3:
   The product has always behaved like this and since no client
   has complained about that specifically, the decision was
   made not to fix it. The user can also just use "" now
   instead of the additional comma to clear out the last field.
