Title: IBM ICM attributes: Retrieve option ITEMTREE does not mean "REFERENCETREE" - United States

QUESTION
 I used retrieve option ITEMTREE, but I do not actually get the whole tree of referenced items. The reference attribute values are missing their attributes, children, document parts, resource content, links, and sub-folders. 

CAUSE
The retrieve option DKConstant.DK_CM_CONTENT_ITEMTREE is sometimes mistaken for an option that will return the whole tree of referenced items or that will retrieve the contents of reference attribute values. 

Users that use the ITEMTREE retrieve option will find that only the directly-retrieved items have their reference attributes populated with blank DKDDO objects except that the PID information is completed.


ANSWER
The retrieve option DKConstant.DK_CM_CONTENT_ITEMTREE retrieves just the reference relationships for the item that is directly retrieved, not the target of the reference attributes. Sufficient information is retrieved for the reference attribute that points to the correct version-specific target root component. The information is provided through the completed PID in a blank DKDDO object as the value of the reference attribute. The user can then call retrieve to retrieve the target item as needed. 

Reference attribute relationships are subject to similar retrieve behavior as links. Only the relationship, not the target DKDDO, is retrieved. Therefore, no attributes, children, document parts, links, folder contents, or resource content is retrieved in the target DKDDO. 

Because the reference attribute retrieval issue is the same as the links issue, for an explanation and solution to retrieving the whole tree of reference relationships, see the following online support document.

There is no such option as "REFERENCETREE". The title of this technote is intended only to describe, in the same nomenclature of "ITEMTREE," what "ITEMTREE" does not include. RELATED INFORMATION
