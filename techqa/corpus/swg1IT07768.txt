   12-16-2014 10:09:23: SEVERE: ERROR - Install aborted.
   
   The error indicates that the install of the ITM language
   packages for ITM 6.3 FP2 failed.
   On Windows, when the ITM or ITM language pack install fails then
   it generates an "Abort*".log file that is the Windows MSI log
   file for the Windows ITM install.
   On a failure, this log file gets moved over into the native log
   directory so that it'll get included in install log file
   collection.
