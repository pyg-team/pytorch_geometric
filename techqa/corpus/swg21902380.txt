PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 "Bar Mitzvah" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile Versions 6.1, 7.0 and 8.0 which is used by IBM and IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
