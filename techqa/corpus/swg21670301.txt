Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Security Network Intrusion Prevention System is affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 and CVE-2014-0076) - United States

Text:
PSIRT; heart bleed SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: 
CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability.




CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) [http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2014-0160&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)]


Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 




DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability.




CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) [http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2014-0076&vector=(AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)]

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Products: GX3002, GX4002, GX4004, GX4004-v2, GX5008, GX5008-v2, GX5108, GX5108-v2, GX5208, GX5208-v2, GX6116, GX7412, GX7412-10, GX7412-05, GX7800, GV200, GV1000
Firmware versions: 4.6.1 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The following IBM Threat Fixpack have the fixes for these vulnerabilities: 

 * Proventia Network Intrusion Prevention System 4.6.1 All Models System-FP0002 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/Proventia+Network+Intrusion+Prevention+System&release=4.6.1&platform=All&function=all] 


for all IBM Security Network Intrusion Prevention System products at Firmware version 4.6.1  

NOTE: Do not apply non-FIPS patches on FIPS mode appliances, as this will result in the appliance becoming locked down. 

 

After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160: 

 1. Replace your SSL Certificates
    
    You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (ie using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 
 2. Reset User Credentials
    
    Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.



Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
