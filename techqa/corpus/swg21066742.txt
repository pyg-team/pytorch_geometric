Title: IBM How can I use the 'kill' command on a Windows fileserver? - United States

kill; afskill; logging TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Debugging an AFS fileserver problem often requires the gathering of extended filelogging, which is accomplished by using the kill -TSTP command, and/or the collection of callback dumps, which are gathered with the kill -XCPU command. How can this be done on a Windows fileserver, which doesn't have the kill command? 

ANSWER
The AFS binary suite for Windows includes an 'afskill' command, which functions similarly to the UNIX kill command:

C:\>afskill
usage: afskill [-signal] [pid] ...
afskill -l

C:\>afskill -l
HUP INT QUIT ILL ABRT FPE KILL SEGV TERM USR1 USR2 CLD CHLD TSTP

The process IDs can be found in the task manager by enabling the PID column under the processes tab.
