QUESTION
 Why is the message portion of the email sent from Maximo being received as an attachment in Microsoft Outlook? 

ANSWER
The Maximo system property mxe.email.content.type will determine how to process emails based on the content-type header field in the email message. If the message portion of your email is being incorrectly received as an attachment then check the value of the mxe.email.content.type property. If it is set to text/html or text/plain then try changing it to multipart/alternative or multipart/mixed and perform a Live Refresh on the property. The information below explains the supported content-types.
