APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Receive the following error message in your CICS Explorer:
   MESSAGE CNX0220E A connection error has occurred: INVALIDPARM,
   PARM
   .
   Upon review, it was determined that the Context and Scope in a
   CMCI request is not being URL-encoded and so can't handle
   characters such as # (pound signs) in them due to their meaning
   in a URL.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Additional Keywords: CICS Explorer APAR is IZ76428 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ76428]. This will
   need to be applied as well to fix this issue.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICSPlex SM V4R1M0 Users                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:    You open CICS Explorer and try to    *
   *                      connect to an System Management Single  *
   *                      Server (SMSS) whose applid contains a   *
   *                      pound sign (#).  You see the following  *
   *                      error message:                          *
   *                                                              *
   *                         MESSAGE CNX0220E A connection error  *
   *                           has occurred: INVALIDPARM,CONTEXT  *
   *                                                              *
   *                      The same message appears when you try   *
   *                      to connnect to a CICSplex whose plex-   *
   *                      name contains a pound sign.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all Web User Interface (WUI) servers   *
   *                 and System Managed Single Server (SMSS)      *
   *                 regions must be recycled to pick up the up-  *
   *                 dated CMCI server.  Note that regions do     *
   *                 not have to be restarted at the same time.   *
   *                                                              *
   *                 CICS Explorer APAR IZ76428 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ76428] must be applied   *
   *                 to any CICS Explorer clients which connect   *
   *                 to an updated server to properly encode the  *
   *                 incoming message.                            *
   *                                                              *
   *                 Any user applications which connect to a     *
   *                 CMCI server must be updated to URL-encode    *
   *                 Context and Scope for transmission to the    *
   *                 CMCI server.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
      The Context and Scope in a CMCI request is not being URL-
   encoded and so can't handle characters such as # (pound signs)
   due to their meaning in a URL.  This affects Context and Scope
   in CICS Explorer clients connecting to V4.1 CICSplexes, and
   the Applid of SMSS regions to which CICS Explorer connects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module DFHWUPFM (WUPFM - CMCI Request Formatter) was modi-
   fied to accept and decode URL-encoded values for Context and
   Scope.  With CICS Explorer APAR IZ76428 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ76428] which causes URLs
   submitted by CICS Explorer to be properly encoded, this allows
   Context and Scope values containing special characters to be
   sent to the CMCI Server.
