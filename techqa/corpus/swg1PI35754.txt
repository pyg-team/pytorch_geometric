APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A simple base statechart of default transition to termination
   state is overidden in a derived statechart. An additional state
   is added to the derived statechart. The default transition now
   targets this new state and the new state now has an outgoing
   transition that targets the termination state.
   
   However, if the overridden checkbox for the default transition
   unchecked then Rhapsody is unable to restore the default
   transition to its original target (the termination state)
   because the new state is still present.
   
   WORKAROUND
   
   User must remove the redundant state and restore the default
   transition
   target manually
