Title: IBM SPSS Statistics does not launch on Mac OS 10.6 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed and licensed IBM SPSS Statistics on Macintosh 10.6.x and 10.7.x. However when I launch the program, I see the splash screen but then the actual program does not launch. The SPSS Statistics icon appears in the dock and is active but I do not see the Data Editor window. 

SYMPTOM
SPSS Statistics displays splash screen when launched but does not load the actual program.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The most likely culprit is the local security software stopping SPSS Statistics from launching. Disable the virus checker/security software and see if SPSS will launch. If so, set an exclusion to the IBM SPSS Statistics folder for the virus checker/security software on launch. We have had reports of incompatibility with a program called Intego with its option Behavioral Analysis turned on. The virus barrier application may have to be disabled for Statistics to launch. 

If this does not solve your issue, please open a case to technical support for troubleshooting.
