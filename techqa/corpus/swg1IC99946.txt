APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The resource stats message needs to be refactored so that it
   works for the JSON format. This is needed by the Healthcare Pack
   V3.0 in order to replace the MBX operational monitoring view
   with the same in a WebUI.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Resource statistics are not published in a format which is easy
   for web applications to consume.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

   tools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been enhanced so that JSON format messages are
   published in addition to the XML format messages when resource
   statistics are enabled.
   
   The JSON publications are available on the following topic:
   
   $SYS/Broker/broker_name/Statistics/JSON
   
   You can set up subscriptions for a specific integration server
   on a specific broker. For example:
   $SYS/Broker/IB9NODE/Statistics/JSON/Resource/default
   
   You can also use wildcards in the subscriptions to broaden the
   scope of what is returned. For example, to subscribe to reports
   for all integration servers on all brokers, use the following
   values:
   $SYS/Broker/+/Statistics/JSON/Resource/#
