APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an on demand, user-initiated (execmode = 2) script package
   is included in a deployment, the pattern engine erroneously
   raises an "Invalid value" error at deployment time for script
   package key values. If the user specifies that "" is a
   valid value for a script key in the cbscript.json file, the
   deployment fails if it is not provided a value.
   
   When you click "Quick Deploy" when using a pattern that uses
   "" as a valid value and execmode = 2 in the script package, a
   red pop up error is shown:
   
   Invalid application model
   
   Example of a failing cbscript.json file
   {
     "scriptkey": "MESSAGE",
     "scriptvalue": "",
     "scriptdefaultvalue": "",
     "validvalues": [
          "",
          "VALUE1",
          "VALUE2"
     ],
     "description": "Testing empty default value with validvalues
      that includes empty string.",
     "required": false
   }
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The user can change the script key definition in
   cbscript.json file to remove the empty string value as follows:
   
   {
               "scriptkey": "MESSAGE",
               "validvalues": ["VALUE1",
                               "VALUE2",
                               "VALUE3"],
               "description": "Testing empty default value with
   validvalues that includes empty string.",
               "required": false
   }
   
   and then in Pattern Builder or the deploy user interface,
   you can still leave the MESSAGE value blank since it is not
   required.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The script key values were not being parsed correctly to
   allow the empty string value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix has been provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.1.2.0.
