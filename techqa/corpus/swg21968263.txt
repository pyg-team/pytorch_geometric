QUESTION
 Why is Lemmatization ignored for certain Watson Content Analytics (WCA) search queries? 

CAUSE
When a search query includes a query modifier, it may cause lemmatization to be ignored in the search query. The query parser does not expand terms to lemma automatically in this case.

ANSWER
In a case where a WCA search query contains 2 or more words with the same lemma and uses a query modifier, such as '-' (AND NOT), it will return unexpected results. 

For example, in the following search query:
house -houses
a user may not expect to have any documents containing the word 'house' or 'houses' returned, as they share the same lemma. However, documents with the word 'house' only will be returned because logically this is what has been queried by the search query. 
In this instance the lemmatization is ignored and instead the query modifier (eg: -) in the query takes precedence.
ie: query syntax character logic takes precedence over lemmatization.
