ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to reproduce:
   
   1) You create a new PM with calendar frequency of 10 days
   2) you populate the field PM.PLUSASTARTDATE with the date of
   today, and thePM.NEXTDATE (next due date) with the date of
   today.
   2 bis)on the frequency tab of the PM check the first sentence
   something like 'Use starting WO information to calculate next
   date' - Sorry I have a french version in front of me.... So you
   have to do that before
   3) you change the status of PM to active
   4) select action / generate WO
   5) In the dialog box, chose : generate WO for the next 30 days,
   use frequency criteria - checked, and click OK
   6) Maximo should generate 3 Workorders
   Once WO generated, one more time play
   7) Select action / generate WO
   8- In the dialog box, chose : generate WO for the next 60 days,
   use frequency criteria - checked, and click OK
   9) Maximo should generate 3 new WO. Unfortunately, we receive a
   message like ' A workorder has already been generated' and
   nothing is generated.
