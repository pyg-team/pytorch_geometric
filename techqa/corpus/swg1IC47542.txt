APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AMQ4043 error "Queue manager not available for connection" is
   reported while trying to establish connection to a remote queue
   manager with SSL enabled MQI channels using WebSphere MQ
   version 6.0 Explorer GUI.
   
   The error pops up after following the steps to add a remote
   queue manager in the Explorer GUI using the "Show/Hide Queue
   Managers" by specifying in the client channel definition table
   file and clicking "Finish" to complete the setup
   Additional Keywords: MQExplorer security
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *   Using a JKS file, we were able to connect using SSL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of WebSphere MQ version 6.0 using Explorer for remote
   queue manager connection with SSL enabled MQI channels
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux,Windows
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When all the other required steps are performing with no
   errors, this error is caused by the usage of an incorrect key
   store file type while configuring the WebSphere MQ Explorer for
   SSL security.
   
   WebSphere MQ Explorer uses the Java key store file(JKS) for SSL
   security, so the key store file being created for configuring
   SSL for WebSphere MQ Explorer needs to be of the JKS type and
   should have a password for access.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The System Administration Guide Version 6.0 SC34-6584-00 is
   modified to include this information.
   
   The following section named "How to get WebSphere MQ Explorer
   to connect to a remote queue manager using SSL enabled MQI
   Channels" is added to Part 3, "Chapter 7 Administration
   using the WebSphere MQ Explorer" under "Setting up the
   WebSphere MQ Explorer" -> "Security" -> "Security for
   connecting to remote queue managers" -> "Using SSL Security"
   
   ------------------------------Start-----------------------------
   How to get WebSphere MQ Explorer to connect to a remote queue
   manager using SSL enabled MQI Channels
   
   On the system hosting the remote queue manager -
   
   1) Define a svrconn-clntconn pair of channels and specify the
      appropriate value for cipher-spec attribute (SSLCIPH) on the
      svrconn channel.
   
   2) FTP, in binary mode, the channel definition table
      AMQCLCHL.TAB file (found under the queue manager's @ipcc
      directory) onto the system hosting the WebSphere MQ Explorer
   
   3) Start a listener on a designated port
   
   4) Place the SSL certificates (both CA and personal) into the
      queue manager's SSL directory (/var/mqm/qmgrs/QMNAME/SSL
      directory on UNIX systems and
      <mqinstallpath>\qmgrs\QMNAME\SSL folder on Windows systems.
   
   5) Create a key database file called key.kdb and stash the
      password in a file (using the check option in iKeyMan GUI or
      using '-stash' on the gskit command
   
   6) Add the CA certificates into the key database created above
      and import the personal certificate for the queue manager
      into the key database
   
   On the system hosting WebSphere MQ Explorer -
   
   1) Create a key database file of type JKS using iKeyMan or
      otherwise and set a password for the key database file.
   
   2) Add the CA certificates and import the personal certificate
      into the newly created key database
   
   3) Start WebSphere MQ Explorer GUI
   
   4) Go to Windows -> Preference -> WebSphere MQ Explorer -> SSL
      Client Certificate Stores and enter the store name and
      password for the JKS file that you have created
   
   5) Right click on Queue manager and click 'Show/Hide Queue
      Managers'. Click on 'Add' on the next screen
   
   6) Type in the queue manager name and click next after
      selecting the option to connect directly
   
   7) Click on 'Use Client channel definition table' and specify
      the location of the channel table file that you have
      transferred from the remote queue manager
   
   8) Click "Finish" to complete the steps and you should now be
      able to access the remote queue manager in the WebSphere MQ
      Explorer
   
   Note: WebSphere MQ Explorer uses Java key store file(JKS) for
   SSL security and hence the key store file being created for
   configuring SSL for WebSphere MQ Explorer needs to be of JKS
   type and should have a password for access.
