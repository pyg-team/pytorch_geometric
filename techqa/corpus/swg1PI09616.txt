   We think this is related to version cleanup, when hash files are
   deleted but the server still believes the version still exists.
   This may happen when using uDeploy V4.8.4 or onwards, and think
   this is a different issue from a known version cleanup issue
   identified by APAR PI05165 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI05165].
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Import the missing files again as new component versions and use
   that for deployments.
