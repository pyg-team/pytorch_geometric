PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Sterling Control Center shuts down after several hours of operation. It does this repeatedly and at more or less regular intervals. 

SYMPTOM
The engine log shows several errors like:


"executeQuery - SQL Exception msg : The query has timed out". 





..ultimately leading to...: 

[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] ERROR RecoverableDAO - The query was executed 60 times for 36605 seconds. However, the engine did not succeed in performing the database operation, because of the following. Error :The query has timed out.
[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] ERROR RecoverableDAO - The query has timed out.
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The query has timed out.
[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] ERROR SQLExceptionShutdownHandler - ** SQLExceptionShutdownHandler entered with sqlex=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The query has timed out.
[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] ERROR SQLExceptionShutdownHandler - ** Event not updated or details on what was being done when error occurred -> The query has timed out.
[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] ERROR SQLExceptionShutdownHandler - The query has timed out.
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The query has timed out.
[InitCompProcCache-348-thread-1] INFO SCCEngine - com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The query has timed out.




The Control Center Engine then shuts itself down because it has no reason to live without a working database connection. 



CAUSE
The database may have become misindexed or otherwise corrupted


ENVIRONMENT
MS-SQL



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check your Control Center engine log for signs of query timeouts leading to a shutdown



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform maintenance on your database to re-index your tables correctly. Consult your database vendor's documentation for details of how to do this.
