 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition that is used by IBM WebSphere MQ. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016 and include the vulnerability commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0448 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0448]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded related to the JMX component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a partial confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109949] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the ../jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - for example jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - for example jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JRE is the only solution.
