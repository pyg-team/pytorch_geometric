 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When an administrator attempts to install a P8eF-4.0.2 fix pack on a Workplace Application Engine system or a Workplace XT system running on a Windows 2008 64-bit server, the following error message appears: "Unable to install IBM FileNet eForms for P8 (): Patch is associated with a product that is not installed on target machine." 

SYMPTOM
When installing P8eF 4.0.2-000 on a Windows 2008 Enterprise Server SP2 64-bit, no error was reported, but the following problems were observed: 

1. The base installer failed to pick up the existing AE or XT installation path.
2. The "IBM FileNet eForms for P8" did not display in the Windows 2008 Control Panel -> Program and Features (formerly called, "Add Remove/ Programs"). Because of this issue, users were not able to remove the software, if needed.
3. After the base installation completed, subsequent P8eF fix pack installations failed because the installer did not detect that the base software was installed.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2008 64-bit Server
