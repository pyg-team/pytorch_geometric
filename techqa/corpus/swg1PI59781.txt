APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have successfully installed and licensed IBM SPSS Statistics
   24.0 to use Concurent User Licensing on a remote Sentinel RMS
   License Manager  (or so you think).  Still each time you launch
   the product, you are met with the same Welcome Screen telling
   you
   you have X many days left in your Trial period and you are
   offered the chance to license you product (again... and again).
   WORKAROUND:
   This comes down to the fact that, while the LAW successfully
   updates the DaemonHost value in spssprod.inf, it does not
   disable the the trial license.
   To do so, simply rename the license file in your product
   installation directory.
   For example:
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24\lservrc
   to
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24\lservrc_bak
   Alternatively, you could use the "#" character to 'comment out'
   the license string(s) within "C:\Program
   Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24\lservrc"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The reported behavior was corrected in an updated version of the
   Statistics 24 Desktop Client that was uploaded on June 23, 2016.
   
   If you are encountering this behavior prior to a mass
   installation of the product, please download the updated version
   of the Statistics 24 desktop client and use this version for
   your installations.
   
   If you are encountering this behavior after a mass installation
   of the product, the immediate corrective ('work-around') for
   this behavior is to delete the 'lservrc' present in the
   installation directory of the Statistics 24 network licensing
   client.
   
   If you are using encountering this behavior after a mass
   installation of the product using automated installation
   technology to install the product, you could delete the
   'lservrc' file as a command line instruction into your
   deployment script using a command argument such as:
   
   Windows (via Administrator Command Prompt)
   cd C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\24\&del lservrc&exit
   
   Note: This command argument example assumes the bit-version of
   both Statistics and the Windows operating system are aligned
   (i.e. either both 32-bit or both 64-bit, not 32-bit client on
   64-bit OS).
   
   Mac (via Terminal)
   cd
   /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents
   /bin/;sudo
   rm lservrc;killall Terminal
   
   Linux (via Terminal)
   cd /opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/bin;sudo rm lservrc;exit
