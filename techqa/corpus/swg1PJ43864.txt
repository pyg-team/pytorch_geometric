APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Content Platform Engine: 5.2.1 - Linux
   IBM Content Navigator: 2.0.3
   WAS: 8.5.5.7
   
   When we retrieve an object path using CMIS API with
   getObjectbypath we received a "object not found" message, when
   an Umlaut exists in the path.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The clients developer has built in a workaround for this until
   they get a solution for this issue:
   
   In the provided example code we first create a new folder with
   special characters in its name. Thus we have access to both,
   the path and the ID of the newly created folder.
   Next, we clear the cache and try to get the same folder again
   by its path. A CmisObjectNotFoundException is thrown.
   We now try to get the folder by path again, but this time we
   previously loaded the folder into cache by getting it with the
   ID.
   We successfully receive the folder and delete it, so that this
   code example can be launched again with the same results.
   
   Regarding the workaround, we first check if the object that we
   want to get by path has special characters in its name. If that
   is the case, all childs of the parent folder will be queried,
   so that they are loaded into cache.
   With the sought object in cache, we can now safely get it by
   path.
