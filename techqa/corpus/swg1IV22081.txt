ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TSAM SSUI does not control properly duplicate project names
   in some cases
   .
   Usually TSAM SSUI doesn't allow to send a Create Project
   service request if the new project name already exists in
   the system in status draft or operational.
   .
   However, following a specific sequence it is possible to
   create the SR with a duplicated project name.
   .
   The sequence is the following:
   - Pass over the whole wizard up to the summary pane filling
     in the forms and using a good, non existing, project name.
   - Click on back button until return to the project details
     pane.
   - Replace the name with the one of a already existing project.
   - Click finish, the wizard go to the summary pane.
   - Click finish.
   .
   After that the SSUI creates the SR though it shows a pop-up
   with the error: CTJZH2334E: A server error occurred when
   updating this new service request with the provided data.
   .
   When clicking "OK" on the pop-up it closes though the wizard
   reamins open as if it is still creating the SR until the user
   clicks "Cancel".
   .
   The SR isn't showed in the "My Requests" pod though it is
   created in  maximo, it remains indefinitely in status "NEW".

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of Tivoli Service Automation Manager
   7.2.2.2
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   TSAM SSUI does not control properly duplicate project
   The check for duplicate project names takes place only after the
   focus leaves the "project name" textbox. If the user's action is
   to click on "next" immediately and all other mandatory fields on
   the
   page are filled in, the check for valid project name comes too
   late and the user can skip over the page and submit a
   pre-existing project name.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   Apply 7.2.2.2-TIV-TSAM-LA0002
   
   For permanent resolution apply Tivoli Service Automation Manager
   7.2.3 when available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The root cause for this problem is that the check for duplicate
   projects happens only when leaving the textbox.
   The check happens but if the user clicked on "next", by the time
   the check has finished (it is a REST call to a remote system),
   the user has already skipped to the next page.
   
   The fix makes sure that the project name is re-checked if the
   user clicks on "next" or "finish" on the "project details" page.
   Only if the double-check succeeds can the user move on to the
   next page.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following  packages:
