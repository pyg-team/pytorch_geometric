PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use a post_exec script to get job's termination reason 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Can LSF report whether and why a job is killed or terminated, other than completed successfully? 
There is no built-in method for LSF to report why a job is terminated.




You can write a post_exec script (executes after a job is done or terminated) that parses job output file "bsub -o" to determine why a job fails. e.g., a job killed for reaching the RUNLIMIT will have the following information in the job output:





TERM_RUNLIMIT: job killed after reaching LSF run time limit. Exited with exit code 145.





 The "bacct" command can also give you information on why a job exits besides the exit code.
