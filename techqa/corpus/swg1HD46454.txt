   locked by <userid> so cannot modify document
   role".  If you send the part reference to the part
   editor window and attempt the same modify
   document role function it accepts the request and
   immediately moves the document to the requested
   role folder.  The inconsistency between editors will
   be a source of confusion for the ENOVIA users.
