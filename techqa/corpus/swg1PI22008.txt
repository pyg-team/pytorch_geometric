   ****************************************************************
   01.When an RDz user disconnects from the server, it is possible
      (although rare) for the timing to be such that a deadlock
      can occur. In such scenarios, this can also result in locked
      datasets.
   02.If a z/OS machine hasn't properly configured their DNS
      settings, an NPE can occur with the server. While there is
      already a workaround for this scenario, there is no message
      indicating to the administrator what might have gone wrong.
      The second issue is that .dstoreHashmap files can get
      frequently created in some scenarios and these files aren't
      very useful to users.
   03.Deleting a symbolic link for a folder from RSE deletes the
      folder contents.
   04.Rational Developer for System z enhancement to allow TLS
      v1.2 usage. To use TLS v1.2, define
      _RSE_JAVAOPTS="$_RSE_JAVAOPTS
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2" in rsed.envvars (host), and
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2 in eclipse.ini (client).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.In order to avoid the deadlock, a synchronized block in the
      server code was removed. This is a change that had already
      gone into the RDz 9* versions.
   02.The RSE server will attempt to fall back to reading the
      hostname via a shell command. If that fails then, a error
      message will indicate a problem and suggest the workaround.
      For .dstoreHashmap log entries will not get created by
      default and older ones will be deleted after a two days.
   03.When a user deletes a symbolic link for a folder, the
      contents are not deleted.
   04.Rational Developer for System z enhancement to allow TLS
      v1.2 usage. To use TLS v1.2, define
      _RSE_JAVAOPTS="$_RSE_JAVAOPTS
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2" in rsed.envvars (host), and
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2 in eclipse.ini (client).
