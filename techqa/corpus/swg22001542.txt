QUESTION
 Why am I seeing a "STMM global benefit structure size mismatch" or a "Global benefit is invalid" message in the db2diag.log? 

CAUSE
For example from the db2diag.log
EDUID : 51 EDUNAME: db2stmm (DB2INST1) 0
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, Self tuning memory manager, stmmGetGlobalBenefit, 
probe:2363 
MESSAGE : ZRC=0x82AE0093=-2102525805=STMM_DBMEM_INVALID_GLOBAL_BENEFIT 
"Global benefit is invalid" 
DATA #1 : String, 102 bytes 
STMM global benefit structure size mismatch. Structure ends at 
0x3ff863fb3a0, expected 0x3ff863fb390. 


EDUID : 51 EDUNAME: db2stmm (DB2INST1) 0 
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, Self tuning memory manager, stmmUpdateGlobalBenefit, 
probe:3289 
MESSAGE : ZRC=0x82AE0093=-2102525805=STMM_DBMEM_INVALID_GLOBAL_BENEFIT 
"Global benefit is invalid" 
DATA #1 : String, 47 bytes 
STMM global benefit is corrupt, reinitializing. 



ANSWER
The above scenario has been confirmed to be a defect in DB2 LUW v11 for SUSE Linux at this time. 

"APAR IT20046 - STMM global benefit is invalid" will be used to correct this defect. 

This is a cosmetic defect, no impact should be noted and the above messages in the db2diag.log can be ignored too. 

At this time there is no fixpack selected to include this APAR.
