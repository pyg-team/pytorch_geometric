APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In ACCE, when creating a new object, the wizard begins a new tab
   in the UI but never completes populating the list of existing
   items.
   If you toggle to another tab and then click back in the wizard,
   more
   of the UI objects are displayed but the list of existing object
   names
   still remains unpopulated.  The UI does not work properly to add
   a
   new object.
   
   This only occurs on Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on ACCE for
   Content
   Platform Engine 5.2.0.3.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1    Select any Object Store
   2    Select Data Design
   3    Select Property Templates
   4    Select New
   5    A new tab will open up to allow you create a new Property
   Template.
        5.a   This tab shows up blank.
   6    Now if you select one of the other Tabs that are currently
   displayed and then go back to the New Property Template tab it
   will display more of the objects but will still not work to add
   a new object.
