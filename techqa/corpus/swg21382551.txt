Title: IBM DNS issues causing FTA to not link. - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Fault Tolerant Agent (FTA) is not linking to the master due to misconfigured DNS settings. 

SYMPTOM
Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) FTA will not link or will not fully link to the master domain manager (MDM) or domain manager (DM).


CAUSE
Domain Name Services (DNS) entries are incorrect.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Depending on how the CPU definitions are set up (long hostname, short hostname, or IP address), attempt to ping back and forth using the address specified in the CPU definition.


The following errors can be found in the TWSMerge.log and NETMAN.log from the FTA:

10:21:28 06.04.2009|MAILMAN:+ AWSBCV082I Workstation <master or domain manager name>, message: 
AWSDEB052E An error occurred in getaddrinfo: No such host is known. 
(getting the host IP address using the host name).

This is the explanation of the error: 

AWSDEB052E 
An error occurred in getaddrinfo: error_message (getting the host IP 
address using the host name). 

Explanation: 
An error was issued while the program was searching for the host IP 
address on the Domain Name Server (DNS). 
error_message describes the error and includes the operating system 
error message. 

System action: 
This message is generated by a library function that is called by more 
than one program. The calling program decides how to handle the error 
displayed by this message. Search the log for following messages to find 
how Tivoli Workload Scheduler responds. 

Operator response: 
Check the information in the error message. If it states that the host 
name does not exist on the DNS, verify that the value of the host name 
in the connection parameters is correct. The connection parameters might 
have been supplied as part of a command, in a text file referenced in 
the command string, or from the default definitions in the useropts or 
localopts file. If the host has just been connected to the network, or 
if it has been reconnected after a host name change, you might have to 
wait for the DNS server to update its database with the new or changed 
host name. 

The NETMAN.log shows: 

13:56:02 06.04.2009|NETMAN:+ AWSEDW053E Netman could not validate the IP 
address for a service. 
13:56:02 06.04.2009|NETMAN:+Service request: Service 2003 for CONMAN/8.4 
on <master or domain manager name> 
13:56:02 06.04.2009|NETMAN:+ IP address: ###.###.###.### 
13:56:02 06.04.2009|NETMAN:+ Error type: **WARNING** 
13:56:02 06.04.2009|NETMAN:+ Error message: gethostbyname() failed, 
unable to retrieve IP address of connecting node: 
<master or domain manager node name> 


Here is an explanation of this error: 

AWSEDW053E 
Netman could not validate the IP address for a service. 
Service request: service_request 
IP address: IP_address 
Error type: error_type 
Error message: validation_error.

Explanation: 
service_request is the service request packet received by Netman 
IP_address is the IP address of the client process. 
error_type is a string containing either the string "**ERROR**" or the 
string "**WARNING**". 
validation_error is a message containing the validation error. 

System action: 
Netman continues, but the operation is not performed. 

Operator response: 
Refer to the Tivoli Workload Scheduler Administration and 
Troubleshooting for a description of IP validation operations.

See also: 
The chapter on troubleshooting the network in Administration and 
Troubleshooting for details on IP validation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Verify DNS settings with your network administrator. This is not a Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) related issue, but rather, there is a network problem.
