PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing the IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 Feature Pack for Web Services feature , the required disk space estimation shown in Installation Manager is not accurate.

A possible symptom could be:
ERROR MESSAGE: 
Modification failed. 
Error during "install" phase:
