Title: IBM Can't deploy CPE 5.2.1, ear files are missing - United States

Text:
Engine-ws.ear; CMUI TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After what seems to be a successful install of IBM Content Platform Engine (CPE) 5.2.1, no Engine-xx.ear files were created in /IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/lib/ so CPE can not be deployed. 

SYMPTOM
When running the deployment task in Configuration Manager, browsing to /IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/lib/ notice there are no ear files such as Engine-ws-ear .




CAUSE
Insufficient disk space allotted for the installation. As of CPE 5.2.1, the ear files (Engine-ws.ear, Engine-wl.ear, Engine-jb.ear) are no longer shipped on the media. The ear files are built on the fly during the CPE installation.

ENVIRONMENT
Identified on AIX, but this could occur on any platform with insufficient space.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect the following logs. Default locations listed below:
opt/IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/ce_install_log_5.2.1.0.txt
/tmp/ce521_install_stdout.txt
/tmp/ce521_install_stderr.txt

The errors to diagnose this issue were in ce521_install_stderr.txt:
...
Command.run(): /opt/IBM/FileNet/downloads/IATEMPDIR/773194.tmp/executeScriptTmp0:stderr [BUILD FAILED]
Command.run(): /opt/IBM/FileNet/downloads/IATEMPDIR/773194.tmp/executeScriptTmp0:stderr [/opt/IBM/FileNet/CPE/ContentEngine/lib/mergepe.xml:329: The following error occurred while executing this line:]

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow the Compatibility Report's disk space requirements and allow for sufficient space. For AIX, CPE 5.2.1 requires 5GB of free space, plus 5GB of temp space. 

To recover from an install that failed to create the ear files due to lack of disk space:




 1. Follow the product documentation to uninstall CPE http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8prm002.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8prm002.htm] 
 2. Increase the free disk space for the install and temp space to 5 GB, each. 
 3. Reinstall CPE as before 
 4. Check the logs listed below for any errors:
    opt/IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/ce_install_log_5.2.1.0.txt
    /tmp/ce521_install_stdout.txt
    /tmp/ce521_install_stderr.txt 
 5. Check /opt/IBM/FileNet/ContentEngine/lib and validate the Engine-xx.ear files were created. 
 6. Proceed with the post install, configuration steps in the product documentation.
