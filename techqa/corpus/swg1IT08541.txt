APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  inclusion of new listener process features in failover script
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   Releases of WMQ-V6.0 on  HP OpenVMS Alpha
   and Itanium Platforms, the inclusion of
   new listener feature is not documented
   in the "START_QM" and "END_QM" template
   scripts used for deploying  failover set.
   .
   The new feature included in WMQ-V6.0 releases
   does allow automatically start and end
   listener processes (RUNMQLSR) associated
   with its Queue Manager instance. The
   existing released versions of the
   "START_QM"  and "END_QM" template scripts
   does guide end users to use both
   "RUNMQLSR" and "ENDMQLSR" respectively
   Implicitly these MQ control commands are
   executed when the failover set is
   implemented and allowed to run.
   .
   However uncommenting the lines containing
   these MQ control commands is not mandatory
   within these template scripts when the
   particular Queue Manager host the
   definitions for the listener objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Both "START_QM" and "END_QM" template
   scripts are modified to guide end users
   to consider as an optional method of using
   these MQ control commands for starting
   and ending listeners.WMQ-V6.0 releases
   provide new feature to define listener objects.
   .
   Local fix:
   1. Issue RUNMQSC command against the Queue Manager
   2.Define the listener object as below.
   DEFINE  LISTENER(<Listener_Name>)
   TRPTYPE(TCP) PORT(<Port_No>) +
   IPADDR(<Cluster_Failover_IP>) CONTROL(QMGR)
   3.End the Queue Manager, join the same to the
   failover set.
   4.Continue with the failover commands.
   .
   Modifications to the template scripts will be
   delivered in the next FP release for WMQ-V6.0
   HP OpenVMS Alpha and Itanium platforms.
