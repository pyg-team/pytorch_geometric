APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Error Description:
   Abstract: In Rational Developer for System Z (RDz) version
   8.0.3, when stopping a debug session, RDz will close the editor
   containing the source being debugged but also the last PL/I
   source edited.
   Problem: Problem seems to appear on second debug session.
   
   1) Connect to RDz host
   2) Create a new z/OS project and subproject
   3) Edit a PL/I program like MYSOURCE.PLI(TSTPLI1) with the LPEX
   editor
   4) Generate JCL for Compile/Link/Go for program
   5) Submit the JCL
   6) When debugger has started and is waiting at first line of
   TSTPLI1: stop it
   7) Editor TSTPLI1.pli gets closed
   
   If after step 3 another editor source file is open (for example
   a JCL), at step 7 it is the last editor that gets closed (ie the
   JCL).
   
   Local fix:
   There is no known workaround at this time.
