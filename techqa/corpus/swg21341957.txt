Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Importing Metadata from a Planning Contributor fails with an error message. Data Source test is succesfull in Cognos Connection. 

SYMPTOM
BMT-MD-6001 Connection to the data source failed because a valid connection string was not specified.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To be able to import Planning - Contributor metadata in Framework Manager, Series 7 (Access Manager) security has to be defined in Cognos Connection and Data source has to use it. .LAE files cannot be used as Cognos does not support it as a Series 7 security, so it must be imported into a directory server prior setup.

Steps:  1. Set up Access Manager security. Import .LAE into a Directory Server if necessary.
 2. Define Series 7 security in Cognos Connection, pointing to a Directory Server above.
 3. Create the Data Source using Series 7 as a "External namespace".
 4. Login to Series 7 namespace.
 5. Run Metadata Wizard to import metadata.
