Title: IBM Cannot use my old table look files (*.tlo extension) with SPSS 16 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have recently installed SPSS 16 or higher and would like to run a ctables syntax with a table look I have created in an earlier release of SPSS. The file extension of the table look file is *.tlo. However, when I run my syntax I receive an error message that the *.tlo file is not a valid SPSS file. Why I can't use my old table look file? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Tablelooks from previous versions (.tlo) need to be regenerated with the new format *.stt.
SPSS 16 or higher use new formats for viewer and table look files. You have to recreate the table look files and save it with the new extension *.stt or use existing table look files. You can find them in the SPSS installation directory within the Looks folde
