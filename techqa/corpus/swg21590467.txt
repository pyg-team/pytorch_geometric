QUESTION
 How do I increase the Apache Derby Database Wait Timeout with IBM Rational Team Concert? 

CAUSE
Derby is only supported in small user deployments, however, there may be a need to increase the wait timeout to prevent errors when writing to the database.

ANSWER
Use the "ij utility", which is bundled with Derby, to adjust the wait timeout parameter. 

 1. Start IJ by using the following command:
    java -cp 'derby.jar:derbytools.jar' org.apache.derby.tools.ij
    
    
 2. Connect to the database in question:
    ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:conf/ccm/derby/repositoryDB';
    
    
 3.  Set the value of derby.tools.waitTimeout: to -1 (infinite timeout)
    ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_DATABASE_PROPERTY('derby.locks.waitTimeout', '-1');
    
    
 4. Query to verify that the value was set:
    ij> values SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_DATABASE_PROPERTY('derby.locks.waitTimeout');
    
    
 5. Exit from IJ:
    ij> quit;
    The timeout should now be set.
