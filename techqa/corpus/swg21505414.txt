Title: IBM Unable to delete an attachment in the Manage Library Dialog Box - United States

Text:
TPAEDOCLINK; Cannot delete this record; BMXAA0876E; Manage Library TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are you getting an error message of "BMXAA0876E - Cannot delete this record." when attempting to delete a doclinks record from the Manage Library dialog box beneath the Select Action menu? 

CAUSE
By design, a doc folder cannot be deleted if it is associated with one or more application. For example, if an attachment was created in the Work Order Tracking app, the doctype is automatically associated with the Work Order Tracking app. 

To delete this doctype, you need to go to the action menu Associate Folders, and delete all the associations with this doctype. Then go back to Manage Folders, and then you can delete the doc folder. 
However, if a regular user does not remember which application (s)he initially created the attached document, then (s)he will not be able to delete it from the UI.


ANSWER
As a system administrator, if you are just looking to prevent the document from displaying in the Manage Library dialog, the following option may be your alternative solution. 

There is a column called 'Show' that flags Maximo whether or not to display the document and its information on the Manager Library screen. 

By running the SQL statement below, Maximo will not display this document in the Manage Library dialog such that other users won't see it. 

This is probably your safest option to resolve this by leaving the existing document intact in the docinfo table, yet not displaying it to all users. 

 

update docinfo set show = 0 where document ='xxxx' 

commit; 

*Notice that 'xxxx' is the value of the DOCINFO.DOCUMENT attribute.
