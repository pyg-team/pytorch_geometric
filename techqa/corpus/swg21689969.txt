QUESTION
 Probe package withdrawal : What are the replacements? 

CAUSE
A number of probes were withdrawn from the IBM Tivoli Netcool product portfolio without stating the alternatives available.

ANSWER
 

In the first instance you should check that the product is withdrawn or not, as products may not be visible in passport advantage due to entitlement problems.
In general, if the release notes are visible in the support portal, then the product should still be available via passport advantage.

The following list shows probes that were formally withdrawn and their replacements, if available:
