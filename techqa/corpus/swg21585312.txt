QUESTION
 How to delete old WAS regions from TEP Navigator list if the ITCAM DC was not unconfigured. 

ANSWER
1. Stop the YN agent process 
In z/OS, take down the YN and YNSA started tasks.
2. Remove the off-line entries from the TEP for this agent. 
You do this by right clicking --> “Remove off-line agent” for the entries in the Navigator list that you want to delete. The YN agent process MUST be down for this option to be available.
3. In your itm_home/config directory make a backup of the file 
hostname_yn.xml 
4. In your itm_home/config directory delete all the .ctx files 
5. In your itm_home/config directory delete all the .xml files with the 
server name you no longer want to see. 
6. In your itm_home/config directory delete the hostname_yn.xml file 

7. Re-configure your YN agent via the itmcmd or itmcmd config -A yn 
commands. On z/OS you will use the ICAT tool to configure the agent.
