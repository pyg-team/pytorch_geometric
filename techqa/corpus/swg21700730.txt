Title: IBM Security Bulletin:  Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java SDK affect Rational Developer for System z CVE-2015-0138 - United States

Text:
CVE-2015-0138; CVE-2015-0410; CVE-2014-6593 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, that is used by Rational Developer for System z. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2015. This bulletin also addresses the “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 
This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0410 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0410]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-6593 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6593]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100153] for the current score

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

By default Rational Developer for System z relies on System SSL defaults for active cipher suites, and by default, System SSL enables the RSA-EXPORT cipher suites for SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 (The cipher is not supported in TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2). 
The RSA-EXPORT ciphers are: 

 * TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 ("03" or "0003") 
 * TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5 ("06" or "0006")



You can explicitly disable the usage of the RSA-EXPORT ciphers by adding the GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS environment variable, ensuring that the environment variable character string does not include ciphers "03" or "06". 

Rational Developer for System z has two components that utilize System SSL:  * RSE, which is used when a client connects to the host. You must specify the GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS environment variable in rsed.envvars, by default located in /etc/rdz. 
 * Debug Manager, by means of an AT-TLS policy. You must create a file holding the GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS environment variable and reference it via the Envfile keyword in the TTLSGroupAdvancedParms section.



Notes:  * The RSED started task must be recycled for changes in rsed.envvars to be picked up. 
 * The AT-TLS policy must be re-activated for the update to be picked up. 


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues.
