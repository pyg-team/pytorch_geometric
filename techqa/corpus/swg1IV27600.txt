APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000
   appears in logfile on cron servers.  The issue seems to occur
   because this client has more than 1000 scheduled reports.  The
   developers have confirmed that the error is thrown because the
   sql that is used in the code is utilizing a sql function (IN
   clause) that has a built in limit of 1000.  This is causing that
   particular sql to fail hence the messages in the log.  The code
   will need to be rewrittne to avoid this error.
   
   There is no functionality loss therefore this is only being
   submitted as a severity 2 apar. The sql error will only cause
   the
   servertimestamp update to fail, which causes the server to be
   "equal" in terms of who to run the crontask instead of giving
   the weight to the server who has previous run the crontask.
