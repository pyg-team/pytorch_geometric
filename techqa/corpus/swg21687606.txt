QUESTION
 How to implement JazzSM / TCR for HA environment? 

ANSWER

Distributed installation of TCR (with Gateway and Dispatcher on different machines) is not currently supported with TCR 3.x. To enable HA, JazzSM (DASH & TCR) should be installed on all the machines, but by pointing to single Content store database.

For Example:
Machine 1 -> JazzSM1 (DASH+TCR) -> Connecting to Contentstore db i,e TCRDB1
Machine 2 -> JazzSM2 (DASH+TCR) -> Connecting to Contentstore db i,e TCRDB1

This is the scenario when one JazzSM machine goes down:

Machine1 (M1)->JazzSM (Dash+TCR )->Configure M2+M3+M4 dispatcher
Machine2 (M2)->JazzSM (Dash+TCR) ->Configure M1+M3+M4 dispatcher
Machine3 (M3)->JazzSM (TCR without DASH)
Machine3 (M4)->JazzSM (TCR without DASH) 

Note: All above JazzSM TCR connects to same Contentstore db 

Enable DASH with high availability -> Considering M1 DASH is down and accessing HA URL, M2 DASH comes up with immediate Cognos dispatcher URL which ever is available at that particular time.
