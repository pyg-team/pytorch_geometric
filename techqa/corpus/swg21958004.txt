 When you open the IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) workbench, you receive error "license key cannot be found".

The licensing is setup as floating.




CAUSE
Possible causes include the following.



 1. The network connection to the license server does not work. 
    
    
 2. You do not own a base floating license for RPT.
    
    
 3. The cause is an erroneous floating license support configuration in the IBM Installation Manager.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For cause A, fix the network connection. Possibly your license server is behind a firewall.

For cause B, contact IBM sales to acquire the right licences. Refer to the Directory of worldwide contacts [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/].
Note: you get the same error when you own only a virtual-users license.
