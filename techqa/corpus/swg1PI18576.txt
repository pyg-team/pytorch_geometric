APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SessionListener does not execute same SessionTimeOutFilter for
   multiple parallel sessions of a user.
   SessionTimeoutFilter will not be triggered normally when using
   the same user login to two different browsers and get two
   different sessions. One login first and another one login
   later. When the later one login, the session of first one in
   portal was not timeout yet. Then wait a moment until both of
   their session are timeout. Only the first one's session
   triggered SessionTimeoutFilter but not the second one.
