Title: IBM ORBLocalHostName : Using CORBA probes with multiple interfaces - United States

Text:
ORBLocalPort; corba; CORBA; interface; multiple; ipaddress TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 ORBLocalHostName : Can CORBA probes be forced to use an interface? 

CAUSE
ORBLocalHostName is not available for all CORBA probes

ANSWER
 

The ORBLocalHostName property allows the probe to use a specific IP-Address when communicating with the CORBA EMS. 

Determine if the probe being used supports the property using the '-dumpprops' command line option. 

If available, the ORBLocalHostName property will be listed alongside ORBLocalPort.
ORBLocalHostName: '' # STRING (No description available)
ORBLocalPort: 0 # INTEGER (No description available)


If ORBLocalHostName is not listed, and is required, please raise an RFE for the probe. 

If the request is urgent, contact IBM Support to see if a test fix patch can be provided, after first checking to see if there is a newer probe patch available on passport advantage. 

 

Typically the ORBLocalHostName is set to the hostname or IP-Address for the network the EMS server is on. Therefore check for the EMS's network using ifconfig [unix] or ipconfig [Windows] on the probe server, and confirm the IP-Address being used to connect to the EMS's network. If necessary ask the system administrator to provide the correct IP-Address or FQDN for the probe server on the EMS's network. 

Check that the EMS system is able to communicate with the probe server on the IP-Address found, and request the firewall administrator to open any ports that are required by the CORBA interface, including the probes port which is set using ORBLocalPort. 

 

Set ORBLocalHostName to the correct value, and check that the probe works as expected.
