QUESTION
 Can't find the IIS agent on Passport Advantage (external) or eXtreme Leverage (internal). What is the new part number for this product? 

ANSWER
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Agent was previously shipped as part of ITCAM for Web Resources and has a 2 byte code of ht. This is part of ITM for Microsoft Applications 6.1.1 and 6.1.2. For the ITM for Microsoft Applications 6.2 release and later, development has passed this code to a team that supports the ITCAM for Microsoft Applications bundle. The new 2 byte code for the IIS agent is q7.
ITM for MS Applications v6.2.0, ITCAM for WR is no longer bundled. A new IIS agent was developed and shipped solely with ITM for MS Application. Use the product 'ITM for MS Application' to get this new agent. The new (internal) component id is 5724B97IS 620.
