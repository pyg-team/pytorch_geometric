Title: IBM Scheduler service running during a simulated failover - United States

Text:
scheduler service cad client acceptor cluster node environment failover TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the scheduler service not stop when the cad stops? 

CAUSE
This behavior is working as designed. The client acceptor (cad) service is responsible for starting the scheduler service, not stopping it. After the cad starts the scheduler service, the cad can be stopped and the scheduler service will remain running until it completes or is interrupted. 

ANSWER
Cluster Environment: 

Simulating a cluster failover (using Cluster Administrator or Failover Cluster Manager) may not accurately simulate the same behavior seen with a real failover. This can occur when using the cad managed scheduler with the Tivoli Storage Manager Backup/Archive (BA) client in a cluster environment. 

In this setup, the cad is defined as the generic service in the Cluster Administrator (Windows 2003) or Failover Cluster Manger (Windows 2008). When using this application to simulate a failover from node A to node B, the application will stop the generic service (cad service) on node A and start it on node B. Because the scheduler service is not known to the application, it is never stopped nor started by the application. 

As a result, if the simulated failover occurs during a scheduled BA client backup, the following will occur: 

 * the cad service will stop on node A 
 * the cluster volumes will fail over to node B 
 * the scheduler service will remain running on node A 
 * the schedule will run to completion on node A 
 * the cad service will start on node B, but the scheduler service will not start to continue the backup as expected by the user


In the event of a real failover (system down), during a scheduled BA client backup, the following will occur:  * the cad and scheduler services will terminate on node A 
 * the backup will stop on node A 
 * the cluster volumes will fail over to node B 
 * the cad service will start on node B 
 * if the time is within the scheduleâ€™s duration window:  * the scheduler service will start on node B 
    * the backup will continue on node B
