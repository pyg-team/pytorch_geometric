APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer Issue:
   1. Install SR3 of IBM<R> Rational<R> TeamUnifyingPlatform<R>
   (via cd as a desktop image) on a Windows 2003 Server platform
   2. Apply SR4 patch (locally on machine)
   3. After applying the SR4 patch, the customer noticed that
   IBM<R> Rational<R> RUP Builder<R> was no longer available via
   Start > Program Files > Rational.  RUP Builder was available
   after the initial SR3 installation.
   4. Customer then went to Add/Remove Programs to modify their
   current installation of TeamUnifyingPlatform.
   5. Selected RUP Builder install component(s) and clicked on the
   Install button.
   Customer received the error message:  "The install has detected
   an existing version of            Rational ClearQuest Web
   (v.2003.06.12 or prior) on this host.  Installing this product
   on a host with an existing version of ClearQuest Web is not
   supported.  Uninstall the existing version before installing
   this version of the product"
   6. When trying to remove the web components mentioned in the
   error message, customer receives the same exact error message
   7. Ultimate issue:  Install is detecting CQWeb components that
   were never installed initially during the SR3 installation.  Now
   customer cannot add or remove ANY TUP components via the
   Add/Remove Windows application.
   
   
   Support's Reproduction:
   1. Created a VM image with Windows 2003 Server OS
   2. Install Team Unifying Platform v.2003.06.13 via desktop
   install
   3. Apply SR4 patch to VM image installation
   4. Go to Add/Remove Programs to modify the install to remove or
   add additional installation components
   5. Receive same error as the customer
   
   Item to note:  When installing v.2003.06.13 of TUP during our
   reproduction attempt, the "old" CQWeb Components were not an
   available option (not even listed).  After successfully
   installing that version and then applying the SR4 patch, when we
   went to Add/Remove programs to modify our install, the "Old"
   CQWeb component was now an available option to select.  Why
   would it not be available when installing SR3, but then is
   available after applying the SR4 patch?  This may be the root
   cause of the error/issue since it is that exact component that
   is mentioned in the Error message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Possible work-around is to create a release area for 2003.06.13,
   then patch that release area with the SR4 patch.  Then to
   install product from the release area.  Work-around is in the
   process of being implemented by customer, and has not been
   proven to resolve the issue as of yet.  If work-around does not
   resolve the issue, customer requests a Hotfix.  Customer can not
   wait for the next release for resolution as their production
   environment is down due to this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable to add/remove components due to CQWeb upgrade error
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem only occurs in version 2003.06.13, not later
   versions.
