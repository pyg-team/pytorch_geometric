PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you access a coach through the Process Portal, it results in an JspTranslation exception. However, the error stack does not provide a cause. 

SYMPTOM
When you access a coach of a deployed process application from the Process Portal, you receive the following error message in your browser and the SystemOut.log file:

00000435 webapp E 
com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: 
[Servlet Error]-[/html/coaches/CoachDesigner.jsp]: 
com.ibm.ws.jsp.translator.JspTranslationException: JSPG0227E: Exception

CAUSE
The root cause of this issue is most likely a corrupt compiled JavaServerâ„¢ Pages (JSP) file in the application server.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review your SystemOut.log file and see whether the error stack provides a cause. To gain more insight on what is happening during the compilation, you can run the JSPBatchCompiler, which is described in the MustGather: JavaServer Pages (JSP) problems [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21255205] document.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, clear all of the compiled JSP files in the temp directories of your application server (WebSphere_Application_Server_install_root/temp and WebSphere_Application_Server_profile_root/temp). For more information, see the InvocationTargetException when rendering a JSP [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21388377] document.




Note: The WebSphere_Application_Server_install_rootand WebSphere_Application_Server_profile_root variables are specific to your environment. 


These changes cause the JSP to be rendered again and the problem should be resolved.
