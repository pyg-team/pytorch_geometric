ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Values from the 'Select value' dialog in a filter expression or
   data item expression are not inserted at the cursors location.
   This happens when the expression has more than one line. This is
   reproducible in Internet Explorer, but not Mozilla Firefox.

COMMENTS
 *  This behavior has been changed in Cognos Anaytics 11.
   To reproduce the issue, the cursor is placed between two
   "carriage return/line feed' pairs.  The problem with the
   implementation provided by IE is that trailing "carriage
   return/line feeds" are removed by the range object.  Because of
   this, the information required to properly position the inserted
   data is not available.  In IE "Standards mode" there is another
   way to get the data (textArea selectionStart and selectionEnd).
   Cognos Analytics use IE Standards mode. We have no plans on
   using standards mode for releases prior to CA11.
