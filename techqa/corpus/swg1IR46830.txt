ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer need to upgrade from 3.2 TO 3.2.1 IBM SECURWAY
   dir. When installing error code:
   "An error occured during the move data process -113,
   missing file: LAP/JRE HOME/BIN/JAVAKEY.EXE.
   Setup package is not complete".
   .
   OS is Win NT 4.0
   .
   Customer says that the upgrade from 3.2 to 3.2.1 on AIX
   and SOLARIS have been done with no problems.
   It is only on Win NT the problem appear.
   .
   Here are the exact steps the customer is taking to migrate to
   3.2.1:
   The steps taken to migrate 3.2 to 3.2.1:
   .
   The setup files are downloaded from:
   http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/secureway/priv/ldap32-ftpww?win [http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/secureway/priv/ldap32-ftpww?win]
   t32/128b
   it/ldap321win.zip
   .
   The zip file is then extrected to d:\ldap_patch
   I then stop the IBM SecureWay V3.2 service togehter with all
   Policy
   Director services (The only system that uses LDAP).
   When al the services has stoped d:\ldap_patch\setup.exe is
   started.
   I select English as instalation language.
   I am then told that "A previous version of the IBM SecureWay
   Directory
   and Client SDK has been found on this system.  Do you wish to
   continue?"
   I answer Yes.
   I am then asked "Do you waint to migrate your current
   configuration
   information to your new installation? Select Yes to migrate or
   No to
   create new configuration"
   I select Yes
   I am then presented with the License agreement
   And I press accept.
   The screen with the current settings are then shown.  It tells
   me that
   "You have chosen to migrate to version 3.2
   D:\Program_Files\IBM\LDAP
   .
   Target Folder
   IBM SecureWay Directory"
   I press Next
   I then get the error message that I have reported earlier:
   "An error occurred during the move data process: -113
   .
   Component: SilentInstall
   File Group: LAPFiles
   File: D:\ldap_patch\ldap\JRE_Home\bin\javakey.exe"
   .
   Pressing OK only sends me to the Setup Complete window which as
   me if I
   want to restart or not.
   .
   Customer do not have any other problems apart from LDAP not
   being upgraded he says.
   .
   The javakey.exe file does not exist in the installation.
   Customer have tried to copy this file from a different
   instalation, but then he get the same message for
   another file which he is not able to find any where
   else.
   Customer has verified that all LDAP services are stopped.
   .

   .
   OK, after building a new NT system and installing swd3.2, I was
   able to
   recreate the same exact problem and errors the customer
   received.  The
   only service I stopped was the LDAP service.
   .
   I am now going to also stop the DB2 services just to see if it
   makes any
   difference, I doubt it, but will still try.
   .

   What I tried did not work.  The problem is as follows:
   During the installation a file called javakey.exe is supposed t
   be
   copied over, but it does not exist were is should nor exist in
   the
   previous version of SWD3.2, thus the error and aborted upgrade.
   .
   PLEASE open an apar with a clear description regarding this
   problem.
   Thanks.....
