Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Tivoli Workload Scheduler CPU utilization (CVE-2014-0963 and others) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Tivoli Workload Scheduler is affected by a problem related to the SSL implementation which, under very specific conditions, can cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0963 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]
DESCRIPTION: 
Tivoli Workload Scheduler is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the Tivoli Workload Scheduler and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex. 

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for Tivoli Workload Scheduler instances. 

Tivoli Workload Scheduler is potentially affected only if when GSKit component is used for secure communication between internal processes.
For Tivoli Workload Scheduler Distributed, TWS nodes are impacted by the vulnerability only if the TWS workstation has been defined with “securitylevel” set to on or enabled or force and GSKit has been explicitly enabled. GSKit has been enabled if the following has been specified in localopts file:
ssl fips enabled = "yes"

If GSKit has been enabled, the security exposure applies to the programs and libraries installed under <TWS home>/bin. 

Furthermore the vulnerability applies to Dynamic Agents or zCentric agents too: GSKit utilization is enabled on Dynamic Agents and zCentric agents if ssl_port is set to a non 0 value in ita.ini configuration file.
Note that this is the default configuration for Dynamic Agents, while it is necessary to explicitly configure secure connection for zCentric agents (the default is not secure connection).
For Dynamic agents and zCentric agents the vulnerability applies to <TWS home>/bin/JobManager and <TWS home>/ITA/bin/agent programs.

Note that TWS is a backoffice application that usually runs over a protected infrastructure where connections with outside networks is forbidden. Connection with branch offices where TWS agents run are always implemented through VPNs. For this reason SSL is not often used to interconnect TWS nodes. Customers with high security demands activate SSL, but they never let TWS nodes to communicate over unsecured networks. 
Saying that, the probability of having attacks is very limited, moreover the majority of the exposures belong to the "denial of service" category. This in the worst case, will lead to the temporary unavailability of the attacked TWS nodes.

CVE ID: CVE-2013-6747 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]

DESCRIPTION: 
Tivoli Workload Scheduler is affected by a problem when a certificate chain presented by a Client or Server could contain a circular reference that will cause the chain building logic to loop which can lead to a segv crash or hang due to memory exhaustion leading to a denial of service.

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]

DESCRIPTION: 
Tivoli Workload Scheduler is potentially affected by a problem about certain kinds of binary type Elliptic Curves used in Digital signatures during signing operations. Although TWS through GSKit component only generates Prime type Elliptic Curves, externally generated keys may be imported in GSKit. 
This vulnerability potentially affects only Dynamic Agents or zCentric agents.
