ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer would like option to setup DWA users to have as default
   plain text
   editor and to send plain text as default and to also have the
   option of
   reverting to HTMP format. The out of the box settings set HTML
   for editor and
   sending mail.
   
   How to reproduce:
   1. Simply install a 6.5.1 Domino server and create a DWA
   user.
   2. Create a new memo. This memo is being edited in HTML and is
   going to be send
   in HTML format.
   
   There is a setting in the Server Configuration document on the
   Domino Web Acces
   tab under the Mail heading which affects this issue. This is as
   follows.
   "When sending mail, set format to:"
   Within this option, you can choose "Plain Text" or "Let User
   Decide".
   Plain Text - When you select this, every DWA user has no option
   but to edit and
   send mail as plain text.
   Let User Decide - When this option is selected, the user has the
   option of
   changing from HTML to plain text in his / hes DWA user
   preferences. The issue
   is lying here where this option defaults to HTML and has no
   option o default to
   Plain Text.
   
   The customer would like an additional setting to appear below
   the setting "When
   sending mail, set format to:" when the option "Let User Decide"
   is selected.
   This additional setting would be something similar to the
   following.
   "Set default format to:" and within this setting you caould have
   the options
   "Plain Text" and "HTML". (As per the options that are available
   in the DWA user
   preferences.)
   
   
   
   
   Hi Shan,
   
   In relation to this enhancement request, I have noticed that the
   status is set
   to Resolved / Not A Bug.
   
   I do not feel this is an appropriate result for this. I do not
   think by adding
   this additional setting is duplicating anything. The following
   should be the
   options you should have.
   
   Option 1
   
   "When sending mail, set format to:" set to "Plain Text". - Here,
   the user has
   no option but to use plain text as their editor.
   
   Option 2
   
   "When sending mail, set format to:" set to "Let User Decide". -
   Here the users
   text editor is defaulted to HTML as there is no option to
   select the default
   editor. The user has the option of changing this in his/her
   Preferences to
   plain text.
   
   Additional Option 3
   
   "When sending mail, set format to:" set to "Let User Decide". -
   The
   administrator should also be able to set the default editor to
   plain text here.
   When this is the case, the user still has the option of changing
   to HTML.
   
   As stated above, I do not feel there is duplication of functions
   here.
   
   The administrator should have the above as options to select to
   ensure he has
   control over his users.
   
   Please reply with any comments you have on this issue and, if
   possible, change
   the status of the SPR and investigate further.
   
   Thank you for your time.

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround would be to open every users Domino Web Access and
   carry out the
   following steps.
   1. Open the users Domino Web Access user Preferences.
   2. On the Mail tab under the Sending header, select Plain Text
   as the default
   Editor.
   
   This would resolve the issue but this would have to be carried
   out on every
   users Domino Web Access mail preferences.
