PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/etc/fit/fit.[sh | bat] script provided with Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.1 feature pack does not produce any output when the "showReport true" arguments are passed. 

CAUSE
The "showReport" option was added as an enhancement to later TIP 2.2 fix packs after TIP 2.2.0.1 feature pack was released.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The "fit.sh -showReport true" command is not required, but can be useful to test if the installed applications in the target TIP instance are "certified" with TIP 2.2.0.1 in advance of attempting the installation. If desired, the fit.sh or fit.bat (Windows) script can be taken from a newer TIP 2.2 fix pack FIT package. For example, download the FIT package for TIP 2.2 fix pack 7. Unpack the package in a temporary location, and then copy the fit.sh or fit.bat script from the package to <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/etc/fit
Retry the "fit.sh -showReport true" command
