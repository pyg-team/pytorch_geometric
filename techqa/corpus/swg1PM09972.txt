ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   - Operating System:
   
   Windows XP
    - Product name:
   Rational Application developer v. 7.5.5
   
   Description of problem:
   
   When generating EJB 2.1 Entity beans from tables in Database DB2
    for z/OS and V8 (compatibility mode)
   the columns and primary keys present in the tables are not gener
   ated in the EJB Map file and
   will produce incomplete java code that does not compile.
   
   Step to reproduce:
   
       - Create a New Physical Data model for Database DB2 for z/OS
    and V8 (compatibility mode)
       - Add a table with PK and 1 field
       - In the JavaEE view , from the Data model make a right clic
   k and make 'Create EJB from Tables (1.x,2.x)'
       - Create new project with EJB module version 2.1
   
       - The code is generated but in Enterprise there is no column
   s columns 1 and 2
       - There is no mapping between the database table and the Ent
   erprise table generated
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Data model format has added a new column type
   zSeries:ZSeriesColumn for DB2 on zSeries.  The bottom-up
   mapping support does not understand this column type and
   fails with mapping the table columns.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  EJB Mapping now recognizes the new data model type
   zSeries:ZSeriesColumn and can create mapping accordingly.
