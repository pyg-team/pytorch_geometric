Text:
CVE-2014-0227 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Apache Tomcat application server in installations of IBM Rational DOORS Web Access version contains security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Some versions of Rational DOORS Web Access are shipped with an Apache Tomcat application server that contains security vulnerabilities. Apache Tomcat has been updated to incorporate fixes for these vulnerabilities. 

Rational DOORS Web Access is affected by the following vulnerabilities:
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0227 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227]
Description: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted request in a malformed chunked header to the Web server to cause multiple processing conflicts on the servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100751 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100751] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

 

 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7810 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7810]
Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the use of expression language. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the protections of a Security Manager.
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103155 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103155] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0230 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0230]
Description: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing limitations on request body size. By sending a specially crafted request to the server, an attacker could keep a connection open and force Tomcat to keep a processing thread allocated to the connection.
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102131 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102131] for the current score

After you obtain the Apache Tomcat update from Support do these steps:


Procedure: 

 

 1. Go to the Rational DOORS Web Access installation directory. 
    
    For example:
    C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\DOORS Web Access\9.version
    
    
 2. Rename the server directory to server.orig.
    
    
 3. Extract the Apache Tomcat server archive that was supplied by Support to ./server in the Rational DOORS Web Access installation directory.
    
    
 4. Copy your ./server.orig/festival directory to ./server/festival.
    
    
 5. Copy the ./server.orig/conf/server.xml file to ./server/conf/server.xml.
    
    
 6. Copy ./server.orig/webapps/*.war to ./server/webapps.
    
    
 7. Optional: Copy any customized files from the ./server.orig directory to ./server.
    
    
 8. UNIX systems only: Run the ./configure-festival.sh command, as described in the help topic Installing the web access server and the web access broker on Linux or Solaris systems [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYQBZ_9.6.0/com.ibm.rational.dwa.install.doc/topics/t_instdwasandbunix.html].
