Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808] 

DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack". 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
To avoid the attack described without applying the fixes above, please apply the following configuration changes to disable RC4 stream cipher.


For IBM FileNet System Monitor v4.5.0 and IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.1.0: 

 1. Edit the files <InstallationDirectory>/gui/cfg/gui-cfg.xml and <InstallationDirectory>/server/cfg/server-start.xml on the FSM / ECM-SM server and add the following line to the file right after the entry <arg value="-Djava.awt.headless=true"/>)
    <arg value="-Dhttps.cipherSuites=SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA, SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA"/> 
 2. Edit the file <InstallationDirectory>/cala_rex/cala_rex_srv.cfg on FSM / ECM-SM server and add the following line to the file rght after the entry <property name="usessl" value="true"/>:
    <property name="ssl.cipherlist" value="ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:!RC4:@STRENGTH"/>

 

For IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.2.0: 

 1. Edit the file <InstallationDirectory>/jre/lib/security/java.security on each ECM-SM server and add the following line to the file
    jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4 
 2. Edit the file <InstallationDirectory>/cala_rex/cfg/cala_rex_srv.cfg on the Primary / complete-installation ECM-SM server and add the following line to the file right after the entry <property name="usessl" value="true"/>:
    <property name="ssl.cipherlist" value="ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:!RC4:@STRENGTH"/>


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
