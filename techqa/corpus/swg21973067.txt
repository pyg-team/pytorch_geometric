PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 "ERROR: Could not find a supported version of WTX" message when installing Standards Processing Engine (SPE) 8.5.1.1 version with WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) 8.4.1.3 version. 

SYMPTOM
"ERROR: Could not find a supported version of WTX" message when installing SPE 8.5.1.1 with WTX 8.4.1.3.


CAUSE
SPE 8.5.1.1/2.0.1.1 was released before WTX 8.4.1.3, so the SPE installer does not recognize WTX 8.4.1.3 as a supported version. The combination has been tested together and is supported, and thus requires a work around for the installation process.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Confirm that WTX 8.4.1.3 version has been installed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For Windows platforms:
Install SPE 8.5.1.1 before installing WTX 8.4.1.3.
Install WTX 8.4.1.3
Manually configure both SPE and WTX 8.4.1.3 to recognize the install location of the other product.

For UNIX platforms:
WTX 8.4.1.3 can be installed either before or after SPE 8.5.1.1
However, do not specify the WTX directory option when you install SPE 8.5.1.1
Manually configure both SPE and WTX 8.4.1.3 to recognize the install location of the other product.

Manual configuration instructions:
1. To configure WTX, edit the WebSphere Transformation Extender dtx.ini file by appending the following lines:

[SPE]
SPE_INSTALL_DIR=C:/IBM/Standards Processing Engine <version>

2. To configure SPE, edit or create the spewtx64env and/or spewtxenv scripts in the <SPE install dir>/bin directory. Change this line to set DTXHOME to the WTX install directory:

%INSTALLREPLACEMENTSTRING%

For Windows, the spewtxenv.bat script should specify the 32-bit WTX installation (if installed), and the spewtx64env.bat script should specify the 64-bit WTX installation (if installed).

The spewtxenv.bat script is always created as part of the SPE install. If you install a 32-bit WTX version after installing SPE, you would need to update the %INSTALLREPLACEMENTSTRING% line to set the DTXHOME environment variable. For example, in spewtxenv.bat script the new line might look like this:

set DTXHOME=C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.4.1 32bit

The spewtx64env.bat script is only created during the SPE install if a 64-bit WTX version is present at that time. If you install a 64-bit WTX version after installing SPE, you would need to create an spewtx64env.bat file by copying the existing spewtxenv.bat file. Then update the %INSTALLREPLACEMENTSTRING% line (or DTXHOME line, if it was set for a 32-bit WTX install) to set the DTXHOME environment variable to the 64-bit WTX directory. For example, in spewtx64env.bat script the new line might look like this:

set DTXHOME=C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.4.1 64bit

For UNIX / Linux platforms, SPE does not use a separate spewtx64env script. The spewtxenv.sh script should specify the WTX installation. For example, in spewtxenv.sh script the new line might look like this:

DTXHOME="/opt/ibm/wtx"; export DTXHOME
