APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Rational Developer for System z enhancement to allow a
   client to connect to multiple instances of a SCM using a single
   host connection.
   This enhancement requires a matching update on the client.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  workaround: create a connection per SCM, withc matching CARMA
   setup.

   01.RDz users want to be able to connect to different CA Endevor
      repository instances from the same RSE connection.
   02.In some cases an 0C4 abend may happen during internal
      special list processing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  01.RDz has been enhanced to allow the users to connect to
      different CA Endevor repository instances from the same RSE
      connection without having to have a separate RSE connection
      for each CA Endevor instance.
   02.The allocation for the return parameters must match the
      expected return parameters in the RAM definitions. The RAM
      code has been changed to ensure that the proper storage is
      allocated for the number of return parameters specified in
      the RAM definitions.
