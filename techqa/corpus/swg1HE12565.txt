APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When editing the subject line for a Change Notice on a hold
   notice, it seems as if we are unable to fit all of the
   information we need in a subject line.
   In the database table legalnotice the change notice subject
   column (NoticeSubjectAsSent)  is storing the change notice
   subject which is defined in the database of type VARCHAR(2000
   Bytes) but the Atlas UI is not allowing more than this number
   of characters.
