ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   
   After upgrading the TEPS from 6.22.01.00 to 6.22.02.00 on
   Linux or Unix, the TEP browser client fails with this
   message:
   
      The Tivoli Enterprise Portal client and server versions
      are not compatible. Please report the problem to your
      system administrator.
   
   Digging further, the version information in applet.html is not
   updated correctly. For example:
   
      Archive           6.22.01.00   6.22.02.00
      ----------------- ------------ ------------
      kjrall.jar        7.622.9313.a 7.622.0126.a
      ae.jar            7.622.9313.a 7.622.0126.a
      cnp.jar           7.622.9313.a 7.622.0126.a
      kdy_resources.jar 7.622.9313.a 7.622.0126.a
      kr2_resources.jar 9.2.9.4      0.0.8.4
      kr3_resources.jar 9.2.9.4      0.0.8.4
      kr4_resources.jar 9.2.9.4      0.0.8.4
      kr5_resources.jar 9.2.9.4      0.0.8.4
      kr6_resources.jar 9.2.9.4      0.0.8.4
   
   After the upgrade to 6.22.02.00, applet.html reflects
   the 6.22.01.00 versions for these files. If the version
   information is patched, the error goes away. However,
   the client does not know to download the newer code
   because the version appears to be older.
   
   In the case of the Agentless Monitors (kr*_resources.jar),
   the version number is solely the Julian date of when it
   was built. So, there is an exposure that two different
   levels of code could be assigned the same version number,
   even across ITM release boundaries.
   
   Finally, this problem also exists in ITM 621, particularly
   in any upgrade to 6.21.02.00.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   1. Install TEPS 6.22.01.00.
   2. Install TEP Browser Client support 6.22.01.00
      Agentless Monitoring for one or more operating
      systems.
   3. Configure everything installed.
   4. Start TEP browser client.
   5. Upgrade TEPS to 6.22.02.00.
   6. Upgrade Agentless Monitoring to 6.22.02.00.
   7. Configure everything updated.
   8. Start TEP browser client.
   
   At this point, the client fails with the message
   reported above in the problem description.
   
   Use the following command to look at the version
   information in applet.html:
   
   grep ^optimize <CANDLEHOME>/<arch>/cw/applet.html

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a temporary workaround to the TEP error, manually
   change the version numbers in applet.html to reflect
   the older version numbers from 6.22.02.00.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Tivoli Monitoring JAR files are not downloaded to the
   browser portal client due to JAR version differences before and
   after the year 2010. The user does not get the expected updated
   JARs and the update function.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed the version browser portal client to ensure any new jar
   files are always higher than the previous versions.
   
   After applying IBM Tivoli Monitoring 621 Fix pack 3, you can
   validate your portal browser client is at the correct fix pack
   and maintenance level.
   
   1.Start the Tivoli Enterprise Portal browser client.
   
   2. From the tool bar in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal select
   Help---->About
   
   3. A splash screen should appear after executing step 2. On the
   bottom left corner of the splash screen it should read the
   following.
   
           DE Version CJ062103_TMS621MDV
           Build 0175a
   
   Note: If the version and build level do not match the versions
   above, the browser has failed to download the proper code from
   the portal server. You may try the following steps:
   
   a. Clear the browser cache
   b. Reconnect the portal browser client
   c. Run through the same steps above to validate the version and
   maintenance level
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle:
       | fix pack | 6.2.1-TIV-ITM-FP0003
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Clear the Java JAR cache on the end user desktop to ensure the
   newer JARs are downloaded to the end user desktop.
