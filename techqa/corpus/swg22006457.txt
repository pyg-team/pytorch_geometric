Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Development Package for Apache Spark is affected by an Eclipse Jetty vulnerability - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Development Package for Apache Spark addresses the following vulnerability by updating the affected component.

The primary role of Jetty within Apache Spark is to provide the Web UI via http, or optionally via https. This https communication channel is encrypted using a server-side keystore, which should be protected with a password. The Jetty vulnerability is an algorithm that exposes a tractable brute force attack against this password. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-9735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9735]
DESCRIPTION: Jetty could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a timing channel flaw in util/security/Password.java. By observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain access information.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127842 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127842] for the current score
