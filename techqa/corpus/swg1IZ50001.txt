ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITM VIOS agent manual needs clarification on installation
   and upgrade instructions
   
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring: VIOS Premium Agent
   User's Guide
   Version 6.2.0
   SA23-2238-01
   ***
   Requirements and agent-specific installation and configuration
    information for the monitoring agent
   This chapter contains information about the requirements for
    the IBM Tivoli Monitoring: VIOS Premium Agent, and agent-
    specific information related to installation and configuration
    of the agent.
   
   To install and configure the IBM Tivoli Monitoring:
    VIOS Premium Agent, use the procedures for installing
    monitoring agents in the IBM&#65449; Tivoli&#65449; Monitoring Installation
    and Setup Guide along with the information in this chapter.
   
   If you are performing a silent installation using a response
    file, see the information about performing a silent
   installation
    in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide.
   ***
   The VIOS agent comes pre-installed on VIOS LPAR.  Referencing
    customers to the generic procedures for installing agents in
    the Installation and Setup Guide is misleading, and should be
    removed from the VIOS agent manual.

   Requirements and agent-specific installation and configuration
    information for the monitoring agent
   This chapter contains information about the requirements for
    the IBM Tivoli Monitoring: VIOS Premium Agent, and agent-
    specific information related to installation and configuration
    of the agent.
   
   To install and configure the IBM Tivoli Monitoring:
   
   The VIOS Premium Agent is preinstalled on a VIOS system and no
    installation is required.
   
   The ITM Unix OS and HMC agents are not supported in a VIOS
    environment.
   Remote deployment to install or update an ITM agent relies on
   the
    target system supporting the OS agent, and for the OS agent to
   be
    installed and running.  Since VIOS does not support the Unix OS
    agent, updating a VIOS agent must be done manually by logging
    into the VIOS lpar locally.
   
   Updating the ITM VIOS agent can be done without updating VIOS
    itself.
   >>>
   The above will clarify that customers can not use
    "tacmd updateAgent" to try and remotely upgrade a VIOS agent.
   This will also clarify that the Unix OS agent and HMC agents are
    not supported on the VIOS system.
