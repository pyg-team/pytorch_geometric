APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To proceed transaction request (for T5/T6 agents), APMUI has
   special logic to handle transaction groupwidget, and convert
   them to CURI request to ITM data provider; If there is "SCOPE"
   defined with "count" or "sort" filters, it converts "SCOPE"
   as parameter in CURI request, and proceed "count"/"sort"
   filters in APMUI server side; But in Itm 630, "SCOPE" parameter
   usage is removed, and instead there must be a condition clause
   to process this agent filter.
   
   APMUI server must adjust the logic to pick up this change for
   ITM 630.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1) prepare for ITM 630 environment with transaction (T5/T6),
   and generate enough transaction records;
   2) From APMUI, create dashboard with application from AMC
   3) check transaction from APMUI dashboard to see if all records
   are accurately present.
   
   
   
   Actually there are two problems in this APAR"
   
   1) described as above that APMUI need to change logic to handle
   REST API change in ITM 630. APMUI has done the change, and temp
   fix has been forwarded to customer.
   
   2) T6 agent/TEMA need to handle problem of param_Limit
   condition from agent side.
   
   For 2), suggest L2 to forward this APAR to TEAM team, or open an
   new APAR for them.
   
   L2 will reroute this APAR to the correct 770 version
   and create new APAR for TEMA team if required
