APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Worklight/MFP Foundation does not provide a frame-breaking
   technique. Since this is relevant for the resource downloading
   requests which are not protected by the application security,
   it's also impossible to implement it as a custom realm.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * MobileFirst Platform users, who have web application.        *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * MobileFirst Studio provides mechanisms by which you can      *
   * control the value of the X-Frame-Options HTTP header for     *
   * Desktop Browser and Mobile Web environments.                 *
   *                                                              *
   * X-Frame-Options                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header is used to          *
   * determine whether or not a browser is allowed to render a    *
   * page in a <frame>, <iframe> or <object> element. Web         *
   * applications can use this header to avoid clickjacking       *
   * attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into *
   * other sites. Setting the X-Frame-Options parameter in the    *
   * environment's application-descriptor.xml will add the        *
   * X-Frame-Options header with the selected value to every init *
   * response.                                                    *
   *                                                              *
   * There are three possible values for MobileFirst Platform     *
   * X-Frame-Options :                                            *
   * no-use:                                                      *
   *     This is the default value. The header X-Frame-Options is *
   * not included in the server init HTTP response. The page can  *
   * be displayed in a frame from any location.                   *
   *                                                              *
   * DENY:                                                        *
   *     The page cannot be displayed in another element,         *
   * regardless of the site attempting to do so.                  *
   *                                                              *
   * SAMEORIGIN:                                                  *
   *     The page can only be displayed in another element on the *
   * same origin as the page itself.                              *
