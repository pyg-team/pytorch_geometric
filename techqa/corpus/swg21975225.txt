CVEID: CVE-2015-7941 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7941]
DESCRIPTION: Libxml2 is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlParseEntityDecl or xmlParseConditionalSections function. By using specially-crafted XML data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause the system to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
