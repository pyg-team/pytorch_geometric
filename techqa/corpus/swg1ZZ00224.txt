APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Whenever the pattern contains the 'Deployment Manager' part, it
   will fail to identify any vmNIC association.
   
   Other parts of the pattern may fail as well.
   
   Code changes required in the toolkit implementations:-
   - configure selected pattern
   - customize pattern
   
   
   Code change snip:
     p.memberCount = "" + part["count"];
       if (part["count"] == null) {
           p.memberCount = "1";
           log.info(activity + " fix part memberCount = " +
   p.memberCount);
       }
   
   
   After this it may become necessary to bypass certain parts of
   the pattern so that these more complex sections do not
   interefere with deployment.  To bypass the parameters for the
   WAS feature list, edit the WAS Parts in the vSys Pattern, and
   'lock' the feature selection.  This will cause the property to
   no longer be exposed in the self-service offering.  The part
   will now successfully deploy.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none, code fix required.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.3 deploying complex
   pattern using self service offering "Deploy Single System".
   
   
   
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Some pattern parts do not have a count property. If this is
   the case deployment will not assign a network interface and
   the deployment will fail.
   
   
   
   
   **************************************************1*************
   *
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   Apply SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.3 Fixpack 1 when available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   Complex pattern might lack of a count property since this part
   is some kind of a singleton from viewpoint of the instance.
   In some cases the count property is not set properly.
   The toolkit offering processing relays on a count property while
   processing. The corrected algorithm makes sure that an internal
   count property is set.
