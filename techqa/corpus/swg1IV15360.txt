ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using TEM TRC 82.044 (but problem exist also in TRC
   512
   Issue reproduction steps:
   1. Logon to TEM for Remote Control Console -> Targets -> Search
   2. Enter "Roy" in "Search Targets" box (see 1.jpg)
   3. Press "Submit" button, 23 records returned (see 2.jpg)
   4. Click "Show SQL":
   SQL for Current Report
   SQL for Current Report
   SELECT DISTINCT A.HWKEY , A.MANUFACTURER , A.MODEL , A.SERIAL_NO
   ,
   A.COMPUTERNAME , B.IP_ADDRESSES , B.LAST_UPDATE , B.LOGGED_USER
   FROM ASSET.ASSET A LEFT OUTER JOIN ASSET.LIVEPOINTS B ON A.HWKEY
   =
   B.HWKEY
   WHERE UPPER (A.MANUFACTURER) LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER (A.MODEL)
   LIKE
   '%ROY%' OR UPPER (A.SERIAL_NO) LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER
   (B.LOGGED_USER) LIKE '%ROY%'
   ORDER BY A.HWKEY
   .
   5. Based on the 23 returned records, click "LENOVO" under
   "Manufacturer"
      column (see 3.jpg)
   6. Then, search result is shown as 4.jpg.  "Limited by
   MANUFACTURER =
      LENOVO" is shown clearly on top of it.
   7. Note that there is an unexpected record which Hardware Key is
   10067,
      i.e. it's MANUFACTURER is NOT "LENOVO", it is
   "Hewlett-Packard".
   8. Click "Show SQL":
   .
   SQL for Current Report
   SELECT DISTINCT A.HWKEY , A.MANUFACTURER , A.MODEL , A.SERIAL_NO
   ,
   A.COMPUTERNAME , B.IP_ADDRESSES , B.LAST_UPDATE , B.LOGGED_USER
   FROM ASSET.ASSET A LEFT OUTER JOIN ASSET.LIVEPOINTS B ON A.HWKEY
   B.HWKEY
   WHERE UPPER (A.MANUFACTURER) LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER (A.MODEL)
   LIKE
   '%ROY%' OR UPPER (A.SERIAL_NO) LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER
   (A.COMPUTERNAME)
   LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER (B.IP_ADDRESSES) LIKE '%ROY%' OR UPPER
   (B.LOGGED_USER) LIKE '%ROY%' AND A.MANUFACTURER = 'LENOVO'
   ORDER BY A.HWKEY
   9. According to SQL, we found that the filtering condition "AND
      A.MANUFACTURER = 'LENOVO'" is just added to the end without
   any
      bracketing on the conditions prior to it.
      i.e. bracketing should be added as: ...... WHERE ( UPPER
      (A.MANUFACTURER) LIKE '%ROY%' OR ...... ) AND A.MANUFACTURER
   =
      'LENOVO'. That's why we got the wrong search result
   .

   Problem Description
   
   After doing a search for targets, target groups, users or
   sessions, the TRC server displays a new report with the results
   of the search. Elsewhere in the server, when a report is
   displayed, it is possibl to click on a column value and the
   report will be filtered to display only the items where that
   column contains the selected value. However, there is an problem
   with the search results report that causes this filtering to
   fail.
   Problem Summary
   
   After doing a search for targets, target groups, users or
   sessions, it is not possible to filter the returned results by
   clicking on the column value, as with any other report.
