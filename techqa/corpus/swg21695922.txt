Text:
CPIT installation linux missing files TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running the IBM FileNet P8 Composite Platform Installation Tool (CPIT) installation binaries on a Red Hat Linux OS from a command shell, an error occurs indicating that the Graphical Installer User Interface Mode is not supported. As a result, the CPIT installation GUI does not open on the screen. 

SYMPTOM
The following appears when trying to run the installer: 

:
Installer User Interface Mode Not Supported 

The installer cannot run in this UI mode. To specify the interface mode, use the -i command-line option, followed by the UI mode identifier. The valid UI modes identifiers are GUI, console, and Silent.


CAUSE
 

The following files are missing from the server:
libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 
libpk-gtk-module.so 
libcanberra-gtk-module.so 
gtk2-engines.i686
ksh
pam.i686


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run the following commands to install the missing files:


 * ./yum install libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 libpk-gtk-module.so libcanberra-gtk-module.so gtk2-engines.i686 
 * ./yum install ksh 
 * ./yum install pam.i686


Then run the CPIT installation from the folder where it is located, e.g. sh 5.2.1-ICF-CPIT-LINUX.BIN
