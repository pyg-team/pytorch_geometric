APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The managed .NET client documentation did not clarify how an
   application-supplied cipherSpec is used to influence the secure
   connection parameters chosen by the managed .NET environment.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   User of MQ .NET application in managed mode connecting to an
   SSL/TLS enabled SVRCONN channel
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The TLS protocol version which the managed .NET environment uses
   for the TLS handshake with the queue manager is derived from the
   cipherSpec value that the application supplies on the MQCONNX
   call.
   
   If the CipherSpec value supplied by the application is not a
   cipherSpec known to MQ, then the MQ managed .NET client
   disregards it and will negotiate the connection based on the
   Microsoft Windows system's group policy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CipherSpec set should be one of the CipherSpecs of the
   supported SSLProtocol version and it can preferably be the same
   as the one specified in the Windows group policy.
   
   The set of supported SSLProtocol versions is dependent on the
   .NET framework version in use.
   
   The IBM MQ Knowledge Center has been updated with additional
   information on how the cipherSpec value supplied by the .NET
   application influences the connection parameters.
