   ****************************************************************
   zSecure Admin/Audit for RACF has the following issues regarding
   profiles with custom data segments:
   - zSecure Admin incorrectly formats custom data segment field
     values for the generated RACF commands. The values are either
     not properly enclosed in quotes or incorrectly enclosed in
     quotes;
   - zSecure Audit incorrectly formats custom data segment field
     values in the RACF_COMMAND field for SMF reports (newlist
     type=SMF) so that the formatted values are not properly
     enclosed in quotes or incorrectly enclosed in quotes;
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  zSecure Admin/Audit for RACF has been modified so it correctly
   processes custom data segment field values.
