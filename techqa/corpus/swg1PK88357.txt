APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If any of the ports specified in the Connection Port Range of
   Launcher Administration are in use by other applications, the
   Java Event Server would fail during system start-up if a
   particular system/msl attempts to assign itself to the already
   in use port,  instead of validating them during assignment and
   skip over to the next available port in the range.
   
   The launcher will produce an error of:
   An exception was caught. Message : Unable to start system
   <msl name>. . Reason: Port xxx is already in use by another
   application.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   If some of the ports specified in the port range of Launcher
   Administration are in use by other applications, Java Event
   Server would fail during system start-up instead of validating
   them during assignment and skip over to the available port in
   the range. Enhanced to skip over to the available port in the
   range to avoid system startup failures.
   
   Users Affected:
   Users using WTX with Launcher and Launcher Studio products.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   1    AIX (32BITS)
   2    AIX (64BITS)
   3    HPUX(Itanium) (32 BITS)
   4    HPUX(Itanium) (64 BITS)
   5    HPUX(risc) (32BITS)
   6    HPUX(risc) (64BITS)
   7    LINUX (32 BITS)
   8    LINUX (64 BITS)
   9    Solaris (32BITS)
   10    Solaris (64BITS)
   11    Windows ALL
   12    z/USS (32 BITS)
   13    zLinux (64 BITS)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Enhanced Java Event Server to skip ports if some of the ports in
   the range are in use by other application to avoid system
   start-up failure even when several ports are avaialble for use
   in the port range specified in the Launcher Adiministration.
