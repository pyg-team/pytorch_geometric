APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   We've got the PercentVMMemoryUsed alert but the value is
   abnormal.
   For example, 123 %. It's over 100%.
   
   Environment:
   ITM for Virtual Servers: VMware ESX Server. v5.1.2 + FixPack 6
   VMware ESX Server v2.5.2
   VMware Scripting API v2.5.2
   
   How to reproduce:
   1.Install the VMware ESX Server and create some VMs.
   2.Create a Tivoli endpoint on a machine other than the ESX
   server.
   Tivoli endpoints are installed using the winstlcf command to
   install
   on a Unix/Linux box.  There is a setup.exe to install on
   Windows.
   The endpoint setup code for Windows is on one of your Tivoli
   Management Framework CDs.  The endpoint must have network
   connectivity to the ESX server.
   3.Install the VMware Scripting APIs on the new endpoint.
   4.Run the discovery task.
     4-1.Specify the new endpoint that you created in step 2.
     4-2.Provide information about how to contact the ESX server.
   5.An object is created on your desktop representing the endpoint
   and ESX server combination.
