QUESTION
 DB2 driver : How can you tell which driver version is being used? 

ANSWER
 

It is best to get the JDBC drivers from the DB2 database server you are connecting to, to ensure the correct drivers are in place for JDBC gateway. 

When there is an SQL error reported in the log file the driver version is shown at the end:
DB2 SQL Error: 
e.g.
DRIVER=4.18.60
DRIVER=3.68.61
DRIVER=3.50.152
DRIVER=3.64.133


You can manually check the driver version using the following syntax:
cd $OMNIHOME/gates/java
java -cp ./db2jcc.jar com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Jcc -version 

By default the JDBC Gateway will source the JDBC drivers from $OMNIHOME/gates/java.

If you want to set the classpath explicitly use the property Gate.Java.ClassPath:
e.g.
Gate.Java.ClassPath: '/opt/DB2DRIVERS/jdbc_sqlj-v9.7fp9/db2jcc.jar:/opt/nrv731/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/gates/java/ngtktk.jar:/opt/nrv731/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/gates/java/ngjava.jar:/opt/nrv731/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/gates/java/nco_g_jdbc.jar' 

 

See the related links to determine which drivers support which DB2 database version, and for DB2 Driver JAR package downloads.
