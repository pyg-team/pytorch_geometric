 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Connecting to OpenLDAP, ADAM, or Z/OS LDAP fails if person object class does not contain uid and there is no alternative mapping for uid because Portal needs a unique identifier for users. 

CONTENT
When using the Configuration Wizard or ConfigEngine command line, connecting to OpenLDAP, ADAM, or Z/OS LDAP fails in the step to "Update the search administration user". This happens when there is no uid attribute in the person object class and there is no alternative mapping for uid. 

Solution: 
(1) Add the uid attribute to the LDAP or
(2) Configure portal to map the cn attribute to the uid attribute. 
Edit wp_profile/ConfigEngine/properties/wkplc.properties and set these values:
federated.ldap.attributes.mapping.ldapName=cn
federated.ldap.attributes.mapping.portalName=uid 
Run the following command from the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory

Linux: ./ConfigEngine.sh wp-update-federated-ldap-attribute-config -DWasPassword=password
Windows: ConfigEngine.bat wp-update-federated-ldap-attribute-config -DWasPassword=password

NOTE: This task MUST be run directly after adding the LDAP to Portal. In the Configuration Wizard workflow this should be done after the step "Add an LDAP user registry to the existing federated repository."
