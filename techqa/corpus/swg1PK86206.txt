   ****************************************************************
   When handling the deactivation of an Activation Specification,
   the Transaction Service rolled back all transactions
   associated with the Activation Specification, even though the
   transactions were active on other threads.
   This caused problems on the original threads because
   transactions were left associated with those threads, but with
   an incorrect internal state. This meant that resources could
   not be enlisted with those transactions, and so all requests
   involving resources failed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Transaction Service has been changed so that when an
   Activation Specification is deactivated, other active
   transactions using the Activation Specification will only be
   marked for rollback, rather than being actively rolled back.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 6.1.0.27.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
