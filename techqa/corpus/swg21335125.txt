QUESTION
 How can you access a Test Database with IBM Rational ClearQuest (CQ) Web? 

ANSWER
There are two ways to access a Test Database in CQ Web: 

 1. The CQ Designer (Eclipse) allows you to setup multiple test configurations for testing the CQ schema before checking it in. Unlike previous versions, you can also choose which client (CQ for Windows client, CQ (Eclipse RCP) client, or CQ Web client) you would like to test the schema in. 1
    
    
 2. Access the database using a URL shortcut. 2
    
    
 3. Manually type in the name of the test database. 3


 

1. Setup Test Configuration 

To set up a test configuration in the new ClearQuest Designer, refer to the Creating a test configuration [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.schema.ec.doc/topics/t_set_test_db_schema.htm] topic of the ClearQuest Information Center [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010159] for version 7.1, or 8.0.1 here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v8m0r1/topic/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.schema.ec.doc/topics/t_set_test_db_schema.htm]. In the Client Setup tab, select "ClearQuest Web" for the Client to run value. 

 

2. Accessing the database with a URL 

As an alternative, you may access your test databases using this URL format: 

http://server_name/cqweb/#/dbset/dbname 

where...


 * server_name is the host name or IP address of the CQ Web server. 
 * dbset is the name of the database set as it appears in the CQ Maintenance Tool. 
 * dbname is the name of the test database you would like to access.


Notes:  * This URL is not limited for use with just test databases. Production databases are also accessible with this method. See the Creating REST URIs to log on [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.user_web.doc/topics/t_logon_shortcut.htm] topic in the ClearQuest Information Center [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg27010159] for more information. 
 * In some cases, you will need to use restapi with the URL in place of the pound sign (#). 
 * The default is connection name is 7.0.0, even though the product release is 7.1, 8.0.0 in CQ 8.0 and 8.0.1, respectively.



Alternatively, you can use the old ClearQuest Web URL format to access any test database. * Here is an example: 

http:// server_name/cqweb/ login?test=1 

3. Manually type in the name of the test database

This is an option only if there is more than one production user database for the connection. In this case, you are prompted to select a user database. You can manually type in the name of the test database to which you wish to connect.



KNOWN ISSUES:


 * ClearQuest Web 7.1 is supposed to convert the older URL formatting for accessing a test database. Trying to use this format might result in an error. This was identified as a product defect under APAR PK77139 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK77139]. It was resolved in ClearQuest 7.1.0.2. Upgrade to the latest version [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21306624] of ClearQuest to resolve this issue.
   
   
 * The Testing schema modifications in Rational ClearQuest Web [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.schema.ec.doc/topics/c_testing_schema_mod.htm] topic of the ClearQuest Information Center [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010159] for 7.1 incorrectly states that test databases cannot be accessed from Designer.
