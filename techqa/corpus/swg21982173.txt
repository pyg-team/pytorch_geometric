WTX TX WMB IIB Multi-threading workfiles upgrade TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error 'failed due to multi-threading and default workfiles' after upgrading to WTX 8.3.0.6. 

SYMPTOM
Error 'failed due to multi-threading and default workfiles' after upgrading to WTX 8.3.0.6.


CAUSE
An enhancement was made to WTX 8.3.0.4 and onwards so that WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) for Websphere Message Broker (WMB) fails a map that has multiple instances running in a single node if the map references a work file, audit file, or trace file name that is not unique.

ENVIRONMENT
Using WTX with WMB Plug-in to execute a WTX map.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The WMB Service trace contains the following error...

DTXMB1003E WTX for WMB error: 'WTX ENV: Inst=31 Map '/MapLocation/MapName.mmc' failed due to multi-threading and default workfiles. Modify the map settings to use either workspace in memory or unique workfiles, or single thread the map.' {1} 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please the following link to find information about running multiple instances of maps using the WMB plug-in eg. changing work files to be unique or in memory.
