   If you have been directed to this document by error message CRIMA1249E, see the important note below: 
   IMPORTANT: For IBM Installation Manager users who have been directed here because your Installation Manager tried to update itself to a version that no longer supports the platform that is in use. The failed IM update attempt shows this error message: 
   "CRIMA1249E: Installation Manager cannot be updated to the latest version on the platform that is in use." 

 * Explanation: Newer releases of the Installation Manager no longer support platforms that are past their End-Of-Support dates. 

 * User Action: You will need to transition to a platform that is supported by 1.8.x version of the IBM Installation Manager.
