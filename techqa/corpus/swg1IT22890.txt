APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating a User Defined Node,  you can select the ICONS
   needed for the node.
   You get get this issue if you save the UDN first and then import
   the  ICONS.
   If you create the UDN, import the ICONS and  save then the
   problem does not occur.
   
   If you start the simulator to try out the UDN, then the message
   flow displays the default UDN icon instead of the ICON selected
   via the UDN editor palette.
   
   The same applies if you install the node.

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are two directories under the ICONS, one call obj30 and
   one called obj32. Update both icons to the large icon.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All user of IBM Integration Toolkit V9 and V10 creating a User
   Defined node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows on x86-64 platform, Linux on x86-64 platform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The default ICON is displayed on the message flow or displayed
   using the simulation mode.
   This occurs if a User defined node is created and saved. and an
   ICON is later imported and saved  afterwards.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been changed to correctly update the ICON if it
   is imported after saving the User defined Node.
   The user will need to re-import the ICON for this fix to work
   correctly.
