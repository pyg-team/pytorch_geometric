APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The display state of greyed-out tick boxes shall be inline with
   the real properties they represent.
   
   The non-modifyable tick boxes in the group field ?Attribute feat
   ures? appear (except of inherit value) as being ticked. This ind
   icates to the user that changes to the attribute do affect chang
   e bars, change dates and generate history. Since this is not the
    case, the fact that the boxes look ticked is misleading.

   ****************************************************************
   The display state of greyed-out tick boxes shall be inline
   with the real properties they represent.
   
   The non-modifyable tick boxes in the group field ?Attribute
   features? appear (except of inherit value) as being ticked.
   This indicates to the user that changes to the attribute do
   affect change bars, change dates and generate history. Since
   this is not the case, the fact that the boxes look ticked is
   misleading.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The check-boxes change bars, change dates and generate
   history are checked and unchecked automatically based on the
   value of DXL attribute.
