QUESTION
 How to change the batch selection mode in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture. 

CAUSE
Need to change the way a shortcut selects the next batch to process.

ANSWER
For Datacap 8.0.1 or earlier: 

 1. Log into Taskmaster Client. 
 2. Go to Settings > Shortcuts. 
 3. Select the icon for the task to be changed. 
 4. On the right section under Batch Selection Mode select the desired mode. 
 5. Click Apply/Done.


For Datacap 8.1 or newer:  1. Log into Datacap Web. 
 2. Go to Administrator > Shortcuts. 
 3. Select the icon for the task to be changed. 
 4. On the right section for Mode select the desired mode. 
 5. Click Apply/Done.


Available batch selection modes: 
 *  Auto mode - Automatically selects the next available batch. This batch is determined by using first in first out (FIFO) technology. For a batch creation task, it automatically creates a batch. 
 * Manual mode - Shows a list of all available batches, and the user selects which batch they want to run. 
 * Manual for Hold mode - Only shows a list of all the batches that the current user has on hold. If that user has no batches on hold, the system reverts to Auto mode. 
 * Prompt mode - Allows the user to select which of the three previous modes they want to run.
