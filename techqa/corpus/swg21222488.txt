PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Verbose GC data gives an insight into the actions that the Garbage Collector is taking, and is vital for performance tuning.
In addition it is one means of determining if the application is "leaking" Java objects, and what size leak has occurred which is useful when carrying out heapdump analysis. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Once the generation of Verbose GC output has been setup [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222436] and the output gathered, it is possible to carry out analysis of the data.
This can be carried out in one of two ways: 

 * Using a Visualisation tool 
 * Manual Analysis by reading the XML log file


Visulization Tools There are currently two publically available tools that are capable of analyzing the Verbose GC output: 

 * Diagnostic Tool for Java Garbage Collector: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/gcdiag [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/gcdiag] 
 * IBM Pattern Modeling and Analysis Tool for Java Garbage Collector (PMAT): http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/pmat [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/pmat]


Manual Analysis The Verbose GC output that is received is dependent on which of the following three Garbage Collection strategies is in place: 

 * -Xgcpolicy:optthruput Optimum Throughput [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222443] 
 * -Xgcpolicy:optavgpause Concurrent GC [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222459] 
 * -Xgcpolicy:gencon Generational and Concurrent [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222486]


It is recommended that a visualization tool is used to develop an overview of the Garbage Collector activity and trends, and then carry out manual analysis for Garbage Collection cycles of particular interest. RELATED INFORMATION
