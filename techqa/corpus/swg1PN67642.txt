APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abend0c4 occurred in EZACIC01 in trace routine during task
   termination. The failure is also reported as a CICS
   transaction abendakea. The failure occurred while trying to
   write a trace entry during task termination. The abending
   instruction is a IC trying to insert character pointed to by
   REG1 to REG15. The address in REG1 is invalid resulting in the
   abend0c4. The system the abend occurred on had recently invoked
   ACR(abend071) which stored the restart old PSW at loc x'8'.
   Trace entry processing at task termination will be corrected.

   ****************************************************************
   ABEND 0C4 IN TRUE MODULE EZACIC01 AFTER SOCKET TRANSACTION
   RETURNS TO CICS FOR TASK TERMINATION PROCESSING.
   THE ABEND OCCURS IN THE TRACING LOGIC ON ENTRY INTO TRUE.
   THIS ABEND ONLY SHOWS UP WHEN AN MVS SYSTEM RESTART HAS BEEN
   INITIATED.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THE TRUE MODULE CALLED EZACIC01 HAD A LOGIC ERROR THAT ONLY
   SHOWED UP AFTER THE USERS RESTARTED THERE MVS SYSTEM.
   UPON TASK TERMINATION THE TRUE IS INVOKE BY CICS'S TASK
   MANAGEMENT. THE TRACING LOGIC IN THE TRUE ASSUMES THERE IS A
   SOCKET PARAMETER LIST ASSOCIATED WITH THE REQUEST AND TRIES
   TO ACCESS THE POINTER TO THIS DATA. HOWEVER THE POINTER TO THE
   SOCKET INFORMATION SHOULDN'T BE USED BECAUES THE TRUE WAS NOT
   INVOKED BY A SOCKET TRANSACTION BUT BY CICS TASK MANAGEMENT.
   THIS ERROR CAUSED EZACIC01 TO ADDRESS LOW CORE CAUSING ABENDS
   ONLY WHEN THE OLD PSW WAS STORED AT THAT LOCATION IN LOW CORE.
   EZACIC01 WAS MODIFIED TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO ACCESS SOCKET
   INFORMATION WHEN INVOKED BY CICS TASK MANAGEMENT.
