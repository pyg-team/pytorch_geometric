PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN

   Incident Diagnosis
   INT V4-V5 DRAW : The V4 DRAW DETAIL cannot
   copy to V5 only once
   Restriction Explanation
   CATIA V5 handles detail's V4 to V5 migration by
   using UUID. These UUID are necessary to identify
   the selected V4 detail.
   The trouble is that old V4 model doesn't contain
   UUID. In V4, this notion appeared in 418. Detail's
   created with a older version of CATIA V4 doesn't
   contain UUID.
   In this model, there are more than 100 V4 2D
   details, and only 20 of them contain UUID.
   By-Pass
   If a paste operation fails due to UUID problem on
   one "old" V4 detail, the model should be closed and
   re-openned. Then the copy/paste operation of
   this "old" V4 detail will be possible.
