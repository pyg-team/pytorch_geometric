PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All OMEGAMON XE for CICS on z/OS users.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Abend 0C4/AKEA in GLUEEXIT at exit      *
   *                      point XDLIPOST.                         *
   *                                                              *
   *                      Support for new CICS SIT parameters.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   When collection of DL/I file-level detail is active and a
   PL/I program makes a DL/I TERM call, an invalid pointer will
   be used. Use of that invalid pointer will cause undesirable
   results which may include 0C4 abends.
   
   CICS SIT changes were introduced in these APARs:
   ENCRYPTION=SSLV3
    PI28038 - CICS TS 3.1 and CICS TS 3.2
    PI27936 - CICS TS 4.1 and CICS TS 4.2
    PI28039 - CICS TS 5.1 and CICS TS 5.2
   RACFSYNC=YES|NO
    PI22267 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI22267] - CICS TS 4.1 and CICS TS 4.2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  OMEGAMON DL/I file-level detail collection was corrected to
   not use an invalid pointer.
   
   OMEGAMON SIT displays were updated to support these
   parameters.
