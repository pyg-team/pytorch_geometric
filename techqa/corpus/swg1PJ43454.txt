APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Adding a toolbar button to the In-basket widget where the button
   is associated with a custom action that is deployed as part of a
   custom widget, the row of toolbar buttons on the In-basket
   widget will get duplicated.
   
   If the custom action is also added to the In-basket widget as a
   menu, then the duplicate row of buttons goes away.
   The issue only appears on initial load of the solution with a
   new browser process.  If the browser is reused after a logout or
   subsequent load of the same page, then the duplication no longer
   exists.
   
   The issue cannot be reproduced with the OOTB action.
   This issue is only a problem for FireFox browsers, it does not
   occur with Internet Explorer or Chrome.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workarounds include:
   1. Add the custom action to the In-basket menu in addition to
   the toolbar.
   2. Use a browser other than FireFox
