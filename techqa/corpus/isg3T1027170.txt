QUESTION
 How to remove flow instances for a legacy user from Flow Manager? 

ANSWER
Here are the steps:
(1) stop JFD by "jadmin stop"
(2) grep all files with the legacy user names under $JS_HOME/work/storage/flow_storage,
e.g: ls -l |grep "username" $JS_HOME/work/storage/flow_storage
(3) Backup and delete the files listed in (2)
(4) Backup and delete <flow_id>.dat files that belongs to this legacy user in $JS_HOME/work/storage/flow_instance_storage/finished
e.g: grep "username" $JS_HOME/work/storage/flow_instance_storage/finished/*.dat to find all relevant files
(5) Backup and delete the Cache file under $JS_HOME/work/storage/cache
(6) start JFD by "jadmin start"

Note: The Cache file contains minimum information (name, state etc) of finished flow instances to help jfd to start up quickly. After it is deleted, it may be a little slower when jfd is restarted, but a new Cache file will then be created automatically, so jfd startup will be faster next time.
