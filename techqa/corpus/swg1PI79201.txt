APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Caching Proxy 7.0 creates a number of symbolic links to msg
   folder. CP logs are in Japanese.
   
   Caching Proxy 8.0 does not have these symbolic links.
   Logs are not in Japanese.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually create the missing symbolic links.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Japanese Users of IBM Edge Caching Proxy    *
   *                  8.0                                         *

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Caching Proxy logs are not written in   *
   *                      Japanese on AIX when using the Ja_JP    *
   *                      locale.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  The symbolic links mentioned in the         *
   *                  conclusion                                  *
   *                  should be created to manually fix this      *
   *                  issue.                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   IBM Edge Caching Proxy on AIX should accept two locales for
   Japanese: ja_JP and Ja_JP. With the Ja_JP locale set, the logs
   are
   not written in Japanese due to missing symbolic links that
   should
   have been created during installation of Caching Proxy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The installer for IBM Edge Caching Proxy on AIX was updated to
   properly create the symbolic links from the ja_JP messages to
   their equivalent Ja_JP form. The following symbolic links are no
   created during installation (paths relative to the Caching Proxy
   root directory):
    - msg/HTMLForm_Ja_JP.res     -> msg/HTMLForm_ja_JP.res
    - msg/cacheagt_Ja_JP.res     -> msg/cacheagt_ja_JP.res
    - msg/config_Ja_JP.res       -> msg/config_ja_JP.res
    - msg/htmlprox_Ja_JP.res     -> msg/htmlprox_ja_JP.res
    - msg/ibmapprouter_Ja_JP.res -> msg/ibmapprouter_ja_JP.res
    - msg/ibmcp_Ja_JP.res        -> msg/ibmcp_ja_JP.res
    - msg/ibmhtc_Ja_JP.res       -> msg/ibmhtc_ja_JP.res
    - msg/ibmproxy_Ja_JP.res     -> msg/ibmproxy_ja_JP.res
   
   This will cause the Caching Proxy logs to be written in Japanese
   when using the Ja_JP locale. If English logs are desired, howeve
   the symbolic links above can be removed to revert the logs back
   English.
   
   The fix for this APAR is targetted for Caching Proxy fixpacks:
    - 9.0.0.5
    - 8.5.5.12
    - 8.0.0.14
