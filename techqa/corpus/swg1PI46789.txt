ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problems addressed in APAR PI46643 for IMS TM Resource Adapter
   version 14.1.0:
   
   1. Prior versions of the resource adapter could not receive a
   confirmation from IMS that the synchronous callout response
   message was received.
   
   2. With prior versions of the resource adapter, whenever a
   callout response is sent, a new connection is created and
   then discarded, causing overhead in opening and closing
   connections.

   Enhancements in APAR PI46789:
   
   1. The send-only with acknowledgement protocol for synchronous
   callout is now supported. By setting the sendOnlyWithAck
   property in the activation specification to true, you can enable
   the resource adapter to receive an acknowledgement from IMS
   that the response was received.
   
   2. For responses sent back to IMS, you can now enable
   connection pooling. You can specify the maximum number of
   connections to hold in the pool, the interval in minutes to
   clean up idle connections, and how many minutes a connection
   can remain idle.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. You can specify in the activationSpec whether to enable
   the send-only with acknowledgement protocol by setting the
   sendOnlyWithAck property to true (default is false).
   
   2. You can specify in the activationSpec the following
   properties for synchronous callout response connection pooling:
   
   connectionPoolEnabled: Specifies if connection pooling is
   	enabled.  The default is false.
   maxConnections: Specifies the maximum number of connections
   	the pool can hold. If the pool is full, all new
   	connections is discarded. The default value is 1.
   poolCleanupFrequency: Specifies the idle connection cleanup
   	interval in minutes.  The default is 20.
   durationOfIdleConnection: Specifies the number of minutes a
   	connection can remain idle before it is cleaned up at
   	the next cleanup interval.  The default is 0, which
   	means an idle connection is cleaned up right away.
