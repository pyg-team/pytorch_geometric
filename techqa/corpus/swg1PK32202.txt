APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Data access portability features" topic in the Version 6.x
   information center does not tell you how to use the WSCallHelper
   class for Java database connectivity (JDBC). The topic needs to
   be improved to make the task easier to accomplish. Make the
   information for the WSCallHelper class in the Javadoc more
   easily accessible from the "Data access portability features"
   topic. Lastly, the jdbcPass method call example is incorrect.
   
   The following APARs address problems in WebSphere Application
   Server Version 6.0.x for WSCallHelper class processing:
   PK06934 -- Add trusted method Array on class Oracle.SQL.Array
   PK09641 -- Use Oracle specific method getNumber on resultSet
   object
   PK12998-- init method on Oracle.SQL.Struct class not permitted

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Developers who want to use non-standard      *
   *                 Java database connectivity (JDBC) classes    *
   *                 with WebSphere Application Server            *
   *                 Version 6.x.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WebSphere Application Server cannot     *
   *                      directly use non-standard JDBC          *
   *                      objects. Within your applications,      *
   *                      you must use the WSCallHelper class     *
   *                      to exploit vendor-specific database     *
   *                      methods and classes.                    *

   ****************************************************************
   The "Data access portability features" topic in the Version
   6.x information center does not clearly explain how to use the
   jdbcPass WSCallHelper class method. However, the Application
   Server requires the jdbcPass method for calling vendor
   proprietary methods on data source connections.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Data access portability features" topic has been updated.
   The code sample for using the jdbcPass method has been prefaced
   with a clearer explanation. Also, a syntax error was fixed in
   the code sample.
   
   The following code sample demonstrates how to use jdbcPass to
   call the Oracle method XMLType.createXML on a connection. This
   Oracle function creates an XML type object out of the XML data
   that the database passes to your application.
   XMLType poXML = (XMLType)(WSCallHelper.jdbcPass(XMLType.class,
   "createXML", new Object[]{conn,poString},
    new Class[]{java.sql.Connection.class, java.lang.String.class},
   
    new int[]{WSCallHelper.CONNECTION,WSCallHelper.IGNORE}));:
   
   Additionally, steps have been added to the topic to access the
   WSCallHelper class application programming interface (API)
   documentation, which provided more generic examples of using
   the jdbcPass method. The following information has been added:
   
   For more examples of using jdbcPass and a complete list of
   method parameters, see the API documentation for the
   WSCallHelper class. In this information center, access the API
   documentation with the following steps:
   1. Click Reference > Developer API documentation > Application
   programming interfaces.
   2. Click com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.
   3. Under the Class Summary heading, click WSCallHelper.
   The first section on jdbcPass discusses using the method to
   call database static methods. The second section on jdbcPass
   addresses database non-static methods.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the next update
   to the information centers, which is scheduled to occur on or
   before December 31, 2006.
