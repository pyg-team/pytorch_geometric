ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PM12028 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12028] added changes to the code to set the 11g Oracle Helper
   class in the JDBC Provider if the 11g driver was used.  This
   inadvertantly breaks the 9i helper class if 9i driver is used
   (10g was not affected).
   
   This fix corrects the problem so that 9i, 10g, and 11g helper
   classes are all set correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually update the helper class in the JDBC provider to reflect
   the correct version.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Oracle Helper classes in the JDBC providers are not set up
   correctly by database-transfer and connect-database scripts.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
