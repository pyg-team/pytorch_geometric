QUESTION
 How do you create a CICS VSAM Recovery (CICS VR) job that will utilize storage in the most efficient manner? 

ANSWER
Create a recovery job using the CICS VR panel interface, specifying that CICS VR should automatically calculate the LSR buffers pools. The IBM default value for the "Automatic LSR buffers" parameter is YES and can be easily verified by selecting VSAM buffer pools from the "CICS VR forward recovery" secondary window. The VSAM buffer pools secondary window [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwug/dwwug00046.html] will display. On this panel, you should see "Automatic LSR buffers ===> YES".

CICS VR will automatically add the BLDVRP command with no keywords to the recovery job. During execution of the recovery job, CICS VR will calculate and use the proper LSR buffer pools.
