   ****************************************************************
   The failure occurs because the upgrade
   process contains hooks that are looking for libraries in the
   2.1 firmware.  The libraries exist in the 2.5 firmare, but
   not in 2.1. The failure can be observed best when trying to
   upgrade the firmware from the command line, where the following
   message may be displayed:
   ==============================
   Console> firmware upgrade <FIRMWARE>
   Upgrading firmware...
   Failed executing pre install hook.
   ==============================
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The hooks in the firmware upgrade process were updated to no
   longer use the missing libaries.
