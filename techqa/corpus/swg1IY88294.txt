   instances and patched up 2) Imported the attached export to
   both 3) Restarted both Impact servers (just to be sure) 4)

   order of some fields around, changed the name of the datatype
   or the name of a field. (The internal datatypes in the export
   are labeled with a green icon). 5) Export the altered datatypes
