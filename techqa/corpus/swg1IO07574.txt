APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Although a port other than 389 is specified in
   cmbcmenv.properties for LDAP server, the LDAP authentication
   user exit of library server uses 389 to access the LDAP
   server.
   
   This is because ITDS (IBM Tivoli Directory Servic) SDK being
   called by the LDAP user exit always uses 389 if URL of the
   LDAP server is in "ldap://hostname" format.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use hostname only instead of "ldap://hostname" in
   cmbcmenv.properties when specifying LDAP server's URL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When CM user exit does LDAP user authentication by calling IBM
   ITDS SDK API,
   we need to pass the protocol, hostname and port number to the
   API, but sometimes
   when we passed protocol "LDAP:\\" to API, the API will always
   look for default port
   389 first, this may cause problems for some really rare
   situations for some customers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix in cm83fp8
