QUESTION
 How to do when we can't increase/decrease the trace buffer size even the instance isn't up ? 

ANSWER
As long as there is a single process attached to the shared trace buffer, you will not be able to adjust the buffer size, especially on Windows box . Again, this is by design. You should do the following:
db2stop
db2 terminate

If that still doesn't work or if DB2 previously terminated abnormally (crashed) you should also try the following:

terminate any applications that may be using DB2 (java, utilities, etc.)

killdb2 (or killdbm)
clean up IPC resource 

(AIX:ipclean -a; Linux: ipcrm;Windows:Microsoft Process Explorer (procexp.exe))
