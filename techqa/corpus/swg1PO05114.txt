ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The session timeout modal can be configured to provide users
   with a notification, a specified number of seconds before a
   session is due to expired because of inactivity.
   The modal provides the user with two options, to continue or to
   exit (and end the session).  On clicking the continue button,
   the users session expiry should be reset (if scheduled to
   expire after 30 minutes of activity the countdown clock would
   be reset to 30 minutes when the user clicks continue).
   The session timeout modal should be displayed each time the
   session reaches the configured timeout period.
   The modal currently only appears once meaning the session could
   timeout without customer knowing.

   Previously, when the timeout warning appeared and the user
   selected the 'continue' button to continue using the
   application, the timeout warning dialog did not reappear again
   to notify them that their session was about to expire. This
   issue has now been resolved.
