 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM WebSphere Cast Iron Solution(CVE-2015-2808) 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Customers on Cast Iron v6.0.0.x should contact IBM Support for migrating to one of the remediated releases. 

Appliance is upgraded with script changes.
For Studio and Secure connectors, to disable the RC4 stream cipher do the following:

Studio
Go to the the location studio is installed
<installation directory>\jre\lib\security\java.security 
Add RC4 to the list of disabled TLS algorithms specified by the property jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms. For example:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4 


For Secure connectors
Go to the the location where secure connector is installed
Windows: <installation directory>\jre\jre\lib\security\java.security 
Linux : <installation directory>\jre\lib\security\java.security

Add RC4 to the list of disabled TLS algorithms specified by the property jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms. For example:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
