Supported storage systems
The following table provides details about the storage systems that are supported by IBM Copy Services Manager.

NOTE: Firmware levels newer than what are listed here are considered untested but are expected to work similarly and can be used. Newer levels are often recommended to pick up the latest fixes and functionality. If issues arise while using the newer levels, open a PMR and IBM Support will investigate the problem and attempt to resolve it, but resolution is not guaranteed. An upgrade to a later version of IBM Copy Services Manager may be required, particularly for new functions. Any issues will be documented as they are identified.
