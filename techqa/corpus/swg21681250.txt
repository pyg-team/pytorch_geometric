QUESTION
 Can user preferences from FileNet Application Engine Workplace be imported to FileNet Workplace XT installation? 

ANSWER
No. Workplace XT and Workplace, despite their similarities, are different products and have different parameters. Their preferences files are not compatible.

However, the files can be exported as XML files, and a custom application could be written to map parameters. IBM does not provide such an application.
