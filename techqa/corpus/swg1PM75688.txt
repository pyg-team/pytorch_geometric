APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v8.0.3.3
   Using the Refactor->Rename in COBOL program may cause a hang
   condition on the client when renaming a section header.
   When you select to rename a section name then all of the
   copybooks that are accessed are downloaded to search for any
   instances of this name.
   There could be a deadlock situation if during this process one
   of the copybooks are locked by another process.
   ***************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Setting affected copybooks on the z/OS host to have STATS ON
   will significantly reduce the chance of experiencing this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using the Refactor->Rename in COBOL program may cause a hang
   condition on the client when renaming a section header.
   
   When you select to rename a section name then all of the
   copybooks that are accessed are downloaded to search for any
   instances of this name.
   
   There could be a deadlock situation if during this process one
   of the copybooks are locked by another process.
   
   ***************************************************************
   Local fix:
   Ensure all copybooks are unlocked before doing a
   refactor->rename.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A dead lock was occurring when threads obtained Jobs API
   resources scheduling locks and the RDz copy library locks in
   different orders.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
