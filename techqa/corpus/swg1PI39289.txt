ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You may encounter an issue where the RAM Web UI does not
   redirect the user to the home page when clicking on the logout
   link; this issue can occur when using WebSphere along with a
   proxy server - upon logout, instead of being redirected to the
   home page, you may be redirected to a page with the following
   message:
   
   "Successful Logout"
   
   The issue occurs because RAM uses the WebSphere internal logout
   feature to invalidate the session and correctly
   remove/invalidate any LPTA tokens, SSO cookies, etc.  However,
   in a scenario where proxy is used with WebSphere, a missing
   parameter is needed in RAM's logout page to redirect WebSphere
   internal logout feature to the RAM home page.
