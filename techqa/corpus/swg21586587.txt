PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Couldn't access action library error in Datacap Studio in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 

SYMPTOM
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21586587&amp;aid=1] 

The user may report that they are running Datacap Studio and some or all of the standard action libraries are missing.

Additionally, if users attempt to run tasks on the Test tab, they will get a Cannot run rules in task profile error.


CAUSE
This error is caused by the software being unable to load the standard action libraries, which default to C:\Datacap\RRS. If using a separate installation directory path, the global rulesets and actions location must be updated.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The path to the global rulesets and actions location can be updated through Datacap Studio: 

 1. Start Datacap Studio 
 2. Cancel any application, workflow or Taskmaster Login selection if prompted 
 3. Click Settings in the top-right corner 
 4. Update RRS folder path under Rulerunner general settings


Alternatively, update the system registry manually, if Datacap Studio is not installed.


Windows x64: 

 * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\RRS\locations\rrs


Windows x86:  * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Datacap\RRS\locations\rrs


If the problem persists even though the path is valid: 

 1. Ensure that there are no permission issues. 
 2. If using a Virtual Machine (VM), search from the top of the registry for C:\Datacap\RRS and update any and all instances. 
 3. If the environment is used for mixed component development, ensure that only the correct version of \Datacap\dcshared\NET\iRRX.dll is installed and registered. Taskmaster 8.1 uses Microsoft.NET Framework version v2 to register its corresponding DLL, while Datacap 9.0 and later uses Microsoft.NET Framework version 4.
