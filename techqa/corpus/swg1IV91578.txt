   Gateway, and then at a later point in time, APM V8 agent on
   the same host are connected to the APM server with the same MSN
   (Managed System Name) as that of ITM agent, the situation files
   for the APM agent MSN do not get created, and events for
   thresholds do not raise for the APM V8 agent.

   1. Connected ITM agents to APM server through Hybrid Gateway,
   and they can be seen on APM UI and their situation files can be
   downloaed to local and events can be fired.
   2. install matching APMv8 agents on the same computer box,
   3. disconnect former ITM agents, and connect new APM agents to
   APM server. the new agents can be seen in APM UI
   4. for APMv8 agents with same MSN with former ITM agents, their
   situation files can NOT be downloaded and their events can not
   be fired.
