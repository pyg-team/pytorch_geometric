APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The HL7DFDLInput node uses a lot of CPU when the message size
   increases.
   
   The HL7DFDLOutput node can exhibit high latency (but not high
   CPU) because the output message is emitted in two separate
   TCP/IP packets.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The internals of the HL7DFDLInput and HL7DFDLOutput nodes are
   not accessible, so these problems cannot be addressed without
   this APAR fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack who deploy
   message flows containing the HL7DFDLInput or HL7DFDLOutput node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The HL7DFDLInput node uses a large amount of CPU when receiving
   an HL7 message.
   The HL7DFDLOutput node can incur latency leading to low
   throughput when sending an HL7 message.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Both problems are addressed in the product by modifying the
   logic in the respective nodes.
