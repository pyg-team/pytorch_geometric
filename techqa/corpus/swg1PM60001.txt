ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z (RDz) Remote Index Search
   default directory is not set as expected according to the GUI or
   the documentation.
   
   In the documentation it states that the default directory for
   the Remote Index Search is:
    /u/userid/.eclipse/RSE/USERID
   However, If rsed.envvars contains
   _RSE_JAVAOPTS='$_RSE_JAVAOPTS -Duser.log=/var/rdz/logs'
   then, the directory INDEX is created in   /var/rdz/logs/USERID
   instead.
   
   There is no documentation that states this setting affects the
   Remote Index Search default directory.
   
   There are 2 issues here:
   First the name of the directory listed in the RDz client window
   is:
   /u/USERID/.eclipse/RSE/INDEX
   It should be:
    /u/USERID/.eclipse/RSE/userid/INDEX
   
   Second, if -Duser.log is set to another directory, the default
   given by the RDz client and passed to the host is not used.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Remote Index Users (z/OS UNIX, or MVS)   *
   *                 who use either files with different          *
   *                 encodings, or who run the RDz server with    *
   *                 a different code page than what is           *
   *                 configured in the the RSE connection on      *
   *                 the client.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When the client RSE connection, or the  *
   *                      MVS subsystem is configured with a      *
   *                      different code page than what is being  *
   *                      used on the server, MVS member names    *
   *                      may be misrepresented in the Remote     *
   *                      Index search results, resulting in      *
   *                      the inability to open the matching      *
   *                      file from the Remote Index Search view. *
   *                      In addition, searches where users haved *
   *                      defined mixed code pages for files that *
   *                      are indexed may fail to find matches,   *
   *                      since the files will have been indexed  *
   *                      using the code page that the RDz server *
   *                      is running with.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Remote Index Search function was running using the code page
   that is defined in the rsed.envvars file (_RSE_HOST_CODEPAGE)
   regardless of whether a connection or the MVS subsystem has a
   different code page configured.  This can result MVS PDS names,
   and MVS PDS member names which contain character code points
   0x5B, 0x7B, ox7C being incorrectly represented in the
   Remote Index Search View.
   In addition, since the Remote Index also used the RDz host
   code page to generate indexes, if a z/OS UNIX directory or file
   was defined in the RSE view to be a different code page than the
   server, or if the MVS PDS or MVS PDS member was defined on the
   client to be in a different code page, the index would have been
   incorrectly generated, resulting in missing matches when
   searches are performed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Remote Index function will now respect client configurations
   for code pages, at the connection, and MVS subsystem level, as
   well as the z/OS UNIX directory and file, MVS PDS, and MVS PDS
   member code page configurations when generating an index, in
   addition to searching an index.
   Client APAR PM56858 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM56858] is also required to be applied for this fix
   to be fully functional.
