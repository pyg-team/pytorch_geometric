   messages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Previously the message generated from the verification of
    input entered on the Telnet Solicitor Panel was not being
    passed correctly to the message handler routine, resulting in
        1) the message being skewed and
        2) Possible invalid messages outputted
   
    Checks were made to verify the output of various combinations
    for if this panel is used for a restricted appl or a
    non-restricted appl.
   
    Userid and Password, if specified, must be retyped if not
    accepted by the authorization checks.  Otherwise, they will
    be considered blank.
   
    If a non-restricted appl is specified using this screen, the
    userid and password are not required. An initial check will be
    done to determine if they are valid, if specified.
   
    The following are some of the various scenarios tested:
   
   
    Screen input        Restricted Appl       Non-Restricted Appl
   ================= ======================= ====================
    > Userid,         > login                   > login
