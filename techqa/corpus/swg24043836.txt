ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is a cumulative fix release and addresses APARs and internally found issues since the release of OMNIbus 8.1.0 fix pack 12. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following defect solutions are included in this release:


8.1.0-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0013
--------------------------

IV87273
A new informational log message has been added to the gateway
logging code to expose the internal cache sizes. Gateway
behaviour is not modified.


IV90179
Gateways could grow unbounded in memory due to entries not being
correctly removed from its internal journal cache. This problem
is now fixed.


IV94878
Netcool/OMNIbus server components may core dump during a
vulnerability scan if the scanner connects to a server listening
port and transmits data that does not comply with the expected
protocol. This issue is now resolved. Clients will be
disconnected if they send data that does not conform to protocol.


IV96209
The MIB Manager SNMP Trap Generator sometimes throws Java runtime
exceptions in the GUI widget that displays a running tally of
traps generated. This is a regression that was introduced in the
implementation of IV91689 in 8.1 Fixpack 11 and only happens for
a very large number of traps. This regression is now fixed.


IV97084
In the scope based extended solution, if the parent event gets
cleared, then the parent event gets deleted. This behaviour is
incorrect behaviour if the event is a parent event with children.
To fix this incorrect behaviour, the SQL trigger
'correlation_process_scopeidparents' is now updated so that a
parent event is always updated with the Severity of its highest
Severity child. Installations that already have the event
grouping extension installed, should apply the fix by running
the following SQL script against the ObjectServer:
'$NCHOME/omnibus/extensions/eventgrouping/update/update81fp8to81fp13/
update81fp8to81fp13_aggregation.sql'.


IV97170
The sm_db_stats automation (part of the self monitoring solution)
incorrectly checked the enableinfojournals variable instead of
the enableinfodetails variable when checking thresholds on the
number of rows in the alerts.details table. This meant that the
EnableInfo field of the "sm_db_stats_details_count" row in the
master.sm_thresholds table was not checked properly. This problem
has been resolved. The resolution requires the manual application
of the update81fp10to81fp13.sql file against any existing
ObjectServers.


IV97985
PAM authentication for the nco_pad process does not reset the
login counter upon successful login. This problem is now fixed.
