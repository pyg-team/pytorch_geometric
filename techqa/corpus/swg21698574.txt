Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes the vulnerability that has been referred to as “FREAK”. OpenSSL is used by IBM Worklight and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation when the optional FIPS 140-2 data-in-motion feature is enabled on the Android and iOS platforms. IBM Worklight and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in the ssl3_get_key_exchange function. The client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
