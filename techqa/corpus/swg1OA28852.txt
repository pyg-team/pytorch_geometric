APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   
   1. When an EVENTOUT queue is full, the MQ agent stops monitoring
   events for this
   specific event queue.
   
   2. The MQ agent doesn't resume processing MQ events even the
   queue full condition
   is subsequently relieved.
   
   3. When an EVENTOUT queue becomes full, the MQ agent produces a
   KMQ107E error
   message, which is not easy to understand for a queue full
   condition.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring users.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQ Monitoring agent stops monitoring    *
   *                      events when an EVENTQOUT queue is       *
   *                      full.                                   *

   ****************************************************************
   1. When an EVENTQOUT queue is full, the MQ Monitoring agent
      stops monitoring events for the corresponding event queue.
   2. The MQ Monitoring agent does not resume monitoring MQ
      events when the queue full condition is subsequently
      relieved.
   3. When an EVENTQOUT queue becomes full, the MQ Monitoring
      agent issues the KMQMQ107E error message. The message is
      not easy to understand for a queue full condition.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. The program logic is modified to be able to continue
      monitoring events when an EVENTQOUT queue is detected full.
      In this case, the event will not be copied to the EVENTQOUT
      queue.
   2. The program logic is modified to resume monitoring MQ
      events as soon as the EVENTQOUT queue is not full.
   3. The new message KMQMQ423W is issued when an EVENTQOUT queue
      is detected full, and the new message KMQMQ424I is issued
      when the queue full condition is detected relieved.
