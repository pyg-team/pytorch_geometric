QUESTION
What is the status of support for the MQLSX, and how should customers develop integrated Lotus® Domino®/MQ solutions?

ANSWER

Support for the MQLSX
Support for the MQLSX has been extended through December 31, 2004. The MQLSX will be supported only in the Notes/Domino R5 environment. The MQLSX will not be supported in the Domino 6 environment. Because support for the MQLSX will end on December 31, 2004, it is recommended that any new solutions be written in Java in a Domino 6 environment.


Developing Domino/MQ Solutions in Domino 6
Customers wishing to develop an application involving Lotus Domino 6/WebSphere MQ interaction must do so using Java. You should do this by using the MQSeries Classes for Java in conjunction with the Domino Objects for Java. For deployment on MQSeries V5.2, you should use the MQSeries Classes for Java supplied with SupportPac MA88. For deployment on MQSeries V5.3, you should use the MQSeries Classes for Java that ship with V5.3. The Domino Objects for Java ship with Domino 6.
