Note 1: No license for Cognos Workspace. This capability needs to be removed.(see note 3) 

Note 2: IBM Cognos Analysis For Microsoft Excel (CAFÉ) was changed to Planning Analytics for Excel (PAx ) to reflect the changes to TM1. 

Note 3: In order to comply with licensing regulations it may be required to remove the capability for a studio from a Cognos Role. 

To disable these functions for a Cognos Role: 

1. Navigate to IBM Cognos Administration > Security > Capabilities 
2. Locate the capability you are looking to remove (Analysis Studio, Event Studio or Business Insight/Cognos Workspace = "Executive Dashboard" ) 
3. From the drop down arrow select "Set Properties". 
4. Navigate to the "Permissions" Tab. 
5. Remove the Cognos Role by selecting the checkbox next to it and then click "remove". 

Note 3: IBM does not recommend the mixing of charge metrics for end users. In the case where this is required, users accessing components of the system licensed under the PVU charge metric must be licensed. PVUs must be owned for each of the components inclusive of the BI server with DQ and Content Manager. Users accessing servers under the Authorized User charge metric are not limited to the number or size of servers which they can access.
