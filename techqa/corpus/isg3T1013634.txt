PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Which configuration can make all users have the same priority in FAIRSHARE? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


How do I make all users have the same priority and their priority decreases as they keep submitting jobs? Or do I need to specify each user. I have tried several combinations but not able to find one in which all users get same priority and priority of each user should decreases upon usage/job submission

To give all users the same fairshare for a specific queue you'd define the FAIRSHARE parameter as follows:
FAIRSHARE = USER_SHARES[[default,1]]

Run 'badmin reconfig' after you've made this change and look at the output of 'bqueues -l ' to make sure this change has taken affect. You check this by looking for the following entries in the output: 
SCHEDULING POLICIES: FAIRSHARE 
USER_SHARES: [default, 1]
