Q. What objects can be imported during migration of planning application to TM1 ? 
A. You can import cubes, dimensions, links, calculations from Planning model using import utility provided in performance modeler. 

Q. Is the link created as rule in backend on the target cube? 
A. Links can be implemented as Rule or TI process depending on your need. Rule is created in target cube and feeder is generated on source cube. 

Q. Can the Rules and feeders are generated automatically only in Performance Modeler? 
A. Yes. auto generation of rules and feeders is supported only on performance modeler 

Q. For a migrated model, Can we create data flow diagram & links for existing cube rules ? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Would data be exported for Cubes connected to database as data source ? 
A. You can export data in the TM1 cube and other objects using transfer out functionality. Same can be imported in other environments using transfer in feature. 
Data in the database can not be exported. 

Q. From where we can get application ID for TM1 application ? 
A. You can get the application id from control cubes or from properties of the application from the portal. Application ID is also available in the address bar of the browser when you open the application 

Q. Will all content from previous TM1 application be exported when migration process done for planning model, ex : node status, submission? 
A. Most of the objects like dimension, cubes, links , calculations are imported. But some of the features are not imported like security, BIF, etc. 
Application Export exports only xml of application, comments and security. 
You can find the detailed list of supported and unsupported objects in PM guide.

Q. May I know why the dimension order is different in the views when opened, from the order which the cube is created? 
What would be the reason? Every time I open the view I need to manually reorder the dimensions. 
A. Dimension order is decided while creating the cube and can be changed later. Views can be used to change the way cube is represented. Views don't influence the dimension order. 
You can check the dimension order in architect. 

Q. Does TM1 Scorecarding have same functions as in metric studio? 
A. Most of Metric studio features have been introduced in TM1 now. Scorecarding in TM1 is easier and dynamic. 

Q. Is there limitation in Cognos Insight if I want import data from flat file? 
A. In Cognos insight, you can not import cells with functions and unstructured files. Most of the structured flat files can be imported. 

Q. Do we have any graphs in TM1? like for comparison of data. 
A. We have many types of charts in TM1. eg. bar charts, column charts, pie charts. You can stack two dimensions to get a comparative charts. 

Q. In Cognos Insight,How about the size, for example, if I want to import flat file with size 3 GB, it can be done? 
A. Yes you can import huge amounts of data using Cognos Insight. 

Q. What are the System requirements to install TM1 10.2 version ? 
A. You can find system requirements and conformance for 10.2 here:

Q. Can TM1 perform Predictive Analysis on reports/cubes based on data? 
A. You can perform forecast analysis using spreading techniques. Built in forecast is not available. 

Q. Is there any option migrating Application from one server to another server? 
A. You can transfer out the application from one server and then use transfer in to import in another server. 

Q. In Cognos Insight can we format the colour of cube cells and also the colour of the template? 
A. It is not possible to change cell colour individually but you can apply different themes in cognos insight to change colours of widgets. 

Q. Can we have multiple security modes ( 1 & 5) in TM1 Application portal for different TM1 servers ? 
A. In order to use multiple Cognos TM1 servers in Cognos TM1 Applications, they must all use the same security authentication (either Cognos TM1 standard authentication or Cognos BI security) and include the same administrator user name and password. 
Do not use a combination of different security authentication modes for the same installation of Cognos TM1 Applications. 
Determine the security mode before you configure Cognos TM1 Applications to use a Cognos TM1 server and use that same security mode with any additional servers you add.

Q. What is the best way to design model, create it with architect or performance modeller? 
A. It depends on your comfort level. Many advanced features like score carding, data flow diagram are only available in Performance Modeler. 

Q. Can we import themes apart from built in? in Cognos Insight? 
A. Only built in themes are supported. 

Q. Can we apply tuning on TM1 as we apply tuning on Cognos BI? This question is from Administrator perspective. 
A. You can tune TM1 using cfg file. Also you can go for web server tuning and OS level tuning.
