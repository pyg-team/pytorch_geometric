ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer needs to work from Excel sheets and wants to be able to
   use them as a data source in TI via Architect, as this works
   through Performance Modeler - this alignment is requested in
   enhancement COGCQ00708694, but has not yet been implemented.
    Our documentation states the text source needs to be a
   comma-delimited file (i.e. .cma/.csv).  If the user tries to use
   xls anyway it creates gibberish in the preview.  Given that they
   shouldn't be using the xls/xlsx file, TI in Architect should not
   allow the user to choose the xls option - that is the defect
   here.

COMMENTS
 *  This is not a defect. The product is working as designed.
   
   
   Among the data sources supported by TurboIntegrator (TI) are tex
   t files formatted as character-separated values or CSV. Common s
   eparator characters are the comma, the colon, the semicolon, the
    tab, the vertical bar (also referred to as pipe) and the space
   character. As the comma is widely used as separator character CS
   V is generally understood as comma-separated values.
   
   A general standard for the CSV file format does not exist. Thus
   a standard file suffix for a CSV file does not exist. Although t
   he .CSV and .CMA file suffixes are widely used, a CSV file can u
   se any random file suffix including the .XLS or the .XLSX file s
   uffix. Thus the TI Editor of TM1 Architect and TM1 Perspectives
   can not hide files having the .XLS or the .XLSX file suffix.
   
   
   Typically a .XLS or .XLSX file suffix indicates that the file in
    question is an Excel workbook.
   
   The TI Editor of TM1 Architect and TM1 Perspectives does not sup
   port Excel workbooks as data sources. Only the TI Editor of TM1
   Performance Modeler supports Excel workbooks as data sources.
   
   Using the TI Editor of TM1 Architect or TM1 Perspectives, you ha
   ve two options when Excel workbooks are your data sources:
   Either export the Excel workbooks into CSV files.
   Or you may use the Excel workbooks as ODBC data sources which ar
   e queried using the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Excel.
