APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This documentation defect is to address the instructions for
   configuring both a client and a server for SSL communication.
   There are two documents in InfoCenter that are associated with
   this issue:
   
   Client side: "Configuring a Client for SSL Connections" at
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/idshelp/v115/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.sec.doc/ids_ssl_003.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/idshelp/v115/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.sec.doc/ids_ssl_003.htm]
   
   Server side: "Configuring a Server Instance for Secure Sockets
   Layer Connections" at
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/idshelp/v115/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.sec.doc/ids_ssl_002.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/idshelp/v115/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.sec.doc/ids_ssl_002.htm]
   
   There are four key points that should be addressed in a
   documentation update:
   
   ITEM 1. The conssl.cfg file needs to be created in the
   $INFORMIXDIR/etc directory. ect location for the file, this
   still needs to be explicitly stated in the documentation for
   clarity.
   
   ITEM 2. The link to the "Manage Keystores and Digital
   Certificates with the IBM Global Security Kit" document should
   be updated:
   
   PDF format:
   ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/library/v6
   1/ihs/GSK7c_CapiCmd_UserGuide.pdf
   ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/library/v6
   1/ihs/GSK7c_SSL_Ikm_Guide.pdf"
   
   IBM HTTP Server V7.0 Information Center:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/info/ihs/ihs/cihs_ikeycmdline.h [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/info/ihs/ihs/cihs_ikeycmdline.h]
   tml
   
   ITEM 3. In addition to clarifying the links to the documentation
   on the gskit commands noted above, it would be beneficial to
   provide a simple example of common commands to run to complete
   the steps noted in the client and server configuration
   documents, along with a notation to refer to the above mentioned
   gskit documentation for further syntax clarification.
   
   ITEM 4. If any of the server utilities (dbaccess, etc) need to
   connect to the server via SSL, users are required to setup
   client keystore on the server by following the steps documented
   in "Configuring a Client for SSL Connections". An additional
   notation should be added to the end of the current "Configuring
   a Server Instance for Secure Sockets Layer Connections" document
   to specify this requirement.
