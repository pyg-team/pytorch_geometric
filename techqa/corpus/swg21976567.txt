 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a vulnerability in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Version 7 that is used by TPF Toolkit. This vulnerability, commonly referred to as “SLOTH”, was disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/UI:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575:

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

 * Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 
 * Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA


Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
