Text:
tivoli_eif.rules UNKNOWN ITM TEMS Severity TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 All events are set to UNKNOWN, no other severities used, source sending to the EIF probe is commonly ITM. 

CAUSE
Standard eif probe install, maybe upgraded so that later code is used, This has included a standard tivoli_eif.rules not suited for dealing with ITM events.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
All events go through as UNKNOWN.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure the appropriate rules file is provided with the ITM pack in use - or for whatever application the events are sourced from, nearly all applications should be providing eif rules to enable their events to pass into Omnibus with appropriate fields of interest.
