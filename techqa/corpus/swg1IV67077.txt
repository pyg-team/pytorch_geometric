APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OOM caused by ITMEvent and ITMMediationFlowPrimitive objects
   that get created
   because the events have no BPM correlation data (sfid,
   fromSOCode, toSOCode, currentSOCode are empty), these events are
   not written yet as metrics but they are cached and waiting for
   "WPS61Tracker" Server Enter invocation to get these correlation
   data
   from this invocation.   Because there is a large number of these
   events and no WSP61Tracker Server Enter invocation, the  cached
   gets so big that the JVM goes OOM.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Those monitoring Business Process Manager(BPM)
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Under some circumstances BPM would not
   * initialise all classes correctly. This leads to a variety of
   * errors but ultimately OutOfMemoryExceptions occur as ITMEvent
   * and ITMMediationFlowPrimitive objects accumulate.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply 7.2.0.1 IF0005
   ****************************************************************
   Due to some initialisation errors, consumers of events may not
   be created. This can lead to infinite objects accumulating.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A hard cap of 5,000 objects per queue was introduced
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
