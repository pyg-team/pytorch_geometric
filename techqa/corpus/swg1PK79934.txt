COMMENTS
 *  The ClearQuest Eclipse Client receives the report as an HTML
   document and displays the HTML document in an embedded
   browser (Internet Explorer on Windows operating systems,
   which is not configurable).  This is a problem in the
   Internet Explorer browser.
   
   The formatting problems can be replicated outside the
   ClearQuest Eclipse Client by right clicking on the report
   and selecting View Source.  Save the resulting document to
   the file system, and use Internet Explorer to view the file.
    You will notice the same formatting issues are seen almost
   immediately.
   
   Using other Web Browsers to display the report also have
   problems.  Loading the HTML file in Firefox left Firefox in
   an unresponsive state. Loading the HTML file in Chrome left
   Chrome in a slow state, but the report eventually loaded,
   without the formatting issues.
   
   Functionality added for ClearQuest 7.1 provides the
   capability to display the report in the ClearQuest Eclipse
   Client in the same viewer that the Windows client uses, and
   does not exhibit the formatting problems observed with the
   HTML document. To enable this functionality, install and
   configure the Report Server for Crystal Reports and
   configure the ClearQuest Eclipse Client to use the Report
   Server for Crystal Reports.
