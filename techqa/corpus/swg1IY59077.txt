ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  pdwebpi on IHS 1.3.28 on Linux does not provide correct SSO LTPA
   token for WAS if it is configured towards Policy Server on AD.
   STEPS to reproduce
   1) configure pdwebpi on IHS ( IHS has plug-in for WAS ) towards
      Policy Server on AD 2000
   2) edit pdwebpi.conf to enable ltpa token sso to was ( refer to
      manual "Plug-in for Web Servers Integration Guide 5.1" page
   127 )
   .
   3) open a browser and go http://apache/snoop/servlet you will be
    prompted for TAM plug-in BA , once you have succesfully filled
   i than WAS ask you to provide a second login .. that means WAS d
   id not recognize the ltpa token.
   In the was log you can see that the plug-in seems to not be able
    to include the credential in the token
   .
   in the was log :
   SECJ0373E: Cannot create credential for the user <null> during
   the Validation of the token.
   The exception is
   com.ibm.websphere.security.CustomRegistryException: Cannot find
   uniqueID for the user unauthenticated at
   .
   NOTE 1) This problem does not arose if the Plug-in is configured
   against a Policy Server on LDAP.
   NOTE 2) If on the Pdpwepi machine it is configured WebSeal and c
   reate a junction ltpa than the SSO works ( of coureither using
   AD or LDAP as user registry
   NOTE 3) I've repplicated the problem on SuSe sles 8 with pdpwepi
    gold ( no fixpack ) on top oh IHS 1.3.28, customer has replicat
   ed on REDHAT and also used pdpwebpi FP1
