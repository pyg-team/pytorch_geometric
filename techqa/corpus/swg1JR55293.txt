ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you start an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) application
   cluster or stand-alone server, the IBM BPM related applications
   start, which involves certain initialization steps. In rare
   cases, these operations might lock each other and cause group
   synchronization to fail. In the SystemOut.log file of the
   server, you find stack traces similar to the following stack
   traces:
   [09/02/16 06:26:05:208 CET] 000000f1 GroupCore     E
   com.lombardisoftware.server.core.GroupCore
   ExternalGroupSynchronizer:run
   synchronization of external group fails with:
   
   com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException: Problems during
   replication of Groups, resetting Group Info cache
   at com.lombardisoftware.server.core.GroupCore.
     getAllGroupsInternal(GroupCore.java:1498)
   
   Caused by:
   com.lombardisoftware.client.delegate.BusinessDelegateException:
   Some object reference in the name "ejb/PersistenceServices"
   relative to the context "cell/clusters/PRD001.AppTarget" is
   invalid.
   
   Some possible causes include a context binding in the name which
   refers to a destroyed context, or an object binding which
   contains an invalid EJBHome reference.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After your application server has started, you can stop and
   restart the IBM BPM Teamworks application from the
   administrative console.
   
   Note: The application name depends on your node and server name
   and follows the naming schema
   
   IBM_BPM_Teamworks_<appTarget>
   
   where <appTarget> either is the application cluster name (IBM
   BPM Advanced or IBM BPM Standard) or the node name and server
   name of the stand-alone server (IBM BPM Express or IBM
   Integration Designer).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The group synchronization launched while the server started
   requires access to a EJB resource. If the EJB is not available,
   the thread must wait and a lock on the EJB cache is set. If the
   group synchronization is started too early, this lock prevents
   the server startup thread from updating the EJB cache and
   completing the load of the EJB. After two minutes, the group
   synchronization thread stops with a timeout and the lock is
   released. The server thread finishes the start up procedure, but
   the group synchronization fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 Cumulative Fix 2 that
   changes the initialization  sequence to run the group
   synchronization only when all resources are available.
