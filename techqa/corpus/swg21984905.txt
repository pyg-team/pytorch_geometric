CAUSE
KVOOP (kvoop.exe) is part of the KeyView application which Domino uses for filtering attachments. It stands for "keyview out of process". 

KVOOP runs anytime Domino works on the full-text index of a database that contains attachments (i.e.: when creating or updating full text index). It is normal that it runs often. 

When full text index for specific databases with particular attachments get corrupted , faulting kvoop messages will be generated as application event.


ENVIRONMENT
Domino 8.5.3 FP6 64-bit 

Windows 2008 64bit (Simplified Chinese)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If it's hard to identify the corrupted attachment due to lots of databases indexing, recommend to disable Domain Index Search if no longer required. 

If it's not an option, you can consider to turn off attachment indexing by setting the following NOTES.INI variable on the indexing server:

FT_Index_Attachments=2

Restarting server is required.
