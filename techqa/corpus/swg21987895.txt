PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the upgrade P8 from 5.1.1 to 5.2.1, when users tried to access Workflow System via acce, they found that only 1 of 4 servers in the CPE cluster is connecting to the PE database. For the rest of the servers, when they are trying to get to the Workflow system, they are getting error below. 
[FNRPE2131090405E]Unexpected exception -- see chained exception Root cause:java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: filenet.jpe.database.DbDate 
(initialization failure) 


SYMPTOM
Here is the screen shot of the error : 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987895&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987895&aid=1]

And here is the log reported in PE system log : 

2016/07/23 12:20:31.760-0500 TaskManager PESecondary1 [Error] Can't 
startup database for: CP1 dbo.FNMedRecOSDS; Exception: 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: filenet.jpe.database.DbDate 
(initialization failure) 
... 
Cased by .. Exception: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
filenet.jpe.database.DbDate (initialization failure) 
..


CAUSE
IBM 1.6 SR12 was not installed on the affected servers. The working server had IBM 1.6 SR12 installed. 


ENVIRONMENT
CPE 5.2.1, Windows, cluster environment. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The exception "Cased by .. Exception: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:filenet.jpe.database.DbDate (initialization failure)" message is misleading. It seems to indicate that the filenet.jpe.database.DbDate class. However, this class exists in the peengine-ejb.jar file. 

To address the issue, install the Java SDK 1.6 SR12 Cumulative Fix for WebSphere Application Server to match up with the working server. Refer to link below for information on 1.6 SR12.
