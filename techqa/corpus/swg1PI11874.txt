You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The XMLLIB XPATH function requires three arguments. When an
   incorrect XPATH map rule is used with only two arguments the
   Design Studio map compiles the map successfully with no compile
   error.  The command line mcompile utility does report the error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ -WTX00044414
   EJ / EJ
   Circumvention: Correct the map rule to use 3 arguments.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender Design Studio users
   
   Problem Description:
   Design Studio fails to validate map rules using dynamic library
   functions with insufficient parameters provided by the user and
   map compilation succeeds when it should fail the same.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Win32
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Conclusion:
   Fixed a problem with Design Studio where it now validates the
   rules properly when the map rule uses any of the dynamic library
   functions and insufficient number of parameters has been
   provided by the user.
