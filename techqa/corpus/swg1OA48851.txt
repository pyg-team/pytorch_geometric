   The Omegamon e3270ui Self-Describing Agent fails in a z/OS 2.2
   environment when USS is configured with KERNELSTACKS(ABOVE).
   This failure does not occur when USS is configured with
   KERNELSTACKS(BELOW).  The RAS1 log shows "TEMS_MANIFEST_PATH
   directory <dir> does not exist!", and the Self-Describing Agent
   is disabled.
