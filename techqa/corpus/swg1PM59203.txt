APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempting to export a module to RIF which is configured for use
   with the change integration will result in the message 'Could
   not export module 'moduleName' - formal module is not open for
   edit'
   
   This is because the integration creates a trigger which prevents
   the module from being opened invisibly or in edit mode. The RIF
   export requires that the module be opened invisibly (if not also
   for edit).
   
   So there is a effectively a clash in the design of each
   component here, but perhaps not one that couldn't be overcome,
   at least in some circumstances e.g. when exporting to RIF
   without locking data.
   
   To recreate:
   
    - configure a module for use in the Change integration
    - add that module to a RIF definition (no locks) and attempt to
   export that definition
   
   Potential workaround:
   
   Loosen the control of the integration trigger.... This is
   slightly dubious and will probably need more input from each
   side.

   ****************************************************************
   RIF requires modules to be opend for exclusive edit to allow
   locks and RIF ID's to be updated on export.
   Change Integration triggers prevent modules under change
   control from being opened for exclusive edit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It is possible to export a read-only module if locks are not
   applied - RIF ID's need to be updated but this can be done
   without saving any other module data.
