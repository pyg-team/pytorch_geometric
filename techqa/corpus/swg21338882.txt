Title: IBM CAM-AAA-0022 error on AIX - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CRN fails to start up. Some CAM errors indicate problems with a Namespace even though
the NS is up and can be accessed by other apps fine. 

SYMPTOM
in crnserver.log
CAM-AAA-0022 The provider <some path>./bin/libCAM_AAA_AuthSeries7.so could not load.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The given Lib can't load. Either because it's not found or some subcomponent is not there.


Steps -

- check the LIBPATH
- do a "dump -n [lib] > dump.txt"
This will give you all the libs this particular lib is depending on. Check every single one of them
a) for existence
b) accessibly by the user aka File permission
c) can it be reached , is the path to it in the LIBPATH
- if there's a Series7 installation for the same useraccount there may be problems with the order
of the PATH or LIBPATH entries. Set the PATH or LIBPATH explicitly in the products startscripts
instead of the profile.
- make sure there's no (other) process blocking the file
- check "ulimit -aS" and "ulimit -aH" for the nofiles parameter which should be at least 1024.
- if installed a "ldd" (not common on AIX) will show similar information
