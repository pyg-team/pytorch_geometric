PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Workplace XT 1.1.5 receives, Bad Response from Server message while Browsing Content Engine using SiteMinder SSO. 

SYMPTOM
While accessing Workplace XT (WPXT) with SiteMinder (SM) SSO configuration, the following error may appear while browsing for Content (e.g. accessing documents from within configured Object Stores)



Bad response from server


CAUSE
The WPXT page is used to hold the post data while the SiteMinder session is being updated (the update happens every 30 seconds via a redirect to smmakecookie.ccc). If the post data is large or if the webserver is slow, this error page shows up. 

Clicking on "OK" will allow you to continue or wait and it will automatically go away once the post preservation process is done.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create a new parameter named "overlooksessionformethods" in the Site Minder agent configuration object for the HTTP servers, and set its value to POST


Example: 


OverlookSessionForMethods=POST 


Here is the description of the setting from CA Site Minder:

OverlookSessionForMethods

Specifies whether the Web Agent compares the request method of all HTTP requests against the methods listed in this parameter. If a match occurs, the Web Agent does not create or update an SMSESSION cookie. Also, cookie providers (if configured) are not updated for that request.

Default: No default
