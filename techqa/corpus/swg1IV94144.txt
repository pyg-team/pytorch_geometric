 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Screens work in Firefox but not in Internet Explorer.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Switch off Compatibility Mode and/or Enterprise Mode in      *

   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In previous versions (3.9 and 4.1.1) ITNM had a (TIP)
   requirement to run IE in compatibility mode. iTNM 4.2 has a
   (DASH) requirement to not run IE in this mode, but the
   documentation was carried over from 3.9/4.1.1 and therefore
   advised the user erroneously. This has been corrected.
