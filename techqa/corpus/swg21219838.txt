PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following are problems that you might encounter when you use the WebSphereÂ® Message Brokers Toolkit Version V6.0 at Fix Pack 1 level. These problems might occur when you attempt to import a COBOL copybook using either the New Message Definition File wizard or the mqsicreatemsgdefs command.

Defect T23691: The figurative constants LOW-VALUE(S), HIGH-VALUE(S) and NULL are not supported. 

Defect 37671 : The copybook must contain at least one 01 level structure. If there is no 01 level structure, no objects (elements, groups, types) are imported. 

Defect T26269.1: The keywords 'VALUE QUOTES', 'VALUE SPACES', 'VALUE ZEROES' and 'VALUE ALL <literal>' create an equivalent default value, but it is not necessarily long enough to completely fill the element. 

Defect T27487.1: VALUE used on a group item does not set default values for the child items. 

Defect T27501.1: Hexadecimal literals (for example, x'FF') are not supported. Default values cannot be created correctly by importing a hexadecimal literal. 

Defect T27754.1: Character ranges in Level 88 items assume the ASCII collating order. Specifically, a range such as "VALUES ARE 'aaaa' THROUGH 'ZZZZ'" does not import because 'Z' is not greater than 'a' in the ASCII collating order. 

Defect T46037: A data-item using PIC N and JUSTIFIED clause prevents the source file from importing. Remove the JUSTIFIED clause to import the file. 

CAUSE
Limitations in the COBOL importer technology used by the Message Brokers Toolkit.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In general, if the COBOL copybook fails to import, the copybook must be corrected before importing again. If the copybook imports successfully, the resulting message model can be corrected using the message definition editor. 

Any specific workarounds are detailed above.
