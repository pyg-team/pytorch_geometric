ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OutOfMemory errors when migrating several million instances
   during snapshot migration.
   
   When migrating several million instances it may require
   upwards of 3-4 GB of heap space leading to Out of Memory errors
   if the JVM is not large enough.
   
   Part of this will be an instance ID array similar to this:
   1,397,526,832 (24.56%) [24] 1 java/util/ArrayList 0x7003c0db8
   |- 1,397,526,808 (24.56%) [38,780,464] 7,555,066 array of
   java/lang/Object 0x74dd3b0f0
      |- 256 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x725169690
      |- 240 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x728b46340
      |- 240 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x72fda64d0
      |- 240 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x72a8db910
      |- 240 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x727abc780
      |- 240 (0%) [24] 1 java/lang/String 0x729b87000
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increase the heap size until the migration can succeed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you migrate a large number of inflight process instances
   between snapshots, you might receive an OutOfMemory error that
   might cause the JVM to fail.

   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   No additional information is available.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION ?
   The fix is available for an IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 cumulative fix that
   uses heap memory more efficiently and does not retain as much
   memory at a time.
