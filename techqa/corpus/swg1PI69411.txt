APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have opened an IBM SPSS Statistics Output Viewer file in
   Statistics 24.0 Fixpack 1.  Or, you have  created a new Output
   Viewer file based on a prior IBM SPSS Statistics command syntax
   file.  In your output you see line graphs created from both the
   Chart Builder dialogs (using GGRAPH command syntax) and the
   older "Legacy Dialogs" (using GRAPH command syntax).
   
   You open each for editing and find that you are unable to change
   the line weight for the lines depicted in the older "Legacy
   Dialogs/GRAPH command syntax" graphs.
   
   Workaround:  Re-create these graphs using the newer "Chart
   Builder" menus and GGRAPH command syntax.  These should be fully
   editable.
