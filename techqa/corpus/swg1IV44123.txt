ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product/VRM: MSSQL agent 06.23.00.00 64bit
   Operating System/VRM: Windows 2008R2 64bit
   Monitoring Env: ITM 6.23 fp02
   Monitored application/VRM/OS: MSSQL 2008R2
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The problem is caused by inproper setting of PATH environment
   variable.
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Install the Monitoring SQL Agent 6.23 (64 bit ) (Before
   installing, uninstall the previously installed SQL agent if any
   and restart machine).
   2. Reconfigure the SQL monitoring agent and use the protocol
   IP.SPIPE.
   Default is IP.PIPE.
   (For detail attached the screen shot 1).

   4. Start monitoring SQL Agent , TEMS and TEPS.
   5. Please verify the data on portal ( you will not able to see
   any data on portal)
   It failed with following errormessage:
   (4DCCF38F.0009-F60:kraarreg.cpp,1905,"FindProxyUsingLocalLookup"
   ) Unable to create socket to host IP.SPIPE:tsalpar6, status =
   1002000a
   (4DCCF38F.000A-F60:kraarreg.cpp,1918,"FindProxyUsingLocalLookup"
   ) Unable to find running CMS on CT_CMSLIST <IP.SPIPE:tsalpar6>
   In the header of the MSSQL agent log this can be found:
   (4DCCEC87.0129-55C:kdebprc.c,1105,"static_constructor") SSL
   interface module kdebe unavailable
   (4DCCEC87.012A-55C:kde1lsd.c,693,"bind_setup") Transport not
   found: IP.SPIPE
   Higher tracelevel then showed this:
   (4DD281A0.0090-EF4:kbbcs1l.c,43,"load_module")
   LoadLibraryEx(C:&#65415;IBM&#65415;ITM&#65415;GSK7_x64&#65415;lib64&#65415;kdebe.dll) returned
   error 0x7E
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the agent env file add the TMAITM6_x64 (for example,
   C:&#65415;IBM&#65415;ITM&#65415;TMAITM6_x64) directory to the PATH.
   The issue was fixed in ITM622 fp8 as IV08547 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV08547].  The same fix need
   to goto the ITM 623 and ITM 630 releases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Microsoft SQL Server Agent on 64-bit Windows does not connect to
    the monitoring server using IP.SPIPE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  HOME\TMAITM6_x64 was placed in the PATH variable to replace
   HOME\TMAITM6. The GSKit 64-bit library directory was added to
   the PATH variable for 64-bit agents, and the PATH variable was
   placed in the ENV file in front of the PATH! variable.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0005
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Edit the KOQENV file and replace HOME\TMAITM6 with
   HOME\TMAITM6_x64 in the PATH variable. Also replace
   HOME\GSK7\lib with HOME\GSK7_x64\lib64. Move the PATH variable
   before the PATH! variable in the file. Stop and restart the
   agent to activate the changes.
