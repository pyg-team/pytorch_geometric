 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In production, we do not see all of the potential duplicate tasks show up in the inbox. For example we have the following number of tasks...

Hereâ€™s the list of tasks from the db table:

PD 3,894
PL 32,726
RI 11,112

The tasks are assigned to user "system" but only a handful of the PD tasks ever show up by default for user system. If I filter the inbox to show only PD tasks then they all show up. I see no errors in the logs that can explain what is going on 

ANSWER
By design the in-box list is populated by the trigger member's creation time and returns 1000 tasks by default regardless of the task type. As a work around, you can use the "Data Manage" menu to create a Tag and define a Rule for the specific task types you need.
