 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to run report by clicking on 'Run with option' and selecting formatting type as CSV format, the output data is shown in a single column instead of separate column. The same behaviour is also observed when the report is send through email as an attachment. 

CAUSE
The following parameters where set at the ReportService and BatchReportService. 

RSVP.CSV.DELIMITER set to , 
RSVP.FILE.EXTENSION.XLS set to TRUE 
RSVP.CSV.MIMETYPE set to application/vnd.ms-excel 

These parameter should have been placed at the parent level ie. in the dispatcher properties.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The resolution to this issue involves two steps: 

a) Removing the parameters from ReportService and BatchReportService. 

 1) Login to Cognos Administration. 

 2) Click on Configuration (Tab) -> 'Dispatcher and Services' . Then click on the dispatcher URL so that it list all the services. 

 3) Click on Set properties [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439447&amp;aid=1] of ReportService -> Settings (Tab) -> Click on Edit link next to Advanced Settings. Remove all the parameters and Click on Ok. 

 RSVP.CSV.DELIMITER set to , [Comma] 
RSVP.FILE.EXTENSION.XLS set to TRUE 
RSVP.CSV.MIMETYPE set to application/vnd.ms-excel


 Follow the same steps for BatchReportService. 

 

b) Adding the parameters to parent level ie. in the dispatcher properties. 

 1) Login to Cognos Administration. 

 2) Click on Configuration (Tab) -> 'Dispatcher and Services' . 

 3) Click on 'Set properties - Configuration' [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439447&amp;aid=2] at the top right corner -> Settings (Tab) -> Click on Edit link next to Advanced Settings. Add the following parameters and Click on Ok. 

 RSVP.CSV.DELIMITER set to , 
RSVP.FILE.EXTENSION.XLS set to TRUE 
RSVP.CSV.MIMETYPE set to application/vnd.ms-excel

Restart the Cognos Service for the changes to take effect.
