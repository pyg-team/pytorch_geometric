Title: IBM Several menu items such as 'Controller Link' (inside main Controller client) and "Data Entry"  (inside Excel link) are greyed out for unrestricted users - United States

Text:
grayed disabled gray inactive grey greyed TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User launches Controller. User finds that the "Excel link" (Controller link) shortcut menu item is unavailable (greyed-out).

If the user manually launches Excel (and then logs onto the Controller link from there) they find that the data entry functions are not enabled (they too are greyed out and inacessible).

In addition, the Excel form cells are grey (not writable). 

SYMPTOM
Controller link shortcut disabled in main Controller client (CCR.EXE): 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634513&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634513&aid=1] 

Data entry functions are not available:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634513&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634513&aid=2]


CAUSE
There are several possible causes for inactive/disabled (grey) menu items. The most likely cause is that the 'bad' user belongs to a Controller menu security group where the menu item(s) have been disabled. 

 * In other words, the user belongs to a restrictive group. For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1394780.


This IBM Technote relates to the scenario where the user does not belong to a restrictive group - instead the user is allowed to see everything.  * Again, there are several possible causes for this. See separate IBM Technote #1656553 for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is that the customer is hosting their Controller (application repository) database inside an Oracle database that has an unsupported (Unicode) character set. 
ENVIRONMENT
Controller application repository database inside an Oracle database that has an unsupported (Unicode) character set.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use the following script to find the values of the relevant Oracle database: 

 * TIP: For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1347750.


Connect system/<password>@<database_name> AS SYSDBA 
select * from nls_database_parameters; 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Configure the Controller application repository to use an Oracle database using the 'supported' character set (WE8MSWIN1252 & National Character Set AL16UTF16).

Steps:
1. Create a new Oracle database using the 'supported' character set (WE8MSWIN1252 & National Character Set AL16UTF16) 

 * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1347750.

2. Export the Controller schema from the 'bad' database to a DMP file, for example by using EXPDP 
3. Import the Controller schema into the 'good' database from that DMP file, for example by using IMPDP  * For more information on steps 2 & 3, see separate IBM Technote #1347756.
