ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Work Order Tracking GL Account warning message
   
   Problem description
   In Work Order Tracking (T&D), if a GL Account is on the work
   order
   record, then you choose a Location, there will be a GL warning
   message
   (see below) regardless of whether there is a GL on the Location
   record
   or not. Should we get the warning message only if there is a GL
   Account
   on the Location record?
   
   Customer needs that this message does not display, even when
   your assets or locations have no GL account associated.
   
   Warning message:
   BMXAA4510E - The location and asset combination you have
   entered would
   default a different GL account than is currently specified on
   the work
   order.  Would you like to update the work order's GL account
   based on
   the new asset/location combination?  Clicking Cancel will
   return you
   with no changes.
   
   This is causing issue with the users as they do not know what
   needs to
   be done. They are confused why they should get the message when
   the GL
   is already there.
   
   We provided some workaround, however customer wants to have a
   solution
   on a out of the box environment, since they do not accept this
   feature.
   
   Customer needs that this message does not display, even when
   your assets or locations have no GL account associated.
   
   Customer said :
   
   I have discussed this issue with Gentiana as I feel that this
   is still an issue and should be resolved out of the box. We
   are aware of removing the button from the dialogue box but
   that would be another click for user to close the dialogue
   box that is not needed. If GL account already exists then
   this warning message should not come upon selection of a
   Location. Gentiana was looking into having a session with the
   Product Manager. Although, we have found a work around
   solution but would prefer if this could be resolved in a Out
   of box solution. Customer needs that this message does not
   display, even when your assets or locations have no GL account
   associated.
