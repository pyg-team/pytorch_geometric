APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When importing a BPMN process diagram via an SA XML file, while
   the original file is still open, the not a valid format error is
   seen in IBM Rational System Architect.
   
   Configuration:
   ------------
   Environment = Microsoft Windows (R)
   Tool = IBM Rational System Architect (R)
   Version = 11.4.2
   Integration = SA Process Integrator with Microsoft Office Visio
   (R) 2007
   
   Detailed Description:
   --------------------
   This issue is know to occur in two scenarios.
   
   Scenario #1
   Importing the SAXML of a BPM diagram with the original diagram
   still open in Visio.
   
   Scenario #2
   Re-importing the SAXML of a BPM diagram with the original
   diagram still open in Visio.
   
   Symptom:
   -------
   Error Message:
   The imported diagram xml is not a valid format as supported by
   SAPI.
   
   Impact:
   ------
   You may think there is something wrong when there may not be.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   ------------------
   Scenario #1
   1. Create a BPMN diagram within Visio using SAPI
   2. Save the file as a .vsd file
   3. Export the file into SAXML
   4. Import the exported SAXML file into Visio
      (ensure that the original file is still open)
   
   Scenario #1
   1. Follows steps 1-3 above
   2. Import into SA (optional: change models if you wish!)
   3. Export from SA into XML
   4. Import the exported SAXML file into Visio
      (ensure that the original file is still open)
   
   Expected Results:
   ----------------
   The (re-)import happens without an error message.
   
   Actual Result:
   -------------
   On the (re-)import an error message is displayed.
   
   WORKAROUND
   close the original diagram within Visio.

   ****************************************************************
   "The imported diagram xml is not a valid format as supported
   by SAPI" error message received when importing a BPMN
   process diagram via an SA XML file, while the original file
   is still open.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There are no plans to address this issue. The problem only
   occurs with the same diagram xml (obtained either from
   System Architect or Process Integrator) being imported more
   than once in the same session. Importing of different
   diagrams is not affected. The resolution is to close the
   original diagram within Visio. The client has agreed to
   concede this issue.
