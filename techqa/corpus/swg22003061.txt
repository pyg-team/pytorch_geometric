 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
 

When using IHS 8.5.5.10 and if installing Connections Surveys on Connections 6.0 surveys will not work and you will see a blank page when accessing the following:
https://hostname/surveys/secure/org/ide/manager.html [https://ic6conn.mulvm.ie.ibm.com/surveys/secure/org/ide/manager.html]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

There is a known issue with ESI Cache.
The current workaround is to disable ESI Cache for 8.5.5.10 when configuring Connections/Surveys. 

1.
Steps to disable it are as follows:

You can do it from ISC using Servers > Server Types > Web servers > [webserver name] > Plug-in properties > Caching then uncheck "Enable Edge Side Include (ESI) processing to cache the responses".

Or you can do it manually as follows:

Find the file plugin-cfg.xml under proper directory, for example, /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/config/webserver1/

Set the value of ESIEnabled to false, see following: 
<Log LogLevel="Error" Name="/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/logs/webserver1/http_plugin.log"/>
<Property Name="ESIEnable" Value="false"/>
<Property Name="ESIMaxCacheSize" Value="1024"/>
<Property Name="ESIInvalidationMonitor" Value="false"/> 

2.
Restart the web server and verify if this resolves the issue.
