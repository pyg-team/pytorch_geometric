Title: IBM Using the MS SQL agent Dump Tran Date attribute for time comparisons - United States

Text:
Dump Tran Date SQL agent ITM ITCAM attribute group time timestamp YYYYMMDD data type comparison compare ; 5724B96MOTR TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can you use the Dump Tran Date attribute (MS SQL Database Detail attribute group) for time comparisons? 

CAUSE
The description of the Dump Tran Date attribute in the MS SQL Database Detail group is incorrect in the user's guide. The user's guide mentions that the value of the Dump Tran Date attribute displays the date and time when the dump transaction command was last executed. However, the value of the Dump Tran Date attribute displays only the date when the dump transaction command was last executed. 

The following description of the Dump Tran Date attribute is correct:
The timestamp that indicates the date on which the dump transaction command was last executed for the database.

You cannot perform time comparisons by using this attribute because the data type of this attribute is not Time+Date. To check the age of a backup, you must create a situation that is triggered when the last backup reaches a specific age (for example 24 hours).


ANSWER
The IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Microsoft Applications: Microsoft SQL Server Agent user's guide will be updated so they reflect the correct behavior of this attribute
