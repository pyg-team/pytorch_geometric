Title: IBM How to resolve RTC server hang issue caused by running out of threads in Tomcat application server - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) server becomes unreachable with out of memory errors reported in application server log. 

SYMPTOM
 

Noticed Tomcat Catalina log was reporting out of memory errors due to maximum threads reach. RTC would just hang when OOM is thrown.


CAUSE

Maximum threads set in Tomcat is reached, therefore there is not enough memory to host additional access requests.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Adjust the maximum thread size for the connector port in the Tomcat server.xml file. Refer to the Rational Team Concert 3.0 sizing guide [https://jazz.net/library/article/551/] for guidance regarding the value size to set. See sample code below: 

 

<Connector port="9443" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" 

maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75" 

enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true" 

acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true" 

clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
