Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM WebSphere MQ (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM WebSphere MQ. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

 * Apply fix pack 7.0.1.13 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960691]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
All Platforms IBM strongly recommends immediately changing any channel definitions that use any of the following RC4 MQ CipherSpecs to use a stronger encryption algorithm; 


 * RC4_SHA_US 
 * TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * RC4_MD5_US 
 * TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 
 * RC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024 
 * RC4_MD5_EXPORT 
 * TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 
 * ECDHE_ECDSA_RC4_128_SHA256 
 * ECDHE_RSA_RC4_128_SHA256 
 * TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA256



Note that IBM might need to deprecate the use of weaker algorithms in response to a security vulnerability, for example MQ CipherSpecs that are not certified as FIPS 140-2 compliant via future product maintenance. 

The IBM WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.3 fixpack deprecates the use of a number of CipherSpecs that are considered to be weak, this includes the use of RC4. 

Further details on the MQ CipherSpecs that are currently available can be found here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q014260_.htm]. 

IBM WebSphere MQ for IBM i 
IBM recommends that customers review system value QSSLCSL [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_71/rzakz/rzakzqsslcsl.htm] to prevent the use of the RC4 cipher.  

IBM WebSphere MQ for UNIX, Linux, Windows & IBM MQ Appliance M2000 

On other distributed platforms, enabling FIPS mode [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q010140_.htm] on a queue manager prevents weak ciphers including RC4 from being accepted by inbound connections and also from being used by outbound connections.

You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher exposes you to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
