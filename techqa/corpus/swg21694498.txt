Title: IBM Object Server - WebGUI Restriction Filters - United States

Text:
filter fails; AEL filter; event restriction; restrict users TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Restriction Filters created in the ObjectServer and applied to a Group have no effect on WebGUI users who are members of that group. 

CAUSE
The group does not exist in WebGUI.

ANSWER
Using the group ObjRFTest as an example, proceed as follows:

1) In OMNIbus, create your Restriction Filter - eg Severity = > 2
2) Create a group, ObjRFTest in WebGUI and assign it ncw_* roles
3) Populate it with your user, TestUser1 
4) In the ObjectServer, once WebgUI synchronisation has occurred, apply 
the Restriction Filter to the group ObjRFTest

You should now be able to see the filter working when TestUser1 next logs into WebGUI and 
opens an Event List.

You can also verify that the filter is in place:

Click Settings > User Preferences for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Web GUI. 
Then, select TestUser1 and click Modify - the filter will be displayed 
in the User filter field.
