Title: IBM Portal Installer fails to find all WAS runtimes in Rational Application Developer 7.5.5.x - United States

Text:
portal installer; unable to find WAS instances TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When attempting to install Portal, the Portal Installer fails to find all WAS runtimes that exist on the system.

SYMPTOM
Portal Installer provides a truncated list when looking for existing WAS runtimes on the system.


CAUSE
Portal uses a combination of methods to try to find WAS because there is not one method that works universally. It's different on every platform, and for a given OS, WAS uses different types of registries with different releases. In addition, there are different ways of installing WAS, and some of them don't leave any standard footprint in a well-known place.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the following location for WinXP, C:\Documents and Settings\<user_name>\Local Settings\Temp, a file called installmessages.txt will be generated which lists the WAS locations found.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The recommended solution is to use the "-W wasListPanel.existingWasLocation" or "-W was.undetectedWas" parameters to pass the location of the existing WAS location. 

i.e. install.bat -W was.undetectedWas=<AppServer location>
