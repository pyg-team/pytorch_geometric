RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Opened DOC APAR IV61898 to document that: 


During upgrade, there have been cases where database changes were not committed into database which caused failure like: 

CTJZH2073E - An unexpected error occurred in the extension class com.ibm.ism.pmtsamcfg.hypervisors.VMware, method Validate. Exception details: BMXAA4210E - Database error number -206 has occurred.
"OWNER_TABLE" is not valid in the context where it is used.. 
SQLCODE=-206, SQLSTATE=42703, DRIVER=3.63.75.

Some steps are required in the Troubleshooting Guide of TSAM stating how to commit pending changes into the database.
