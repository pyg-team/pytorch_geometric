IBM Installation Manager requires all previous repositories because of the thorough validation it performs before installing the latest fix. The following items are validated: 

 * Ancestor check: Installation Manager ensures that the base code is present (some required components in the latest fix might not have been previously installed). 
 * Delta check: Installation Manager validates the new code to be installed with the fix. 
 * Live code check: Installation Manager verifies that the currently installed products and components contain the information needed in case a component needs to be rolled back, updated, or removed. 


Therefore, it is essential to have all repositories from previous fixes available before installing the latest fix. 

If you do not have an active network connection on the machine where you are running IBM Installation Manager, download the repositories manually from the IBM Support website [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006649]. Copy downloaded repositories to a machine with IBM Installation Manager and extract the repositories to a local folder on the machine. Then, manually add them to IBM Installation Manager from the File > Preferences > Repositories menu. 

It is recommended that you keep repositories from previously installed fixes; these repositories might be required if you need to roll back to a previous version. RELATED INFORMATION
