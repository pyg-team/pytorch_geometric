Title: IBM CLFRP0038E: IBM Connections Content Manager failed to be configured on WebSphere Application Server. Error Step : Step "action-config-ce-ccm - United States

Text:
CLFRP0038E IIM component failed action config ce ccm TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When using IBM Installation Manager to install the Connections Content Manager (CCM) feature of IBM Connections, the installation fails with exception CLFRP0038E: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

CAUSE
There are numerous possible causes of this exception. For example, insufficient free disk-space on the drive used by the Operating System for temporary-storage.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The ConfigTrace.log file of the WebSphere Deployment Manager should be analyzed for details on the root-cause of the CLFRP0038E exception: 

 

1. Open the ConfigTrace.log file that exists within the following directory of your IBM WebSphere Deployment Manager's file-system within a text-file viewer: 

 * 
 * 
 *  
   /<WAS_HOME>/profiles/Dmgr01/ConfigEngine/log/ConfigTrace.log 
 * 
 * 
 *  
   C:\<WAS_HOME>\profiles\Dmgr01\ConfigEngine\log\ConfigTrace.log 


2. Search for the name of the Step that IBM Installation Manager (IIM) failed to configure: 
 * 
 * action-install-ce-fncs-ceclient-unix-ccm
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * action-config-ce-ccm
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Note: What IIM refers-to as steps are called targets within the ConfigTrace.log file. Begin scrolling-up line by line and inspect the output from the previous step/target. 

3. Notice this warning message that was generated while executing the step/target ( action-install-ce-fncs-ceclient-unix-ccm) before the step/target that IIM failed to configure ( action-config-ce-ccm): 

[exec] Preparing to install... 
[exec] WARNING: /tmp does not have enough disk space! 
[exec] Attempting to use /root for install base and tmp dir. 

[exec] WARNING! The amount of /root disk space required to perform 
[exec] this installation is greater than what is available. Please

[exec] installation again. You may also set the IATEMPDIR environment 
[exec] variable to a directory on a disk partition with enough free 
[exec] disk space. To set the variable enter one of the following 
[exec] commands at the UNIX command line prompt before running this 
[exec] installer again: 

[exec] - for Bourne shell (sh), ksh, bash and zsh: 

[exec] $ IATEMPDIR=/your/free/space/directory 
[exec] $ export IATEMPDIR 

[exec] - for C shell (csh) and tcsh: 

[exec] $ setenv IATEMPDIR /your/free/space/directory

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the example above, the root-cause of the CLFRP0038E exception was insufficient free-space on the temporary-storage location of the Operating System. 

 

IIM requires approximately 2GB of free disk-space within the temporary-storage location of the Operating System to install IBM Connections Content Manager (CCM). 

 

So this particular problem has 2 solutions: 

 

 * 
 * 
 *  
   UNIX/Linux:  * 
    * 
   
   
   Microsoft Windows:  * 
    * 
   
   
 *
