QUESTION
 IBM TRIRIGA Tasks require 2 hits on the Save button for saving the record properly 

CAUSE
When we enter new value into a field, if there are any auto-computed field linked to it, we have to move focus out of the field (to any other field), and then hit the Save button. Another option would be hitting the Save button twice (1st click will move focus out of changed field, 2nd will do the actual save action). 

See a sample of this happening on the Work Task application below:

S01) Log in to IBM TRIRIGA Application;

S02) Go to "Home -> Tasks -> Manage Tasks -> Work Task" application;

S03) Load a Task record;
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=1]

S04) On the General tab, update the field "C. Planned Working Days" with a different value and then hit the Save button just once;

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=2]

S05) See that you will see calculation adjustment happening and fields will show that clearly;

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=3]

S06) Close the record (See that even you have saved the record before, system will issue this warning message “You are about to lose all the changes made. Close the window anyway?”, click OK for it)

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=4]

S07) Reload the same record;

S08) See that the "C. Planned Working Days" has NOT been updated properly;

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=5]

S09) On the same General tab, update the field "C. Planned Working Days" with a different value and then hit the Save button just once;

S10) See that you will see calculation adjustment happening and fields will show that clearly;

S11) Hit the Save button again (this will be the second hit for the same record);

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981613&aid=6]

S12) Close the record (See no pop-up warning window this time);

S13) Reload the same record;

S14) See that the "C. Planned Working Days" has been updated properly this time.



Is there any work around for such behavior?



ANSWER
The options we have for this scenario are:

(a) Move focus out of the field (tab out) by clicking any other field in the for so that the auto-computed field is calculated and then click once the Save button;

(b) Click twice the Save button, the first for the calculation to be performed and the second for saving the record. 

This is working as designed for updates in fields linked to auto-computed ones.

For the sample above, the The "C. Planned Working Days" field has an On Change workflow, that updates the "Planned End Date". When you "Save" or "Save and Close" it still has to update the calculation.

It is necessary users to TAB out of the field, so that the calculation can work, then they will be able to "Save" or "Save and Close" without issue.
