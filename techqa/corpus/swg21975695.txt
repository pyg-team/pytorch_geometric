 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Developer for z System (RDz) attempts to launch Debug via zUnit for a COBOL or PLI program will result in either only assembler code displayed or no source displayed in the Debug perspective 

SYMPTOM
A. When using the IBM Debug Tool the source program is displayed in assembler only when the debug perspective opens 

B. When using the IBM Integrated Debugger no data is shown in the debug perspective, and you may see the Debug Engine Message: 


 * 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A. Work around for IBM Debug Tool environment 
In BreakPoint View of Debug Perspective::


 1. Right mouse click > Add breakpoint 
 2. Stop At All Function Entries 
 3. Select Resume. 
 4. By repeating resume you can see the COBOL/PLI source listing



B. Work around for IBM Integrated Debugger environment 

In the first debug attempt follow these steps: 
 1. Add Breakpoint 
 2. Stop At All Entries 
 3. in BreakPoint View when debug perspective comes up (ID doesn't show assembly-listing first) 
 4. After a while, you'll see listing of zUnit testcase 
 5. Once you do this operation, you can see a listing file from next time without this operation
