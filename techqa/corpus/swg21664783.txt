PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After uninstalling JDBC Gateway using uninstall command from $NCHOME/_uninst/nco_g_jdbc, the reinstallation is failing with a message that features already exist on the system. 

SYMPTOM
"No new features to install" window is displayed with message "You haven't selected any new features to install as the selected features already exist on the system."


CAUSE
The output of listIU is still showing the JDBC Gateway as installed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Back up existing DE by zipping/tarring the entire DE directory

e.g. for root install, tar up "/usr/ibm/common/acsi" directory and keep it in another location. Alternatively, use de_backupdb.sh script to create the backup.


2. Run de_lsrootiu.sh script and review the output to determine the discriminant information.

e.g. <discriminant>/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool</discriminant>


The discriminant would be /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool 


3. Run listIU.cmd or listIU.sh and in the output look for a line which has "RootIU UUID:" and the component name and version 

e.g. IU RootIU UUID: 060A90E184C84B7A98E25EC426B44288 Name: gateway-nco-g-jdbc Version: 1.5.1.0 


4. Remove the uninstalled component from the listIU, by running

manageIU.sh -o delete -r <discriminant> -d RootIUTypeID , 

Based on the example above, for root install with discriminant of "/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool" the command to run would be: 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/manageIU.sh -o delete -r /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool -d RootIUTypeID[060A90E184C84B7A98E25EC426B44288, 1.5.1.0] 


5. Run listIU.sh again and make sure that JDBC gateway is no longer listed. 

The reinstallation of JDBC gateway should now work. If the problem with reinstallation persists, please contact IBM Support.
