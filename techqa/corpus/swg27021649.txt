ABSTRACT
 This presentation answers frequently asked questions on the WebSphere DataPower SOA appliances relating to SFTP, MQ, ITCAM for SOA, XSLT, DNS, request/response headers, and encryption and decryption. Audience are also encouraged to interact with our panel of experts during the Q/A period.

Ask the Experts session 
30 June 2011 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 04:02 Technical introduction 04:59 What are the configurable components needed for an SFTP implementation, and what is the differentiation between SFTP and FTPs? 09:25 Can DataPower multi-protocol gateway services be monitored by ITCAM for SOA? 12:37 Can you show how we can exploit the use of encryption/decryption with DataPower? 15:59 Why is the reply message not received by DataPower in an MQ request/reply flow? 21:05 I would like to profile my stylesheet on DataPower; does DataPower provide this type of functionality? 25:26 How can DNS cause problems with the DataPower device configuration and data flow? 27:01 How long does the DataPower cache the IP address of remote services like backend server when we use DNS names? I am asking this question because it allows the backend team to replace the backend server with DR site when the backend server crashes.I know that DataPower DNS cache depends upon TTL value in present when it queries DNS server to resolve the IP address. Will this hold good for this?

29:03 What is the difference between configuring duration monitor filters and SLM monitors? 30:17 Why doesn't SLM monitor express threshold in milliseconds? 31:00 Why does the dp:get-cert-details extension function depend only on objects or a base64 string? Why can't it read cert files for details? Are there plans to enhance this function? 32:29 Why does the CPU and memory usage of the device suddenly rise even when there is no significant increase in message flow ? (for example: traffic flow amongst two devices is equivalent, but one device is peaking at 45 % cpu and 50 % mem, while the other device is at 2 - 3% cpu and 5 - 10 % mem usage). The configuration on both the devices is completely identical. 36:17 What is the key? Is it the public certificate, thumbprint, serial number or any other part? 37:02 Can the panel of experts advise on the use case for Multi protocol gateway? 38:55 if we expose IMPG multi protocol gateway as a service and if we don't have a wsdl, will the HTTP client consume that multi protocol gateway service? 41:18 Can the same XSL stylesheets be used for hooking up WS-proxy and XML-fw to ITCAM for SOA? 43:00 Let's say we have a set of certificate loaded on the DataPower device, and we would like to interrogate each certificate using the dp:get-cert-details extension function in order to get some details about the DN, CN and expiration date. Right now we are creating object for every single certificate, can we avoid redundancy if we have the function go directly to the certificate file? 47:53 Does DataPower support FTPS, or is it only SFTP enabled? 48:33 Can DataPower rotate keys? 49:05 Is the functionality of ITCAM for SOA provided in WAMC? 53:54 You had mentioned that the SLM monitor will allow time limits to be set in milliseconds, but I am unable to do because it only allows me to set time limits in seconds. With this limitation in mind, I am trying to set up a SLM monitor for calculating the total latency of a given WebSphere proxy, and to have it notify me with an e-mail whenever the latency crosses the threshold level of maybe 500 milliseconds. I currently accomplish this with the duration monitor with a filter on it. However, I observe that with the threshold filter on the duration monitor I do not get notified every time the event occurs. Instead I observe that I get notified onlyon every alternate occurrence. Why does this behavior exist? 57:50 Is there possibility to do some state management for transactions in DataPower? (i.e. saving state for correlations between multiple different transactions coming to the box) 58:55 Closing remarks 59:43 End of Call
