 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a report in IBM Cognos Analytics Query Studio, the image fails to load when the report is generated in PDF/Excel format. 

SYMPTOM
Right clicking on the image and displaying the element shows the image cannot be found.


CAUSE
During the upgrade from Cognos BI 10.x.x to Cognos Analytics 11.0.x, the location of images changed for legacy studios

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copying the <COGNOS_INSTALL>/webcontent/explore folder to <COGNOS_INSTALL>/webcontent/bi will allow the images to be displayed correctly.
