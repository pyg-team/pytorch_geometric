APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Both APAR:IY42077 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY42077] and this one relate to WebSEAL's support
   for protecting Web servers
   against cross-site scripting attacks.
   
   The problem is "bad requests are not recorded in request.log"
   
   When the filtering does work, there's no entry written to the
   log to indicate that anything was filtered.
   
   Michael T. at the Gold Coast confirmed
   that these requests should definitely be logged,
   especially in this case, as otherwise there's no way
   to determine
   who's trying to attack you.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When there is a "?" in the URI, WebSEAL does not
   filter the request, ie, still find <script> tag in web
   server access log.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 3.8-PWS-FP15.
