ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you have a tracking group in both a Process App and a Toolkit
   with the same name, and tracked data exists, the Send
   Definitions process breaks for your entire Library.
   
   Repro steps (I am not sure if all of these are necessary but I
   could NOT reproduce this just by having an identically named TG
   in a Process App and Toolkit):
   
   1. In a toolkit, create a tracking group, "wleTG". Give it at
   least one tracked field.
   2. Create a snapshot for the toolkit.
   3. In a Process App, create a tracking group, "wleTG". Give it
   the same tracked fields as the toolkit's (may not be necessary).
   4. Add dependency on the toolkit's snapshot created in step 2.
   5. Create a new BPD, modeled like: Start -> Activity -> wleTG ->
   End
   6. Either use local variables or manually entered data to give
   the tracked fields values in the TG's Implementation tab.
   7. Complete an instance.
   8. Send definitions. The TG_ table will be created with the
   appropriate columns. In my case, no data was added to the table.
   9. Send definitions again. Data still will not be added to the
   table but you will see that the columns for the tracked fields
   have now been duplicated. For example, if your fields are "foo"
   and "bar", after the second Send Defs, you will have columns
   named "foo", "bar", "foo2", and "bar2". This will continue to
   happen until your table hits the maximum 1024 columns.
   ** Other tracking groups will no longer get any data written to
   their tables.
   ** No errors in tw-perf.log
   ** LSW_LOAD_TRACE indicates a successful send
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  I tried to workaround the issue by archiving the toolkit and
   process app, renaming the tracking groups, remapping the
   tracking groups, taking the tracking groups out of any usage,
   deleting the TGs from PA and toolkit, and giving new snapshots
   to my PA and toolkit. None of these approaches fixed the
   environment though renaming the TG allowed some data to be sent
   but columns were still duplicated.
   
   The only workaround was to actually remove the TG_ table, the
   View, and the associated records from LSW_COLUMN, LSW_TABLE, and
   LSW_VIEW on the perf database.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you have a tracking group in both a
   Process App and a Toolkit
   with the same name, and tracked data exists, the Send
   Definitions process breaks for your entire Library.
