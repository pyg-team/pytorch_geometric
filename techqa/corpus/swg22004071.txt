PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rule : SHC101
Issue Detected : SPU network interfaces are not bonded
Severity : High
Components : spa1.spu13 (from nz_spux)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Unless it is a hardware problem a power cycle of the SPU will be enough to fix the issue. 

A power cycle of an active spu needs an outage. 

 

As user nz
[nz@netezza ~]# nzstop 

[nz@netezza ~]# nzpush -s x/y power cycle 

[nz@netezza ~]# nzstart 

 

x - blade number
y - spa number
For example for spu0111 it will be: 

nzpush -s 1/11 power cycle 

 

If this doesn't solve the issue collect DSA logs for the SPU and the AMM's service data

AMM Service data:
[nz@netezza ~]# /nz/kit/bin/adm/ibm_amm --loc=spa1.mm --service_data=/tmp/mm_sd.tgz 
Use the correct spa number corresponding to the problematic blade.
