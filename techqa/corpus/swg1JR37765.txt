APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Sparse lookup jobs with ODBC connector connecting to MS SQL
   Server jobs abort with the following message:
   
   Event type:Fatal
   User:dsadm
   Timestamp:9/10/2010 6:35:45 AM
   Message Id:IIS-CONN-ODBC-00004
   Message:
   Lookup_3,0: ODBC function "SQLFetch" reported:  SQLSTATE =
   HY010: Native Error Code = 0: Msg = [IBM(DataDirect OEM)][ODBC
   SQL Server Driver]Function sequence error
   (CC_OdbcDBStatement::dbsFetch, file CC_OdbcDBStatement.cpp, line
   1 296)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set Autocommit mode to ON in connector stage properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of ODBC Connector stage connecting to MS SQL Server
   and Netezza database and doing sparse lookup functionality.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When sparse lookup job is run against MS SQL Server and Netezza
   Databases, the job aborts with the following error message when
   the number of input rows are more than insertarray size
   multiplied by the number of nodes in the config file.
   
   Sparse_LkUp,7: [IIS-CONN-ODBC-000004] ODBC function
   "SQLFetch" reported:
   SQLSTATE = HY010: Native Error Code = 0: Msg = [IBM(DataDirect
   OEM)][ODBC SQL Server Driver]
   Function sequence error (CC_OdbcDBStatement::dbsFetch, file
   CC_OdbcDBStatement.cpp, line 1,204) [pxbridge.C:5685]
   
   
   For example, if the insert array size is 2000 (which is
   default) and the number of nodes in the config file is : 2, the
   job fails when the sparse lookup is run with more than (2000 x 2
   =) 4000 rows.
   
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   Apply this APAR.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This was because of the reason of explicitly setting the commit
   mode behaviour. In this patch, the commit mode setting is done
   only when it is enabled in the ODBC Connector stage properties.
