ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  2/5/04 -- This has happened to me twice in past couple of days
   with 6.5.1NP
   Gold build.  No additional info.  I tried to debug a little but
   I screwed up.
   Next time, maybe I'll have some more info. -Jeff E.  -- 2/6/04
   -- more info.
   It appears that multiple outline views are sharing the same
   sitemap on the
   bookmark bar (the main outline view and some embedded views).
   For init of each
   one, it sets the sitemap's computehnote to its hnote.  On a
   reload (happening I
   think because I have a policy that keeps setting my welcome page
   to the
   Workplace page), the child outline views get nuked as do their
   hNotes, but
   nothing is clearing out the computehnote from the sitemap which
   is still used
   by the parent bookmark bar outline view.  I think a fix (not
   necessarily
   complete but should fix the crash and various occurrences of
   this spr) would be
   to set the sitemap's computehnote once again near top of
   CNEMOutlineView::Reload or something like that.
   
   12/2/03 - CountryWide reported an issue with same callstack
   using
   v651_11172003NP.  I've included the NSD in Attachments db and
   also have the
   Fault Reports/NSD's related to the server crashes so let me know
   if you need
   that info as well... - Kathy

   User Comments: I was minding my own buz, when I crashed. My mail
   server had crashed and I
   had been failed over to my clustermate (although not very
   gracefully). The
   crash occurred about the same time my mail server came back up
   (I think).
