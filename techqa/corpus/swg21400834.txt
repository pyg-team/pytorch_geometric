Title: IBM File name length limit for packages/rules in Rule Studio - United States

Text:
character; length; limit; maximum; name; number; package; rule; size TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the limit on the number of characters that a package/rule name can have in Rule Studio? 

ANSWER
For Rule Studio, because projects are stored in file format, the file name length limit is defined by the operating system.
For example, on Windows XP, the file name length is limited to 255 characters, but this applies to the entire file path, not just the file name. Therefore, you need to make sure that the entire path does not exceed 255 characters:

<workspace_path>/<rule_project_name>/rules/<rule_package_name>/<rule_name>
