APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running an MQ utility program, such as CSQUTIL, the job
   fails with abend 5C6-00C60006 because the application cannot
   access message table CSQFSTAB.
   The STEPLIB includes the SCSQANLE dataset, but this dataset
   does not contain load module CSQNL25E (alias CSQFSTAB).
   The missing module is caused when the MQ FMIDs HMS7100 and
   JMS7101 are installed in separate SMP/E apply steps.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do an APPLY REDO of WebSphere MQ for z/OS base and features
   together to resolve the problem.
   An example of the APPLY REDO statements:
   //SMPCNTL DD *
   SET BDY(TZONE).
   APPLY SELECT(HMS7100,JMS7101) COMPRESS(ALL) REDO
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CSQUTIL abends 5C6-00C60006 because     *
   *                      message table CSQFSTAB cannot be        *
   *                      loaded.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If the SMP/E apply for FMIDs HSM7100 and JMS7101 is performed
   in separate steps, an error in the definition of the LMOD
   CSQNL25E means that it may be missing from the SCSQANLE library.
   
   CSQNL25E has an alias of CSQFSTAB, which is the message table
   used by MQ utility applications.
   
   When running the WebSphere MQ utility program, CSQUTIL,
   with an SCSQANLE library which is missing CSQNL25E, the
   application will be unable to load CSQFSTAB. This results in
   abend 5C6-00C60006 being issued.
   
   
   Similar abends may also be seen when using other MQ utility
   applications.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes have been made to the MQ SMP/E definitions to ensure
   that CSQNL25E is correctly produced in SCSQANLE.
