ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When two application designed as default Notes home page and a
   search is initiated by clicking on the first letter of search
   string, this will bring up the search window with the first
   letter appearing in search field. If "Find" button is clicked
   or enter key is press, it finds the document that matches the
   value in the search field and the search window will disappear.
   if the steps are repeated immediately after the first action by
   typing a letter to begin another search then there is problem
   of the subsequent letters not appearing on the search field.
   The observation is that the focus is shifted, whenever the next
   letter is press on the keyboard, to the "Find in" Field. In
   case the next letter typed on the keyboard matches any of the
   options in the list of 'Find in ' field then it will select it.
   Exmaple is Who, Subject, Date, size. When you type this letter,
   if it happens to be first letter of any of these options then
   it will select it (eg W matches 'who'), this is how you will
   know focus has changed to the field.
   
   This behaviour only occur while searching the right
   application, it does NOT occur while searching the left
   application.
   
   DETAILED STEPS
   i). Open Notes Clients, you will see 'click here for home page'
   
   ii) Or supposing you are using the bookmark.nsf file as your
   current startpage click on "Create a new home page "
   
   iii) Give the page a name and press next  (eg MyPage or ..)
   
   iv) Select Frames and click next
   
   v) Select Application (untick inbox and application) and choose
   1 Notes application
   
   e) Select the frame setup
   
   e1) The left frame should be the inbox in this case.
   
   vi) For the right frame you can select your names.nsf
   addressbook from the server and choose the peoples view. Should
   be easy to reproduce with these two.
   
   vii) Finish the startpage
   
   viii) Try the quick search in the right application. The first
   search (as described above) will work fine. Try to search
   again, it won't work anymore. the same search works perffectly
   on the left application (inbox)
