LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 383161
   RJ / SF
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue:  WebSphere Application Server Liberty
   isn't honoring the binding to a specific IP address but uses
   0.0.0.0 instead
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix:  Corrected the code that would incorrectly
   set the listen address when a specific listen address is
   specified.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Description of issue:  SCC user authentication fails when using
   SEAS (Sterling External Authentication Service) and the password
   contains special characters (eg. &, <, >, etc.).
   
   Description of fix:  Added code to marshall the userid and
   password, when building the SEAS authentication xml string,
   allowing all valid special characters to be used in these
   fields.
