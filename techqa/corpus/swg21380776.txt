Title: IBM Using Enhanced System Debugger with integrated LPEX Editor does not display Assembler programs - United States

Text:
RDz; Enhanced System Debugger; display; assembler TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Developer for System z v7.5 Enhanced System z Debugger does not support the display of Assembler source in the Debugger. 


SYMPTOM
If the default editor has been set to use the new Enhanced COBOL editor in the workspace preferences, the Assembler source will not be displayed. Also, when an Assembler program is called from COBOL, COBOL error messages are issued instead of Assembler error messages. 

CAUSE
Rational Developer for System z v7.5 includes the Enhanced System z Debugger support which includes:


 * Integration with the LPEX editor facilitating better flow from editing to debugging 
 * Use of the outline view while debugging 
 * Content assist while entering debug commands 
 * New Debug Console commands that can also be entered in a command file are added to allow for unattended debugging.


This enhancement does not support the displaying of Assembler source in the Debugger. When the default editor has been set to use the new Enhanced COBOL Editor in the workspace preferences, the Assembler source will not be displayed. 
ENVIRONMENT
Windows XP



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following commands must be issued in the Debug Engine Command field: 

 1. set assem on 
 2. ldd <assembler compile unit>



Where <assembler compile unit> is the assembler compile unit to be debugged (it is recommended that you repeat the same command for each compile unit of the load module). A Request For Enhancement has been submitted to Development. More information can be found via the Rational RFE Community at the following URL:
