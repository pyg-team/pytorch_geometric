APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   If there are multiple servers with the same domain (for example,
   2 IBM Rational Change and Configuration (CCM) servers)  and the
   Lifecycle Project Area (LPA) template configures multiple
   artifact containers for the domain, the LPA "Create Project
   Area" does not work correctly.
   There are two problems:
   1. Multiple drop downs appear on the row for the first
   application container, with no drop downs on other rows for the
   same application
   2. When the project areas are created, they can be created in
   the wrong server because the drop down was created on the wrong
   row.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Log in to an environment where you have multiple CCM
   applications registered with the same IBM Rational
   JazzTeamServer (JTS). Assuming there are 2 CCMs in this case and
   their context root are 'ccm' and 'ccm2'.
   2. Go to LPA Create Project page.
   4. Select Template: Quality Professional, Analyst, Developer -
   with separate Quality Management Tasks and Requirements Change
   Requests
   Notice that there are 2 drop downs on the row for the first
   Change and Configuration Management container. There is no drop
   down on the rows for the second Change and Configuration
   Management container. This is not correct.
   5. Select "ccm2" in the second drop down
   6. Enter a name for the project
   7. Save. Notice that the projects are all created in ccm. This
   is not correct. At least one of them should be created in ccm2.
   
   
   What is the expected output?
   - In step 4, there should be a drop down per application
   container
   - In step 7, The projects should be created in the application
   selected during the LPA creation.
   
   What do you see instead?
   - In step 4, multiple drop downs appear on the row for the first
   application container, with no drop downs on other rows for the
   same application
   - In step 7, The projects are all created in CCM.

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can manually create a project in each CCM repository and use
   the 'link to existing' option to select to use these projects
   when creating a new lifecycle project.
