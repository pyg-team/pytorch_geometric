QUESTION
 How do you display user details for notes created in Web Call Center (WCC) in Application Console in Sterling Order Management 9.3? 

CAUSE
User details of the notes entered in WCC are not displayed in Application console.


ANSWER
In WCC , user detail is retrieved from the path Notes/Note/User/UserName where as in Application Console, this value us retrieved fromNotes/Note/ContactUser.
Use the workbench to edit the mashup and override the attribute name ContactUser with the value xml:CurrentUser:/User/@Username.

Steps to workaround: 

 1. Login to WCC ( dev mode) and start customization on Add Note button.
    
    
 2. Go to data tab - Mashup calls - Behavior Mashups
    
    
 3. Select Mashup Reference ID saveNote and click on edit.
    
    
 4. In the Input XML , override ContactUser attribute with the value xml:CurrentUser:/User/@Username.
    
    
 5. Save the customization and exit.
    
    This will ensure the user details are now visible in Application console for notes added in Web call center.
