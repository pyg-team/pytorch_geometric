QUESTION
 In Connect:Direct for i5/OS what is the PMGR_Q *USRQ that is open when a backup is attempted? (SCI61652) 

ANSWER
The object PMGR_Q is dynamically created by Connect:Direct for i5/OS at start-up and is locked by the CDPMGR job. When Connect:Direct for i5/OS is active and PMGR_Q is locked, it cannot be backed up. If Connect:Direct for i5/OS is ended normally, the PMGR_Q object is deleted. It will be created again when Connect:Direct for i5/OS is started. There is no need to backup this object. We recommend Connect:Direct for i5/OS be ended with the ENDCD command before backups and IPLs.
