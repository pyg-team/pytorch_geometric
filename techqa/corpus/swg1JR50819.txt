APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you change the primary admin user after you create the IBM
   Business Process Manager (BPM) profiles and later try to
   create a new deployment environment (DE) by using the
   administrative console DE wizard when logged in as the IBM BPM
   cell admin user, you see following error in the administrative
   console:
   
   The login user ($CellAdmin) does not have required access to
   create a deployment environment. Use cell administrator
   ($PrimaryAdmin) to log in.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - Change the WebSphere Primary Admin user same as CellAdmin
   user
   - Restart the Deployment Manager
   - Log as CellAdmin user
   - Create the  new Deployment Environment
