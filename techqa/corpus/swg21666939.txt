QUESTION
 How to deal with encryption keys after DSM server migrate to new machine?

You are planning to migrate your DSM server to new machine. You would like to know if the encryption key generation is based on any hardware information. If not, can you just use the old key from the original server? In such case, can you do the backup/restore to import data from old server to new server?




ANSWER
The encryption keys are not tied to any specific DSM.
Yes , you can move over the encryption keys by doing a standard backup/restore or by doing an export/import of the specific key via the 'keys' interface.
