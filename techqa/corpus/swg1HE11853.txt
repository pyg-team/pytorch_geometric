APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The filenames that are passed to the pre-processor for
   processing are enclosed by double quotes. The double quotes are
   dispensible and complicate the usage of the filenames in the
   pre-processor because the double quotes must be first removed in
   most cases.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The pre-processor has to remove the enclosing double quotes
   before it can work with the filenames.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fix is included in ICCSAP 2.2 FP2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is included in ICCSAP 2.2 FP2.
