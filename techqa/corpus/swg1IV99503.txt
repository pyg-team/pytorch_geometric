APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  More Search Option - Enable the Select Value option for
   Locations.
   
   Under More Search fields, we need the ability to chose the
   Select Value
   under the Locations label for the Locations application. We
   have tried
   several configurations but no luck.
   
   Action Taken:
   Modified the Lookup value and/or the Menu Type for the Location
   attribute in the Location More Search screen in Application
   Designer.
   Tried a number of configurations including matching what is
   setup on
   the Locations field on the More Search in the Assets
   application, but
   the lookup either does not display or you get Invalid Bindings
   when
   trying to use it.
   
   For testing, I added Select Value to the
   current menutype  LOCATIONSCLASSIFICATION and added
   lookup="locations"
   on the Location field. I saw invalid binding when I clicked
   Select Value.
