Title: IBM BIA01006 error when installing IBM WebSphere Business Integration Adapters with Adapter Framework 2.6.x - United States

Text:
CrossWorlds.jar; BIA01006; Adapter Framework TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing WebSphere Business Integration Adapters on top of Adapter Framework 2.6.x, you may need to create an empty file to circumvent the error: "BIA01006: The directory you selected does not contain a compatible version of the adapter framework". 

CAUSE
The WBI Adapters installation verifies whether the following file is present on the file system: 

 * 
 * 
 * adapter framework 2.6 install location
 * 


The installation fails if the file is missing. As of Adapter Framework Version 2.6.x, this .jar file is present only when the Adapter Framework Toolset is being installed. 
ENVIRONMENT
Problem observed with WebSphere Business Integration Adapter for Ariba(R) Buyer 3.2, -for mySAP 6.0.9 and -for SWIFT 1.9 but applies to other adapters as well.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The installer of the WBI adapter will throw the following exception: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21231755&amp;aid=1]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1.Verify whether the CrossWorlds.jar file resides in the directory <AF 2.6 install location>\lib\. 

2. If there is no CrossWorlds.jar in the directory, create an empty file named CrossWorlds.jar and save it in this location. 

3. Re-run the WBI adapter installation process, for example with the UNIX command: 
"./setupAIX.bin -W unsupportedPlatform.active=false".
