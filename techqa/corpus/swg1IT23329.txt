APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AMQ9776: Channel was blocked by userid
   
   EXPLANATION:
   The inbound channel 'MY.SVRCONN' was blocked from address
   'nnn.n.n.n' because the active values of the channel were
   mapped to a userid which should be blocked. The active values
   of the channel were 'MCAUSER(<MCAUSER>'.
   
   The expected queue manager log entry should be:
   
   AMQ9776: Channel was blocked by userid
   
   EXPLANATION:
   The inbound channel 'MY.SVRCONN' was blocked from address
   '127.0.0.1' because
   the active values of the channel were mapped to a userid which
   should be
   blocked. The active values of the channel were
   'MCAUSER(<MCAUSER>)
   CLNTUSER(<CLTUSER>) ADDRESS(<ADDRESS>)'.
