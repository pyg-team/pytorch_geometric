PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 6.1 modifications will be available in the
   February 2013 update to the Information Centers. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 6.1 issues will be addressed:
   ID: PM80753
   Problem: The storage locations of IBM WebSphere embedded
   ConnectJDBC driver have changed.  Users need to be aware of
   these changes so they can appropriately access the drivers.
   Specifically, updates are needed for the "IBM WebSphere
   embedded ConnectJDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server" and "IBM
   WebSphere embedded ConnectJDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server
   (XA)".  In Version 6.1.0.41 and later, the only
   WebSphere-embedded Connect JDBC driver JAR file is
   sqlserver.jar.  All of the necessary JDBC driver classes are
   stored in this JAR file and the base.jar, spy.jar, and
   util.jar are no longer included.
   
   Resolution: Sections IBM WebSphere embedded ConnectJDBC
   driver for Microsoft SQL Server, and section IBM
   WebSphere embedded ConnectJDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server
   (XA)" of topic  Data source minimum required settings
   for Microsoft SQL Server, are updated to include the following
   note:
   
   Note: In WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1.0.41 and
   later, the only WebSphere-embedded Connect JDBC driver JAR
   file is sqlserver.jar. All of the necessary JDBC driver
   classes are stored in this JAR file. The base.jar, spy.jar,
   and util.jar are no longer included.
   
   ----------------
   ID: 743252
   Problem: Topic, WLM Delay Monitoring for z/OS, contains a
   table.  In the response section of the table in two rows, the
   recommendation is documented to split the controller (code
   REGT and SSLT).  This recommendation is incorrect. There is no
   way to 'split' a controller.   This recommendation needs
   to be corrected.
   
   Resolution:  The two rows
   (marked WAITING REGULAR_THREAD and WAITING SSL_THREAD)
   in the response section of the table in topic, WLM
   Delay Monitoring for z/OS, is updated as follows:
   
   WAITING REGULAR_THREAD
   Create a new Server in the same cluster. By doing so, you now
   have two control regions to share the work and are able to
   spread out processing to forestall any processing contention.
   
   WAITING SSL_THREAD
   Create a new Server in the same cluster. By doing so, you now
   have two control regions to share the work and are able to
   spread out processing to forestall any processing contention.
   1. Increase SSL threads.
   2. Look at SSL configuration.
   3. Create a new Server in the same cluster.
   
   This update also applies the Version 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5
   Information Centers.
   
   ----------------
   ID: 748687
   Problem: The information centers do not provide an example of
   how, for JAX-WS, a user can specify the HTTP or HTTPS
   properties programmatically using the RequestContext parameter
   of the BindingProvider API.
   Resolution: The topic "Configuring a Web services client to
   access resources using a Web proxy" has been updated to include
   the following information:
   
   For JAX-WS, the following code allows you to specify the HTTP
   or HTTPS properties programmatically with RequestContext of
   BindingProvider:
   
   // Set the https.proxyHost as a property on the
   RequestContext.
   BindingProvider bp = (BindingProvider) port;
   bp.getRequestContext().put("https.proxyHost","proxyHost1.ibm.com
   ");
   bp.getRequestContext().put("https.proxyPort","80");
   
   This update was also made to the Version 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5
   Information Centers.
   ----------------
   ID: 748689
   Problem: The name of the Sun Java System Web Server,
   has changed to Oracle iPlanet Web Server. This change is not
   reflected in the information centers.
   Resolution: All references to the Sun Java System Web Server
   contained in the information centers have been changed to
   Oracle iPlanet Web Server.
   
   This update was also made to the Version 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5
   Information Centers.
   --------------
   ID: 749497
   Problem:  Topic, Java virtual machine custom properties,
   incorrectly documents the following properties:
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#162;com.ibm.websphere.deletejspclasses
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#162;com.ibm.websphere.deletejspclasses.delete
    &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#162;com.ibm.websphere.deletejspclasses.update
   by indicating that in a Network Deployment environment, these
   properties apply to the node agent.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Java virtual machine custom properties, is
   updated for these specific properties to indicate that in a
   Network Deployment environment, these properties apply to the
   WebSphere Application Server.
   
   This update also applies to the Version 7.0, 8.0,and 8.5
   Information Centers.
