PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Title
   Unable to deploy new virtual systems.   Tasks are queued, and
   virtual systems are queued during deployment.
   
   Error description
   The appliance is unable to deploy new virtual systems, because
   appliance local storage got filled up.  There is a bug in the
   system that it can not longer clean up the internal cache
   causing the disk to fill up.  This happens when an appliance has
   a number of different virtual images that are deployed on to
   un-cached hypervisors.  If the appliance deploys the same
   virtual image over and over, it will not hit this problem.  This
   problem is only visible on the 2.0.0.2 firmware level.
   
   Local fix
   Revert the maintenance where possible, upgrade to latest
   firmware and execute maintenance again.  If Revert is not
   possible then you will need to move to the  latest firmware
   will need to be created.
