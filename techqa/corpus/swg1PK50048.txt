ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error occurs when try to View or Refresh the ReqPro Requirement
   from a CQ Requirement.
   Steps:
   1. Setup the integration between a ReqPro project and a CQ db (I
    tried DB2(and Oracle) both for ReqPro and CQ).
   2. Login to the above CQ db from CQWeb.
   3. Query to a CQ Requirement and click Modify
   4. Click the View button
   5. ReqPro project login dialog opens. Input the User and Passwor
   d, and then click OK.
   Error occurs saying:
   Error reading INI file. Invalid file path specified.
   Unable to locate file for ReqPro project. Login failed.
   path=\\jinmay\Project\RPCQI_Enterprise\RPCQI_Enterprise.rqs
   The same error appears when try to do the Refresh from a CQ Requ
   irement.
   Note: if the project is not located at the shared directory, 404
