PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
This technote identifies an issue that can occur where creating a view from IBM Rational ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC) 7.1.1 reports an error: MalformedResponseException: Premature EOF.

SYMPTOM
 

When attempting to create a view from a CCRC 7.1.1 client, the following error is seen: 


CRVAP0087E CCRC command 'mkview' failed: Error: "com.ibm.rational.clearcase.remote_core.rpc.MalformedResponseException: Premature EOF" 


In the CM Server system logs, the following is seen:

CAUSE
 

 1. The issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR PM08209 (applies only if seen on a Solaris 10 x86 CM Server with version 7.1.1 installed).
    
    
 2. The issue has also been seen to occur when permissions on the ClearCase_check directory of the ClearCase server are too restrictive.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

For Cause 1 

 

Defect APAR PM08209 has been resolved in ClearCase 7.1.1.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21265307]. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM08209] 

 

For Cause 2 


Change the permissions on the ClearCase_Check directory to provide the ability of all users who will need a ClearCase license to be able to create a file in this directory. 


Also, refer to technote 1431848 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21431848]Displaying VOB list is very slow when licensing caching directory permissions are too restrictive.
