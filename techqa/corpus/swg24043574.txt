PREREQUISITES

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 
Installation Windows 

 1. Log in as a local administrator. 
 2. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. 
 3. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. 
 4. Run the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack executable.
    Note: you must use "Run as Administrator" by first right-clicking on the executable. 
 5. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is now the installed version.


Guidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Windows-based clients: NOTE: This Fix Pack may require the machine to be rebooted to complete the installation. Please be aware that "pushing" the installation in unattended, silent mode may therefore force an unexpected machine reboot on a user, and schedule such installations accordingly. 

The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Windows Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding "Extracting the Contents of a Downloaded Installer file" and "Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers". 

In this case: 

 1. Download the appropriate installer file to a temporary location on your hard drive. 
 2. Open a command window as the local Administrator account and change directory to the temporary download location. 
 3. Extract the "SPSSStatistics24.0.0.2Patch.msi" and locale-specific .mst file into a specified location from the downloaded FixPack installer file, "24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe",using the documented "/b" switch: 24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe /b"c:\Stats24002FixPack" (where <OS> is your operating system) 
 4. You can then copy the two extracted files to a network share for easier distribution. 
 5. Install the patch: 
    
    msiexec /i "c:\Stats24002FixPack\SPSS_Statistics_24002_<OS>_Patch.msi" /qn /L*V "%temp%\SPSSStatistics24002PatchLog.txt" PYTHON_EXISTS="1" TRANSFORMS="c:\Stats24002FixPack\1033.mst"
    
    (where <OS> is the same operating system specification as in step 3)


Installation Mac 

 1. Download and save the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack to your local hard drive. 
 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. 
 3. Execute the Statistics 24.0.0.2 Fix Pack installer from the downloaded .dmg file. 
 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the About Statistics 24 menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.


IBM SPSS Statistics 24 release is supported on Apple Macintosh OS X 10.10.x (Yosemite) through macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) 

Guidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Macintosh-based clients: 

IBM SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 for Mac OS X has a silent (push) installer. To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: 

 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). 
 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. 
 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:
    USER_INSTALL_DIR=/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24 
 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. 
 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:
    
    ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties


Installation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. 
 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. 
 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the ‘root’ user. 
 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.


Guidelines for unattended/pushed installations for Linux-based clients: The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Linux Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding "Running a Silent Installation on Mac and Linux Computers". 

Note: Please contact IBM SPSS Technical Support to obtain the appropriate installer.properties file for the Linux platform. 

SPSS Statistics Server - 24.0 FP2 Installation Instructions 

Installation Windows 

 1. Log in as a local administrator. 
 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. 
 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. 
 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. 
    Note: you must use "Run as Administrator" by first right-clicking on the executable. 
 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.


Installation UNIX/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX / Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation 

 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. 
 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. 
 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the /bin, /lib and /common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: 
    
    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common 
 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator’s Guide for more information. 
 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): ./<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. 
 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): ./<installer_name>
    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. 
 7. Start the Statistics Server after the Fix Pack installation is complete. 
 8. Run ./statisticsb and enter SHOW VERSION. The response should indicate 24.00.00.02
