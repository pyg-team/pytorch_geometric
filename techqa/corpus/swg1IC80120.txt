APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments Installation
   and Users Guide 6.3 needs to be updated to include a description
   of the VMHOST option of the DOMAIN paramter. In addition, the
   description of the same option in the Tivoli Storage Manager
   Backup Archive Client Installation and Users Guide 6.2 and 6.3
   needs to be updated because the current description can be
   misleading.
   
   The following description is currently documented:
   
   ---
   vmhost=hostname
   Process all virtual machines that are defined to the Virtual
   Center or to the ESX server that is specified on the VMCHOST
   option. The virtual machines also must be running on the ESX
   server that is specified by the host name. Host
   name can include multiple ESX servers separated by commas.
   Allows for automatic inclusion of newly added virtual machines.
   ---
   
   The above description is misleading as it is not clearly stated
   that this option is not desgined to control which ESX server a
   snapshot should be taken from, in case the VCenter contains a
   number of ESX servers. In fact, that can only be configured on
   VMware side within the VCenter.
   
   
   Platforms and versions affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environment 6.2 and 6.3
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low

   *                      and Users Guides (6.2, 6.3) are         *
   *                      missing a description of the vmhost     *
