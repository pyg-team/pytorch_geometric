APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is seeing intermittent loss of ODBC connections to
   MSSQL. The error reported is 'General network error. Check your
   network documentation.' with SQLSTATE '08S01'. Message flows
   that use the SAPInput node, or any of the WebSphere Adapters
   input nodes, do not release idle database connections. This can
   lead to database connections held by the message flow becoming
   stale if the database server or the network terminates
   connections after a long period of inactivity.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker using the SAPInput node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A message flow that takes input via a SAPInput node and makes
   a database connection to a Microsoft SQL Server can suffer
   from intermittent loss of ODBC connections resulting in the
   message 'General network error' being reported. Message flows
   that use the SAPInput node, or any of the WebSphere Adapters
   input nodes, do not release idle database connections. This
   can lead to database connections held by the message flow
   becoming stale, if the database server or the network terminates
   connections after a long period of inactivity.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker now releases idle database
   connections created by message flows that take input from the
   WebSphere Adapters input nodes, for example the SAPInput node.
