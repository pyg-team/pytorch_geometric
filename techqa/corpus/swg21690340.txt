AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM DB2 Recovery Expert for Linux, UNIX, and Windows version 3.1.0.0 through 4.1.0.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
You must replace the IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition that is installed with IBM DB2 Recovery Expert for Linux, UNIX, and Windows with the latest IBM Runtime Environment, Java™ Technology Edition. Detailed instructions are provided in the tech-note "Updating the JRE for DB2 Recovery Expert for Linux, UNIX and Windows [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21644942]". 


IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.
