   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   LOCAL FIX - N/A
   
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   The current knowledge center documentation for the
   BPMCheckOrphanTokens command does not specify what application
   changes are detected between snapshots.  The command may show
   results of no orphaned tokens for migrating to a new snapshot.
   However, there are some properties that are undetected that may
   lead to an orphaned token.  For example, if a flow line is
   modified in a way that it can produce an orphaned token if
   instance were migrated.  BPMCheckOrphanTokens does not check for
   such changes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM v8.5.0.x Knowledge Center.  More
   information is added to the documentation to clarify what
   application changes will not be detected by the command.
