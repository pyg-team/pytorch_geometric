ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Duplicated of BR10000105521
   Customer has found a major issue which is impacting
   production.
   When using the SWI option ?Open from SmarTeam? which we were
   told is the only supported ST/SW Integration option, the
   ?Destination directory? defaults to
   previous user?s destination location, and not obeying the
   Default Work Directory defined in STFE.
   The issue is not reproducible if we use the function ?Find
   Object? which we were told by DS is not a supported use for
   SWI. See below:
   If we continue using the ?Open from SmarTeam? option, users
   have to always remember to manually change the location of
   the file(s) which will be Checked-Out or the file(s) will be
   Checked-Out to a location that does not exist.
   If the file is checked to a non-existing location, the file
   is not accessible as the location gets created as phantom and
   the user does not have access to the location.
   I found BR10000105521 on DS? KB which appears to be the same
   issue as we are seeing.
   We cannot use the ?Find object? since DS told us that any
   option used under the SmarTeam menu in SW other than the
   ?Open from SmarTeam? is unsupported part of the integration.
   And using the ?Find Object? option produces the ?Read Only?
   error with files marked at Checked-Out.
   The only workaround we can use for now, is for each user to
   manually set the directory with every checkout.
   I would like to have this issue elevated and have DS/Artizone
   immediately provide us with the proper course of action from
   here, as we have no options to move forward in a ?Supported?
   fashion.
   Customer's Environment
   SmarTeam R20 SP 5 (HF 76)
   SolidWorks 2011 SP3.0
   Windows 7 x64
   Description of BE reproduction of BR10000105521 (for which
   this SR/BR is Duplicated) :
   Windows 7 x64 - V5R20 SP5 - SWI x64 - SW2011 SP2 x64 - PLMDB
   from V5R20 SP5
   No any default setting changed.
   Default setting included set in SMARTEAM System Configuration
   Editor for Default used
   I have reproduced the reported problem using next scenario:
   1. Launch SWI with admin
   2. Default SmarTeam Work directory is My
   Documents\SmarTeam\Work
   3. Create DifferentFolder in My Documents
   4. Create SW Part, Save it by SolidWorks Save As under
   DifferentFolder
   5. Do SmarTeam Save and Check In - succeeded
   6. Open from SmarTeam
   7. Search for the Part
   8. Check (mark) Edit check box in SmarTeam Open Dialog -
   Check Out window appears
   9. Check the destination directory
   Expected result: SmarTeam Work directory as My
   Documents\SmarTeam\Work should appear and the file should be
   copied into it
   Current result: the defect - My Documents\DifferentFolder
   appears (that was folder were the Part was saved previously
   in SW and in ST)
   Besides, if we are not using SmarTeam Open dialog (Open from
   SmarTeam, but any Search and doing Open for Edit/Check Out
   from Search SmarTeam Editor, there is the right destination
   folder appear
