Title: IBM Collecting Data: reporting a performance issue of the ruleset execution in the RES - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You are facing a performance issue of the ruleset execution in the Rule Ewecustion Server component. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Operation Decision Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

ANSWER
The following information must be provided whatever is the performance issue. This is the minimum information required to diagnose all performance issues concerning the RES execution stack. Depending on them, more information might be requested.
1. Version of ODM components 

The versions must be extracted from log files, copy/paste the concerned log for:


 * RES Console (if relevant) 
 * SSP (if relevant) 
 * HTDS (if relevant) 
 * RuleSession 
 * XU


2. Settings and environment of the execution stack: 

The versions must be extracted from log files, copy/paste the concerned log for: 
 * the exact version of the JDK 
 * the name of the server runtime environement (if relevant) 
 * the exact version of the server runtime environment (if relevant) 
 * Attach a screenshot of the ruleset properties in the RES console of all concerned rulesets or send a backup of the RES repository.


Provide the settings of the XU by attaching one of the following: 
 * the ra.xml 
 * a screenshot of the configuration of the XU in the Application Server console 
 * your code setting the XU with the RuleSession API


3. Installation of the XU 

Is the XU installed as: 
 * a global connector (yes/no) 
 * scoped in a j2ee application (yes/no) 
 * using j2se mode (yes/no)


4. How is the execution of the rulesets triggered? 

Which RES modules are used: 
 * HTDS (yes/no) 
 * SSP (yes/no) 
 * RS-EJB (yes/no) 
 * RS-MDB (yes/no) 
 * RS API (yes/no) 
 * DecisionRunner (yes/no)


If the RuleSession API is used by your code:  * Attach the code calling the RuleSession API

or  * Provide the following information:  *  Stateful or stateless rule session? Is the execution trace used? Is force uptodate enabled? 
   
   


Describe the minimal execution scenario to generate the performance issue: 
 * How many different rulesets? 
 * How many applications? 
 * How many concurrent executions? 
 * What is the average duration of the ruleset execution? 
 * What is the average TPS? The TPS stands for Transaction Per Second, it is the average number of rulesets executed per second. 
 * How many ruleset changes?


5. Log and dumps of the RES execution stack 

What is the time (or the most possible precise range of time) of the performance issue? 

Attach the log of at least the RES components of the execution stack (RuleSession, XU, and persistence). 

Attach at least 2 XU dumps, one before and one after the issue. If possible one XU dump during the performance issue. RELATED INFORMATION
