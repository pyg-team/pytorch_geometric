APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Tivoli Framework 4.3.1 TMR and Endpoint on the same AIX box.
   After upgrade, w commands fail with the following error :
   
      > wlookup -ar ProfileManager
   exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program wlookup because of the
   following errors:
    0509-022 Cannot load module
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  /usr/local/Tivoli/lib/aix4-r1/libms343.a(libms343_shr
   ).ne
    0509-022 Cannot load module
   /usr/local/Tivoli/lib/aix4-r1/libms343.a(libms343_shr).
      0509-150   Dependent module
   /opt/Tivoli/lcf/lib/aix4-r1/libdes343.a(libdes343.a.shr) could
   not be loaded.
              0509-152   Member libdes343.a.shr is not found in
   archive
              0509-022 Cannot load module wlookup.
      0509-150   Dependent module
   /usr/local/Tivoli/lib/aix4-r1/libms343.a(libms343_shr) could not
   be loaded.
   0509-022 Cannot load module .
   
   The Framework server environment is sourced and everything is
   fine up until the endpoint environment is sourced then.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  From 4.3.1, the name of members in the archive library has been
   changed for AIX. Thus the member name is different between the
   server and endpoint. It causes incompatibility between the
   libraries of the server and endpoint.
   The member name in the following two libraries are conflicted.
   
   LCF:
     libcpl343.a
       (member) shr.o
   
     libdes343.a
       (member) shr.o
   
   TMF:
     libcpl343.a
       (member) libcpl343_shr
   
     libdes343.a
       (member) libdes343.a.shr
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is fixed in patch 4.3.1-TMF-0012 and 4.3.1-LCF-0010.
