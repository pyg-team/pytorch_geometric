APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Master Data Engine is a high performance application and
   uses large amounts of RAM to provide fast response time.  On
   larger installations, the memory and file requirements can
   exceed the default ulimit (user limits) setting of the
   operating system.
   Set all ulimit settings related to memory (stack and heap) and
   the number of open file descriptors (nofile) per process to
   "unlimited" or the maximum allowable size. The supported
   operating systems of IBM AIX, Linux, or Solaris have different
   options for setting the memory, stack, and open file settings
   (for example, through user creation or within a user .profile
   or .login file).
   For Linux, change the number of open file descriptors (nofile)
   to 65535.
   For complete details, see the vendor specific documentation for
   ulimit settings.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

   Documentation added for "User limits on UNIX and Linux
   platforms":
   The Master Data Engine is a high performanceapplication and uses
   large amounts of RAM to provide fast response time. Onlarger
   installations, the memory and file requirements can exceed the
   default ulimit (user limits)setting of the operating system.
   Set all ulimit settings related to memory (stack andheap) and
   the number of open file descriptors (nofile) per process
   to"unlimited" or the maximum allowable size. The supported
   operatingsystems of IBM© AIX©, Linux, or Solaris have different
   options for setting thememory, stack, and open file settings
   (for example, through user creation orwithin a user .profileor
   .loginfile).
   For Linux, change the number of open filedescriptors (nofile) to
   65535.
