QUESTION
 Is it possible to monitor the status (failed, overrun, etc) of the Oracle DBMS Jobs using Oracle Extended agent ? 

ANSWER
The Oracle Extended agent currently does not have a specific attribute group to monitor the status of the Oracle Jobs. 

Anyway, you can leverage on the feature called Customized SQL to implement your own monitoring of the wanted information. 
The following link provides detail about the Customized SQL feature and how to configure it: 

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/oracleextended/fac_config_agentspecific_definingsql.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/oracleextended/fac_config_agentspecific_definingsql.html]

Basically, you may want to identify the table where those information are maintained and use an SQL query to extract them from the table. 

For example if you are using DBMS Scheduler, you can use table DBA_SCHEDULER_JOBS. 

This is a link from Oracle portal explaining something more about monitoring of the DBMS jobs: 

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/schedadmin002.htm [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/schedadmin002.htm] 

Using the Customized SQL you can extract all the information highlighted in the above article and have them displayed on TEP.
