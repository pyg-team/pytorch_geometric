QUESTION
 How do you set the prefix for objects in IBM Rational DOORS? 

CAUSE
The Object Identifier is composed of the Module Prefix concatenated with the Object's absolute number. It is generally desirable that objects in different modules have different identifiers; so when you copy a module you often want to change the new module's Prefix and therefore all its objects identifier

ANSWER
The following steps will change the object prefix in a DOORS module:


 1. Open the module exclusive edit
    
    
 2. Click the File menu > Module Properties...
    
    
 3. Select the attribute name Prefix on the general tab 
    The background color will darken
    
    
 4. Click View/Edit button
    This loads the attribute window
    
    
 5. Add your desired prefix in the value field 
    
    
 6. Click OK to close the attribute window 
    
    
 7. Click OK to close the properties window
