QUESTION
 When SQL Server 2012 is configured in AlwaysOn High Availability configuration, what are the steps to properly monitor the database environment with ITM SQL Server Agent ? 

ANSWER
AlwaysON feature is not intended to realize HA for SQL Server services,it is a more integrated way to 
perform database mirroring and realize high availability. 
In SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn introduces a new concept of "database group".
Target for High Availability is the database group, not the 
services as for the normal cluster configuration. Locally there are now 2 (or more) servers running an active instance per server. 
The DB are grouped by groupID on which you create a LISTENER with its Server Name, IP and port.
On one of the instances the DB will be on-line, while the secondary will be read-only because a Mirror service keeps them aligned with the one on primary server. 
The Cluster service only task is to map Server Name, IP, and takes you to the physical 
server that currently has active database group in that specific moment.

----
This is the AlwaysOn concept from a client application perspective. 
For what concern KOQAGENT, you don't need to perform any specific 
cluster configuration beside installing and configuring the KOQAGENT on 
the nodes where the SQL Server instances are running. 
If the SQL Server services are active and running on both nodes, we 
will have the two KOQAGENT running on the respective node and 
collecting data. 
The SQL Server Agent 6.3 introduces new attribute groups and workspaces for AlwaysOn feature.
So, after you configured the agents on the db nodes running SQL Server engines, you 
only need to start them, and all the rest with regard to the AlwaysOn
feature, is managed by the agent itself.
