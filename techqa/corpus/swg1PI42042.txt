ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) gives an error if Oracle 12c is
   used as the database, and fails to connect with the following
   error message:
   
   "Data source connection test failed: CRRGW5548E An
   com.ibm.team.integration.reporting.db.exception.DbAccessExceptio
   n error occurred when validating the database connection, caused
   by !CRRGW6011E Database version detected is "Oracle Database 12c
   Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production With
   the Partitioning, OLAP, Advanced Analytics and Real Application
   Testing options" but Oracle 10.2.0.0 or 11.2.0.2 or later is
   required"
   
   The workaround is to ignore the version check by adding
   com.ibm.team.datawarehouse.db.override.versioncheck=true to the
   app.properties file to ignore the version check.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Solution:
   The Oracle driver code in JRS was only supporting versions 10g
   and 11g of the database. Support for a 12c database was added.
   In addition, the JRS driver now allows versions 11.2+ and 12.1+
   of the Oracle JDBC driver.
