PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring 6.0.0 users.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQ agent has repeated abend 0E0 in      *
   *                      functions MQEL and MQXM.                *

   ****************************************************************
   If the monitored queue manager is terminated by the MVS force
   command, it is possible for the queue manager to be left in an
   unexpected state that MQ monitoring agent does not recognize.
   This causes the MQ monitoring agent to repeatedly attempt to
   access unavailable queue manager data and abend.
   
   The following messages may be seen:
   
      KMQRM104E  ABEND recovery entered
      KMQRM104E+   Code=X'00E0' FUNCTION=MQEL ADDRESS=X'BB5004EE'
   
      KMQRM104E  ABEND recovery entered
      KMQRM104E+   Code=X'00E0' FUNCTION=MQXM ADDRESS=X'BB5453DA'
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to check additional status flags in
   queue manager to identify when queue manager is in force or
   quiesce state. This will allow MQ monitoring agent to identify
   problem and stop monitoring.
