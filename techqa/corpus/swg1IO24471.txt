ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#act
   ion=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=20183 [https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=20183]
   
   On a Windows 7 & 8 system, using Datacap 9.0 FP3, running IE10,
   the following two scenarios have been observed where the Batch
   Status for a Assembly(Classify) job and for a Verify job remains
   on HOLD after completing the task
   
   
   Scenario 1: When an Assembly Job is completed within Datacap
   Navigator,
   the batch is routed to the Verify Job. However, the batch that
   was
   previously in Assembly is not removed and is put on Hold status.
   The
   Assembly batch is still able to be opened and changes can be
   made and
   submitted (however, submitting the batch in this instance does
   not
   create another batch in Verify).
   
   
   
   Scenario 2 (same application): Verify batches that are committed
   to
   FileNet are still showing up as 'Hold' in Verify.
   
   
   
   Notes:
   
   1. This behavior was first observed after FP3 was applied in
   November.
   2. This event appears to occur whenever a wTM session timesout
   out while processing the manual task. When the session timeout
   occurs, the user is logged out of DC Navigator.  Once the user
   logs back in, they can complete and Submit the task.  However,
   once submitted, the batch status remains on Hold (instead of
   "Job Done") and the status of the next task (Verify) changes to
   Pending
