   ****************************************************************
   Date-type variables can now be substituted with an expression
   containing the string 'CURRENT DATE'. When promted for such
   variables, the user may for example enter this expression on
   the data selection panel:
            CURRENT DATE - 7 DAYS
   The expression is not case sensitive. Enclosing quotes are
   allowed but not required. CURRENT DATE expressions are also
   supported for BATCH reports; however, when used in DRLEBATR
   calls, the expression must be enclosed in quotes:
            &FROM_DATE='CURRENT DATE - 7 DAYS'
              &TO_DATE='CURRENT DATE'
