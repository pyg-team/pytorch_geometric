PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 License Expired error message 

SYMPTOM
Attempts to login to the application causes an error message to display indicating that the license has expired. The error messages that will appear in the WAS SystemOut.log file are: 

DSRA8201W: DataSource Configuration: DSRA8040I: Failed to connect to the DataSource. Encountered java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied 

DSRA001E: SQL State = 7200. Error Code = 1,1017. java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied


CAUSE
There are two reasons why this error can appear:
1 - The license has truly expired.
2 - Connectivity to the database has failed so the ability to validate the license fails causing the error message.


ENVIRONMENT
Database server
Application/Process servers



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The server.log file for either the application and/or process servers will indicate an issue connecting to the database. 

Example error message found in the server.log file or WAS SystemOut log:

DSRA8201W: DataSource Configuration: DSRA8040I: Failed to connect to the DataSource. Encountered java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
DSRA0010E: SQL State = 72000, Error Code = 1,017.
java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clients should first validate that the database is running and that connections from the application/process servers to the database work. If access is done via a web server, verify that the web server has access to the database server. Check to see if there are any firewall rules or proxy servers in the network configuration that may be preventing the connection to the DB server.
