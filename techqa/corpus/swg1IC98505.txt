   software\control-m server\ctm_server\exe\ctmsrv_service.exe' is
   not backed up as part of the system state because cluster disk
   'd:' is not accessible.
   
   The same error is generated when running backup using Tivoli
   Storage Manager backup-archive client 6.4.1.0, 6.4.1.1, 6.3.2.0
   But there is no above error when using Tivoli Storage Manager
   backup-archive client 6.3.1. The d$ is shared between two
   cluster nodes and it belongs to other nodes.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In MS Cluster environment System Writer can return file
   located on witness disk that is not available at moment of the
   system state backup (volume belongs to other node). In this
   situation we issue a message that disk is not available and
   continue processing.
