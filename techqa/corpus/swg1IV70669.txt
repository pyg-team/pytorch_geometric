   ABSTRACT:             KFWITM217E error in historical config
   window
   
   Problem Description:
   =============
   With the TEP client and history collection configuration window
   open, GUI showed KFWITM217E error if the db2 connection was
   disconnected and restored.
   
   This is the popup message:
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Cannot load Product Configuration data
   KFWITM217E Request error:[IBM][CLI Driver] SQL1224N The
   database manager is not able to accept new requests, has
   terminated all requests in progress, or has terminated the
   specified request because of an error or a forced interrupt.
   SQLSTATE=55032, GENERIC SQLSTATE:40003, ERR:-1224
   SQLExecDirect rc=-1:SQL_ERROR
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Once user click "OK" on that message, the historical collection
   config works just fine.
   
   This problem didn't occur in ITM 623 release, observed in ITM
   63 FP2 and above.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   With the TEP client and history collection configuration window
   open, stop and start warehouse db. Wait to make sure the
   warehouse db is up and running. On the history collection
   config window, try selecting "unix os" history, for example,
   you'll get the KFWITM217E error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Once user click "OK" on the message popup, the history
   collection configuration works just fine.
