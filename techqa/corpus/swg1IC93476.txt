LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users who have MQTT clients which are
   regularly reconnecting to the MQXR listener following broken
   connections.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   There was a small timing window in which a connection that is in
   the process of being reestablished is used before it has
   completed. Depending on the time at which this happened, this
   would cause one of two NullPointerException FDCs to be thrown,
   and the MQXR listener channel to stop unexpectedly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The timing window has been removed and the NullPointerExceptions
   no longer occur.
