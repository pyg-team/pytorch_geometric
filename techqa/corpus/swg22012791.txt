QUESTION
 How do I change the width of the left column on my Maximo Start Center (Go To Applications)? 

ANSWER
The width of the column that contains the "Go To Applications" on the Start Center in Maximo 7.6 is determined by a value in the 

Library.xml file. By default the column width is longer than any of the standard application names and looks like this: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22012791&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22012791&aid=1]

Some clients would like the left column to be narrower and look more like this:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22012791&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22012791&aid=2] 

 

You can modify the width of the left hand column by modifying a value in your Library.xml file. Please try the following on
a test environment to change the width of your left column on the Start Center. 

First in Application Designer, click on Select Action / Export System XML and then select the Library xml. 

After the Library xml opens in a browser,save the page to your 
hard drive as LIBRARY.xml. Then make a backup of the LIBRARY.xml in case you need to restore the original version. 

Then open LIBRARY.xml in a text editor such as Wordpad or Notepad and look for the following code: 

<section cssclass="sysNav" id="GotoOnlyNav"> 
<sectionrow id="t1rg"> 
<sectioncol id="t1c0g" sysnav="true"> 
<navcontainer collapsible="true" id="taskNavg" 
pagenav="true" width="190"> 

Then change the width value from 190 to a smaller value such as 100 and save your file. You will end up with the code below. You may have to 
experiment with the exact width you would like but the process is the same. 

<section cssclass="sysNav" id="GotoOnlyNav"> 
<sectionrow id="t1rg"> 
<sectioncol id="t1c0g" sysnav="true"> 
<navcontainer collapsible="true" id="taskNavg" 
pagenav="true" width="100"> 

After saving your changes go back into Application Designer and click on "Import Application Definition" and browse for your modified LIBRARY.xml
file and import your changed file. Then logout and back in and see if the left column is now at the desired width like the one shown above.
