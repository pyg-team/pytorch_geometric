APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario:
   - Activate the VPM variable for improving PSN performance:
   CATCDMA.VPM.XML.STORAGE : STRING;
   CATCDMA.VPM.XML.STORAGE = '/tmp/xml_vs_storage_$ORACLE_SID/';
   - Copy the content of the cache at the corresponding location.
   - Start 3DCOM and expand a PSN
   -> Attributes of some Parts are set to null (see video scenario_
   ko.zip),which is not the expected behaviour.
   - Exit 3DCOM and delete the content of directory /tmp/xml_vs_sto
   rage_$ORACLE_SID/
   - Start 3DCOM and replay the same scenario (see video scenario_o
   k.zip)
   -> Attributes are now displayed successfully.
   RESULT:wrong PSN display with 3DCOM XML Cache

   - Exit 3DCOM and delete the content of directory
   /tmp/xml_vs_storage_$ORACLE_SID/
   - Start 3DCOM and replay the same scenario (see video

   -> Attributes are now displayed successfully.
   RESULT:wrong PSN display with 3DCOM XML Cache
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem seems to be due to corrupted PSN Cache
   Additional Closure Information:
   Explanation:
   According to R&D the main problem is the creation of
   Corrupted PSN Cache.
   We need to understand the scenario at the point where
   incorrect PSN cache are created.
   The scenario you have provide is the result of corrupted PSN
   cache,But R&D requires the scenario to root cause of the
   problem.
   Hence as at this point there is no scenario for creation of
   corrupted PSN cache,we cannot correct this.
   Possibility for customer :
   1)The problem seems to be due to the corrupted PSN cache and
   if we delete the content of directory
   /tmp/xml_vs_storage_$ORACLE_SID/ the problem does not appear
   any more.
   2)Each time a file (PSNCache) is created in the cache
   directory
   put it as read only, to ensure these file are not modified
   improperly.
