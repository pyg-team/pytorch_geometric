Title: IBM AEL on Web GUI clients hangs - United States

Text:
AEL; hang; freeze; frozen; JRE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 AEL applets freezes when Java console and debug options are enabled 

SYMPTOM
We observed this problem in the following environment: 

Operating System version : Windows 7 Professional Version 
Browser : Internet Explorer 8 
Java version : Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.045_b06) 

On Web GUI clients,when Java console and debug options are enabled, AEL applets occasionally hang in IE. When the problem happens, it doesn't affect other Web GUI clients. Closing and reopening IE, login to Web GUI again would fix the problem.


CAUSE
A bug in Java 1.6 was identified:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Oracle fixes the bug in Java 1.7. For Web GUI clients, please refer to Web GUI reference guide regarding supported Java version before upgrading.
