ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The behavior of "Secured By option" is not correct
   V5R18 SP7 HF6 HF15
   Database sent by Customer in case 87612999760 as Exp_R18.dmp
   (ID=26DDC1D793A94A7FA031587E8D2CA0FB).
   Accordingly to call information this database was upgraded V5 R1
   4 - R16 - R18.
   Accordingly to call information this database is some 'Old SmDem
   o', but really it is CHANGED by Customer DATABASE and SmDemo is
   only its name, not SmDemo setting.
   Real SmDemo setting related to Secure By shown in SmarTeam Data
   Model Designer for SmDemo_V5R18.
   The problem below does not relate to SmDemo, to old SmDemo, and
   to upgraded SmDemo.
   But the problem is next (found by VAR / Customer and related to
   'middle class' problem).
   While in some database Documents Super Class IS NOT ASSIGNED for
    Secure By, but some Leaf Class ('middle class') as, e.g. Solid
   Edge IS ASSIGNED for Secure By, then Secure By checkbox IS DISAB
   LED (grayed out) and next cases should be tested after fixing th
   e problem:
   Scenario 1:
   1. User joe has a Role in Project-0063 ACME Manufacturing (Proje
   ct Manager)
   2. User joe can successfully add Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draw
   ing, Weldment with Secure By USING SmarTeam Editor to this Proje
   ct
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with joe
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draft, Weldment, She
   et Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose same Project-0063 => Choose
    Link to Project and Add to Desktop => And click on Documents tr
   ee
   6. KO=NG: Secured By check box IS DISABLED (grayed out)
   Scenario 2:
   1. User joe has NO Role in some new created Project (created by
   bob and only bob has in the new Project some Role as Project Man
   ager)
   2. User joe can successfully add Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draw
   ing, Weldment with Secure By USING SmarTeam Editor to this Proje
   ct
   NOTE: it is since joe is Admin
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with joe
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draft, Weldment, She
   et Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose created Project => Choose L
   ink to Project and Add to Desktop => And click on Documents tree
   6. KO=NG: Secured By check box IS DISABLED
   (grayed out)
   Scenario 3:
   1. User bob has NO Role in Project-0063 ACME Manufacturing or in
    any other Project, including created ones for testing purposes
   2. User bob CAN NOT successfully add Solid Edge Part, Assembly,
   Drawing, Weldment with Secure By USING SmarTeam Editor to this P
   roject using SmarTeam Editor
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with bob
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draft, Weldment, She
   et Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose same Project-0063 or any ot
   her Project where bob HAS NO appropriated Role => Choose Link to
    Project and Add to Desktop => And click on Documents tree
   6. OK: Secured By check box IS DISABLED (grayed out).
   Scenario 4:
   1. User bob has a Role in any Project, including created ones fo
   r testing purposes
   2. User bob can successfully add Solid Edge Part, Assembly, Draw

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENTATION
   DELIVERED WITH SmarTeam VERSION V5R20
   Additional Closure Information:
   ACI, INI, SEI, SWI, Office integrations
   Chapter: Basic Tasks or (if Other):
   Topic: Project Manager, OR Saving a Part for the First Time
   Documentation after correction :
   In each integration, the following text was added:
   Text added to "Saving a Drawing for the First
   Time" or "Project Manager" topics:
   Secured By
   When checked, the object you select is linked to
   the project and receives security settings
   according to the Link to Project settings defined
   for the entire project.
   Note: When the database contains Project-based
   security and you assign "Secured by Project" for a
   leaf class (but not for a super-class), the
   Secured By checkbox in the Project Manager window
   is disabled.
