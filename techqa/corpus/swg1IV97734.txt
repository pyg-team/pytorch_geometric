APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  zLinux computers are not being recognised correctly.
   For this case, there are two z13 machines 2964-n30, one machine
   has 8 Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and another has 4 IFL.
   There is no CPU pooling configured on zVM. Each Integrated
   Facility for Linux (IFL) or Central Processor (CP) engine
   should be equivalent to 1 core. But ILMT recognized 30 IFL's
   for full capacity which is probably linked to the fact that z13
   Model N30 has 1 to 30 PUs, but these are not just IFL's.
   The number of IFL's is 4 and 8 so ILMT should use this numbers
   for PVU full capacity calculation. It is also important to
   mention that numbers under server cores column are correct.
