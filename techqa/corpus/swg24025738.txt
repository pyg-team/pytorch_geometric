ABSTRACT
 This document provides download and installation information for IBM速 Rational速 RequisitePro速, version 7.1.1 Interim Fix 001. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This interim fix is an update to the Rational RequisitePro fix pack 7.1.1. The interim fix download contains content for upgrading only Rational RequisitePro. It can be installed independently from other Rational products. This interim fix does not include the entire product, but rather a subset of fixed components and files. 

What's new in this release
This interim fix provides enhanced integration for Rational RequisitePro and Rational Requirements Composer. The major enhancements include the following: 

 * Ability to resynchronize Rational Requirements Composer attribute groups and Rational RequisitePro requirement types. 
 * Ability to import requirements from Rational RequisitePro that are located in Microsoft速 Word documents. 
 * Ability to remove or change the connection between projects in Rational Requirements Composer and Rational RequisitePro. 
 * New support for integer, decimal and date attribute types. 
 * User-navigable links are now maintained between requirements in both tools. 

This integration requires the installation of Rational Requirements Composer version 2.0.0.1 and this Rational RequisitePro version 7.1.1 iFix01.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
There are two options available for updating to this interim fix:


 * You can add the path to the update repository in IBM Installation Manager and then use the Update feature. This method requires a connection to the Internet on the computer performing the update. 
 * 
 * If you are behind a firewall or otherwise unable to use the online update mechanism, you can download the update repository, extract it to a local server (creating a local repository), add that repository to Installation Manager on computers on your network, and use the Update feature to perform the installation.



Before beginning the upgrade using either of the installation options, close Rational RequisitePro. If you are upgrading an installation with the Web components (RequisiteWeb), perform the following tasks: 
 * Use your Windows Computer Management to stop the following services:  * IBM HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC
    * IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 - RWP ReqWeb Servlet
   
   
 * Copy the catalog.txt file and store it elsewhere in your file system. By default, this file is located here:
   C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\RequisitePro\ReqWeb\projects
 * If you previously specified an alternate installation location, copy the config.txt file and store it elsewhere in your file system. By default, this file is located here: 
   C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\profiles\profile2\installedApps\ DefaultNode\ReqWeb.ear\ReqWeb.war\WEB-INF\classes\ 
 * If you previously customized the Rational Web Platform for RequisiteWeb, as described in Configuring the IBM Rational Web Platform [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/reqpro/v7r1m0/topic/rwp/topics/c_configuration_overview.html], make copies of the httpd.conf, ssl.conf files, and any other files you modified.


After you finish upgrading the RequisiteWeb installation, restore your copy of the catalog.txt and other backup files to the directories in which they were previously located.
