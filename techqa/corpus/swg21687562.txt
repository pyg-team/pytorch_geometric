QUESTION
 How do I enable Bidirectional language support in Maximo Cognos Reports? 

ANSWER
For Maximo Cognos reports to support for bidirectional languages, settings must be enabled in Cognos. 

First, set the values within Cognos Connection and Cognos Workspace Advanced 

To do this, access the Cognos Connection. Open the My Preferences page, and select the 'Enable bidirectional support' check box. 

If you are using Cognos Workspace Advanced, select the 'Enable bidirectional support' check box in the Run Reports window of this product. 

Notes: 

1. If you enable or disable bidirectional support in Cognos Connection and then you start Cognos Workspace Advanced, the settings from Cognos Connection will be applied to Cognos Workspace Advanced. 

Next, within the Report Studio tool, set the direction of the text so it displays right to left.
This is known as mirroring the text. 

1. Add a language parameter to the report for a bidi language (For example, ‘ar’, ‘he’, ‘fa’) 

2. Specify that the whole report (the highest level “container” object) should be displayed right-to-left. 

3. Adjust lower-level ‘containers’ (column, graphs, etc.) or base text direction of content so that they display correctly; for example, if they contain non-bidi text.
