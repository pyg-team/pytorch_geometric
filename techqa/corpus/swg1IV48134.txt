APAR STATUS

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users using AD version shipped with Drivers 17 or earlier.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * AD creates two separate socket connections to a device       *
   * during an ssh2 connection attempt - one to determine the ssh *
   * version and the second to login and discover the device.     *
   * Devices setup with a race condition where you cannot connect *
   * more than once to the same device inside a one second period *
   * will cause discovery to fail.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to the AD version being shipped with Drivers 18.     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Updated ssh2 code so that it uses only one connection throughout
   ssh2 negotiation.
