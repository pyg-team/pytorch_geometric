APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I would like a simple change to the error message which is
   already being
   displayed to add there information that this issue could be
   caused by
   invalid credentials to IEM Server Console Operator.
   I would recommend under this APAR to add some error handling to
   differentiate between:
   a) invalid credentials (most software is responding with
   "unknown user",
   "wrong password")
   b) other, perhaps not handled error conditions ("unexpected
   error, refer
   to logs for more details")
   
   <Example) Missing an 'unzip' package on IEM server machine which
   is prerequisite for VM Manager Tool.
   While this was a customer mistake, because we have described in
   our doc
   that unzip package is required for vm manager tool to be
   successfully
   installed e.g. here:
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.l [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.l]
   mt.doc_9
   .0/com.ibm.license.mgmt.doc/admin/r_vmm_reqs.html
   We could do more and better. For example we can modify the same
   above
   error message on UI and add there next potential cause of the
   problem
   (missing unzip package).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * When an action cannot be completed because it cannot be sent
   * to the Endpoint Manager server, it is not clear whether the
   * problem is caused by invalid credentials or some other error.
   * EXPECTED RESULTS:
   * Error messages that are displayed when the action cannot be
   * sent to the Endpoint Manager server indicate whether the
   * problem occurs because of invalid credentials or due to some
   * other error that needs to be checked in the log.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply appropriate update when available.
