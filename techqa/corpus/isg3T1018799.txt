abstract text
One currently has a Stored Procedure with a 1 Meg Parameter XML data type defined which is coming across a DRDA connection. It is possible that there will be multiple calls of the same Stored Procedure before a COMMIT is sent. Does the DB2 DSNZPARM LOBVALA value need to be cumulative, i.e. if one has 15 calls to this Stored Procedure before a COMMIT, does one need 15 Megs defined for the LOBVALA parameter?
