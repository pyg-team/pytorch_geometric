ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   Request isn't correctly listed when "Delete User" filter is
   selected in
   "View Completed Requests".
   This phenomena occurs under Japanese language installed. This
   can't see
   under English environment.
   
   When Today, This week or This month is set as the filtered term,
   no
   "Delete User" request is listed.
   When the filter is set as "from 1st of Jan 2000 to tomorrow",
   only
   "Delete User" requests, which are older than this month, are
   listed.
   
   Can Customer Recreate:
   Yes, and Japan L2 regenerated.
   
   ITIM Server Version - 4.5.1 with IF18LA
   
   Server Environment
   Operating System   : AIX5.2 ML3
   Database server    : DB2 V8.1 w/ FP2
   Directory server   : IDS5.1 w/ FP2
   Application Server : WebSphere V5.0 w/ FP2
   
   Desired Behavior:
   "Delete User" filter should work correctly.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   1) Install Japanese language using Language Support CD-Rom
   2) Change priority of language in IE browser
      IE, take for example,
      a) Select "internet option" from "Tool" menu
      b) Select "Language..."
      c) Make "Japanese [ja]" to be the top priority
      d) Restart IE to get it effective
   3) Login to ITIM
   4) Create a person
   5) Delete the person
   6) Go to filter setting of "View Completed Requests", then set
   "Today"
      and "All Users".
   7) On "View Completed Request", set "All" filter
   8) Make sure that two completed requests above are listed.
      Please refer OK.jpg image file.
   9) Change the filter to "Delete User", then make sure whether
   the
   "Delete User" request is listed.
      "Delete User" request should be there, but no request is
   listed.
      Please refer Error_Today_DeleteUser.jpg image file.
      If you change the term to "This week" or "This month", you
   would see
      the same phenomena.
   10) Change the filter to "New User". This change works fine.
   "New User"
       request gets listed.
   11) Change the filter to "All"
   12) Go to filter setting of "View Completed Requests", then set
   as
       follows. (Please refer Filter_by_a_term.jpg image file.)
      "Between Specific Dates"
      Start: 1st Jan 2000  00:00
      End  : Tomorrow
   13)Make sure that two completed requests above are listed.
   14)Change the filter to "Delete User", then make sure whether
   the
      "Delete User" request is listed.
      The "Delete User" request should be there, but no request is
   listed.
      Please refer Error_Term_DeleteUser.jpg image file.
      If there are another "Delete User" requests, which have been
   run
      before, they would correctly be listed.
