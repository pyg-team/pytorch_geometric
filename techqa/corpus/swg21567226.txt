PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote identifies a "General network error" issue that can occur in IBM Rational ClearQuest when using a Microsoft SQL Server database. 

SYMPTOM
You are using SQL Server database Named Instance. You have configured Rational ClearQuest to connect with either the Hostname field set to:


<SERVER HOST>\<INSTANCE NAME>

Or your Connect Options are set to: 

INSTANCE=<INSTANCE NAME>


When connecting, this error occurs: 


SQLDriverConnect: RETCODE=-1, State=08001, Native Error=11
[IBM Rational DataDirect][ODBC SQL Server Driver][libssclient24]General network error. Check your network documentation.
[IBM Rational DataDirect][ODBC SQL Server Driver][libssclient24]ConnectionOpen (Hostname and server name not provided or found()).
A network trace reveals that the server host and instance names are separated and re-joined as an invalid hostname. 



CAUSE
This was identified as a product defect under APAR PM49352, but determined to be a permanent restriction.



ENVIRONMENT
Rational ClearQuest is installed on Linux or UNIX. Database vendor is SQL Server.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
See technote 1261609 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21261609] for a workaround and information about this issue on Linux and UNIX platforms.
