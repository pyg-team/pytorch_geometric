PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempt to install IBM Netcool/OMNIbus FP8 (7.3.0-TIV-NCOMNIbus-linux2x86-FP0008) results in error: "Incorrect install location. The path you entered did not have any Netcool/Omnibus components installed. Please check and try again" 

CAUSE
Seems user did non-root install originally but carried out OMNIbus FP8 installation as root. 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Netcool/OMNIbus 7.3.0 with IBM Deployment Engine (DE), non-root installation

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review which user performed the base/previous installation - mostly, a non-root user. 




Ensure that you have a back-up server with same environment/installation.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please follow the workaround noted below to resolve the issue :

1. Take backup of DE from backup server using command below: 


"<DE_INSTALL_LOCATION>\bin\de_backupdb -bfile backupFile" 



2. Copy the DE "backupFile" from backup server to primary server.

3. Please take backup of the "/usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos", copy repos folder to some other location in primary server.

4. Restore DE backup on primary server using command below: 


"/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_restoredb -bfile backupFile" 



4. Now, re-try the FP installation
