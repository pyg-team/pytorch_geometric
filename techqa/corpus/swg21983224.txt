Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities in Node.js affect IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software included in Rational Developer for i and Rational Developer for AIX and Linux - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Portions of IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software are shipped as a component of Rational Developer for i (RPG and COBOL + Modernization Tools, Java and EGL editions), and Rational Developer for AIX and Linux.
Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities in Node.js were found on May 3, 2016. IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software has addressed the applicable CVEs (CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2105). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2105 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
