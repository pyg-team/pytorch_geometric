Title: IBM Mustgather: Gathering data for a Java application crash problem on Windows - United States

Text:
windows crash gather; MustGatherDocument TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If your Java application crashes on a Windows operating system, there are a number of diagnostic data files that are useful for diagnosing the problem. This mustgather document describes about the diagnostic data files to be collected and the procedure to collect the same. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following set of diagnostic data files will be generated during the time of the java application crash:
1. Javacores
2. Core dumps
3. Snap traces
4. JIT dumps (For Java 7.1 and Java 8 releases only) 
5. Application logs (stdout, stderr)

For these diagnostic data files to be created, check that the system is configured correctly as per setup [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222468] document. 

NOTE: From Java 7.1 and Java 8 releases onwards, Just Intime Compiler(JIT) generates JIT diagnostic dumps on general protection fault(GPF) and abort events. 

Please collect the diagnostic data files generated during the time of the java application crash as per the below steps:

1. Collect the javacore, core dump, snap trace and JIT dump generated.

Please note that all the javacore, core dump, snap trace and JIT dump generated can be found in the current path and the names of them will follow the below format:
Javacore : javacore.<time stamp>.<id>.txt
Core dump : core.<time stamp>.<id>.dmp
Snap trace file : snap.<time stamp>.<id>.trc
JIT dump : jitdump.<time stamp>.<id>.dmp 

For Java 6 and 5 SDK releases, 

Run the JExtract tool against the generated core dump using the following command:
<installpath>/jre/bin/jextract [coredump]


For 64bit JVM enabled with -Xcompressedrefs option, please use
<installpath>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [coredump] 

Save the resulting archive file, which has a name in the format of
core.<time stamp>.<id>.dmp.zip 


From Javaâ„¢ 7 SDKs on Windows platforms, you do not need to run the jextract utility. 

In case, if the core dump is not generated as expected using -Xdump option as in setup [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21222468], please refer and use the Microsoft ADPlus [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/hardware/ff537953%28v=vs.85%29.aspx] tool to generate the core dump at the time of crash as appropriate and send us for diagnosing the problem.

2.Collect the console logs, such as standard out and standard error logs, which are generated by default. 

After collecting all the above diagnostic data files, you can submit them for help with diagnosing the problem.
