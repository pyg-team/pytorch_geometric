ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  226029
   Operating System: Windows (Microsoft)
   
   Problem title
   Can't generate a static import statement for an event
   
   Problem description
   In Rhapsody Java V7.5, I can add a dependency with stereotype
   ??StaticImport??  to a class and a static import statement is
   generated
   ok. I can do the same for a package, but there is no code
   generation for an event.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As I workaround I have to set the property
   Java_CG:Framework:EventIncludeFiles to
   com.ibm.rational.rhapsody.oxf.
   RiJEvent, static java.util.LinkedList.*; in order to get my
   static
   import statement generated.
   The attached java model shows the workaround applied to the
   event
   AlarmClockMainMenu.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PK93896 - ??StaticImport?? doesn't gen correct code for
   events
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Rhapsody actually does not support any kind of dependency
   manually added to events. not even a regular usage
   dependency.
   You can open an enhancement, if you think this is important
   enough.
