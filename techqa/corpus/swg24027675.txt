Internal Defect 17450 
Symptom: Javaâ„¢ exception caused by the following function call: 

encentuate.ng.account.AccountManagerImpl.getAllAccounts(...) 

When passing credentials into a user wallet where the Authentication Service does not exist, generates a Java exception error. Call SOAP API and the SetAccountCredential method, when the entry does not exist in the wallet. Instead of returning account not found, the IMS application generates a Java exception.

Problems fixed in the previous fix pack releases 
For problems fixed in the previous releases, see fix pack 8.1.0-TIV-TAMESSO-IMS-FP00001 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24025962] readme file.

KNOWN ISSUES 
a. For WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, manually deploy IMS Server again after applying the fix pack.
b. Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On IMS 8.1.0.210 was shipped without support for Update Installer. On an unmodified IMS Server installation, the Update Installer tool does not recognize the IMS Server. 

To fix this issue, follow these steps:
i. Stop any running Update Installer instances.
ii. Download the etc-ITAMESSO-8.1.zip file.
iii. Extract the etc-ITAMESSO-8.1.zip file in. The extracted properties directory enables the Update Installer to recognize the IMS Server.
iv. Copy the extracted properties directory to the root of the Tivoli Access Manager for Single Sign-On IMS 8.1 installation directory. If Tivoli Access Manager for Single Sign-On 8.1.0.0.210 installation directory is C:\Program Files\IBM\TAM E-SSO\IMS Server\, extract the properties directory into C:\Program Files\IBM\TAM E-SSO\IMS Server\properties.
v. Provide connection properties in <IMS_Installation_Folder>\etc\tamesso.ims.appserver.properties. 

If you have installed TAM E-SSO in C:\Program Files\ibm\TAM E-SSO\IMS Server, copy the extracted properties directory in C:\Program Files\ibm\TAM E-SSO\IMS Server\etc.
vi. Provide connection properties in <IMS_Installation_Folder>\etc\tamesso.ims.appserver.properties 

If WebSphere Application Server is installed on Machine Server1, set: * was.hostname=Server1.
