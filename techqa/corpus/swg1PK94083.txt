APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Portal is used in combination with an HTTP server,
   WebSphere Portal does not generate URLs (most notably,
   URLGenerationTag) that enforce a protocol switch from HTTPS to
   HTTP. Hence, once Portal is switched to HTTPS it cannot revert
   back to HTTP unless the user logs out.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When WebSphere Portal is used in combination with an HTTP
   server, it does not generate URLs (most notably,
   URLGenerationTag) that enforce a protocol switch from HTTPS to
   HTTP. Hence, once Portal is switched to HTTPS it cannot revert
   back to HTTP unless the user logs out.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When an incoming request is routed from an HTTP Server to
   WebSphere Application Server, the protocol is typically changed
   to an unsecure connection. The information whether the original
   incoming request was secure or not cannot be detected by looking
   at the protocol of the URL. Instead, the code that generates
   URLs needs to check request.isSecure().
