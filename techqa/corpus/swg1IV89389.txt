APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnel discovery
   using scope.mplste, setting m_Mode=3 will result in discovery
   of head, transit and tail tunnel records. The user is able to
   view the tunnel topology for the head tunnels in the Network
   View but not the transit and tail tunnels. These views are
   always empty because the stitchers only creates the tunnel pipe
   objects for head tunnels even though data exists for the transit
    and tail tunnels.
   
   The work to be done is to create the tunnel pipe objects for
   transit and tail tunnels so that the tunnel topology is visible
   in the transit and tail tunnels in the Network View.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *   This internal APAR should followed by RFE request by
   customer
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users who use the Network View to view their MPLS tunnels    *
   * topology.                                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * No topology is displayed for transit and tail MPLS tunnels   *
   * in the Network View. This makes those views useless for the  *
   * user since the views are always displayed empty.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Apply this APAR fix and perform discovery on the MPLS        *
   * tunnels.                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes to the PopulateDNCIM_MPLSTETunnels and
   PopulateDNCIM_MPLSTETunnelPipe stitchers to ensure that the
   stitcher creates the network pipe for the tunnels. Always
   execute PopulateDNCIM_Collect to add the interfaces to the
   tunnel collection.
   
   Also includes changes to use the tunnel description instead of
   "unnamed" and displays the ActualHop data for the MPLS tunnel in
   the Device Structure.
