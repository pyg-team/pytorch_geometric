APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a ruleflow is made of many tasks linked via nested
   fork/join nodes, once notices that the build or display time for
   this ruleflow grows non linearly (exponentially) with the number
   of nested fork/join.
   The observed build time with 18 rule tasks is about 1s, however
   it grows up to 45s with 24 tasks, and up to 2 hours with 30
   tasks.
   
   Profiling Rule Studio during the build of the ruleflow shows an
   outstanding hotspot method:
   ilog.rules.rf.check.util.IlrRFCheckerUtilities$ForkJoinBalancing
   Checker.explore(IlrRFNode), which appears to take 99% of the
   time spent during the build.
   
   The same performance issue can be observed in Rule Studio and
   Rule Team Server
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  the ruleflow can be split into multiple smaller subflows, and
   with a main flow that orchestrates them
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ruleflow checker code evaluates recursively each fork join
   to verify proper combination. The code need to be modified to
   avoid verifying in depth.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Refactor the fork/join checker code
