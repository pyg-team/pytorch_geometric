Title: IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator images cannot be registered after templates are refreshed - United States

Text:
UUID; template; convert; register; deleted TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you update a template that is already registered in IBM SmartCloud Orcestrator, then the product does not pick up this update. When you try to deploy the virtual system pattern, it displays a "Virtual machine could not be registered" error. 

SYMPTOM
The pattern fails to deploy.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This IBM SmartClound Orchestrator behavior is "as designed." 



When you convert the template to a virtual machine, it is not listed in the image list that is generated by the "glance image-list" command; the template does not exist as an image anymore.
When you convert the virtual machine back to a template, the new image has a new OpenStack UUID even though it has the same VMWare UUID. Thus, you must register the template again in IBM Workload Deployer before deploying it. This behavior is part of the design of Openstack.


When you convert a registered template to a virtual machine, power on and off the virtual machine, and finally reconvert the virtual machine to the template, the new template has a new UUID. Thus, it must be re-registered in IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator before using it.


Before you convert the virtual machine back to a template, run the following commands to reset the Activation Engine (AE): 

 1. cd c:\windows\setup\ibm\
    
    
 2. .\AE.bat --reset -n --user Administrator --password <password>
