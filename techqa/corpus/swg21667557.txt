Title: IBM Sysmgr.log - Info: processing system operation: Diagnostic dump (9), arg = 22 - United States

Text:
Sysmgr.log ; processing system operation; Diagnostic dump (9); arg = 22 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am seeing a lot of messages in /nz/kit/log/sysmgr/sysmgr.log file, such as:
xxxxxx Info: processing system operation: Diagnostic dump (9), arg = 22

What do they means ? Is it going to impact the system ? 

CAUSE
These are informational messages only and do not indicate any issues. There can be safely ignored.

ANSWER
When you see these message, that simple means the 'nzsqa <option> -sys' command was issued. 

The message means the following command was issued: 
'nzsqa responders -sys'

These are informational messages and do not indicate any issues; and can be safely ignored.


If you want a full explanation, on the error :
xxx MDT Info: processing system operation: Diagnostic dump (9), arg = 22

Diagnostic dump (9)
This just means system is trying to dump something , see argument("arg") value below.

Here are the listing of what each argument ("arg") means :-
0 commStats Show Front Channel Stats
7 interactions Outstanding interactions
8 job Active Jobs
10 lockTbl Lock (semaphore) Table
11 memTbl Memory allocation table
12 netStats Show Back Channel Stats
13 plan Running Plans
14 procTbl Process/Thread Table
15 schedQueues Show jobs on scheduler queues
16 schedMemory Show scheduler memory
17 workRank Show scheduler work ranking
18 swapSpace Show swap space statistics
19 tblDict Show Table Dictionary
20 transactions Outstanding transactions
21 tree Full Hardware Information
22 responders Show Interaction Responder information
23 channelTbl Show active channels
24 channel Show channel information

Therefore, when you see Diagnostics dump (9), arg = 22; you know there was a 'nzsqa responders -sys' command issued.

Likewise, 'nzsqa memTbl -sys' will indicate as arg = 11 :-
Info: processing system operation: Diagnostic dump (9), arg = 11
