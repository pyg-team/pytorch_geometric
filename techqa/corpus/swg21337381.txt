Title: IBM Access Manager not properly installed. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to start Access Manager Administration.

After trying an uninstall and reinstall, problem persisted. Performing an Apply from the top in Configuration Manager revealed no errors. 

SYMPTOM
Access Manager is not properly installed and cannot continue. Please contact administrator.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove the entry for the Access Manager in the cmplst.txt. Reinstall Access Manager.

If the first one doesn't resolve the issue then check to see if the user is Administrator on the box. It could be security related. Ensure that the users have execute permissions on the AccessAdm.exe which resides in the <installed drive>:\Program Files\Cognos\cer#\bin.

Once you have lifted security and if this still doesn't work then it's possible that the users don't have proper access to certain registry keys. From the Start --> Run window, type "dcomcnfg" and this will bring you into DCOM. What we need to do is go into DCOM and ensure that we allow the registered application to be viewed by other people. In DCOM, go to the properties of "Authenticator2 Application" and then under the security tab you can give proper permissions to the proper users.
