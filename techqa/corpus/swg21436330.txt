QUESTION
 Why do some agents have a blank entry for Health Status? 

ANSWER
In the Agent view, some agents have no entry in the Health Status column. The Notification view can have a blank entry in the Current Agent Health column, as well.

There are two current reasons for this:


 1. Not all agent types report information to populate the Health Status column. Many of the host-based agents do not have the capability to populate a Health Status at this time.
    
 2. When the SiteProtector Application Server Service is restarted, it can take a few minutes for the Health Status to display for some SiteProtector agents in the Agent and Notification view.


Also, note that many agents with a blank Health Status column might have details in their property's Health Summary view.
