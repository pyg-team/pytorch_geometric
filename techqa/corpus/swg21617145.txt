Title: IBM Modeler 15 EA - Service not running - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We installed SPSS Modeler 15.0 Client and Server and on both we added the Entity Analytics.

We used the documentation Entity Analytics Advanced Configuration Manual.pdf to configure and launch the Entity Analytics service on the server.




SYMPTOM
Using the command :
<modeler-install-directory>\ext\bin\pasw.entityanalytics\manage_repository.ba -start<repository-name> <username> <password>
gives below messages:
Starting SolidDB server...
SolidDB server started
Starting EA service..
However when using the -check option we get the following:
SolidDB server is running on host localhost, port 1320
EA service not running on host localhost, port 1321


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The .SqlErr.log file residing in the C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\15\EA\tmp
is having below messages 
-------
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: Exception: SQL call failed.
IM002
[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: CRITICAL ERROR: 
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: {
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: [SQL-01001]: Critical Database Error
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: Failed to initialize database connection
11/08 09:21:42 [sql:4124] CRIT: }


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Note that the information to configure and launch the Entity Analytics service from the Entity Analytics Advanced Configuration Manual.pdf only needs to be used when COP, Collaboration &Deployment Services and/or Decision Management is involved.
Creating the Entity Analytics repository, when connecting to Modeler Server, in the Entity Analytics output node would be sufficient to be able to use EA when connected to Modeler Server.
Following can be checked 
Check if, on the server, a UserDSN using the SoliDB driver is configured and NetworkName is 'tcp 1320'
Check in the solid.ini file, residing in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\15\EA\repositories\EA_repository_name below and modify if needed 
[Data Sources]
{DataSource}=tcp {Port}
to
[Data Sources]
{DataSource}=tcp 1320
Ensure that between the use of the command with -start and -check option there is enough time left needed to launch the service.
