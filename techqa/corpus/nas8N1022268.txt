Title: IBM Unable to install or deploy an application in Websphere Application Server - United States

Text:
Websphere Application Server deploy deployment application install failed java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to deploy an application in Websphere Application Server 

SYMPTOM
Error WSVR0501E when attempting to deploy applications to Application Server


CAUSE
Third-party application .jar file is in the /qibm/userdata/java400/ext directory. This directory should never be used to store application specific .jar files.

ENVIRONMENT
Websphere Application Server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When trying to deploy the application using the Web Adminstration GUI you will get errors: 




WASX7015E Exception running command; WASX7132E Application install ... failed. 

Standard error: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError. 

Websphere Application Server SystemOut.log (ie: /qibm/userdata/websphere/appserver/v85/express/profile/myprofile/logs/myserver/systemout.log) shows: 


WSVR0501E: Error creating component com.ibm.ws.websvcs.component.WASAxis2ComponentImpl
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
at java.lang.J9VMInternals.initialize(J9VMInternals.java:257)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem may be the result of a third-party application .jar file from the /qibm/userdata/java400/ext directory. 

 

Here is an example of what should be in this directory by default (V7R2 system was used for this example), using the EDTF '/qibm/userdata/java400/ext' command from the OS command line: 


db2_classes.jar 
<outines_classes.jar (actual filename: db2routines_classes.jar)
eim.jar 
eimos400.jar 
i5osCCAmri *DIR
ibmjcehdw.jar 
runtime.zip
