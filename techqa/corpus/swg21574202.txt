QUESTION
 We have moved our corporate LDAP server to a new host. What changes are required for the Initiate Master Data Engine to point to the new hostname? 

ANSWER
To change the hostname that the Initiate Master Data Engine uses to connect to the LDAP server, please follow the steps below. 

 1. Open the engine.properties file found under MAD_HOMEDIR/inst/mpinet_{instance-name}/conf in a text editor 
 2. Modify the MAD_AUTHSTR value to reference the new hostname 
 3. Save the changes made to the file 
 4. Restart the instance for the changes to take effect


As with any change to the Initiate Master Data Engine configuration, we recommend that you try this out in a Test environment prior to making the changes in Production.
