   Here are some observation in the Infocenter documentation  .
   Product managers had promised the IC docs will be reviewed by
   the test team during the test.  Please send this comments and
   address the remote migration documentation.   Thanks
   
   
   Step1 . If the profile that is being migrated is a federated
   profile, edit the
   Installer/profiles/profile-name/properties/wsadmin.properties
   file to point to the new version deployment manager and
   synchronize the profile with it.
   
   This is the first step in remote migration and we are assuming
   Dmgr is migrated and new Dmgr exist ?! .   I do not think
   generic documentation with hints of ND steps  and assumptions
   will really help customer to follow the instructions.  Separate
   documentation for standAlone  and ND environment documenting
   will help .   Customer land on this page by search and will get
   lost in the first step .
   
   Step2. Create a default profile on the system that has the new
   version installed and the same operating system as the source
   system, using the Profile Management Tool or the manageprofiles
   command-line utility.
   
   Why are we doing this default profile creation ?  I do not see
   anything in this page making use of the default profile in this
   page.   I am guessing it is because of some migration tooling
   problem which may not be able to determine some of the default
   variables like Install_root etc  if a default profile (
   porfileregistry.xml) does not exist.  Am I right ?  Documenting
   why are we creating default profile will help  but IMO  it is a
   waste of time and fixing the tooling will help. there is long
   road to migration completion  and creating unused profile will
   be unnecessary step.
   
   
   Step3 : Create the remote migration utilities image.
   
   - We do not need the unzip instructions in this step before
   copying the file to the source_system (in step4).
   - Also indicate that the zip file will contain the migration
   tools required to create the snapshot on the remote machine .  (
   Just helps the customer understand why is he doing this step. )
   
   Step5 : Optional: Extract the application deployment
   configuration.
   and
    Step6 :  Optional: Edit the XML file that contains the
   application deployment configuration.
   
   - Above two "Steps" should be combined  as one step  with the
   heading " Optional : Required if your applications that use
   WebSphere Adapters
   -  Can you confirm this step has to be done before creating the
   snapshot in step7 ? it is hard to believe we need to run this
   before creating the snapshot.
   - can not imagine where is the
   BPMQueryDeploymentConfiguration.sh   command . helps if you use
   some notation like
   
   <remoteMigrationUtilities_unzip>/bin/BPMQueryDeploymentConfigura
   tion.sh  in the sample command or spell it out "use the
   BPMQueryDeploymentConfiguration.sh command from the remote
   migration utilities bin directory to .
   
   
   Step 7.  Create a snapshot of the migration source profile.
   
    -- adding
   <remoteMigrationUtilities_unzip>/bin/BPMSnapshotSourceProfile.ba
   t in the sample may be good , if not most likely customer may
   use the BPMSnapshotSourceProfile.bat  file from the target/bin
   it it exist .. Seens it done before
   
   --    Important:  On a UNIX system, ensure that all extracted
   files have execute permission
   
     Most probably the "Important" statement belongs in the step 4
   
   Step10 : Migrate the source profile to the target profile.
       If the source profile does not have security enabled, the
   -username and -password parameters are unnecessary; ..
   ..........
   
    WPS/BPM installation is always secured .. Remove the statement
   "unnecessary" and add the options to the sample ..
   
   ===========
   Add the followign RTC#  where the Infocenter is working on the
   documentation ..
