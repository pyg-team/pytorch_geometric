LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you update the membership of an internal group, your
   updates must be propagated to the IBM BPM document store to also
   update the authorization of process attachments and case
   folders. This operation is done in bulk on all teams that
   contain the internal group. If this operation affects a team as
   well as its manager team, the operation might fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that ensures permission updates do not fail will be
   included in an IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 cumulative fix.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Not applicable
