CAUSE
This note clarifies the term 'thresholds' as used in the Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM Reporter Set.

ANSWER
The term ‘thresholds’ refers to threshold properties that are taken from an Alcatel-Lucent router and stored in IBM® Tivoli® Netcool\Proviso® or IBM® Tivoli® Netcool Performance Manager® properties. The Temperature Reporter Set contains samTemperatureThreshold and samTemperatureThresholdInFahrenheit properties.
