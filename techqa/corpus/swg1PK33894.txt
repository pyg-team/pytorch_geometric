   ****************************************************************
   The "Administrative roles" topic needs to state that the
   primary administrative user must be logged into the
   administrative console to change administrative user and group
   roles. Also, the "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol entity types in a federated repository configuration"
   topic must explain that default values are not set when you
   select the Custom LDAP type in a federated repositories
   configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Administrative roles" topic has been updated with the
   following statement:
   
   "The Primary administrative user name must be used to log on
   to the administrative console to change the administrative user
   and group roles."
   
   Note: The previous statement is not applicable to the
   "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access Protocol entity
   types in a federated repository configuration" topic in the
   Information Center.
   
   The following statement has been added to the "Configuring
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol entity types in a
   federated repository configuration" topic:
   
   "During LDAP configuration, based on the selected LDAP
   server type, some defaults and mappings are set in the
   configuration. When the selected LDAP server type is custom,
   no default is set, and you must set all of the mappings
   manually. To avoid setting all of the mappings manually,
   choose a non-custom LDAP server type (for example, IBM
   Directory Server or SunOne) which matches closely to your
   LDAP server."
   
   Date that information will be available externally to
   customers:
   The modified documentation will be available in the next
   update to the Information Centers, which is scheduled to
   occur on or before March 31, 2007.
