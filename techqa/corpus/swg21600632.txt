Title: IBM Problem launching Android Emulator with Worklight Studio 5.0 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to launch the Android emulator (virtual device) from IBM Worklight Studio results in the error "Launching <your app> has encountered a problem". 

SYMPTOM
The full error message is as follows:

"Launching <your app> has encountered a problem.
Errors occurred during the build.
Errors running builder 'Android Package Builder' on project '<your project name>'.
sun.security.x509.X500Name"




Steps to reproduce: 

 * Try to open your Google Android project as "Android Application" within Worklight Studio. 1. Right click the Android generated project corresponding to your Android application 
   
   2. Select Run As > Android Application
   
   


 * You may also receive similar errors when trying to access other Google Android Development Tools plugin features from Worklight Studio.


CAUSE
Google's Android Development Tools plugin for Eclipse requires Oracle JRE in order to run properly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you install IBM Worklight Studio using Installation Manager, the install process will ask for the location of the Oracle JRE and it will create a Windows shortcut or a Linux / UNIX shell script to properly launch Worklight Studio with the proper JRE settings. 


When developing mobile applications for Android, you must always launch Worklight Studio using the provided shortcut / script to ensure that the Eclipse platform is executed using Oracle JRE, to satisfy Google's ADT plugin requirements.

On Windows platforms you should launch Worklight Studio from either one of two ways: 

 * Navigate to Start > All Programs > IBM Software Delivery Platform > IBM Worklight Studio v5.0 > IBM Worklight Studio 
 * With file explorer or a command prompt, execute <install_dir>/SDP/Worklight.cmd


On UNIX/Linux platforms you should launch Worklight Studio from the shell script:  * Open a terminal and execute <install_dir>/SPD/Worklight.sh
