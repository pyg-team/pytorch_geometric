APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z version 9.0 and 9.1
   
   If the JCL contains the parameter TYPRUN=SCAN RDz JES status in
   the RSE view will incorrectly displays jobs as ACTIVE when they
   are are completed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the parameter in the JCL prior to submitting or check the
   status of the jobs using the  Host Connection Emulator.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: 01.All RDz users submitting TYPRUN=SCAN      *
   *                    jobs.                                     *
   *                 02.z/OS Explorer users submitting jobs       *
   *                    using the TSO submit method.              *
   *                 03.All users who specify IBM-937             *
   *                    (Traditional Chinese) as host code-page   *
   *                    in their client.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.RDz shows TYPRUN=SCAN jobs as        *
   *                         active after completion of the       *
   *                         scan.                                *
   *                      02.JMON assumes too soon that a job     *
   *                         ended, resulting in failure to get   *
   *                         job information.                     *
   *                      03.Unable to work with JES jobs.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.Rational Developer for System z shows TYPRUN=SCAN jobs as
      active after completion of the scan.
   02.JMON assumes too soon that a job ended, resulting in failure
      to get job information. The client receives:
      msgNo=2005, message=Command failed
   03.Unable to work with JES jobs. JMON log shows "FEJ308E
      Malformed command received".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.JES Job Monitor is updated to correctly interpret job
      status.
   02.JMON incorrectly thinks that STAT_CONV (130) is a
      post-execution phase, while it's a pre-execution phase. This
      is corrected.
   03.The new-line character is translated different for IBM-937
      than for other code-pages, resulting in the new-line
      becoming part of JMON output. When JES client sends such a
      string (for example, jobID) back as part of another command,
      JMON will fail the command. JMON is corrected to deal better
      with unexpected code-page translations.
