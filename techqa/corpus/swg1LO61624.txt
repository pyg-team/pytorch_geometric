APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS USER ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In an asymmetrical cluster (clients failover to 2 other servers,
   some to one
   the rest to the other) there is a large impact when the clients
   do a
   ServerGetClusterReplicaMatches call to find the server to fail
   over to. The
   impact can be so large as to make the server unavailable causing
   existing
   clients connected to failover, bringing the entire cluster
   down.
