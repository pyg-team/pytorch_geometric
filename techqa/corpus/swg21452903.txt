Title: IBM "java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect" error while using VPN connectivity with WebSphere Cast Iron - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Studio Verify, receiving the error "java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect" when invoking a web service (WS Invoke) or a HTTP (HTTP Post) call (which needs to be called within the same network) while using VPN connectivity. 

CAUSE
Cast Iron is using the LAN IP address instead of picking the VPN IP address. This is a system limitation and an enhancement request has been logged. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM will change the behavior in a future release to allow the user to specify the IP (if multiple IP's are found) in case of studio verify.
