APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Situations using the File Comparison attributesgroup does not
   work properly. The situations are started, but never opens as
   expected.
   If a trace for the agent is set to the level:
   ERROR (UNIT:KRA ALL) (UNIT:KLZ23 ALL)
   A trace record similar to the following one canbe found in the
   log:
   (4D69DB70.0037-D:kralz23b.cpp,267,"PrintSelf")originnode="nc11
   where the origingnode hostname has been truncated to the first 4
   characters.
   RECREATE INSTRUCTION:
   The problem can be recreated by creating a situationon the File
    Comparison attribute group with a formula similar to:
   IF *VALUE Linux_File_Comparison_File_Name_1 *EQ
   '/opt/IBM/ITM/tmp/file1'
   *AND *VALUE Linux_File_Comparison_FIle_Name_2 *EQ
   '/opt/IBM/ITM/tmp/file2'
   *AND *VALUE Linux_File_Comparison_File_Compare_Option *EQ Plain
   *AND
   *VALUE Linux_File_Comparison.File_Compare_Result *EQ Same
   Even if the file1 and file2 are equal, the situation is not fire
   d.
