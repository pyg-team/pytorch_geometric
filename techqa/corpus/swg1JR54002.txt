APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Interim fix JR52979 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52979]
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52979) is
   intended to improve how fast the Team Performance dashboard
   loads when there are many teams and process application
   snapshots. However, even with that interim fix installed on IBM
   Business Process Manager (BPM) (or interim fix JR53731 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR53731]
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR53731) on IBM
   BPM V8.5.0.1), performance might still be slow the first time
   the dashboard loads after the IBM BPM server starts or restarts.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Interim fix JR52979 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR52979] adds a new database query that looks up the
   project that a team is associated with and a cache that stores
   teams that were found other times the Team Performance dashboard
   was loaded (by any user), improving the overall logic for
   determining the teams to display in the Team Summary area of the
   dashboard.
   
   However, if the team information is not available in the default
   snapshot for a project, multiple snapshots must be searched to
   find the team information, which can still slow down the team
   information retrieval the first time the dashboard loads after
   the IBM BPM server starts or restarts.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 and V8.5.6.0 CF02 that
   adds a new database query that looks up the snapshot and project
   with which a team is associated, further reducing the amount of
   time required to load the dashboard.
