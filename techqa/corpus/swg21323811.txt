QUESTION
 How to change the default edit mode of a DOORS Module to "Read only" without using a short cut. 

ANSWER


In order to change the default edit mode to read only without using a short cut follow these steps:  1.  Click Start -> Run -> regedit. 
 2.  Navigate to the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\telelogic\doos\8.X\config\ 
 3.  On the right pane of the Registry create a new registry entry with the following values: String value key: defopenmode and Value: READ_ONLY 

From the above modifications the DOORS Module would open by default in Read only mode , without having to modify the DOORS short cut. When working with formal modules, you can use one of three edit modes: READ only You can read (look at) the module, but you can't edit it. EXCLUSIVE You can edit the module, but other users can only read it. SHAREABLE While you're editing one section of the module, another user can edit another section. You have to lock the section of the module that you want to edit, to stop other users from editing it. While you have the section locked, other users can only read the data in it. When you've finished, you unlock the section to allow another user to edit it. Note: In shareable edit mode , you can't create top-level objects in the module. Additionally, you can't create, delete or edit attribute definitions or attribute types. These tasks can only be accomplished in exclusive edit mode . 8.2, 8.1, 8.0, 7.1 DOORS Administration AnswerProduct versionPartner ContentInternal ContentCategoryReference ID
