ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABSTRACT: HBR:97.5% BUIT MODEL BUT
   MEASURED RESULT IS NOT  97.5%
   .
   Scenario:
   1.Open new Product and change to Human Builder
   Wb.
   2.Slect New Manikin command.
   3.Set 97.5 as Percentile.
   4.Select Properties on the Manikin.1 in the tree.
   5.Select Anthropometry tab. Confirm that Stature
   and Wight are listed as 97.5, it is correct.
   6.Change to Human Measurement Editor WB.
   7.Slect Display the variable list command and
   confirm the values.
   .
   RESULT:
   Stature and weight are 97.5, it is correct. Other
   values are not 97.5,
   .

 *  Incident Diagnosis
   HBR:97.5% BUIT MODEL BUT MEASURED RESULT
   IS NOT 97.5%.
   Correct Application
   This is the expected behaviour. Automatic variables
   are computed values, based on the value of the
   manual variables. When a 97,5% manikin is
   created, it means that the stature and the weight
   are set as manual, all the other variables being
   computed values. This is why the other variables
   correspond to different percentiles of the
   population. When the stature is changed to
   automatic from manual, all the automatic variables
   (including the stature) are recomputed based on
   the only manual variable (the weight). When we
   return to manual management of the stature, the
   value is not changed and that's normal since it is
   not a result.
   Documentation Reference
   Human builder
   .
   Getting Started
   .
   Insert a new Mankin .
   .
   The percentile is applied to the stature (height) as
   well as the weight of the new manikin. It indicates
   the group the manikin will belong to within the
   ordered statistical population.
