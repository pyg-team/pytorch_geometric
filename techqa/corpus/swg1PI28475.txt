APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  REORG SHRLEVEL CHANGE is executed with a user defined mapping
   table that uses the old 6 byte LRSN. When CCSID conversion is
   involved for creating the correct format mapping table, messages
   MSGDSNU2900I & MSGDSNU299I are issued, and the job fails with
   RC00E400D0 when the UTILD contains special characters.
   
   DSNU2900I ssid 266 10:46:56.36 DSNURMAP - MAPPING TABLE IS
   SPECIFIED WITH A NON-EXPANDED LRSN COLUMN
   DSNU299I  ssid 266 10:46:56.41 DSNUGLDX - CHARACTER
   CONVERSION FROM CCSID 273 TO CCSID 1208
                          FAILED WITH ERROR CODE 00000008 FOR
   'UNKNOWN'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define mapping table with new 10 digit LRSNs
   or do not use special characters in UTILID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 11 for z/OS users of online REORG    *
   *                 utility.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ABEND04E RC00E400D0 and MSGDSNU299I     *
   *                      occurred when a REORG SHRLEVEL CHANGE   *
   *                      created a mapping table implicitly      *
   *                      with special characters in the          *
   *                      utility identifier (UID).               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply corrective PTF when available.         *
   ****************************************************************
   A REORG SHRLEVEL CHANGE running with a special character in the
   UID abended with ABEND04E RC00E400D0 after issuing the message
   DSNU299I - CHARACTER CONVERSION FROM CCSID n TO CCSID 1208
   FAILED WITH ERROR CODE 00000008 FOR 'UNKNOWN'.
   It happened because of an internal conversion error when
   generating the mapping table and index name from the UID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The REORG code has been modified to correct this conversion
   error.
