APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  USER AFFECTED:
   ==> Advanced BPM users that find cannot deploy because duplicate
   entries appear in the zip file.  The duplicate entries may
   involve WSDL files or .CMT2 files.
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   ==> Mulitple WSDL interfaces were generated for sub-processes,
   creating dupe entries in the ZIP file when the PA or TK is
   deployed.  Errors prevent these interfaces from being deleted.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   ==> On early versions of Advanced BPM, interfaces were generated
   for sub processes.  These interfaces appear in IID with names
   such as 130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a and
   130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358aOneWay, and they contain an
   operation with no inputs and no outputs.  There is also a file
   in IID with the file type "cmt2" which tracks the interface with
   the sub-process.
   
   Under certain conditions, there may be multiple instances of
   these (WSDL and CMT2 files) for the same subprocess in the
   repository.  Only one  instance is visible in IID, but the
   application will not deploy because there may be multiple
   entries with the same path name in the ZIP file that is
   deployed.  As a result, the deployment fails.
   
   Deleting these interfaces in IID and then calling Refresh and
   Publish can fail with the error:
   
   Business Process Diagram with ID
   BPD.130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a not found.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WSDL interfaces were generated for sub-processes multiple times,
   creating duplicate entries in the ZIP file when the ProcessApp
   or Toolkit is deployed.  Errors prevent these interfaces from
   being deleted.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced 7.5.1 users that cannot
   deploy because duplicate entries appear in the zip file.  The
   duplicate entries may involve WSDL files or .CMT2 files.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   On early versions of Advanced BPM, interfaces were generated for
   sub processes.  These interfaces appear in Integration Designer
   (IID) with names such as 130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a
   and 130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358aOneWay, and they contain
   an operation with no inputs and no outputs.  There is also a
   file in IID with the file type "cmt2" which tracks the interface
   with the sub-process.
   
   Under certain conditions, there may be multiple instances of
   these (WSDL and CMT2 files) for the same subprocess in the
   repository.  Only one instance is visible in IID, but the
   application will not deploy because there may be multiple
   entries with the same path name in the ZIP file that is
   deployed.  As a result, the deployment fails.
   
   Deleting these interfaces in IID and then calling Refresh and
   Publish can fail with the error:
   
        Business Process Diagram with ID
   BPD.130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a not found.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR suppresses the error 'Business Process
   Diagram with ID BPD.130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a not
   found" and allows the successful deletion of these interfaces.
   The generation of an interface for sub-processes is no longer
   done with a fix for JR43323 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR43323] but these interfaces may exist if
   the sub-process was created before that other fix was installed.
   Once the fix is applied, the following actions need to be
   followed:
   
   1) Open the ProcessApp or Toolkit in an IID workspace
   2) In IID, delete the interfaces for the sub-processes (I.E. the
   interfaces with a name such as
   130c3420-9027-4a07-89b9-bc7f4916358a).
   3) Call Refresh and Publish to update the repository.
   4) Delete the PA from the workspace and then open it in the
   workspace again.
   5) Repeat as long as you see interfaces appear in IID for the
   sub-processes.
