ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you run a process with a user task that is defined to run as
   a multi-instance or simple loop, and this task has a timer
   boundary event with a trigger specified relative to the task's
   due date, the process fails with an exception similar to the
   following exception, which you see in the SystemOut.log file of
   the server:
   
   [8/30/16 15:17:11:482 BRT] 00000158 wle           E
   CWLLG0326E: A deliverException has occurred.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the process model and define the timer boundary event in
   a different way. There are several options other than relative
   to due date, for example, you could define the timer boundary
   event relative to the start of the step or a custom date that is
   hardcoded or is from a process variable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a user task runs in a loop, each task instance has its own
   due date. A timer boundary event on an activity is a timer for
   the overall activity, not a timer for each instance of the loop.
   There is only one timer and that one timer cannot be calculated
   relative to multiple different due dates of several task
   instances. It is, therefore, not possible to run a process in
   such a combination.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that shows a validation error for processes that contain such a
   non-executable definition. If a user still models and runs this
   task, an improved failure message is provided.
   
   To determine whether the IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   is available and download it if it is, complete the following
   steps on Fix Central:
