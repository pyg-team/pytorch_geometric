Title: IBM Why is a 1722 error occurring when installing IBM Datacap? - United States

Text:
install; upgrade; GUID; registry TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing IBM Datacap, at the end of the InstallShield sequence, a 1722 error dialog appears, stating that the installation could not finish due to DLL registration problems. 

CAUSE
Using (double-clicking) the IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1.msi file, instead of setup.exe to do the installation causes this issue.
It is mandatory that setup.exe be used for installation, because it examines the system for required prerequisites and installs the necessary files.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run setup.exe.
