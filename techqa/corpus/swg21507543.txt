secure backup sftp TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to perform a secure backup on my WebSphere DataPower appliance and target it for an SFTP destination? 

CAUSE
Need to send DataPower to a secure destination, but do not have that option.

ANSWER
Currently, when doing a secure backup on a DataPower appliance from the default domain, along with the crypto certificate, you must specify a destination. The valid destinations from this area on the WebGUI include local:, temporary: and ftp:. However, you can still send the secure backup to an SFTP destination, by proxying with a Multi-Protocol Gateway as follows: 

 1. Create a MPGW and use an FTP Server FSH as its front side handler. The destination should be the desired SFTP location. 
 2. Set both Request and Response type to Pass-Thru. 
 3. You will need to have your SFTP destination associated to an SFTP client policy pointing at the appropriate SSH client profile in the user agent of the XML Manager.


After performing these setup steps, you can specify your secure backup destination as follows: 

ftp://userid:password@ip_address:Port 

where  * ip_address is the DataPower appliance. 
 * Port is the port number of the FTP Server FSH attached to the MPGW.


An example MPGW configuration is attached here:
