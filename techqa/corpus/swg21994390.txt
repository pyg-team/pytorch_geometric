QUESTION
 What are the current tips and issues regarding incremental Java analysis in IBM Security AppScan Source?



ANSWER

As of AppScan Source Version 9.0.3.5, incremental Java analysis is available on Windows and Linux. See Incremental analysis for Java [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSS9LM_9.0.3/com.ibm.rational.appscansrc.common.doc/topics/incremental_scan.html] for more information.

Tips for incremental scanning:


 * To force a full analysis scan, disable incremental analysis or clear the vulnerability analysis cache, as described in the above topic. 
 * When performing incremental analysis, you should run a full analysis scan after making any of these modifications:  * Security rule changes or changes to custom rules that are applicable to the project or application. 
    * Scan configuration changes. 
    * Changes to .ozsettings files that affect scans. 
    * Changes to the application or project properties. For example, any changes that you make in the AppScan Source for Analysis Properties view for All Applications or a selected application or project. 
    * Adding a new project to an application or deleting an existing project. 
    * Excluding files from scans. For example, in AppScan Source for Analysis, you can choose to exclude a file from scanning by right-clicking it in the Explorer view and choosingExclude from Scans.
   
   


Notes and limitations: 

 * After an incremental scan, findings markers in the editor may no longer be in the correct location. 
 * Remediated findings that do not have a trace may appear in incremental scan results. 
 * You cannot have more than one AppScan Source products or components open at the same time during incremental scans. In addition, another user cannot scan the same application or project as you are scanning, at the same time and on the same machine.
