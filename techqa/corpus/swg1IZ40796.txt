ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNMv3.7/6 - Duplicates Pre-Disco Filters
   
   All O/S, ITNMv3.7 FP6.
   
   When a Pre-Disco filter is created and the "advanced tab"
   completed with CAPITAL "AND OR" within the definition. A
   duplicate is created and the filter is copied if you log out
   then back in again.
   
   e.g. filter 1 once saved would now appear as filter2
   
   Test Steps:
   
   For some reason the name given to a "Pre disco filter" with a
   number in it, re-creates itself incrementing its name if a
   number is present in the name.
   
   
   Pre-disco filter 1selected
   logout of ngf
   login and goto filters tab
   Current enabled filter is now Pre-disco filter 2
   Pre-disco filter 1 is now in the list of available but disabled
   filters.
   SEE the attached zip folder and double click on the .html doc
   for demonstration of issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use Capitals in Pre-Disco filter definition.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All platforms. GUI-Disco GUI - Pre Filters
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Discovery duplicates teh pre- filters.
   The problem used to occur whenever the key words are typed in
   uppercase. In this case, the filter stored into OQL will be of
   the same case as user entered, while the filter is store into
   filterLbrary.xml after converting any uppercase OQL keywords
   like AND,OR,LIKE, IS,NOT, NULL into lower case key words.
   In the code,  the filter stored in oql table and the filter
   stored in filterLibrary.xml are checked for equality. Siince the
   type of check is case sensitive, it fails in the above scenario
   and in such cases, Disco creates a duplicate filter.
   
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   Upgrade to Fixpack that contains this fix.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution: The comparison is now made case insensitive. OQL
   accepts upper case keywords, so, this way users can coniue to
   have upper case keywords in their filter definition .
