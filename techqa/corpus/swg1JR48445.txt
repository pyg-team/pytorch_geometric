   ****************************************************************
   When a profile is being upgraded from IBM BPM V8.5 to IBM BPM
   V8.5.0.1, the REST service provider is not updated correctly
   if the source IBM BPM V8.5 is multiple deployment environment
   (DE) setup. During the profile upgrade process, the REST
   Services Gateway application that was in the cell scope in IBM
   BPM V8.5 is removed and redeployed in each DE with a new name:
   REST Services Gate-way_<deployment_target>.
   The corresponding REST service provider should be assigned to
   correct deployment target correctly. However, the REST service
   provider for each DE environment is not updated correctly. The
   admin con-sole, which users access by clicking Services > Rest
   services > Rest service providers, shows that the REST service
   provider for all DEs is assigned to the same deployment target
   and REST service provider with the old application name,  &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;
   Services Gateway, &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189; still listed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that assigns the REST service provider for
   each DE to its correct deployment target and removes the REST
   service provider with the old application name.
