 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is it possible to create a date prompt and have the default date set to the current date? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is not possible to do this with a single prompt using the current Impromptu functionality. However, the technique below describes how this can be done using a combination of two prompts and a calculated column in the report.

First create a calculated column called DatePromptCalculation in the report as follows:

if ( upper ( ?Date Choice? ) = 'T' ) then ( today () ) else ( ?Date Prompt? )

* database functions for today's date may also be used in place of today ()

Create a ?Date Choice? prompt as a type in string prompt. The message should say something similar to "Enter T for today's date or D to enter a date in the prompt below" and set the default value to "T" .

The ?Date Prompt? prompt can be a date prompt of any type you choose, be it type-in / report , file or catalog picklist.

Next setup the filter to look like this:

Date = DatePromptCalculation

Now when the report is run the user will see a prompt dialog box with two prompts. If they do not change anything today's date will be used as the filter criteria. If they wish to use another date they can enter anything but a T in the first prompt and specify a date in the second prompt.
