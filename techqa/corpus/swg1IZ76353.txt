ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   Approver Initials:    BS
   Severity:             2
   Reported Release:     621
   Compid:               5724C04EP Tivoli Enterprise Portal
   ABSTRACT:             MQ situation not firing when using enum
   value
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   When a situation uses an enumerated value the tems is not
   generating an
   alert when the situation data shows it to be true.
   .
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   1) Code a situation which is testing on "Time to Full Msgs
   (Sec)" ==
      "Zero Put Get Rates"
   2) In the Queue Statistics workspace look at the column "Time to
   Full
      Msgs (Sec)" and in my case I had 13 queues that met this
   criteria
   3) Wait for situation to fire and you will find it wont fire
   4) Code a situation which is testing on "Time to Full Msgs (Sec)
   !=
      "Zero Put Get Rates"
   5) In the Queue Statistics workspace look at the column "Time to
   Full
      Msgs (Sec)" and in my case all 13 queues had "Time to Full
   Msgs
      (Sec)" set to "Zero Put Get Rates"
   6) Wait for situation to fire and 13 instances of the event are
      incorrectly raised.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An MQ agent situation authored using the Queue Statistics
   attribute "Time to Full Queue (Sec)" does not raise when
   expected.
   
   The following is a specific example of this:
   
   Author a situation to test
   
   "Time to Full Queue (Sec)" EQUAL (EQ, ==) "Zero Put Get Rates".
   
   The formula would be as follows:
   
   *IF *VALUE Queue_Statistics.Time_to_Full_Queue *EQ
   Zero_Put_Get_Rates
   
   A situation with the formula above will not raise when the
   condition is met.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code in the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server has been
   changed to accept a new attribute keyword ("nose" NO Scale Enum)
   to direct it not to apply SCALE on a value that's set from an
   ENUM.
   
   This APAR has a co-requisite APAR IZ79111 that is needed for the
   specific MQ situation to raise when the condition is met.
   IZ79111 is in a separate release for the MQ Agent and needs to
   be installed when that is available.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.1-TIV-ITM-FP0004
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0004
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  A workaround can be done by removing the "scal 2" attribute
   keyword and value from a specific attribute when the behavior
   mentioned above is occurring. This workaround will only work if
   an ENUM vale/vali value is used for a situation.
