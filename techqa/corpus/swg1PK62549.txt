APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBMJCE Provider provides an implementation for the SHA-1
   cryptographic hash algorithm. This implementation returns
   incorrect hash values when the input exceeds a large size
   (2^32).
   
   Other providers such as the BootstrapProvider do not appear to
   be affected.
   
   
   Other utilities which rely on java cryptography may fail with
   their own error messages. SMP/E receive order may fail with
   messge GIM45500S: "VERIFICATION OF HASH VALUE OF FILE xxx
   FAILED. SMP/E WILL NOT RETRY FILE RETRIEVAL"
   
   KEYWORDS:
   msgGIM45500S msgGIM45500 SMPE
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact Level 2 for an interim fix (an updated
   ibmjceprovider.jar file to be placed in ../lib/ext directory)
   SOVD: 132540
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBMJCE SHA-1 Implementation returns incorrect H
   ash for files greater than 4GB.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem is seen with SHA-1, SHA-256, SH
   A-384 and SHA-512 and when the file size is greater than 4GB. Al
   l Java Releases (Java 1.4.2, Java 5.0 and Java 6) has this probl
   em. Fix is provided for all these Java releases. The fix would b
   e available in:
   Java 1.4.2 SR12
   Java 5.0   SR8
   Java 6     SR2
   Fixed Module: ibmjceprovider.jar
