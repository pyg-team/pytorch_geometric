QUESTION
 Why is SiteProtector not resolving the Source and Target DNS Name fields? 

ANSWER
The Source DNS Name and Target DNS Name fields are showing up as blank in the Analysis view, but it is not possible to do a DNS lookup on the IP addresses and resolve them.

The Source DNS and Target DNS name fields are populated from the DNS name associated with the asset, for example, an event with source IP address 1.1.1.1 that does not have a source DNS name associated with it. The asset can be found with the IP address 1.1.1.1 (it may be in your ungrouped assets) and you may notice that it does not have a DNS name associated with it. Right click on that asset and choose "Update Host". The Application server will query its DNS server to see if it can resolve the IP address 1.1.1.1 to a host name. If the Application server can, it will populate it in the Asset tab. In the Sensor Analysis view, the Source DNS name can now be seen.

The DNS name of assets can be populated four different ways:



 * By right clicking on an asset and choosing Update Host or Reverse DNS Lookup.
   
 * By scanning a host in Internet Scanner or Enterprise Scanner.
   
 * By importing assets from your Active Directory server.
   
 * By right clicking on an asset and choosing Edit Host and manually typing in its DNS name.
