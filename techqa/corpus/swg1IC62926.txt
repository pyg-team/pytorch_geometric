ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In DB2 v9.7 a small amount of memory from the database heap may
   be leaked during a REORG.  For the leak to occur, the
   reorganized table must be compressed and must contain at least
   one XML column.  Some of the XML documents must be stored in the
   XML storage object and be compressed.
   
   Symptoms of this memory leak include:
   - Continuous increase of memory usage both inside the DB2
   process and on the system overall
   - Out-of-memory errors reported by the database manager
   - Side effects such as the inability to connect to DB2 databases
   - System memory or paging space exhaustion
   
   This memory is allocated from the database heap, and will be
   reported by DB2 memory monitoring tools (db2pd, db2mtrk,
   snapshot).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increasing the size of the database heap via the 'dbheap' memory
   configuration parameter may help prevent the symptoms of this
   memory leak.
