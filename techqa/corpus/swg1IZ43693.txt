APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Missing data adaption when migrating BPC.
   .
   Data adaption might not be performed when the database schema is
   upgraded manually.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This problem occurs if the BPEDB schema or database is migrated
   manually to the current version
   using the appropriate upgradeSchema6xx.sql (and if necessary the
   upgradeTablespaces6xx.sql) script.
   Depending on the version from where the system is upgraded some
   of the following data might be inaccurate:
   WPS 6.0.0 : existing 'WorkList' and 'ActivityInstance
   attributes' instances are not migrated to the new version
               and might not be visible anymore.
   WPS 6.0.2 : the new column EXTENDED_AUTO_DELETE might not
   reflect the original values but might be set to the new
               default value that is
   AUTO_DELETE_ON_SUCCESSFUL_COMPLETION.
   
   
   
   Problem conclusion
   
   This Fix should be applied before the BFM/HTM containers are
   started the first time after the
   BPEDB database schema is manually upgraded to the current
   version.
   The data in the affected tables are updated then accordingly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem fixed with V620 FP1
