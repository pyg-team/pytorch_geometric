APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After searching for documents using the IBM Content Collector
   search application, the results are displayed on the search
   results page. If there are more results than can be displayed
   in the results frame, a scroll bar is shown. However, the
   scroll bar appears to be at the end of the list even if there
   are further documents. As a result, the user cannot
   access the documents at the end of the list.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem does not occur in Internet explorer versions 8 and 9
   in native mode. The browser mode and document mode setting in
   these versions of Internet Explorer should be set to native
   mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See Error Description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, the scroll bar is displayed correctly.
