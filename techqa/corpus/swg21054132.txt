 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When WebSphere MQ Workflow for AIX is uninstalled, a copy of the installation profile "/usr/lpp/fmc/fmcrc" is created so that any changes you made to your old version are available when you install and configure a new version of Workflow. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are installing a new WebSphere MQ Workflow version, to be able to use the previous configurations, you need a copy of the previous installation profile. The installation profile is located in /usr/lpp/fmc/. During the deinstallation it will be deleted, but before this is done, it is saved with a unique name in the ConfigurationRootDirectory (usually /var/fmc/).
Please note that the configurations themselves (usually located in /var/fmc/cfgs/...) are not touched.

For example, (taken out of smit.log):
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
Pre-deinstall Verification...
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
Verifying selections...Found an installation profile at /usr/lpp/fmc/fmcrc.
The file will be backuped to /var/fmc/fmcrc.install-backup.19098
Done. Now continuing with deinstall...
done

To use your previous settings, after installing the new software level create the new installation profile as usual using the command "fmczinsx -o env ..." and use the backup copy as a reference for any additional changes.
