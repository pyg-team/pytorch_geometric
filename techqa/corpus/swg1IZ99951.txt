APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running the IF with a fresh install of TCR 2.1.1 on
   Windows, the following error message occours:
   
   "TCR is running on TIP2.1; So not required to install this ifix;
   ifix
   applicable only for TCR on TIP 2.2; Exiting"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The tipcli.bat output for the TIP version a fresh install of TCR
   2.1.1
   differs from the output of an upgraded version of TCR 2.1.1.
   
   This requires a manual change in
   
   check_tip_version.bat:
   command: if "%str%" == "tip2.2" (
   Replace this line with: if "%str%" == "tip2.1" (
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TCR 2.1.1 IFIX1 had an issue in the published package where an
   XML was incomplete/corrupted. This prevented the install of the
   IFIX1 in the customer's environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The TCR 2.1.1 IFIX1 package has been re-published to Fix Central
   after
   another round of testing with the correct package. Customers can
   download the latest package from Fix Central and install the
   same.
