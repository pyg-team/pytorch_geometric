 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When AT-TLS is initialized, the following expected messages do not appear in the TCPIP joblog:
System SSL: SHA-1 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: SHA-224 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: SHA-256 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: SHA-384 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: SHA-512 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: DES crypto assist is available 
System SSL: DES3 crypto assist is available 
System SSL: AES 128-bit crypto assist is available 
System SSL: AES 256-bit crypto assist is available 
System SSL: ICSF FMID is HCR7770 
System SSL: PCI cryptographic accelerator is not available 
System SSL: PCIX cryptographic coprocessor is available 
System SSL: Public key hardware support is available 
System SSL: Max RSA key sizes in hardware - signature 4096, encryption 4096 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the following JCL card to your TCPIP PROC JCL:
//STDERR DD SYSOUT = * 

When you re-test, you should now see the system SSL crypto messages in your TCPIP joblog.
