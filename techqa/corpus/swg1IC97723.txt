APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a Java client connects to a queue manager on which AMS is
   active, an exception in the client can occur if these
   conditions are met:
   
   1. The queue manager is little-endian (byte-reversed) that is,
    Windows or Linux.
   2. The queue manager and client CCSID are incompatible, that is,
    there is no conversion possible between the CCSIDS
    on the queue manager.
   .
   This causes the policy data to be sent to the client in
   the encoding of the queue manager; the client expects them to be
   big-endian (byte-ordered) and an exception is raised.
   .
   Examples:
   mqjms.log.0
    month dd, yyyy nn:nn:nn PM [main]
    com.ibm.mq.ese.intercept.JmqiOpenInterceptorImpl
    The IBM WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Security Java
    interceptor failed to obtain the security policy.
    Reason Code: '3013' The IBM WebSphere MQ Advanced
    Message Security Java interceptor was not able to
    obtain the security policy. See subsequent messages
    in the exception for more details about the cause
    of the error.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/
   JMS who are connecting to an AMS enabled Queue Manager (AMS is
   installed) with a coded character set identifier (CCSID) set
   to a character set that uses big-endian encoding
   (byte-reversed).
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64, Linux on zSeries, Linux on x86, Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The AMS policy data was not returned to the WebSphere MQ Classes
   for Java/JMS Client in the expected format, this resulted in a
   MQRCCF_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ERROR (reason code 3013) being flowed back
   to the application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The AMS policy data is now returned to the WebSphere MQ
   Classes for Java/JMS Client in the expected format.
