Title: IBM How do I run an ANOVA analysis with a control variable? - United States

ANOVA ANCOVA UNIVARIATE CONTROL VARIABLE TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I'm attempting to perform a One-Way ANOVA with Analyze> Compare means> One Way ANOVA. 
That works fine, but I really want to add a control variable and there are no options to do that. 

How can I add a control variable to an ANOVA analysis? 

ANSWER
To specify an ANCOVA with a single factor, go to Analyze> General Linear Model> Univariate. 

Specify the dependent variable. 
Specify the factor as a Fixed Factor.
Add the control variable as a Covariate.

The default model would be one with a main effect of the factor and for the covariate, using Type III sums of squares. Thus the factor effect is controlled for the covariate. A custom model specification can be done in the Model dialog, so you can, for example, also enter an interaction between the factor and the covariate in order to evaluate the equal slopes assumption made in the standard ANCOVA model.
