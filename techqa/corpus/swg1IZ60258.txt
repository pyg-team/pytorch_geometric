ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CTGDIK034I Creating AbapErrorInfo object:
   
    We found a new problem for SAP Net Weaver Agent (version 5.0.2
   with
   connection reset patch). The PMR# 06602,422,000 is opened for
   this
   issue.
   Issue description:
   SAP Net Weaver Agent full reconciliation aborted half way
   without any
   error or warning message shown in TIM request.
   According to the agent log, the reconciliation stopped iterating
   users
   when it found a user account existed at the beginning but was
   removed
   later during reconciliation.
   
   In the beginning of agent log, the following info is found:
   <item><VALUES><![CDATA[U372258]]></VALUES></item>
   
   In the end of iterating (before searching support data), the
   following
   error message can be found:
   CTGDIK034I Creating AbapErrorInfo object: message='User U372258
   does not
   exist', error number='124', error flag='E'.
   
   We think there are two defects in this case:
   1. If the reconciliation is aborted, the TIM request should not
   be in
   "Success" status. It should log down the error message in TIM
   request
   with a "Failed" status.
   2. Error handler should be added to handle the missing account
   issue. It
   should be able to skip the missing account and continue to
   process other
   accounts left.
