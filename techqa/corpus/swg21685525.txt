QUESTION
 How do you suppress Java dumps for Java OutOfMemoryError (OOM) Exceptions for IBM Rational Developer for system z (RDz)? 

CAUSE
You may see the following error on the zOS operator console because a user has tried searching for text on a very large PDS (for example): 
JVMDUMP039I Processing dump event 'systhrow', detail ''java/lang/OutOfMemoryError' at 2014/09/11 09:56:37" 


ANSWER
To suppress writing dumps for an OutOfMemoryError exception, you need to add the Xdump line to the RDz configuration file rsed.envvars.

Example:
_RSE_JAVAOPTS= -Xdump:none:events=systhrow,filter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError
