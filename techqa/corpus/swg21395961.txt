ABSTRACT
 This technote contains brief descriptions of problems in IBM InfoSphere eDiscovery Manager Version 2.1.1 Fix Pack 1 that were discovered before the product shipped. Where applicable, workarounds are provided. 

CONTENT
1. The silent installation response file might lack the WAS_TYPE WebSphere Application Server parameter 

The response file that is automatically generated for a silent installation lacks the WAS_TYPE parameter if WebSphere Application Server was silently installed on the system. When WebSphere Application Server is silently installed, entries for WebSphere Application Server are not written to the vpd.properties file, and therefore the WAS_TYPE parameter is not written to the eDiscovery Manager response file. 

Workaround: Copy the following lines into the silent installation response file and then uncomment one of the two WAS_TYPE parameters: 

# WebSphere Application Server type. Uncomment only one of the
# following two parameters, depending on whether your site runs
# WebSphere Application Server Base or WebSphere Application Server ND (Network Deployment).
#WAS_TYPE=BASE
#WAS_TYPE=ND 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM InfoSphere eDiscovery Manager Version 2.1.1 Fix Pack 2. 

 

2. SRVE0255E: A WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle /ibm/console/login.do has not been defined 

After the eDiscovery Manager installation completes, you might get the following error: 

 * 
 * SRVE0255E: A WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle /ibm/console/login.do has not been defined.


This can happen in the following scenarios:  * In WebSphere Application Server Base environments, if the eDiscovery Manager server and the WebSphere Application Server administration server are running in different application server instances of the same profile 
 * In WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment environments, if the name of the eDiscovery Manager application server instance is not "server1"


Workaround: If the eDiscovery Manager server is running, stop and restart it. If the eDiscovery Manager server is not running, start it. Update: This problem is fixed in IBM InfoSphere eDiscovery Manager Version 2.1.1 Fix Pack 2.


6. The default value in the Text Index column for the CONTENT mapping field is incorrect 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21395961&amp;aid=1] For collections of type Files - Content Collector, the default value in the Text Index column for the CONTENT mapping field is incorrect. The default value should be "$FULL_TEXT$", not "content". 

Workaround: On the Search Mapping tab of the Collections pane, change the value in the Text Index column from "content" to "$FULL_TEXT$" for the CONTENT mapping field. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM InfoSphere eDiscovery Manager Version 2.1.1 Fix Pack 2. 

 

7. The status of pending export tasks can be misleading 

If eDiscovery Manager is already processing the maximum number of simultaneous export tasks, the status of pending export tasks can be misleading on the Tasks pane of the Case Information page. Because the pending tasks have been scheduled by the eDiscovery Manager work manager, they are transitioned from the Scheduled status to the Running status although they have not actually started yet. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM eDiscovery Manager Version 2.2. 

 

8. The link to the Tasks pane of the Administration page does not work 

As an administrator, the task status link (for example, You have no running tasks or You have failed tasks) in the top right corner of the Search page or the Case Information page reflects the status of your tasks on the Tasks pane of the Case Information page. Clicking this link displays the Tasks pane of the Case Information page. 

Similarly, the task status link in the top right corner of the Administration page reflects the status of your tasks on the Tasks pane of the Administration page. But clicking this link does not display the Tasks pane of the Administration page; it displays the Tasks pane of the Case Information page. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM eDiscovery Manager Version 2.2. The task status link always reflects the status of your tasks on the Tasks pane of the Case Information page. 

 

9. The task status link can be misleading 

As an administrator, switching between cases that have different task statuses can cause the task status link to freeze. For example, the task status link for one case might indicate the existence of failed tasks and the task status link for a second case might indicate the existence of running tasks. After switching back to the first case, the task status link can freeze, reflecting the (running) status of tasks in the second case instead of reflecting the (failed) status of tasks in the first case. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM eDiscovery Manager Version 2.2 

 

10. The task list is not refreshed after you delete a task 

If there is at least one failed task in the task list and a user tries to delete any other task from the list, it appears that the task is not deleted. In reality, the task is deleted, but the task list is not refreshed to reflect the deletion. 

If the user subsequently tries to view the details of the deleted task or tries to delete the task again, the message "The task was already deleted" is displayed correctly. 

Workaround: Click Refresh All after deleting a task to refresh the task list. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM eDiscovery Manager Version 2.2 

 

11. Running multiple Delete Case tasks at the same time can cause problems 

Running multiple Delete Case tasks at the same time can cause one of the following problems: 

 * One of the tasks can fail with an "Array Index out of Bounds" exception in the eDiscovery Manager work manager log file 
 * Both tasks are paused and neither complete
   


Workaround: Restart one of the failed Delete Case tasks. When it completes, restart another failed Delete Case task, if it exists. Do not restart more than one failed task at a time. Recommendation: If possible, run only one Delete Case task at a time. 

Update: This problem is fixed in IBM eDiscovery Manager Version 2.2
