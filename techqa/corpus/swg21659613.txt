PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ServiceStatusContentServlet: Can not get SoapORBClient 

SYMPTOM

CAUSE
Corruption of the ServiceList file

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The following error: 

 * 
 * 
 * TimeStamp
 * 


is found in the file: 

 * 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Once the usual causes listed in the TechNote "Services not listed in Service Status pane" [link below] have been exhausted it is prudent to check the SystemOut.log and confirm if the ServiceList file: 




 * 
 * [ImpactServerName]
 * 


has been corrupted. By default the file contains the following entries: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * [TimeStamp]
 * 
 * 
 *

The [TimeStamp] by default is from the time Impact was installed, otherwise it is from the time a custom Service was added or an existing Service edited in such a was as to change the properties held within this file. The list of entries is rarely as incrementally ordered as above. 

One can either resort the file from an uncorrupted back-up or manually rebuild the file. All actions are to be performed as the User used to install and run Impact: 

 *  Stop the Impact Cluster (ewas.sh stop) - Secondary(/ies) first, then the Primary. Back off a copy of the current [ImpactServerName]_servicelist file. On the Primary either replace the corrupted file with the uncorrupted back-up copy OR manually rebuild the file to at least the default model (as above). If there are additional custom Services to be added then each will require the three properties (class, isprimary and name) and incremental numeric value (>19) and the numservices property would have to match the final increment number. Restart the Primary ImpactServer and check the availability of the Service Status pane contents. If successful, restart the Secondary ImpactServer(s).
