APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying the System Monitoring shared service along with
   the System Monitoring for WebSphere MQ shared service, we would
   expect to see the ITCAM for MQ agent in the TEPS console of the
   System Monitoring shared service for every virtual machine that
   has the MQ software component installed on it. However we do
   not see the ITCAM for MQ agent.
   
   The configuration of the MQ agent automatically uses IPv6 and
   cannot connect to the system monitoring when using externally
   managed cloud groups.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact IBM Support for workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Code has been added to to check if the System Monitoring shared
   service has been configured before setting up the WMQ monitoring
   agent. If the shared service  has been configured an attempt to
   verify the WMQ agent installation is performed before
   configuring the agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System and
   BlueMix Local System version 2.2.3.0 in the System Monitoring
   Pattern 1.0.10.0.
