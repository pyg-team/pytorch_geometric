QUESTION
 Is ITCAM for AD 7.1.x compatible with 7.2 support files? Are these version backward compatible?


ANSWER
Yes, it should be compatible. However, make sure that the AD 7.1 DC is at least at 7.1.0.3.8 (or 7.1.0.4) level as there is an issue with heap size values in the GC and Application Server summary workspaces with older AD 7.1 versions.
