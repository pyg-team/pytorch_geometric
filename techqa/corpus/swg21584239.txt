QUESTION
 How to delete a template from Clarity?


CAUSE
In IBM Clarity Server, when the Menu items belong to dynamic folders, even if the content is displayed when accessing the menu, when browsing the files in menu administration, the content is not accessible

ANSWER
If you have a dynamic folder, you can copy templates directly in the folder and they will show up in the web application, you can assign permission on the folder and the users will have access to all the content of the folder and you cannot delete the items from the front end. The only option is to remove the files in the physical location on the application server.

If you have a static folder (the dynamic setting is not enabled) you can publish using Studio, or use Add Menu Item, you can assign permission for every individual file in the folder and you can delete the items from the front end using Menu Administration
