 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I run Content Manager OnDemand for i and am looking for this year's e-mail newsletters that provide valuable hints and tips for the product. Are those available? 

ANSWER
Please note that Content Manager OnDemand newsletters for all platforms can now be accessed here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024130]. 
Starting with the 4th quarter of 2011, the OnDemand Newsletter covers all platforms, not just i (formerly known as iSeries). The newsletter is delivered quarterly. Also, starting with the 2nd Quarter bulletin of 2016, the format has been changed so that it is easier to read on wide screen devices. We recommend that you use the full screen viewing option in Adobe Acrobat (Ctrl+L) for best results.

Thank you for your support over these last 18 years! Questions about the OnDemand Newsletter should be directed to dbryant1@us.ibm.com.
