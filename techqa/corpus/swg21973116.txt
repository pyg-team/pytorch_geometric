 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I install 2 or more XMETA metadata repository databases for different IBM InfoSphere Information Server versions on the same Oracle installation? 

ANSWER
In theory you should be able to change the XMETA metadata repository creation script (provided with IBM Information Server installation files) to install each XMETA database under a different Schema/User so that everything is created with its own Schema/User and they are completely separate from each other. 

Note this will have performance implications if both XMETA databases are being used simultaneously.

Also this particular scenario has not been officially tested by the IBM Development team so the co-located XMETA databases will not be officially supported.

If you do attempt this we recommend you have a good back up of the first Oracle database before you create the second in the new schema.
