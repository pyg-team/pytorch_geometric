ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Does CATIA V5 without the 5691-ASD (assembly design) provide
   SIMPLE multi-model capability?
   In other words, is there a facility within
   base CATIA V5 to provide "session" style capability which is
   provided with COM in V4??
   .
   Here is the test scenario I followed:
   .
   1. Remove all LUM licences on the system
   2. Introduce only the 5691-ADD licences (which does not
   include     5691-ASD   (assembly))
   3. Start CATIA V5==> There is NO multi-model capability
      (ie Product)
   4. Quit CATIA
   5. Introduce 5691-ASD licence
   6. Start CATIA  ==>  There is capability to work with
   multiple      models.
   
   I hear everyone asking the question.
   And migrating to V5, do they need to buy ASD ?
   .
   This is the trouble to migrate to V5 for the cst.
   20 x  5691-ASD licences OR in other words 20 x $6005 = $120100
   and the cst can not accept it.
   .
   --------------
   We studied further about this issue:
   There is some follow on information that may be useful.
   There is a work around to my query but it seems as if there is
   actually
   a bug within CATIA V5.
   .
   1. If your customer has no assembly product (5691-ASD) in V5
      as part of their migration from V4 (eg5691-ADD or
   5691-SBD)      then the -y have NO multi-model(or "V4 session")
   capability.
   .
   2. If the customer has an existing CATProduct file from
   any          source
      (even an empty one) everything seems to be OK. It is
   possible    to open this CATProduct file,create further
   assemblies and       sub-assemblies on top of it and even save
   it as a new Product     again.
       So working from a blank one is the work around to
   this           problem.
   .
   ---------------
   Hi DS,
   it seems that one cannot create a CATProduct (equivalent session
   in V4) without 5691-ASD, but if they somehow get hold of a
   CATProduct file (from any source, even if empty) then all "V4
   session" functionality within
   V5 is OK.
   .
   
   I have tried your secnario with CATIA V5R3GA . You are right
   that
   under START/Infrastructure , Product Struct is listed as an
   available
   product ( OnLY ADD Configuration was insatlled ) But After
   selecting
   the 'product structure item ' I got an error message saying that
   I
   would
   need the ASD license ( Why not ' ) So I havejust sent a note to
   the development team to know why ASD is needed .
   Thank you for your understanding,
