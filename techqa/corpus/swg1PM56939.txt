ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for WebSphere
   Applications  Version: 07.10.02.07 + WAS ND 7.0.0.19 + WAS VE 7
   
   Restart the DMGR - the TEMAs will lose
   connectivity to the XD Cells and will not reconnect. An Error
   will appear in the Connection Status field, and a Situation will
   get generated. Expected behaviour is that after a certain amount
   of time, the TEMAs reconnect of their own accord.  This is
   however not happened. The TEMAs have to be manually restarted in
   order for them to connect to the XD Cell instances.
   
   First possible reason: found exception
   "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Timer already cancelled"
   thrown from XDCellSubNode.
   defautTimer may be cancelled because of an unchecked exception
   thrown from TimerTask.
