PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The program logic is enhanced to accept a dynamically issued
   SET GROUP or SET MANAGER command with EVENTS(NO) parameter
   specified. The agent will stop monitoring the events at the
   next sampling interval. The event monitoring can be resumed
   by dynamically issue the SET GROUP or SET MANAGER command with
   an EVENTS parameter other than EVENTS(NO).
