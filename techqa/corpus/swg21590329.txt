Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When an XML document was being posted with:

"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

to SI 5.1 HTTP Server Adapter, the error of "INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified" is noted in various system logs. 

SYMPTOM
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified


CAUSE
The trading partner was posting a plain XML document, but document was being posted with an incorrect content type: 

"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 

SI 5.1 was then decoding the document and then trying to parse as an XML document. This caused an Illegal Character error as the document was never urlencoded in the first place. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On the sending/posting system, trading partner needs to explicitly set the Content-Type to text/xml before posting to SI 5.1 system and the document can then be properly parsed.
