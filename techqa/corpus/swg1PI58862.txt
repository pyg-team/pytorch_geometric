   *                      may cause unexpected results as an      *

   ****************************************************************
   When the On Demand Router processes a request it may create a
   corresponding ODR Session ID cookie to ensure that the same ODR
   processes subsequent requests from the same client.  The
   creation of the ODR Session ID cookie is based upon attributes
   in the JSESSIONID cookie. However, there were cases that the
   cookies did not match.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ODR code was changed to ensure that when the ODR Session ID
   cookie is copied from the JSESSIONID cookie.  This will ensure
   that these two cookies have common characteristics.
