QUESTION
 Alcatel 5620 SAM probe : RecoveryFile property : Do environment variables get expanded? 

CAUSE
$NCHOME and $OMNIHOME environment variables should not be used for probe specific properties or generic properties specific to the probe type.

ANSWER
 

Check to see if $NCHOME or $OMNIHOME is being used to specify the RecoveryFile in the probes property file; 

e.g.
RecoveryFile: "$OMNIHOME/var/AlcatelSamRecovery"

Although the default behaviour is to use the given file, if the property is explicitly set, the $OMNIHOME variable is not expanded and the probe is unable to write to the RecoveryFile.

In general, only the common generic probe properties will expand environment variables such as $NCHOME and $OMNIHOME.

The recommendation is to always use the specific full path to the file or directory given in a probes property definition;
e.g.
RecoveryFile: "/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/var/AlcatelSamRecovery"

Check that the file is recreated when the probe is running, and its permission's are correct for the probe user.
