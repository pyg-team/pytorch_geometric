ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You would like to perform a silent installation of release 23 on
   Macintosh Yosemite 10.10.3 with either single user (authorized
   user) license or for network (concurrent user) license
   
   Therefore, you Download SPSSSC_23.0_MAC_OS_SILENT_ML.dmg to a
   Mac 10.10.3 desktop
   Open the DMG file as administrator and extract the content of
   the DMG file to a folder or desktop
   After extraction you see 2 files:
   
   SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin and installer.properties
   
   Open installer.properties file and edit it for your needs, for
   example when you would like to perform a silent installtion for
   single user license you need to set the AUTHCODE parameter and
   enable row single=1
   
   You save the edited installer.properties file into the same
   folder as SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin
   Then, open Terminal.app and CD to the folder where you saved
   both files
   Run below command to start the silent installation
   
   sudo ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin -f ./installer.properties
   
   The installer starts to launch but then gives an error about
   IAMac below.
   
   *************
   SPSSs-iMac:desktop SPSS$ sudo ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin -f
   ./installer.properties

   This was reported to IBM SPSS development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This error message on console can be ignored. It does not affect
   the installation.
   After you see this error on Terminal, if you wait a bit you see
   that silent installations for either single user or network
   license will proceed successfully on 10.10.3 Yosemite and the
   program SPSS 23 will run fine after installation.
