Title: IBM Configuring ITMPolicy Data Fetchers to ITM 6.3 - United States

Text:
TBSM ITM webservice itmpolicy data fetcher TIPWebServiceHttpRouter TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There may be issues connecting to ITM 6.3, depending on how ITM was installed.

You may see the error: Error CTGBA0093E No agents found 
when clicking on [Test Web Service Connection]



SYMPTOM
Error CTGBA0093E No agents found 


CAUSE
The queryport is not enabled by default in ITM 6.3

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you connect to the following URL using a browser: 


 http://<ITM Hostname>:<port>/TIPWebServiceHttpRouter/services/QueryPort 

Where the hostname and port are the same as those you specified in the ITM Policy Datafetcher config, you should see something returned that contains: 


Hi there, this is a Web service!

If you don't, it suggests ITM does not have the queryport open.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First check that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Web Services have been configured correctly, as described in Chapter 17 of the ITM 6.3 Installation and Configuration Guide. 

 

Check if the file kfwtipewas.properties in the directory: <inst>/ITM/<arch>/cq on the target ITM server, it may be appropriate to copy the file from: <inst>/ITM/<arch>/cq/sqllib. 

 

Please contact ITM support for further details if you are still unable to connect.
