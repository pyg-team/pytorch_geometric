APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upgraded ICN from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2 and now I am getting an error
   when I
   try to add multiple documents. The error is telling me that the
   class
   that I have chosen contains one or more properties that require
   a
   unique value for each document. I did not get this error before
   the
   upgrade with 2.0.1 and I have checked the class and don't see
   the
   require unique property. I have also tried to add multiple
   documents
   with the Document class and get the same error. I have not
   altered the
   Document class from the original install.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This behavior was introduced in the 2.0.2 fix for:
   Defect 28223: CM8 - Multi document add fails on a class that has
   Name attribute set to unique ( It is a non ICM$NAME attribute )
   
   The new behavior is too restrictive. The multi-add should be
   prevented only if there is a non-system property that requires
   unique values *and* also requires a value (can't be empty).
   Non-system properties that require a unique value but do not
   require a value should be displayed as read-only.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ERROR ADDING MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS TO A P8 REPOSITORY AFTER
   UPGRADING TO ICN 2.0.2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  fix for this issue included in 2.0.2.0 iFix001 and
   later.
