   (2) Click 'new' put 'test' as 'Package Definition Name'.

   and keep other fields by default
   
   (3) Save the record and change the status to approve the package
   definition
   
   (4) Continually to distribute and create the migration package
   from source environment.
   Confirmed test-MAXIMO_MAXDB76_MAXIMO_20170905152222.zip
   was generated
   
   (5) Open IE11 and login target environment which having the same
   version info as source environment.
   
   (6) Go to 'Migration Manager' application, click action 'Upload
   Package', a popup dialog being displayed.
   
   (7)Then click button 'Browse...' point to the location of
   test-MAXIMO_MAXDB76_MAXIMO_20170905152222.zip created from
   step4.
   Full path info being displayed. Click button 'OK' to upload the
   file, receiving error : dm#dmuploadfail
   
   file not being uploaded to inbound folder of target environment.
   No execption or error being output in log file as well.
   
   (8) If using non-English environment for example Linux, file
   would be
   uploaded to target environmet, but the filename being changed to
   C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\Desktop\test-MAXIMO_MAXDB76_MAXIMO_2017090515
   2222.zip
   (full path info being saved as filename)
   
   Later on when trying to deploy the uploaded file, receiving
   error BMXAA6042E deploy package not be selected, Still couldn't
   deploy the package successfully
