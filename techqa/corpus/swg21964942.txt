QUESTION
 Unable to launch probe and no messages are logged, how can we start the probe? 

CAUSE
For some reason, permission of $OMNIHOME/propbes<INTER>/nco_p_xxx may be changed to as below
-rwsr-sr-x 1 netcool ncoadmin 77934 Feb 05 2010 nco_p_ping*


ANSWER
If probe file permission is unexpectedly changed as below, the probe is unable to be launched. 

The condition is as below 

exec userV / permission > -rwsr-sr-x / owner: netcool -rwxr-xr-x / owner: netcool user: netcool OK OK user: root NG OK change the permission -rwsr-sr-x using chmod 755 nco_p_xxx  

 Then nco_p_probe -version also failed with (like) following errors 

-----------------------------------------
/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/probes/nco _p _ping -version
