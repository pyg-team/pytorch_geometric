Title: IBM IV50251: THE ASSET APPLICATION ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE STATUS ON A RECORD EVEN IF THE NOSTATUS WORKFLOW ACTION IS ACTIVE. - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use the NOSTATUS Action in Workflow you should not be
   able to make any status changes.   That is true in many
   applications but not in Assets.  There are probably other
   applications where that is true but the only one I have
   verified is Assets.   It allows the status change only if there
   are synonyms of the current status but it should not allow it
   under any case.
   
   
   The Client reported this on 7.5.0.3.  I have reproduced it on
   7.5.0.3 and on 7.5.0.5.
   
   Product management declared this a bug saying, "NOSTATUS should
   not allow status change on the synonyms, we need to unify the
   rules on the WO model.  APAR please"
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Go to Domains and find LOCASSETST (Asset Status).
   2. Verify that the Internal Status OPERATING has synonyms,
      typically Active and Limiteduse.   If it does not have any
      synonyms please add some.
   3. Go To WF Designer and enter a new process for Object = ASSET
   4. Use these nodes:
   
           start--------->Task---------->Stop
   
   5. On the Action line from Start to Task put the Action
      NOSTATUS.
   6. For the Task make one Assignment and give it to Originator.
   7. Save, Enable and Activate.
   8. When the Add WF Support to Applications dialog box appears
      add Full WF support to Assets by clicking OK.
   9. When that finishes you will have to logoff and back on to
      see the WF additions in the Assets application.
   10. Go To Assets
   11. Pick any Asset or make a new one.
   12. Change its Status to Operating.
   13. Click the Route WF button to start it in the WF process
       created above.
   14. Click on the Change Status toolbar button.
   
   The bug is that you will now get the Change Status dialog box
   but you should not get it.  With the NOSTATUS Action in effect
   the Change Status button should be disabled as it is in other
   applications such as WOTrack.   You should immediately get the
   dialog box with this message in it:
   
    BMXAA4042E - The status cannot be changed for the selected
                    records.
   
   Instead, you get the Change Status dialog if there are synonyms
   of the current status, in this case Operating.   If there are
   no synonyms you get the proper error dialog, that is why you
   have to verify that there are synonyms or create them.
