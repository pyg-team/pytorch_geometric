PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: As we update our knowledge centers, the following
   Version 9.0 modifications will be available. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 9.0 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: 246615 (RTC)
   Problem: WebSphere Application Server  V9.0 uses Jython 2.7 and
   as such the Jython reserved keyword list is different than what
   was is in Jython 2.1  The client moved up to V9.0 and certain
   scripts failed even though they worked on an earlier release
   and Jython 2.1.   The keyword, as,  is allowed in Jython 2.1,
   but not in Jython 2.7.
   Topic, Using wsadmin scripting with Jython, needs to be
   updated.  The reserved keyword list needs to conform with
   Jython 2.7.
   Resolution: Topic, Using wsadmin scripting with Jython, is
   updated.  There are three new reserved keywords that need to
   be added to the topic:  as, with, yield.  Then this topic will
   conform to Jython 2.7.

   Problem description: Topic, Multiple virtual hosts for
   web modules is in need of an update. The term, virtual
   host, is changed to, web module. Also, some of the step
   directions are in error.  These documentation erros can lead
   to misuse if the procedure is follows as is.
   Resolution:
   1) Topic, Multiple virtual hosts for
   web modules, is updated.  The second sentence of Step 3b -
   virtual host is changed to web module.  Step 3b mentions step
   1 in the second sentence should refer to step 3a.  This second
   sentence now reads:
   If you selected more than one web module in step 3a:
   
   2) Topic ,Virtual hosts settings, is updated.
   The second sentence of step 2, is updated to change, virtual
   host, to ,web module - and now reads:
   If you selected more than one web module in step 1:
   
   These topic updates also applies to version 7, 8, and 85.

   ID: 246184 (RTC)
   Problem: TPV logging script does not work if the topic,
   Logging Tivoli Performance Viewer data using scripting, is
   followed as documented.  The topic needs to be updated to
   indicate particular presferences that need to be set as well
   as to corroect the currently documented character string,
   tpvOName, to tpvName.
   Resolution:  Topic, Logging Tivoli Performance Viewer data
   using scripting, is updated.
   (1) Steps 5, 6, 7 are updated so that tpvOName is changed to
   tpvName.
   (2) At the end of Step, the topic now reads:
   Make sure you add the following preferences:
   - pref.setBufferSize(nnnn) - Sets the number of entries to
   store in the buffer, where nnnn is an integer.  (Example:
   pref.setBufferSize(1200) )
   - pref.setLoggingDuration(nn) - Sets the logging duration.
   This is how long in seconds logging will stay active once it
   has been turned on, unless it is stopped manually by the user.
    (Example: pref.setLoggingDuration (60) )
   - pref.setRefreshRate(n)   - Sets the refresh rate in seconds,
   the number of  seconds between requests for new data (Example:
   pref.setRefreshRate(5) )
   - pref.setLogFileSize(nnnnnnnn) - Sets the log file size in
   bytes an individual log file can grow to. (Example:
   pref.setLogFileSize(1000000) )
   - pref.setNumLogFiles(n)     - Set the number of log files to
   use while logging.   (Example: pref setNumLogFiles(3) )
   
   This update also applies to V7.0, V8.0, and V8.5.

   Problem: Topic, Enabling z/OS authorized services on Liberty
   for z/OS, documents an example that is missing information and
   when used, can lead to errors. Message CWWKB0118W appears in
   the Liberty server messages.log after configuring a new named
   angel. This server is not authorized to connect to the {0}
   angel process. No authorized services will be loaded.  This
   condition is caused by using the SAF definitions on the
   knowledge center topic, Enabling z/OS authorized services on
   Liberty for z/OS.
   Resolution: Topic, Enabling z/OS authorized services on Liberty
   for z/OS, is updated.  The second bullet in the procedure now
   reads:
   To create an unnamed angel server profile and enable a server
   that is running as WLPUSER1 to connect to it, issue the
   following commands:
   
   RDEF SERVER BBG.ANGEL UACC(NONE)
   PERMIT BBG.ANGEL CLASS(SERVER) ACCESS(READ) ID(wlpuser1)
   
   [16.0.0.4 and later]To create a named angel server profile and
   enable a server that is running as WLPUSER1 to connect to it,
   issue the following commands:
   
   RDEF SERVER BBG.ANGEL.namedAngelName UACC(NONE)
   PERMIT BBG.ANGEL.namedAngelName CLASS(SERVER) ACCESS(READ)
   ID(WLPUSER1)
   
   The profile name that you specify for the namedAngelName
   variable is the name of the new angel.
   
   [16.0.0.4 and later] You can use generic profiles such as
   BBG.ANGEL.* to grant a user ID access to multiple angels.

   ID: 246702
   Problem: the PidWaiter creates a new thread every ping
   interval. When there is no response beyond PingTimeout, the
   thread sleep for 60 seconds and try to ping again.
   The user could not understand from the knowledge center about
   the time of sleep and retry while planning to design handling
   of server fault. An update to the knowledge center is needed.
   Resolution: Topic, Monitoring policy settings, is update - At
   the end of the section, Automatic Restart, the following
   paragraph is added:
   For managed processes, a PidWaiter thread is dedicated to
   monitor each managed process. After every ping interval, the
   PidWaiter thread creates a new thread called the contact
   thread. Every contact thread waits for a response from the
   managed process up to the ping timeout value. If no response
   is received by the time the ping timeout is reached or if
   contact fails with an exception, the PidWaiter thread sleeps
   for 60 seconds and then tries again. If there is no response
   to the second attempt to create the contact thread and ping
   the managed process, PidWaiter tries to restart the managed
   process if Automatic Restart is set to true.
   
   This update also applies to V7.0, V8.0, and V8.5

   Problem: Websphere Applicaiton server 9.0 knowledge center is
   missing a statement that WAS 9.0 can be installed using
   installation manager in console mode.
   Resolution: Topic, Installing the product offerings, is updated:
   (1) About this task sentence now reads:
   Depending on your operating system, you can install a product
   using the Installation Manager GUI, command line, response
   files, or console mode. Installation Manager performs the
   following actions:
   (2) An additional bullet is added which reads as a "link"
   - Installing packages by using console mode
