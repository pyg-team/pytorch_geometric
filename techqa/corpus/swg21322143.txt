QUESTION
 How can I match a variable value to an array key? 

ANSWER
Below is an example to populate an array and match a variable value to the array. 
# The real array key ("one" in the first example) would be a variable, the "1" is used to set the value to the non empty string 
myarray["one"] = "1" 
myarray["two"] = "1" 
myarray["thre"] = "1" 

# This populates the array with the value we want to check.
myarray["checkthisvalue"] = "1" 


# This sets the variable containing the value we want to check 
$In = "checkthisvalue" 

# If the value has never been seen before myarray[$In] will return the empty string if (! match(myarray[$In], "")) 
{ 
@Summary = "Match" 
} 
else 
{ 
@Summary = "No match" 
}
