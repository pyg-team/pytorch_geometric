Title: IBM Data Server Manager is showing "Unsupported Version" for a monitored database - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is IBM Data Server Manager (DSM) showing "Unsupported Version" for a monitored database? 

CAUSE
The DB2 versions supported by DSM are: 
- V9.7.6 and higher
- V10.1.3 and higher
- V10.5 and higher 

DSM V2.1 added support for DB2 V11.1.

DSM can show "Unsupported Version" even thou your db2level is listed above.
This error can happen when the DB2 table functions used by DSM are not on a supported level, required by DSM.

Another scenario that you can encounter errors in DSM, caused by DB2 table functions not being on the required level by DSM, is when you see the SQLCODE=-206 error in some of the DSM log files:
The SQL0206N "<name>" is not valid in the context where it is used.



ANSWER
You need to check the level of the DB2 table functions used by DB2. 

To do so, run the following DB2 SELECT command on the monitored database:
db2 "select versionnumber from sysibm.sysversions order by 1 desc fetch first 1 row only"

The VERSIONNUMBER needs to be supported by DSM.

If the VERSIONNUMBER does not return a supported DB2 version required by DSM, and your db2level is correct, then running db2updvnn command is required.
