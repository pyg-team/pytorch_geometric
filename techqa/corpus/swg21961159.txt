Title: IBM Leap Second - Sterling Application Impact - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Does leap second affect OMS? Leap second will be inserted on June 30th 2015, will this cause problems with OMS? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Order Management System uses Unix time and Unix time is defined as the number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970, 00:00 UTC, but without leap seconds. Unix time does not have any way to represent the leap second so instead it uses the same second twice. For example, this is how Unix time looked on January 1st 2009:

UTC Unix clock
2008-12-31 23:59:59 1230767999 
2008-12-31 23:59:60 1230768000 <--leap second
2009-01-01 00:00:00 1230768000 
2009-01-01 00:00:01 1230768001 

For applications there is no way to differentiate between the two distinct times but Unix clock implementations handle this problem using Network Time Protocol (NTP). 

So leap second is handled by your operating system and should not cause problem to OMS. 

If you want to check if your clock is synchronized with NTP server and implements the kernel discipline (explained here http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm [http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm]) you can do the following: on Red Hat run ntptime, you should get something like this 

ntp_gettime() returns code 0 (OK)
time d9369a51.768b9fb0 Thu, Jun 25 2015 17:18:41.463, (.463068202),
maximum error 63910 us, estimated error 3825 us, TAI offset 0
ntp_adjtime() returns code 0 (OK)
modes 0x0 (),
offset 6711.977 us, frequency 0.000 ppm, interval 1 s,
maximum error 63910 us, estimated error 3825 us,
status 0x2001 (PLL,NANO),
time constant 6, precision 0.001 us, tolerance 500 ppm,

If you however get something like this 

ntp_gettime() returns code 5 (ERROR)
...

that would mean your clock is not synchronized. Stop the ntpd service, synchronize your clock with NTP server and restart the ntpd. For more details on how to do this on Red Hat please see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sect-Date_and_Time_Configuration-Command_Line_Configuration-Network_Time_Protocol.html [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sect-Date_and_Time_Configuration-Command_Line_Configuration-Network_Time_Protocol.html]

Please notice that “even if the operating system does not implement the kernel discipline, the clock will show an error of one second relative to NTP's time immediate after the leap second. The situation will be handled just like an unexpected change of time: The operating system will continue with the wrong time for some time, but eventually ntpd will step the time. Effectively this will cause the correction for leap seconds to be applied too late.” Source http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-real.htm#AEN2499 [http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-real.htm#AEN2499]
