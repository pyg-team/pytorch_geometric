Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect some configurations of IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile Versions 6.1, 7.0 and 8.0 that is used by IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager and IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
