APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Copying and pasting a table or cells from Excel 2007 into a
   new Memo in Lotus Notes results in an image/picture instead of
   text.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1.) Create a new memo in Notes
   2.) Open Excel and type text into the cells
   3.) Copy table from Excel and paste into new Memo
   
   RESULT: A picture or image is pasted
   EXPECTED RESULT: Text or an editable table is pasted
   
   This does not occur using the same Notes build with Excel 2003.
   There appears to be a change in Excel that's causing this issue
   with any Notes version
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To workaround this issue, in Notes go to Edit --> Paste Special,
   and choose the default option, "Paste" and in the "As" section
   choose "Microsoft Office Excel Worksheet", which is OLE, "Rich
   Text" or "Text" options.
