EJPAH2025E; virtual portal; hostname; host name; error; creating a virtual portal TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are trying to create a new virtual portal using the Virtual Portal Manager portlet in IBM WebSphere Portal. The creation of your new virtual portal fails with the following error:

EJPAH2025E: Hostname is already used in default virtual portal. 

CAUSE
When using the same host name for your virtual portal as you do for the base portal, the host name field should be left blank when creating the virtual portal.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

To resolve the issue, leave the host name field blank when creating the virtual portal, or use a host name that is not already in use by another virtual portal or by the base portal itself. 

Further details about the virtual portal host name are documented in the WebSphere Portal Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/welcome_main.html] as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hostname of the virtual portal. This attribute is optional. Use it to add a host name of your choice for the virtual portal. The portal uses that host name for the friendly URL of the virtual portal as follows: http://your_hostname_example:port/wps/portal. You can pass that friendly URL to your Portal users for easier access to your Portal.

Notes: 
1. This URL will be used internally to access the virtual portal instance, even if you specify a user friendly context URL as mentioned above. Make sure that the host name that you specify here is accessible. 

2. You cannot use the same virtual portal host name twice in the same Portal installation.
