 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The DataStage Designer is slow when opening jobs but was quite responsive in the past. Are there any environmental factors that we can check to see what is triggering the slow response time? 

ANSWER
The DataStage Designer utilizes services hosted on WebSphere Application Server to access design time information for jobs from the database server hosting the xmeta repository. 

If the xmeta repository is hosted on a separate server you should ensure that the system is not running close to CPU capacity or is constrained by disk I/O which can occur if the same database server is shared with other applications or is also used to host the Information Analyzer database.
