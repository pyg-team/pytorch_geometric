APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
   information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3
   protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a
   man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via
   a Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE)
   attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of
   encrypted connections, if those connections traverse a network
   to which the attacker has access.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Deployers of IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10   *
   *                  Appliance V2.1 and V2.5                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that     *
   *                      has been referred to as the Padding     *
   *                      Oracle On Downgraded Legacy             *
   *                      Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is    *
   *                      enabled in the WebSphere DataPower      *
   *                      XC10 Appliance versions 2.1 and 2.5.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  IBM recommends that you review your entire  *
   *                  environment to identify areas that enable   *
   *                  the SSLv3 protocol, and take appropriate    *
   *                  mitigation and remediation actions. The     *
   *                  most immediate mitigation action that can   *
   *                  be taken is to disable SSLv3.               *
   *                  To disable SSLv3 for XC10 Version 2.5,      *
   *                  take the following steps:                   *
   *                  1. From the web console, under              *
   *                  Collective-->Settings-->Manage              *
   *                  cryptography standard, specify any of the   *
   *                  following settings: FIPS 140-2, SP800-131a  *
   *                  transition, SP800-131a transition with      *
   *                  TLSv1.2, or SP800-131a strict. Any of       *
   *                  these settings will disable SSLv3.          *
   *                  Appliance client applications must be       *
   *                  configured so that they can support TLSv1   *
   *                  or TLSv1.2 if that is used. The SP800-131a  *
   *                  strict configuration requires TLSv1.2. If   *
   *                  the 2.5 firmware upgrade is applied, or a   *
   *                  later level of firmware is used, it is      *
   *                  also possible to use a TLSv1 setting, in    *
   *                  addition to those already listed.           *
   *                  2. Click Apply changes now. This will       *
   *                  restart the collective, and data in         *
   *                  the cache at the time of the restart will   *
   *                  be lost.                                    *
   *                  3. For Version 2.1, apply the               *
   *                  firmware upgrade. If the appliance is in a  *
   *                  collective, all the appliances in the       *
   *                  collective should be upgraded before        *
   *                  making the configuration change.            *
   *                  4. From the web console, under              *
   *                  Appliance-->Settings-->Security-->Manage    *
   *                  cryptography standard, specify TLSv1.       *
   *                  5. Click Submit TLS Settings. This          *
   *                  operation will restart the collective, and  *
   *                  data in the cache at the time of the        *
   *                  restart will be lost.                       *
   *                  6. If this firmware upgrade is applied,     *
   *                  and the configuration change to run as TLS  *
   *                  only is made, then when upgrading to        *
   *                  Version 2.5 firmware, apply the 2.5         *
   *                  firmware or a later upgrade, so that the    *
   *                  TLS-only configuration                      *
   *                  setting is preserved.                       *
