PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION V5R20 GA level.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED ON V5R19 SP6.
   Additional Closure Information:
   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   CATIA hangs when document contains expert ruleset or rulebase
   while using report generation functionality. There was a loop
   created when user uses GenerateXLMReport method on a document
   with a rulebase in it.
   .
   CORRECTION EXPLANATION:
   The algorithm is modified due to which now CATIA does not hang.
