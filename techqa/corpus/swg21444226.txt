QUESTION
 Is using SiteScope with ITCAM supported? 

ANSWER
ITCAM is not designed to work with other monitoring products on the same JVM. However, specifically in the case of HP's SiteScope product, ITCAM will work with SiteScope as long as these versions are being used:
SiteScope v11 with ITCAM for WAS 6.1 FP5 + IF11 or higher
SiteScope v11 with ITCAM for AD 7.1 FP1 or higher.

This is still not supported software so use at your own risk. We've done some limited testing in our labs with the above versions of SiteScope v11 and ITCAM for AD 7.1 on AIX 6.1. Default customization were used in both products and both products worked successfully with each other.
