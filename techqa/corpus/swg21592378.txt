PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Product fix pack fails while installing a fix pack for the Tivoli Integrated Portal. 

CAUSE
The product installation program requires TIP to be stopped prior to starting the installer, but TIP is left running. A Websphere fix pack installation script detects the TIP instances is running and aborts the installation.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the installation log located in the installation user's home directory. The log will contain the messages: 

2012-04-23 14:29:39.452-04:00 : FINE : PlanStepEventOccurred(Failed target 'step_00004_WASFP') (from com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.COIWrapperPluginImpl.eventOccurred)
2012-04-23 14:29:39.452-04:00 : FINE : COIEventType.ERROR (from com.ibm.ac.coi.ext.ia.COIWrapperPluginImpl.eventOccurred)

Check the WAS update logs located in the <TIP HOME>/logs/update directory. The logs will include messages like: 

CWUPI0032E: 
Running processes have been detected that may interfere with the 
current operation. Before installing or uninstalling maintenance 
package, stop all WebSphere and related processes. Ensure that the 
following processes are not running: 
/netcool/tipv2/java/bin/java 
/netcool/tipv2/java/jre/bin/java 
In order to install a TIP/eWAS fixpack, the server must be stopped 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Some products that are deployed in Tivoli Integrated Portal require that the TIP server process is stopped prior to starting the product fix pack installation program. Consult the product installation documentation to determine if the TIP process must be stopped. If so, retry the installation with the TIP server process stopped.
