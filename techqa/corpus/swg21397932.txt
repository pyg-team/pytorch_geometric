Title: IBM Checking whether a DB2 LUW table was first created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY - United States

Text:
db2look; not logged initially; syscat.tables; log_attribute TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I find out if a table was initially created using the "NOT LOGGED INITIALLY" option?


ANSWER
In DB2 V8.1 the LOG_ATTRIBUTE column in the SYSCAT.TABLES table was used to check if a table was created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY. In DB2 V9.x this column is no longer being used and will always have a value of 0. Instead, you can use the db2look command to get DDL information on the table which would show you if the table was created as "NOT LOGGED INITIALLY"


Example:
db2look -d <database_name> -t <table_name> -e -o <output_file_name.out>
