Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx : ISM  snmp monitor - Internal error (SnmpSync status) - United States

Text:
ISM SNMP monitor 71ISM-CONF; 71ISM-GEN; 71ISM-TS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using ITCAM for Transactions, ISM snmp monitor fails as seen in ITM TEP GUI, 
under "Internet Service Monitors" -> "profile statistics" workspace view. 

SYMPTOM
 Looking at ITM TEP GUI, Under "Internet Service Monitors" -> "profile statistics" workspace view shows the following results :
- Elements : 1
- Good : 0
- Marginal : 0
- Bad : 1

snmp.log file with 'debug' tracing enabled previously in snmp.props property file shows messages like :

Debug: Selecting '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0'
where '1'
Warning: Invalid selector string: '1'
Debug: snmpGetNext: '1' added to pdu
Debug: SnmpLib: snmp_build: unknown failure
Debug: snmpSync: Status Errror:
reason Unknown Error 1919906418 (Unknown error 1696624247), lib 16966 24247 sys 1919906418
Error: Internal error (SnmpSyncstatus)
Warning: '1' does not contain ''
Error: Failed to resolve index selectors


CAUSE
Possible cause is that the OID Group value was setup incorrectly or was invalid, in the ISM snmp monitor settings, while using the ISM GUI configuration tool for example.

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for Tx V7.3
ISM agent
SNMP monitor

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use 'snmpget' or 'snmpwalk' commands or similar, from a system that would have SNMP commands package, against the same OID that was defined in the ISM snmp monitor settings, e.g.
'.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0'
to validate if it's a valid OID that is returning data, or not.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Correct the defined oid group value setting for your ISM SNMP monitor if it was invalid, using the ITM TEP ISM Internet Service Monitoring Configuration.
