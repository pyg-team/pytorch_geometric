ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT:
   
   ITM 6.1 with TEC event synchronization (SUF) installed
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   The SUF running on the TEC server is
   supposed to first try port 3661 and then try 1920.  The problem
   is that
   the SUF cannot currently distinguish the difference between a
   listener
   on 3661 that is an agent, and a listener on 3661 that is a TEMS.
   Thus,
   on a system with both an agent and a TEMS, SSL must be disabled
   for
   everything (both TEMS and agent) before the SUF will try 1920.
   If the
   SSL is only disabled for the TEMS, the agent will still be
   listening on
   3661 and the SUF cannot tell it's an agent.  Thus, the SUF
   breaks.
   
   RECREATION STEPS:
   
   Install a TEMS and another ITM component (such as an agent) on a
   system.  Disable SSL on the TEMS (insert ip.ssl use:n in the
   KDC_FAMILIES or KDE_TRANSPORT variable) but leave it running on
   the agent.  The SUF will have problems connecting to 3661 but
   will not try any other ports.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Situation Update Forwarder does not fail over to non-SSL
   when SSL is disabled on the TEMS.
   
   Additional Information:
   The SUF running on the TEC server is supposed to first try port
   3661 (SSL) and then try 1920 (non-SSL).  The problem is that the
   SUF does not currently distinguish the difference between a
   listener on 3661 that is an agent and a listener on 3661 that is
   a TEMS.  The SUF fail over logic was expecting no response to
   the SSL request.  In this scenario, SSL was disabled on the TEMS
   but not on the agent.  Therefore, when the SUF got a negative
   response to the SSL request it did not attempt to fail over to
   non-SSL.
   
   This APAR is being closed FIN with concurrence from the
   submitting customer. This means that a Solution to this APAR is
   expected to be delivered from IBM in a release(if any) to be
   available within the next 24 months.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  As a workaround, you could disable SSL on all listeners and then
   the SUF would properly fail over to non-SSL.
