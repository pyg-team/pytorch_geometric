WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.0
WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.1 

WebSphere eXtreme Scale 8.5 

WebSphere eXtreme Scale 8.6

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Since MD5 signatures are no longer compatible with Java, installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients and servers that are running with an MD5 certificate. If any WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients or servers are configured with a certificate with an MD5 signature, they must be replaced prior to starting after upgrading to this interim fix. Failing to do so will result in the clients and servers failing to connect to each other. Note that client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.



<Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1 PI62225 Refer to the Version 7.1 table in the Recommended Fixes page for WebSphere eXtreme Scale [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991]. WebSphere eXtreme Scale 7.1.1 8.5 

8.6

PI62255 Refer to the Version 7.1.1, 8.5, or 8.6 table in the Recommended Fixes page for WebSphere eXtreme Scale [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991]. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
No workaround exists. If you are running WebSphere eXtreme Scale standalone, apply the appropriate fix from the previous table. If you are running WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients or servers that are embedded in WebSphere Application Server, apply the appropriate fix for WebSphere Application Server, which is described here: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962931 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962931]
