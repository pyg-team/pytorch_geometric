APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Database Routine transform in a Graphical Data
   Map to call an Oracle Stored Procedure that is returning
   locally relabeled columns in one or more Sys Ref Cursors from
   table joins the column data may not be mapped correctly giving
   unexpected null output element values.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To work with locally relabeled columns the fix must be applied
   and activated via an environment variable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus who use the Mapping node with
   Database Routine transform to call an Oracle Stored Procedure
   that is returning relabelled columns in a sysref cursor.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using the Database Routine transform in a Graphical Data
   Map to call an Oracle Stored Procedure that is returning locally
   relabelled columns in one or more Sys Ref Cursors from table
   joins the column data may not be mapped correctly giving
   unexpected null output element values.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Graphical Data Map Editor is corrected to ensure that the
   order in which the user defines the columns in sysref cursors in
   a Database Routine transform is preserved in the ".map" file.
   
   The Graphical Data Map runtime component now provides an
   environment variable MQSI_MAP_DB_SYSREF_COLPOSINDX which can be
   set to cause the correlation of data columns from Oracle Stored
   Procedure sysref cursors to the mapping transforms in the
   Database Routine Return transform to be made by positional index
   rather than column names.
   
   If MQSI_MAP_DB_SYSREF_COLPOSINDX is set to 'true' this is
   applied for all sys ref cursors. Alternatively it can be set to
   a space separated list of  '<sysref cursor parameter name>:true'
   to only apply the positional correlation to those sysref
   cursors.
   
   To implement the fix the following is required
   1) Apply this APAR to the Integration Toolkit
   2) Review, and possibly re-edit the columns in the sysref cursor
   to ensure all columns returned are preset in the order the
   stored procedure emits them.
   3) Apply this APAR to the Integration Server runtime
   4) Activate the positional correlation mode by setting the
   environment variable MQSI_MAP_DB_SYSREF_COLPOSINDX
