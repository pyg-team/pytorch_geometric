ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   .
   Abstract: VPM-CV5 INTEROP: EACH TIME THE
   GEOMETRY IS OPENED AND SWICTHED TO
   DESIGN MODE ALL THE FILES ARE COPIED TO A
   LOCAL DIRECTORY UNDER CATTemp
   .
   Scenario:
   1) Open a PSN graph
   2) Select some CATParts and load them into CV5
   3) If the work with cache system is checked the
   cgrs are created
   4) Switch to design mode
   5) The files loaded are copied to
   $CATTEMP/SelectiveLoadingCache
   6) Close the window
   7) All the files under
   $CATTEMP/SelectiveLoadingCache are deleted, the
   cgrs remain
   8) If the same Parts are again loaded into CV5 the
   cgrs are used from the cache
   .
   Result:
   But when are switched to design mode the files are
   copied again into local directory.
   With CV4 and the cgr files, the timestamp is used
   to check if it is necesary to reload the files into the
   local directory. Why not with CV5 files?

   THE FILES ARE COPIED TO A LOCAL DIRECTORY

   Restriction Explanation
   The SelectiveLoadingCache is an internal cache
   used to support the selective loading of V5 design
   documents such as CATParts, CATDrawing...
   This means that when you open this document, you
   can load its contained data progessively when the
   data is needed by an application.
   This is the purpose of this cache. It is not meant to
   be a persistent cache, keeping the data after
   document closing.
