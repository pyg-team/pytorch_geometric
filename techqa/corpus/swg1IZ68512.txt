APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Following documentation problems are found in GA version of
   TSAM 7.2 Installation and Administration Guide:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v10r1/index.js
   p?topic=/com.ibm.tsam.doc_7.2/tsam_welcome.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v10r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.tsam.doc_7.2/tsam_welcome.html]
   
   The install of the TSAM management server on was on:
    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 (x86_64)
    VERSION = 10
    PATCHLEVEL = 2
   
   Here is a list of eight issues in the document that need to be
   addressed:
   
   1. On page 47, there is a section called ?Disable /tmp cleanup
   (tmpwatch and anacron)?.  The steps provided are specific to Red
   Hat linux, and we were using SUSE.  Information should be
   provided for both.  For SUSE, the
   ?/etc/cron.daily/suse.de-clean-tmp? file needs to be renamed.
   
   2. On page 48, there is a section called ?Enable the WebSphere
   Application Server SOAP port.?  The steps provided here are
   specific to Red Hat.  Information should be provided for SUSE.
   We executed "chkconfig SuSEfirewall2_setup off" and "chkconfig
   SuSEfirewall2_init off", and also used the GUI (YaST -> Security
   -> Firewall) and disabled it there.
   
   3. On page 48, it is mentioned that swap space should be at
   least twice the amount of memory.  This is not always necessary.
   When running the script to verify operating system requirements
   on the TSAM management server, the following warning is given.
   The installation guide should explain more about the reason for
   this requirement, and state that the warning can most likely be
   ignored.
   
   4. On page 49, there is a list of required packages that must be
   available on the TSAM management server.  There is a pre-install
   step that runs a script to verify that the packages exist, but
   it does not check for the required versions of the packages.
   The TSAM installation guide says doesn't say what documentation
   to check to verify that I have the correct versions of these
   packages.  There needs to be a link to somewhere (another
   document, a technote, etc.) so that the user can verify the
   versions. The current documentation only says:
   
   Note: The script can make only general decisions about whether a
   required package is installed. Successful execution of the
   script does not necessarily mean that the version of an existing
   package is a proper one. This must be verified by the user.
   
   5. On page 60, the steps to install Tivoli SRM are provided.
   When installing FP4, the process may end with a ?serious error?
   (see screen shot below) which can actually be ignored.  The TSAM
   install guide mentions an informational message that can be
   ignored (CTGIN2252I:  Cannot connect to base services web
   application), but it does not mention this ?serious error?.
   
   
   
   Below is a note (from TSAM Test &
   Installation Support in Germany) explaining the issue.  The TSAM
   install guide should be updated to say that the serious error
   can be ignored if the user can log into Maximo and check the
   system information to verify that FP4 has been applied.
   
   Hi,
   
   the problem here is/was, that at the end of the installation of
   SRM FP4, the installer restarts the server and tries to connect
   to verify that the installation succeeded.
   I some cases, the check times out before the server has started
   and presents this error.
   
   I logged on to maximo and checked the installed versions (help
   -> System Information).
   
   
   
   It presents the SRM Service Catalog in version 7.1.0.4.
   This means, that FP4 was applied.
   
   Your system looks good and I suggest to ignore the error panel
   and continue.
   
   Best regards,
   
   
   
   6. On page 64, after installing Tivoli Service Automation
   Manager for WebSphere Application Server, there is a section for
   ?Completing the installation segment?.  This information is
   missing.  The document looks like:
   
   Completing this installation segment:
   1. Verify the installation by ...
   Note: Do not continue until all problems or discrepancies have
   been resolved.
   
   Something needs to be filled in after ?Verify the installation
   by ...?
   
   7. On page 70, step 8 says to shutdown TPM by running tio.sh
   (this is the last step in ?Configuring WebSphere Application
   Server on the TPM server?).  There should be another step listed
   to say to restart TPM.  This must be done prior to executing the
   next section (?Configuring the SSH key?).
   
   8. On page 205, there is a section for ?Configuring and running
   Discovery on a TPM server.?  It says to log on to TPM at:
   
   https://hostname:<port>/tcWebUI (where port is either 9045 or
   9046)
   
   This URL is incorrect.  We found out that TPM 7.2 now uses the
   Maxmio UI. The old TPM URLs are not valid.  The entire TSAM
   installation guide should be reviewed to ensure that the URLs
   are correct as follows:
   
   WAS Console
   https://<hostname>:9043/ibm/console/logon.jsp [https://<hostname>:9043/ibm/console/logon.jsp]
   userid = wasadmin
   
   TSAM User GUI
   https://<hostname>:9443/SimpleSRM/login.jsp [https://<hostname>:9443/SimpleSRM/login.jsp]
   userid = PMRDPCAUSR
   
   TPM GUI
   https://<hostname>:9443/maximo/ui/login [https://<hostname>:9443/maximo/ui/login]
   userid = maxadmin
   
   From the 8 issues described above, issues 1, 6, 7, and 8 have
   already been resolved with TSAM version 7.2.0.1.
   
   This DOC APAR is to address issues 2, 3, 4, and 5.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Administrators during product installation
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: TSAM install documentation in TSAM 7.2
   Installation and Administration Guide is incomplete or
   inconsistent.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Technote 21419433 is available for
   clarification:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419433 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419433]
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  TSAM 7.2 Installation and Administration Guide does not have
   complete installation steps for SUSE Linux platform. Some of the
   documentation was already provided by the 7.2.0.1 version of the
   document. The technote provides some further information.
