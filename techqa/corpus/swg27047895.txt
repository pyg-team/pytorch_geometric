Important 

Updates are required only on Servers and thick client computers. No update is required for "thin client" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. 

Once installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use "Uninstall or change a program" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. 

The language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. 

 

Alerts! 

1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. 

As a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. 

The global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\RRS folder. The application copies are in the application DCO rules folder. 

Customers must manually update the ruleset DLLs in each application where they are installed. 

2) When running an update, the master task configuration files are updated (Datacap\ProgramSet) but the setting in applications are not updated (in application DCO folder). 

As a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience problems that have been fixed. 

The master task configuration is located in Datacap\ProgramSet. The application settings are in the application DCO folder. 

Customers must manually update the task setting in each application where they are installed.

Known limitations in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1 

Read this information to learn about known limitations in IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Feature Pack 1. 

 

 

Component Summary TMWeb Scan Windows 10 supported with IBM Datacap 9.0.1 FP1 with the following known limitations:

1. TMweb's "IE Test" page may result in a dialog box titled “Accusoft Twain Pro7 common 9.0.013” with the message "picdll Load Library failed.”
2. When trying to perform a Web scan with a Physical Scanner connected (via twain drivers) , ie using Web Vscan configured with scancl.aspx, the message "picdll Load Library failed" may be displayed. 

If any of these messages appear, TMWeb scanning will not be possible. Medical Claims When in MClaims Prof Red/Black FixupScan, clicking "Next LC" button will advance to the next page and display the data for it (Type and Status), but will keep the previous page selected as well, and changes to Status (from "Invalid Claim Type" to "New Claim") will not be saved.

Suggested workaround: 
After clicking "Next LC" button, which will show previous page and current page selected in the Batch View display, then click the current page node in the Batch View display to properly select only the current page. After this one can continue to change the page Status and click "Next LC" button and repeat workaround for the next page.
