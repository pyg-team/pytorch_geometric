Title: IBM The Enterprise COBOL SQL CoProcessor gives compiler errors.  The SQL PreProcessor does not give the same errors. - United States

MSGIGYPS0209-W MSGDSNH206I MSGIGYPS0209 IGYPS0209; 1244064 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the user compiles an Enterprise COBOL program with the DB2/SQL PreProcessor, no compiler statements are flagged as in error. 
When he uses the Enterprise COBOL CoProcessor, with the SQL option specified, he gets this and similar errors: 
IGYPS0209-W DSNH206I DSNHANAL STATEMENT REFERENCES COLUMN 
'AAAAA'.'BBBBB''CCCCC', WHICH IS NOT DECLARED IN THE SPECIFIED TABLE(S) 

CAUSE
There are DB2/SQL Precompiler options that relax or enforce the official DB2 standard to varying degrees. 
In this case, the PreProcessor options were set with these overrides: 
// EXEC PGM=DSNHPC,
// PARM='HOST(COBOL),APOSTSQL,SQL(DB2),STDSQL(NO)' 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the COBOL CoProcessor was run with the same overrides: 

 CBL SQL('HOST(COBOL),APOSTSQL,SQL(DB2),STDSQL(NO)') 
the statements were not flagged as errors.


NOTE 1) The DB2/SQL PreProcessor default options are used by the Enterprise COBOL SQL CoProcessor. Informational APAR II13782 lists some options that cannot be overridden when the CoProcessor is used. 

NOTE 2) The options needed to be set for matching or similar results will vary for each customer installation. 

NOTE 3) A list of differences is in the Enterprise COBOL for z/OS Compiler and Runtime Migration Guide GC23-8527 chapter 18 and in Enterprise COBOL for Z/OS Programming Guide SC23-8529 chapter 21.
