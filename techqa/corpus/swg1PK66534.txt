PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0.x will be updated to include information on the
   Oracle JDBC Driver for OCI.
   
   In the Information Center, the "Minimum required settings for
   Oracle" topic will be updated to include the following
   information:
   
   "Oracle JDBC Driver for OCI"
   The Oracle JDBC Driver provides JDBC access to the Oracle
   database that uses the Oracle Call Interface (OCI).
   This JDBC provider:
   -Supports the oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleConnectionPoolDataSource
    one phase data source.
   -Requires the following JDBC driver file:
    ojdbc14.jar. If you require Oracle trace, use ojdbc14_g.jar.
   -Requires the following DataStoreHelper classes:
    com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.OracleDataStoreHelper
    Oracle 10g:
      com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.Oracle10gDataStoreHelper
   -Requires a valid authentication alias.
   -Requires the following properties:
    URL - The URL that indicates the database from which the data
    source obtains connections. For example:
    jdbc:oracle:oci:@<tsname_alias>
   
    You must define <tsname_alias> in the
    ${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file.
   
   For more information on configuring this JDBC provider, refer
   to the information center topic on creating a data source that
   uses the Oracle JDBC Driver for OCI.
   --------------------------
   In the Information Center, the following topic will be added:
   
   "Creating a data source that uses the Oracle JDBC Driver for
   OCI"
   You can use the Oracle JDBC for OCI with Version 6.0.x of the
   Application Server.
   
   To create a data source in Version 6.0.x of the Application
   Server that takes advantage of the Oracle Call Interface
   (OCI), you might want to use the Oracle JDBC OCI driver. This
   JDBC provider can be configured with the Application Server.
   
   1. From the administrative console, create the JDBC provider.
      a. Click Resources > JDBC Providers.
      b. Select the scope for the JDBC Provider. The scope can be
         set to a cell, node, or server level.
      c. Click Apply.
      d. Click New to create the JDBC Provider.
   2. Configure the settings for the JDBC provider.
      a. In the Configuration tab, under General Properties,
         configure the settings for an Oracle JDBC driver.
         i.   In Step 1: Select the database type, select Oracle
              from the list.
         ii.  In Step 2: Select the provider type, select Oracle
              JDBC Driver from the list.
         iii. In Step 3: Select the Implementation type, select
              Connection pool data source or XA data source from
              the list.
         iv.  Click Next.
      b. Enter database class path and native library path
         information.
         Best practice: Application Server variables can be used
         in the class path or the native library path. For
         example, you can use variables like
         ${ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH} and ${ORACLE_HOME} in the
         paths for the class path and native library path, but
         you must define the variables ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH
         and ORACLE_HOME to the Application Server. Define or
         change the paths for these variables in the
         administrative console by clicking Environment > Manage
         WebSphere Variables.
   
         i.   In the class path field, enter the following:
              ${ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH}/ojdbc14.jar
         ii.  In the native library field, enter the following:
              ${ORACLE_HOME}/lib
              where ORACLE_HOME is configured to the location in
              which Oracle Network client is installed.
   
   3. Create the data source in Application Server.
      a. Click Resources > JDBC providers > Oracle JDBC Driver for
         OCI > Data sources > New.
      b. Enter the name for the data source.
      c. Enter the JNDI name for the data source.
      d. Select the name of the data store helper class  that
         corresponds to the type of JDBC provider that you
         configured.
      e. Select Component-managed authentication alias, and enter
         the database specific properties for the data source.
      f. For the URL, enter the URL for the data source. For
         example:
         jdbc:oracle:oci:@<tnsname_alias>
         The value for <tnsname_alias> must be defined in the
         ${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file.
      g. Click OK and save the configuration.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
      http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
      the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere
      Application Server documentation is available in both an
      online version and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version.
      For more information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see
      the following Web site:
      http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the September
   2008 update to the information centers.
