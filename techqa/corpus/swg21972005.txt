Please note that JR55592 was made available for download (but not officially announced in a security bulletin) to address CVE-2014-8912. On BPM V8.0 and later, JR55592 overwrites some of the changes of JR54678 and thus reintroduces CVE-2015-7400. The correct fix for CVE-2014-8912 is JR56078 which supersedes JR55592 as announced in Security Bulletin: Security vulnerability in Business Space affects IBM Business Process Manager and WebSphere Process Server (CVE-2014-8912) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985861]. 

For any version of WebSphere Prcoess Server, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the IBM Business Process Manager Advanced. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
