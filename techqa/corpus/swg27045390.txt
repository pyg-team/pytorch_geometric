"As a follow up to today's "Ask the Experts" session on DAOS, I am starting this topic so that we can gather feedback about the current version 1.8 of the DAOS Estimator tool. Please install it, use it, and share with us your experience with it. Tell us how it works in your environment, and if you can think of any other data/output you might like to see in it."

Q&A 
NOTE: Note that the data written to the NLO file is identical to what WOULD have been written to the NSF file. Any NSF-level encryption/compression/encoding choices are applied before it goes to the NLO. The NLO encryption is in ADDITION to any NSF-level encryption. 


Q1. I already have the DAOS Estimator tool installed on IBM i but I was never able to get it to run. Do you have instructions on how to run it?

Q2. If I need to move the DAOS folder, are there any technotes for this ?

Q3. Can I run the DAOS estimator tool while the IBM i Domino is running or do I have to stop the server? What parameters does it need to run with? 
The server can be up. For example, you can use the command "load daosest -o filename.txt". See the Deployment Guide for more information.

Q4. To confirm - DAOS and Traveler are completely compatible? 
Yes 


Q5. With clustered servers, DAOS can be implemented independently - Correct?  * Yes. Each server has its own DAOS repository and is independent. 
 * Yes. It is server specific. One server can be DAOS enabled and the other not. Or have different settings.



Q6. I'm having trouble understanding how to restore data on DAOS enabled servers. Do all the NLO files have to be individually restored? Or, do backup softwares have the capability?  * At the simplest level, yes...the files need to be restored individually. There are some 3rd party apps that will automate that somewhat. 
 * Depends on the backup software you use. Some like ArcServe and BackupExec understand DAOS and can restore NLOs automatically for you. IBM's TSM cannot so you'd have to restore them manually



Q7. Will DAOS cause any problems with IMAP clients? 
One thing to watch for, you will want to set.. 
 * DAOS_AVOID_MIME=1
 * 

IMAP checks size (to report to client) by pre-formatting the messages and storing them temporarily in an attachment. If this attachment happens to be larger than the DAOS min size...it will get stored in daos and hang around for 30 days or whatever. That INI avoids the problem. 


Q8. Anyone have a link for how to configure Arcserve / Backup exec to restore automatically? 
I can't speak to specific 3rd party apps, you'd have to contact their tech support. One workaround is to have clustered Domino servers and to have one that does NOT have DAOS enabled. Then do normal backup/restore operations from there, and the data will replicate to the other servers. 


Q9. Is it true that the whole DAOS feature makes a positive impact to the performance of the server if that very server has a lot of memory, thus most of the date is stored in DAOS but the rest (like structure of the DBs) is stored in memory? 
Domino tends to be constrained by I/O rather than memory and DAOS certainly helps with I/O overhead. 


Q10. How do set event handlers for DAOS?

Q11. What is the recommended configuration to obey the physical size of a database instead of its logical size? 
As long as the db physical size is < 64GB, it's ok. 


Q12. What tool did he just mention (on the call)? 
I was referring to the command output "Load daosmgr status" - very useful output. For more information, see Using the Lotus Domino Attachment and Object Service Estimator too [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014980]l. 


Q13. If I archive a mail with an attachment stored in the DAOS repository, will the mail stored in the archive still reference the NLO in the DAOS repository? Or does the archive process copies the attachment to the archive?  * If the archive db has daos enabled it will reference the same nlo 
 * If the archive db where the document is being moved to is not daos enabled then the document will contain the actual attachment 


* * * 
Q14. For those of you running DAOS already, how big is your DAOS repository on your largest server? We are hitting resync issues with around 4TB in DAOS - using default size of 64kb 
You should consider increasing the minimum size of attachments to participate to DAOS 

Agreed - if I do that, will it send attachments smaller than the participation size back into the individual mailfiles? 148 folders in the DAOS directory 
You might want then change the participation size. What is the size that you have set for attachments to be in DAOS? 

64KB is the size set for attachments in DAOS, which made sense when we first enabled it shortly after it became available. Understand from the presentation that this is no longer recommended so will revisit  * TOO SMALL!!! 
 * I think that is a little bit low in your setup. I would suggest changing it to 1mb and do a offline resync followed with prune


Agreed! Just checking number of NLOs on our primary mail cluster - over 5 million! Will discuss with our storage team and re-run the estimator tool
