   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Users are unable to install a BAS       *
   *                      TCPDEF for a TCPIPSERVICE definition    *
   *                      while specifying the ATTACHSEC          *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all MASes must be restarted.  Note     *
   *                 that the restarts do not need to occur at    *
   *                 the same time.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   When a user installs a BAS TCPDEF resource for a TCPIPSERVICE
   definition which specifies the ATTACHSEC attribute as either
   VERIFY or LOCAL the install fails with a RESP2 value of 125 401
   for the EXEC CICS CREATE service.  The MSGUSR log for the CICS
   region contains message:
   .
   DFHCA5204 E mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss applid ???????? COIE Command not
   executed. '          VERIFY' keyword is not valid.
   .
   If the definition is installed using the Web User Interface,
   the following messages will be received in the browser:
   .
   EYUVC1231E  'Install' (INSTALL) request failed. Request complete
   for 1 records. (Tableerror, Dataerror)
   .
   EYUVC1272I  Action (INSTALL) failed. Nothing installed (31).
   .
   EYUVC1273I  Action (INSTALL) failed for 'name' (Tcpdef) version
   1, in 'masname'.  Invalid request. (CICS information: RESP(16)
   RESP2(125, 401) EIBFN(3030))
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A logic error in EYU0BNC9 (BNC9), whose job it is to process
   requests relating to the creation of various resources within
   the target CICS, has been changed to correctly set the ATTACHSEC
   value.
