PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why does the IBM Datacap DotEdit Application List dropdown combo box not appear on the initial logon screen? Only shown is an edit box, which requires the typing of the name of the application to be run. There is no dropdown combo box showing the list of applications available to be selected. 

CAUSE
Mismatched versions of DotEdit.exe on the client machine vs. on the TMServer machine.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Running DotEdit.exe on TMServer worked properly. Running DotEdit.exe on a client machine had the problem.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy DotEdit.exe from the TMServer to the client machine, or run the Datacap installer on the client, selecting DotEdit. This was probably caused by a Fix Pack update that was not done on the client machines.
