APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:   Customer is ingesting content to P8 via ICC from
   MS Exchange via an SMTP ICC connection.
   The eml files are added to P8 but the content indexed by CSS
   from the XML file the ICC creates for indexing ....does not
   return the correct hits when the search is for XML.
   
   The issue was initially noticed with eDM searches but now with
   ICC dumps of the xml files the issue can be reproduced in
   searching via P8 FileNet Enterprise Manager.
   
   Search examples:
   1. Returns the expected result.
   
   SELECT d.this, d.Id, vcs.ContentSummary FROM CSS_CBRclass01 d
   INNER
   ContentSearch vcs ON d.This = vcs.QueriedObject
   WHERE CONTAINS (d.*,'"System! ADMIN"')
   
   2. Returns unexpected results:
   
   SELECT d.this, d.Id, vcs.ContentSummary FROM CSS_CBRclass01 d
   INNER
   ContentSearch vcs ON d.This = vcs.QueriedObject
   WHERE CONTAINS(*, '@xmlxp:''//icc_subject[.contains("System\!
   Admin")]''', 'Lucene')
   OPTIONS (FULLTEXTROWLIMIT 501)
   
   When using the latter search of:  WHERE CONTAINS(*,
   '@xmlxp:''//icc_subject[.contains("System\! Admin")]''',
   'Lucene')
   OPTIONS (FULLTEXTROWLIMIT 501) or ("System! Admin")
   return hits where content contains other characters such as a
   hyphen in the string:
     "System!-Admin"

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Content Search Services (CSS) searches were not returning    *
   * the correct results in some cases.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.1.0.0-P8CSS-IF005 or higher.                    *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed Content Search Services (CSS) searches in
   5.1.0.0-P8CSS-IF005 and higher to correctly return the correct
   results where content contains "non-trivial gaps" such as
   sentence breaks.
