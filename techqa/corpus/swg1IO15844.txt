APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a document is imported with the pClient and later
   downloaded with WEBi, then the downloaded file has a duplicated
   file extension (e.g. name.pdf.pdf). A document with file
   extension ".cgm" has a duplicated file extension ".cqm".
   As default WEBi adds .DAT to an unknown file type when
   downloading. This fix removes the .DAT extension for the
   following mime types.
   ".mp4"; ".m4v"; ".png"; ".zip"; ".xps";
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you download documents, the file extension would be
   duplicated if the file name included another period.
   
   The .dat file extension is added documents if IBM WEBi does not
   understand the file extension.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  File extensions are no longer duplicated, and the file extension
    is displayed for all known file types.
   
   The .dat file extension is still added to documents if IBM WEBi
   does not understand the file extension. However, you can
   override this behavior by adding a DO_NOT_USE_DAT_EXT
   environment variable to the web application server where IBM
   WEBi is deployed.
