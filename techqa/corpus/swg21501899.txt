Title: IBM JD Edwards users not recognized when using the Deployment Portal - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 JD Edwards users can use Query with full JD Edwards recognition and without errors. When the queries are saved to the Content Repository and run by JD Edwards users through the Deployment Portal the JD Edwards data dictionary is not applied to their results and queries with UDC fields return 'column not found in datasource' errors. 

SYMPTOM
Data dictionary definitions missing from Query results. UDC fields not recognized and return errors.


CAUSE
Incorrect JDBC driver name and incorrect JDBC driver URL in datasource definition . The customer was using 

JDBC Driver Name: com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver and 
JDBC Driver URL: jdbc:as400://I5ENT03;libraries=cadsvr4;BatchPerformanceWorkaround=TRUE;


ENVIRONMENT
JD Edwards World environment or Enterprise environments not using JDE services.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the pes.log to identify the JDBC driver in use.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Insure the datasource definition specifies the correct ShowCase JDBC driver and URL. Use 

JDBC Driver name com.showcasecorp.jdbc.SCDriver. and 

JDBC Driver URL jdbc:showcasecorp://<system name>:<port number>;translate binary=true 

where <system name> is the system host name from CFGTCP Option. 12 and <port number> is the port number of the ShowCase server library.
