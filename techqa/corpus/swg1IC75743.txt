PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker using the IMSRequest Node.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   IMSConnect Configurable service has a property named
   SSLEncryptionType which the user can set when they want to
   enable SSL for their IMSRequest nodes communication.  The value
   set for SSLEncryptionType decides the cipher suites that the
   SSL handshake will use. The documentation(an60170_) says that in
   order to set SSLEncryptionType to 'strong', the user must alter
   the Java virtual machine (JVM) policy files as suggested below:
   
   +++++++
   To enable Strong encryption, you must alter your Java virtual
   machine (JVM) policy files to refer to unrestricted versions.
   For more information about how to alter your JVM policy files,
   and for policy file downloads, see the developerWorks article
   about Java security.
   ++++++
   
   This is no longer a restriction and needs to be removed from
   the documentation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere Message Broker InfoCenter topic an60170_ has been
   updated to remove the restriction from the documentation.
