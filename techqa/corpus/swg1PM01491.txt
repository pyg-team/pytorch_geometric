ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   ********
   
   Paths of specification files in the makefile are generated witho
   ut quotes.
   
   Description:
   ************
   
   As per the definition of the 'PathWhiteSpaceHandling' property,
   it is expected that the code generation for the makefile takes c
   are of the white spaces in the paths to the various files used i
   n the make file, depending upon the value specified for this pro
   perty. However this does not seem to be the case. While the use
   of the property affects the paths for the implementation and the
    object files in the make file it does not for the specicication
    files.
   
   This many a times results in error on specific environments, due
    to the presence of these white spaces.
   
   Workaround:
   ***********
   
   Manually add quotes to the paths of the specification files or u
   se a post processor script to achieve the same.
