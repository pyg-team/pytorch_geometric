 FIX README

ABSTRACT
 Excel add-ins that connect to another data source by using formulas to create data
must be enabled in IBM速 Cognos速 Disclosure Management XBRL 10.2.1.1 before tagging that data. 

CONTENT
An XBRL user might need to tag data created by resolving formulas through the use of an Excel add-in. For example, they might use Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) formulas as data in an Excel object. To tag this data, these formulas must first be resolved by enabling the HFM Smartview Excel add-in in IBM速 Cognos速 Disclosure Management XBRL. 

To enable add-ins, the user follows this procedure:
1. Open the project that you want to work with.
2. Open and check out the Excel object you want to use for tagging.
3. Click Add-Ins Mode.

The user can now tag any data that is using an add-in formula.
