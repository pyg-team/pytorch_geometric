Title: IBM Content Collector does not detect cluster or other nodes in version 4.0 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In some environment, IBM Content Collector version 4.0 does not detect cluster or other nodes in the cluster. 

SYMPTOM
 

 * During installation of secondary nodes, the cluster name is not displayed in the drop down list. 
 * When running afuClusterTool.exe, not all nodes in the cluster are displayed in the output.


CAUSE
In some environment, multicast may not be working or reliable.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 * Use the following technote to configure ICC cluster:
   SolidDB Setup in an IBM Content Collector cluster [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882791]
   
 * If afuClusterTool -show still does not show expected output, check the following and provide the additional information to IBM support.
   
 * Verify the following registry settings on each node of the cluster:  * SOFTWAR > Wow6432Node > IBM > EMRC > 4.0 > Datastores > ibm.ctms.datastore.soliddb > ConfigurationBackupHost = hostname of the configuration backup host 
    * SOFTWAR > Wow6432Node > IBM > EMRC > 4.0 > Datastores > ibm.ctms.datastore.soliddb > ConfigurationHost = hostname of the configuration host 
    * SOFTWAR > Wow6432Node > IBM > EMRC > 4.0 > ibm.ctms.datastore_monitor > nodes (type: multi-string) = hostname1
      hostname2
      hostname3 
      (multiple entries separated by new lines)
      
   
   
 * In the file ContentCollector\Configuration\afu_install.properties, verify the following: CLUSTER_NAME=name_of_cluster 
   
   The cluster name should be the same on all nodes.
   
   
   
 * In the file ContentCollector\ctms\DataStoreMonitor.reg, verify that you have: scopes=name_of_cluster 
   
   config-host=hostname_of_the_configuration_host 
   
   config-backup-host= hostname_of_the_configuration_backup_host 
   
   icc-nodes=hostname1\2Chostname2\2Chostname3
   
   


 * In the file ContentCollector\ctms\DataStoreMonitor.cfg, verify that net.slp.useScopes = name_of_cluster
