 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 If you encounter a problem with InfoSphere® Workload Replay, the Guardium® appliance, or with Guardium S-TAP® for Linux, UNIX, and Windows, you can use must_gather commands to collect diagnostic information that you can send to IBM Software Support to help troubleshoot the product. 

CONTENT
To collect and download MustGather information for InfoSphere Workload Replay:


 1. Access the command-line interface (CLI) on the Guardium appliance on which InfoSphere Workload Replay is installed. The CLI is available locally on the InfoSphere Workload Replay server or remotely through telnet/SSH by using port 22. 
 2. Log in as the cli user. 
 3. Create the MustGather results file.  1. At the CLI prompt, enter the following MustGather command: 
        support must_gather oqcr_issues
        A compressed oqcr.datestamp.tgz file is created. 
        Example: oqcr.20131203.tgz
        The file includes various logs, such as the web server log, the capture manager log, and the global log. The file also contains Java dumps and other types of diagnostic information that is useful when troubleshooting. 
     2. Verify that the following message is returned before continuing:
        Created file /var/log/guard/must_gather/oqcr_logs/oqcr.datestamp.tgz
    
    
 4. Download the MustGather results file to a local computer.  1. Start the file server by entering the following command from the command-line interface:
        fileserver
        Attention: While the file server is running, InfoSphere Guardium logs and other product-specific files are available on the InfoSphere Guardium server without any requirement to log in. Turn off the file server as soon as you are done downloading your files. 
     2. Open a web browser on the computer to which you want to download the MustGather results file, and open the following URL:
        http://guardium_hostname_or_ip
        Where guardium_hostname_or_ip is the host name or IP address of the InfoSphere Guardium appliance computer on which you installed InfoSphere Capture Replay.
        Note: Use http. Do not use https. 
     3. From the landing page, navigate to the /must_gather/oqcr_logs/ directory. 
     4. Download the compressed oqcr.datestamp.tgz file. 
        Example: oqcr.20131203.tgz 
     5. When the download is complete, from the command-line interface, press Enter to stop the file server.
        Tip: By default, the file server automatically stops after 600 seconds. To set the file server time-out, enter the following command from the command-line interface:
        store timeout fileserver_session n
        where n is the number of seconds in the range of 60-1200 after which the file server stops. To see the currently set file server time-out value, enter the following command:
        show timeout fileserver_session
