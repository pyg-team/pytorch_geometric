ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Entry Templates/Add Wizard and Searches do not display the
   entire multi-value property when a choice list is attached to
   that property. However,a single-value string property value is
   displayed in its entierty.
   
   Is there a workaround? Yes and No.  In a search, users can
   select the field and then use the arrow keys to read to the end
   of the value. During an add process, users cannot scroll down to
   the end of the value to see what they are selecting is the
   correct value.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   Requires XT 1.1.4.2
   1_. Create a choice list with more than 50 long value items.
   2_. Attach the choice list to a Multi-Value property with a
   length of 254 and to a doc class.
   3_. Ensure that your Workplace XT system has the fresh changes
   to CE and then log into Workplace XT.
   4_. Add a document using the doc class with the choice list
   above. Note the issue is here with the end of the longer values
   in the CVL being obscured.
   5_. Complete adding the document (content or no content).
   6_. Go to Advance Search and select your doc class or just the
   property that the CVL is associated with. Note the issue is
   here, too.
   
   Actual Results: Users cannot read the longer values of the
   choice list.
   
   Expected Results: Users should be able to read the values of the
   choice list before selecting.
