ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description of Problem:
   In Rational DOORS Next Generation, the permalink of a view does
   not display the view correctly in IE or Chrome browser.  The
   problem is seen when clicking on the link in an email or by
   copying the link and pasting it in the browser address bar. It
   works in Firefox, but not in IE 11 or Chrome.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Using IE or Chrome browser, click on a folder to view some
   artifacts.
   2. Click on the Views tab on the left hand side
   3. Click on the pencil icon next to a view
   4. Select Show Permalink and copy the URL.
   5. Open IE or Chrome and paste this into its address bar
   
   IMPORTANT: This works in IE or Chrome if you have already logged
   in to DNG in that browser in a current session. So, to reproduce
   this, make sure to paste the URL into a fresh session of IE or
   Chrome where it will be forced to ask you to log in.
   
   Expected Results:
   The view should have displayed properly.
   
   Actual Results:
   Shows a mostly blank screen.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround for this is to do the following:
   1. When the issue occurs (i.e., view is not displayed), click
   the Browse Artifacts option from the Artifacts menu at the top
   of the window.
   2. Paste the view link into the browser url area and press
   enter.
   3. Then execute the browser refresh/reload page option.
