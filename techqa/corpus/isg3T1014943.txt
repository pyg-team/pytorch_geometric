PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why can't LIM restart after I edited the hosts file with IP forwarding option on? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


The IP forwarding option is on. I edited the hosts file and tried to restart the LIM. This is the error message I got :

[lsfadmin@acsrocks1 conf]$ lsadmin limrestart all

Checking configuration files ...
No errors found.
ls_gethostinfo: Failed in sending/receiving a message: Permission denied
Operation aborted

With the original hosts file, I can restart LIM. But after I modify it, I get the error message above. 

Problem identified: the user put a wrong ip address for the external interface on the master node, so that the packet are routed to external network.
