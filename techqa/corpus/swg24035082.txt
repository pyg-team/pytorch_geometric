 * Use IBM PureApplication System or IBM Workload Deployer to import and deploy the provided patterns:  * License server shared service (based on Rational License Key Server)
    * Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management virtual system pattern
    * Rational Application Developer virtual system pattern
   
   
 * The license server shared service pattern must be deployed in the same cloud group as the application patterns that use it. Deploy the license server shared server first. Subsequent application deployments locate the shared service automatically.

Impact Assessment Impact Description Recommended This is the first release of IBM Software Delivery and Lifecycle Patterns. KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS
 Note the following issues.






 * Rational License Key Server
 *  Problem: Rational License Key Server is run as the root user on Linux and UNIX. When it starts, you get a message in the log /opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/logs/lmgrd.log observing that the license server manager (lmgrd) is running as root, which is "a potential security problem and not recommended." Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue. The server cannot be run as a non-root user. The issue may be resolved in a future release of Rational License Key Server. 
 * Rational License Key Server
 *  Problem: when starting the server, the following error entries may appear in the log /opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/logs/lmgrd.log> 
   (lmgrd) license daemon: execute process failed: 
             (/opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/bin/telelogic) -T fit-ipasvm-115 11.10 3 
             -c /opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/config/tokenStarterPack.dat
   (lmgrd) license daemon: system error code: No such file or directory
   (lmgrd) telelogic exited with status 45 (Child cannot exec requested server)
   (lmgrd) Please correct problem and restart daemons
   (lmgrd) license daemon: execute process failed: 
             (/opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/bin/rational) -T fit-ipasvm-115 11.10 3 
             -c /opt/IBM/RationalRLKS/config/tokenStarterPack.dat
   (lmgrd) license daemon: system error code: No such file or directory
   (lmgrd) rational exited with status 45 (Child cannot exec requested server)
   (lmgrd) Please correct problem and restart daemon
   
   
   Workaround: Ignore the log entries. The license server supports both new and legacy license file types. These messages indicate that you are using a new license file type. 
 * Rational Application Developer  * Problem: When configuring a Project area connection, if you allow Rational Team the Concert client to save your credentials, (Remember my password option), RTC hangs after asking for the master password. It attempats to setup password recover but never completes. 
    *  Workaround: use any of the following workarounds.  * Uncheck Remember my password when you are prompted for credentials.
       * If you check Remember my password, you are prompted to enter a master password. Enter one. When you are prompted to specify a recover profile, click No. The recovery profile consists of additional security questions and answers.
       * Disable Secure Storage before creating a repository connection in the Rational Team Concert Client. Go to Window > Preferences, then navigate to General > Security > Secure Storage. Clear the UI Prompt check box. Click Apply, then OK to save the preference.

To save time, know the answers to these questions: 

 * What software versions were you running when the problem occurred? 
 * Do you have logs, traces, or messages that are related to the problem? 
 * Can you reproduce the problem? If so, what steps do you take to reproduce it?
