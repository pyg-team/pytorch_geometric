ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I'm installing another Linux box with CCMDB / CDT function, I
   discover the Linux with config files => /etc/hosts, change the
   content of /etc/hosts, then scan again, I see nothing when I
   right-click the Linux box and select "Change History", If I
   save each scan into different versions, then I can see changes
   between each version, this means it can capture its latest
   content, but why can't I see the change in current version, do
   you know why ??
   
   
   
   The problem has to do with how we choose the default date for
   the change history.
   
   Recreate steps:
   
   1) added a config file (/etc/hosts) to the CollationProcesses
   custom server template
   
   2) ran discovery
   
   3) changed /etc/hosts
   
   4) ran discovery
   
   5) right click on one of the CollationProcesses and chose
   "change history"
   
   6) clicked on run report - no change shows up
   
   7) look at the dates for the change history. notice that the
   DEFAULT date range is from about a week ago until the time the
   UI was launched! This is not a bug, but its certainly not
   intuitive.
   
   8) When I changed the end date to one that was AFTER the last
   discovery run, the correct changes are shown. BTW, the way we
   show changes to config files is poorly layed out.
   
   
   
   CMVC defects 8111, 8110, and 8116 have been opened for aspects
   of all this.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Of course, the workaround is just to restart the UI which
   re-sets the default date.
   
   This APAR is scheduled for FP1, due January 2007.

   When we bring up the change history report gui, we now
   set the to time to be current instead of the gui launch time.
