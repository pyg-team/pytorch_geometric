Title: IBM Adapters not showing up when logging into Atlas Extensions - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After logging into Atlas Extensions, the adapters (HRLoader, MatterLoad, OULoader) are not listed. 

CAUSE
Incorrect syntax in the atlas-quartz-jobs.xml and/or atlas-quartz.properties file(s), or application server temp file issues.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you've customized the <atlas install location./properties/atlas-quartz-jobs.xml and/or atlas-quartz.properties file(s), this situation is possible. Typically, the only customizations that should be necessary in these files is modifying CRON expressions in the atlas-quartz-jobs.xml file. After any changes are undone to these files, a restart of the AtlasExtensions application is necessary.

If you are certain that these files do not have any customization issues, or you have returned these files to their default settings and the issue persists, you will need to empty your Application Server's temporary directories.

Clear the application server cache by removing directories that are contained in the AtlasSuite profile (or domain) and the AtlasReports profile (or domain).

The directories to remove depend on the type of application server that you have.

IBM WebSphereÂ® Application Server
Remove the following directories:

- temp
- wstemp

Oracle WebLogic Server
Remove the following directories:

- cache
- temp

JBoss Application Server and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
Remove the following directories:

- tmp
- work\jboss.web\localhost

Once these steps have been completed, restart AtlasExtensions. The adapters should appear as expected.
