APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: When we open any existing key database files
   (key.p12, trust.p12,
   DummyServerTrustFile.jks or DummyServerKeyFile.jks) and import
   certs
   into these files and then save them (using "save as" option) as
   same
   file name and password, we are getting the attached error. Once
   you
   click ok or cancel and close the ikeyman tool and go to the
   location
   where the key database file needs to be there, we see nothing.
   the key
   database file is getting deleted. This was not the case with the
   same
   servers almost a month back when we were on WebSphere 7.0.0.19
   patch.
   We recently updated our patch version to 7.0.0.25. The same
   error is
   happening on our ESB servers as well.
   We have verified the same action on one of other WAS server
   which is at
   7.0.0.11 patch level, we don't have this issue. We have used the
   same
   key database files on both the servers to verify the issue. We
   are
   getting error on WAS server with 7.0.0.25 patch level whereas we
   have
   no issues on WAS server at 7.0.0.11 patch level. We are also
   sure that
   this was not an issue when we were at patch 7.0.0.19.
   In the attached file you will find OS version, ikayman version,
   ESB
   version, WAS version, Java version along with the error
   description.
