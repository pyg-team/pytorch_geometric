   01.The DebugSessionHandler logs error messages whenever there
      is a failed attempt to connect to DBM. In some cases, DBM
      will not be running and, as a result, there can be several
      error messages logged.
   02.Rational Developer for System z Integrated Debugger has a
      coexistence issue with IBM Debug Tool due to shared TD
      queues.
   03.Definition of new security profiles which are required for
      the Integrated Debugger. AQE.AUTHDEBUG.STDPGM
      AQE.AUTHDEBUG.AUTHPGM Sample jobs FEKRACF and AQERACF are
      updated, so is the host configuration utility.
   04.Service to Developer for System z (RDz) AQED3XXT LE user
      exit to remain compatible with IBM Debug Tool 13.1 APAR
      PI16543 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI16543].
   05.Rational Developer for System z (RDz) Integrated Debugger
      started task DBGMGR no longer uses the SVC startup argument
   06.Session state from the first debug session was not cleaned
      up properly, leading to failures in subsequent runs
   07.The Integrated Debugger could not correct retrieve and
      display the source while debugging when compile options that
      affect the listing were specified via SYSIN.
   08.The compiler option Language(UE) was not supported by the
      Integrated Debugger.
   09.The Integrated Debugger technique used to get control of
      applications at certain locations (breakpoints) involves
      inserting illegal instructions into the application. This
      causes the application to abend in cases where a single
      instance of the application (address space) is being used
      simultaneously by multiple users.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Instead of logging these messages as errors, they should be
      logged as informationals.
   02.Rational Developer for System z Integrated Debugger is
      updated to use other TD queues CIBM, IBMDBGIN -> AQED,
      AQEDBGDS CIGZ, IGZDBGIN -> AQEM, AQEDBGM
   03.Definition of new security profiles which are required for
      the Integrated Debugger.
   04.Service to Developer for System z (RDz) AQED3XXT LE user
      exit to remain compatible with IBM Debug Tool 13.1 APAR
      PI16543 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI16543].
   05.DBGMGR started task no longer uses SVC startup argument
   06.Fix made to debugger cleanup routines
   07.The Integrated Debugger was modified to support specifying
      listing options via SYSIN
   08.Support for Language(UE) was added to the Integrated
      Debugger.
   09.The Integrated Debugger has been modified to handle
      debugging multi-user CICS regions.
