CAUSE
This happens to audit event that was created for a document that uses marking sets and the marking set has a user assigned but no longer existed.

 2. Create a test document class, add a property with marking and assign the marking set previously created.
    
    
 3. Enable the Update event to record Original and Modified object for the above document class.
    
    
 4. Create a document using the above document class.
    
    
 5. Remove the user that was assigned to the marking set from the directory server.
    
    
 6. Update the document's properties to trigger an update event.
    
    
 7. Go to Workplace XT and search for the document and attempt to view the update event history.
    
    
    IMPACT: End users unable to view audit event

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply Content Engine Client Test-Fix CE 4.5.1.4-P8CE-ALL-TF020 (on top of Workplace XT). This test fix is compatible with CE 4.5.1-004. To obtain the test-fix, open a PMR with FileNet support team. 

The fix will also be in future CE 4.5.1 Fix Pack 8.

This fix updates the Workplace XT Jace.jar and Javaapi.jar files.
