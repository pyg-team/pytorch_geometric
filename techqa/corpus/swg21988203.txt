QUESTION
 Does Modeler support TLS 1.2? 

ANSWER
Modeler 18.0 Fix Pack 1 supports TLS 1.2 for connecting from the Modeler client to the Modeler Server and also for connecting to a C&DS application server configured to use TLS 1.2. Prior to Modeler 18.0 Fix Pack 1, TLS 1.2 was not supported. 

However, Modeler 17.0 and higher does support TLS 1.1 for connections between Modeler client and Modeler Server. But not TLS 1.1 between Modeler client and C&DS with TLS 1.1 enabled. 

In order to specifically enable TLS 1.1 connections within Modeler client, you need to launch the Modeler client along with the following Java parameter 

"C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\17\bin\modelerclient.exe"
-J-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultProtocol=TLSv11

You can either do this from a command prompt, or update the Windows shortcut for Modeler client to contain that additional parameter: -J-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultProtocol=TLSv11
