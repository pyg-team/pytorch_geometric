APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Federated repositories do not support a z/OS LDAP
   server with an SDBM backend (RACF). Only a StandAlone repository
   supports z/OS LDAP SDBM.
   
   The infoCenter should be updated to reflect this restriction.
   
   Here are the relevant topics in the information center where
   it should be mentioned that LDAP with z/OS SDBM is only
   supported for a StandAlone registry and not Federated
   Repositories.
   
   -"Using a single built-in, file-based repository in a new
   configuration under Federated repositories"
   (twim_filebased_unconfig)
   And
   - "Federated repositories" (cwim_fedrepos) - contains a table
   discussing the differences between federated repositories and
   other user registry implementations.
   
   If you try to configure a Federated Repository with a z/OS
   LDAP SDBM server, the administrative console reports that the
   primary administrative userid does not exist in the
   repository. In the job outputs, the following error is seen:
   
   <cut>

   Here, the primary administrative userid provided was:

   The LDAP log will show the following messages:

   If one tries to configure a federated repository with a z/OS
   LDAP SDBM server, the administrative console reports that the
   primary administrative userid does not exist in the repository.
   The restriction that WebSphere Application Server federated
   repositories DO NOT support a z/OS LDAP server with an SDBM
   backend (resource access control facility (RACF))is not
   documented in the information center.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  APAR PK40324 requires changes to documentation.
   
   NOTE: Periodically, we refresh the documentation on our
   Web site, so the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line
   documentation, go to the product library page at:
   
   
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   
   The information center topic, Federated repositories, will
   include the restriction:
   WebSphere Application Server federated repositories DO NOT
   support a z/OS LDAP server with an SDBM backend (resource
   access control facility (RACF)).
   
   The information center topic, Using a single built-in,
   include the restriction:
   WebSphere Application Server federated repositories DO NOT
   support a z/OS LDAP server with an SDBM backend (resource
   access control facility (RACF)).
   
   The information center topic, Using a single built-in,
   file-based repository in a new configuration under Federated
   repositories, will include the restriction:
   WebSphere Application Server federated repositories DO NOT
   support a z/OS LDAP server with an SDBM backend (resource
   access control facility (RACF)).
