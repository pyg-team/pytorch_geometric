Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Sweet32 vulnerability that impacts Triple DES cipher affects Communications Server for Data Center Deployment, Communications Server for AIX, Linux, Linux on System z, and Windows (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Sweet32 exposes a problem in the Triple DES algothorim for sessions that receive more than 2 GBytes of data on an encrypted session. Once beyond that amount of data, the algorithm allows for a
intrusion that can be more easily decrypted. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

For previous versions of Communications Server for AIX, V6.3, we recommend you upgrade to Communications Server for Data Center Deployment, V7.

For previous versions of Communications Server for Linux, V6.2, we recommend you upgrade to Communications Server for Data Center Deployment, V7.

For previous versions of Communications Server for Linux on System z, V6.2, we recommend you upgrade to Communications Server for Data Center Deployment, V7.

For previous versions of Communications Server for Windows, V6.1.2, we recommend you upgrade to Communications Server for Windows, V6.4.

Once this fix is applied, if the secure socket connection supporting the TN3270 session receives more than 2 GBytes, the session will be disconnected with an error code:

Example: On a CS Linux server, there error message will look like this:

O/S send call failed with error code 0x01bd.

Where the 0x01bd is a hex 445, which is GSK error: GSK_ERROR_BYTECOUNT_EXHAUSTED

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For Communications Server for Data Center Deployment, V7, Communications Server for AIX, V6.4, Communications Server for Linux V6.4, Communications Server for Linux on System z, V6.4, Communications Server for Windows, V6.4, and Communications Server for Windows, V6.1.3 you can mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the amount of data on a TN3270 SSL session to no more than 2 GBytes. TN3270 sessions normally do not stay active long enough have this amount of data received on a socket session. If a secure session could be active for months at a time or the session is used to do file transfers, then upgrade the product with this APAR fix.
