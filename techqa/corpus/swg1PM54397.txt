APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This issue can be seen when using a WebSphere Transformation
   Extender map for converting data from one data language to
   another, and that map is running under WebSphere Message Broker.
   
   When the message domain on the output card is set to XMLNSC, the
   data between the tags can be in the wrong encoding.
   
   The tags themselves seem to be unaffected.
   
   When the message domain for the output card is set to BLOB it
   works fine.
