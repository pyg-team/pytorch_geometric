Title: IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) cannot create any new tasks because the disk space is full - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Business Process Manager cannot add any new rows because there is no more physical disk space on the database server. 

CAUSE
The disk space on the database server is full. There is no more space to write now rows. Each database vendor has different error stacks. The following text are some examples of error messages that you might see in the SystemOut.log file: 

 * IBM DB2
   Caused by: com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException: DB2 SQL Error:
   SQLCODE=-289, SQLSTATE=57011, SQLERRMC=USERSPACE1, DRIVER=4.12.55
   
   
 * Microsoft SQL Server -
   Disk space full and transaction log file could not write any more data.
   00000022 wle E CWLLG2068E: An unexpected exception occurred during an attempt to generate the next primary key. Error: com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksRuntimeException: The transaction log for database 'twProcessDB' is full. To find out why space in the log cannot be reused, see the log_reuse_wait_desc column in sys.databases

   at com.lombardisoftware.server.ejb.pk.PKGeneratorCore$1.call(PKGeneratorCore.java:89)

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the free disk space on database server.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow one or more of these possible solutions to resolve the issue: 

 * Based on the operating system, determine whether you can remove temporary or trash files on the server to free up space.
   
   
 * If IBM Business Process Manager is installed on same server, check for large files using diagnostic traces or heap dumps. For example, look at the [BPM_install]\profiles\[profile_name]\logs files. By default, when IBM Business Process Manager experiences an out-of-memory (OOM) Javaâ„¢ core, heap dump files are saved. The collective total amount of consumed space per crash can be 5 GB or more.
   
   
 * You can increase the transaction log file size. See the following database documents:  * For an IBM DB2 database, see Fixing an "SQL0964C Transaction log for database is full" error [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21121437] 
    * For a Microsoft SQL database, see Increase the Size of a Database [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175890.aspx]. 
      
      
   
   
 * Contact your system administrator to add more disk space to the server.
   
   
 * Ensure that the server has enough disk space to grow with the IBM Business Process Manager application and any other applications that use the database.
