APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSNWLI2 EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   The DSNWLI2 DB2 module is the IFI interface module.
   The error indicates an application loading dsnwli2 more than 32k
   times
   TCT task is closing its plan after an interval of inactivity,
   then reopening it when it needs to update a book not releasing
   the DSNALI program properly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of InfoSphere CDC for z/OS acting as a *
   *                 subscription target, with subscription       *
   *                 sources not on z/OS systems.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Address Space Content management logic  *
   *                      in InfoSphere CDC for z/OS attempts to  *
   *                      manage the DSNALI module (DB2           *
   *                      high-level language interface) as it is *
   *                      used by user exits.  When acting as a   *
   *                      subscription target, if the             *
   *                      subscription source is not on a z/OS    *
   *                      system, it is possible that the source  *
   *                      will send requests for bookmark         *
   *                      back-reporting to the target at         *
   *                      intervals which cause the DB2 plan in   *
   *                      use by the target to be re-opened and   *
   *                      then closed again.  Each closing of the *
   *                      plan produces a mis-accounting of the   *
   *                      number of times the DSNALI module has   *
   *                      been loaded, and eventually z/OS        *
   *                      message CSV002I is issued.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The DSNALI module is not being removed from the address space,
   and eventually its load count exceeds 32767.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Logic to account for and DELETE the DSNALI module during closing
   of DB2 plans has been corrected.
