APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Right-align table window ALN column content.
   
   In a user defined table window, we have an ALN column that we
   would like to align right in order to line up better with
   another table window below that contains numeric content.
   However, the label appears to follow the data type rather than
   the value in the align tag.  e.g. in the below table column
   definition, the mm/dd value is correctly right-justified, but
   the label is left-justified which looks awful and is visually
   distracting causing the appearance of misalignment of columns.
   
   <tablecol dataattribute="FP_DAY1_DATE" id="ae1313612698624b"
   inputmode=" READONLY" label="" width="68" align="right"  />
   
   STEPS TO REPLICATE:
   
   Try to right-align STATUS of WOTRACK in the list tab and you
   should see the same issue where the content shifts right but
   the label does not.
   
   <tablecol dataattribute="status"
   id="results_showlist_tablebody_6"
   linkedcontrolid="qbe_s1_sr1_sc2_s2_tb1" align="right"/>
