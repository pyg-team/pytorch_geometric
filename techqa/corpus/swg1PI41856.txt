APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting in 6.1.0.4, plugin steps are failed if the agent does
   not send an acknowledgement that the server's request for a step
   was received within a specified time frame (default is 30
   seconds). When these plugin steps fail, the dialogue related to
   them is not cleaned up properly, which causes the
   var/sa/dialogue directory on the server to fill up with entries.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If there are too many entries in the var/sa/dialogue directory,
   you can:
   1. Make sure that there are no processes or version imports
   running. (Consider using maintenance mode to allow currently
   running processes to finish without allowing new processes to be
   started.)
   2. Stop the server.
   3. Delete all entries in the var/sa/dialogues directory.
   4. Start the server.
   
   Do not attempt to delete dialogue files while processes are in
   progress.
