PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are running CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) and receive messages about invalid structure size. You want to know if there is a way to determine if the logstream is built large enough to accommodate a particular VSAM file for CICS VR. 

SYMPTOM
IEF196I [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.ieam800/iea2m8c119.htm] Invalid structure size RC0C RSN02010C08 No suitable coupling facility found in preference list.

CAUSE
The structure size specified for the CFRM policy is insufficient for the CICS VR logstream.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Coupling facility (CF) policy parameters for logstream structures vary, depending on each operational environment. CICS VR is generally intended for recovery of CICS VSAM files. It uses CICS definitions for VSAM recovery logstreams and CICS structure of logstream blocks.

A general recommendation is to use INITSIZE(10000) and SIZE(16000).

You can check the structure size for the CFRM policy with the command:
DISPLAY XCF,STR,STRNM=LOG_CICSVR

The POLICY SIZE string in the answer will display the defined SIZE for the structure. If the size is too small, change it to SIZE(16000), or a suitable size, with the IXCMIAPU program.

For additional guidance and more precise values, see Sizing log streams [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/dfha13b.html] in the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) information center.

The CFSizer [http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/z/cfsizer/] tool can also help you calculate the structure sizes.
