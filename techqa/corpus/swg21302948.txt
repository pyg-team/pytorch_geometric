PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are migrating your WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) and are experiencing a problem. 

This mustgather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on z/OS.
Return to the WebSphere Message Broker MustGather index [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Review the WebSphere Technical Exchange for your version: Webcast replay: Migrating to IBM Integration Bus v9.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038933]
    Webcast replay: Migrating to WebSphere Message Broker V8 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024453]
    Webcast replay: Migrating to WebSphere Message Broker V7 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27017865]

STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1.  General Broker information  * Record the operating system version, release, and maintenance level.</li>
     * Record the version, release, and maintenance level of any related products and components for the problematic application.
     * Collect the Standard Error logs.
       WMB writes information to the JOBLOG on z/OS. See: z/OS broker job logs [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14165_.htm]
       
       
     * Optional (MustGather) data
       Dumps
       See: [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an04350_.htm]Using the Dump command on z/OS 
    
    
    
 2. mqsimigratecomponents (BIPMGCMP) job
    If you used BIPMGCMP 'mqsimigratecomponents job', please send in the output of the job from the time of the failing migration. You can use the same command, post migration, to check or verify the current components. See: mqsimigratecomponents command [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fan26150_.htm]
    
    



ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem

STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
