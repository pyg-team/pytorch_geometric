 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The environment was restored from a backup. 
All features are working well, excepte the searches are not returning any documents in ICN. There are error messages in the logs like the following.

SystemOut O CIWEB Error: [*******(unknown) @ *********] com.ibm.ecm.struts.actions.BaseActionHandlerImpl.executeAction()
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com/filenet/api/collection/PageIterator.getTotalCount()Ljava/lang/Integer;
at com.ibm.ecm.util.p8.P8PagingIterator.getTotalCount(P8PagingIterator.java:69) 

ENVIRONMENT
ICN Version 2.0.3 â€“ Build ICN203.800.411 

CPE 5.2.1 patch level - P8 Content Platform Engine 5.2.1.0 / Content Engine Build dap521.234
Database version - Oracle 11.2
WAS Version - IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment/ Version 8.5.5.7


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the Ping pages from FileNet Content Manager server and Content Navigator server. 


http://cpeservername:9080/FileNet/Engine [http://cpeservername:9080/FileNet/Engine]
http://host_name:port_number/context_root/Ping [http://host_name:port_number/context_root/Ping] 

 

FileNet Content Manager is running with CE build is dap521.000.001.002, which matches CE Client Build 5.2.1 (dap521.000.001.002). 

Content Navigator server is running with CE Client 5.1.0 dap501.153. 

 

The CE client build doesn't match with CE server.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As this environment was restored from backup, for some reason, the Jace.jar was not properly backup/restored. Obtain the proper Jace.jar from FileNet Content Manager server, and replace the original Jace.jar on Content Navigator server. 

Make sure to restart Content Navigator server to use the new Jace.jar. 

It can be double checked to run ICN Ping page again.
