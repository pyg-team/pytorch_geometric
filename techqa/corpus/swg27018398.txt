CONTENT
The purpose of this document is to describe the integration between IBM Rational Rhapsody and Neutrino QNX. 

The document explains the concepts used in setting up the integration and provides step by step guidance in performing installation of QNX on VMWare as host, installing the adapters to rebuild IBM Rational Rhapsody framework followed with a small “Hello World” example.

Adapters are a set of .cpp/.h files which implements the system call specific to the environment along with the makefile required to build the IBM Rational Rhapsody framework.

This document also explains how to install QNX on a VMWare image if you do not have a Target.
