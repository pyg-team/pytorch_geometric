Title: IBM ClearCase MultiSite synchronization gets blocked for Feature Level 6 VOB families if one site upgrades to 8.0 (versions 8.0 through 8.0.0.3). - United States

Text:
multisite; import; alert; flash; Cannot read header of packet; syncreplica; sync; feature level 6; fl6; RATLC01540827; PM71680 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to synchronize a packet between a 8.0.0.x VOB server and a 7.1.2.x VOB server (either direction) where the VOB family feature level is 6 results in the warning "Cannot read header of packet" and the import fails. 

SYMPTOM
A ClearCase 8.0.0 VOB server that is hosting a Feature Level 6 VOB replica is unable to import packets for that replica generated on a 7.1.2 VOB server, and generates export packets from that replica that are not readable (can not be imported) by a 7.1.2 VOB server. 

Packet imports fail with warning message:

multitool: Warning: Cannot read header of packet
/opt/rational/clearcase/shipping/ms_ship/incoming/sync_abc_2012-08-
23T095226+0200_2316: Invalid argument

CAUSE
Defect APAR PM71680 [www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71680] has been opened to address this issue.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This defect is resolved in Rational ClearCase version 8.0.0.4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033363]. 

Notes: 

 * VOB Feature Level 6 was introduced with IBM Rational ClearCase 7.1.2.2. See About feature levels and ClearCase [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21119269] for further details. 
 * If you have your VOBs at Feature Level 6 and are considering an upgrade to ClearCase 8.0 on a server, you should install at least version 8.0.0.4.
