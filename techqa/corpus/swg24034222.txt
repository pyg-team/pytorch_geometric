ABSTRACT
 Secure your IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation applications using IBM Security Access Manager for single sign-on using HTTP header, LTPA token, or OAuth and risk-based access(RBA) 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This integration enables single sign-on (SSO) from IBM Security Access Manager for Web to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation (previously known as IBM Worklight) using LTPA token, HTTP header, or OAuth for authentication. In addition, context-based access (CBA) and risk-based access (RBA) is provided using IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile.


The JavaScript and HTML of the IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation mobile application must be configured to respond to an authentication challenge from WebSEAL or Web Gateway Appliance by providing valid IBM Security Access Manager credentials or OAuth tokens. 
When using CBA and RBA, the IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation mobile application must be configured to handle a step-up authentication using one time password (OTP), which can be displayed in a web view or built in to the mobile application.

The integration package includes sample applications and adapter to validate successful HTTP header or LTPA token integration, single sign-on to backend data sources using Worklight Adapters, OAuth authentication, context/risk-based access, Device Single Sign-On and MobileFirst Platform Foundation generated Certificate Authentication. 
The sample applications and challenge handlers are intended to be used as references for developing your own IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation mobile application integration with IBM Security Access Manager.
