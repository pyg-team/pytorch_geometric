APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users Affected: All WebSphere MQ Monitoring Agent users
   
   Environment:  z/OS only
   
   Problem Description:  Table agents for our sampled attribute
   groups
   return data for all subnodes (queue managers) monitored by the
   agent
   regardless of  distribution and this data will be written to
   history.
   This will result in higher CPU collecting all this data for all
   subnodes
   and more data being written than requested.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring 7.0.1 users.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Historical collection request returns   *
   *                      data for all subnodes regardless of     *
   *                      history collection distribution.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply this PTF.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Table agents for the sampled attribute groups return data
   for all subnodes (queue managers) monitored by the agent
   regardless of distribution and this data will be written
   to history. This will result in higher CPU collecting all
   this data for all subnodes and more data being written than
   requested.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The table agent code of the sampled attribute groups is
   modified to return data only for queue managers requested
   in the subnode list.
