 How to darken the line separator in Cognos Express Planner Web Application 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please see screenshot on how the line separator in Cognos Express Planner Web Application looks and how we can achieve the required output. 

1. Locate the TM1CubeViewer.css file in the tm1_64\tm1web\css folder 

2. The following areas will be modified to include new lines of code:

.CVHeaderCell to include border:1px solid #000000;
.DataCell to include border:1px solid #000000;

Configuration including new lines of code will look as follows:
.DataCell
{
font-size: 8pt;
font-family: Tahoma, 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Verdana, Helvetica,
sans-serif;
text-align: right;
padding-right: 3px;
padding-left: 3px;
margin:0px;
border:1px solid #000000 //This line is to be added
}
.
.CVHeaderCell /*** bad0f1 ***/
{
padding-right: 3px;
padding-left: 3px;
/*font-weight: bold;*/ /* CHANGE: Removing Text bold style */
font-size: 8pt;
font-family: Tahoma, 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Verdana, Helvetica,
sans-serif;
color: #333333;
/* These are the header cells of the each column of data */
background-color: #E7E5E5; 
border-right: 1px solid #E2E2E2;
border-left-width: 0px;
border-bottom: 1px solid #E2E2E2;
border-top-width: 0px;
margin:0px;
border:1px solid #000000; // This line is to be added
}

3. Save the file. Now try to launch Cognos Express Planner Web Application and check the line separator. 

CVHeaderCell this is for Column and Row borders

.DataCell this is for Data Input cell borders

If you only want to change one of them, then just adjust as needed. If they want a specific color such as Black (#000000), just get the HTML color code and adjust as necessary. Note that you cannot only change Column border or Row border, it will need to be both, or neither. You can however change Rows and Column border, but not data cell borders, and vice versa.

Something else to note, the pixel size (px) will impact the overall column and row width, but doesn't respect the data cell widths. For instance, if you changed the settings to show a thicker border on the Rows/Columns, and a thinner border color for Data Cells:

.CVHeaderCell:
border: 3px solid #000000;

.DataCell:
border: 1px solid #000000;

The column and row width, lines will be slightly wider than the data cells, so it may show as some column/row titles, not appearing in a straight line. You should try to keep the pixel sizes the same proportion.

Lastly, the .css will likely get overwritten if an Interim Fix, or Fix Pack is applied, so best to keep a backup copy of the file, prior to applying fixes or upgrades.
