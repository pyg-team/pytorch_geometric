Text:
license import; CRJAZ1490E; import failure; cannot import license TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Importing Jazz license key fails with "The upload did not complete in a reasonable amount of time; the server may be unavailable ID CRJAZ1490E" error for IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) 

SYMPTOM
When you import a Jazz license key from https://<ServerName>:<Port>/jts/admin, the following error is shown and license import fails: 

 The upload did not complete in a reasonable amount of time; the server may be unavailable ID CRJAZ1490E


CAUSE
TThis error occurs when CLM version 6.0.3 is running on IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) and the WAS profile is using unsupported Java version. CLM version 6.0.3 supports Java version 1.7.1.3. Check the detail in Compatibility Report [https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProduct?deliverableId=F4143950EDE411E4989B60FF8B09BCE8&osPlatforms=Windows&duComponentIds=S002&mandatoryCapIds=13%7C132].


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management version 6.0.3 

IBM WebSphere Application Server version 8.5.5.X


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the Java version that CLM is using by the following steps. 

 1. Go to https://<ServerName>:<Port>/jts/admin and open [Server] on the top menu. 
 2. Open [Status Summary] on the left menu. 
 3. Check [Version] under [Server VM] field.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop the CLM server and check Java version that WAS can set to applications. 

About managesdk command [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ja/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rxml_managesdk.html] 

 1. Open command line prompt and open <WAS_HOME>\bin. 
 2. Run managesdk command to get list of Java version WAS can use.
    Windows: managesdk.bat -listAvailable -verbose
    Linux: managesdk.sh -listAvailable -verbose


 

If Java version 1.7.1.3_XX is not in the list, then install supported Java version by using the following help. 

Installing and uninstalling SDK Java Technology Edition 7.0 or 7.1 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/ae/tins_installation_jdk7.html] 

 

Check the Java version again to see if supported Java is correctly installed. Then change the Java version that CLM uses. 

In this example, AppSrv01 is a CLM profile name and Java version 1.7.1.3 is installed. 

 1. Open command line prompt and open <WAS_HOME>\bin. 
 2. Change the Java that the profile uses.
    Windows: managesdk.bat -enableProfile AppSrv01 -sdkName 1.7.1.3
    Linux: managesdk.sh -enableProfile AppSrv01 -sdkName 1.7.1.3 
 3. Check Change has been correctly reflected to the profile.
    Windows: managesdk.bat -listEnabledProfile -profileName AppSrv01 -verbose
    Linux: managesdk.sh -listEnabledProfile -profileName AppSrv01 -verbose


Restart WAS and check the Java version that CLM uses from [Status Summary], and import the Jazz license key. RELATED INFORMATION
