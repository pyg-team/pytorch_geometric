APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Request for enhancement to the Custom Scripting feature as
   follows:
   
   one of my client was highly interested in this new feature but
   then very when he recognized, that this feature does only
   trigger pure. In fact most scripts do status monitoring with
   both, good and bad status for an item and therefore certainly
   need sampled events instead to see clearing events as well.
   
   Does this work as design, and if so, do we plan to change the
   behavior?
   
   Otherwise the agent will never achieve what it is supposed to:
   substitute hundreds of existing agentbuilder agents over time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: Events from situations on custom scripts do
     not close automatically.
   
   Problem/Problem Summary: The data gathered executing the custom
    scripts in 6.30 FP5 are reported using the
    KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime attribute groups (where XX stands
    for LZ or NT or UX). These groups implement 'pure event'
    tables. Because of this, situations cannot receive
    'clearing' events and need to be manually closed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix/Problem Conclusion: New KXX_Custom_Scripts_Rtm_Smp sampled
    tables added. They report the same custom scripts' output data
    as those reported by the existing pure event tables.
   
    Specifications are as follow:
   
    Attribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts_Rtm_Smp (multiple rows)
   
    Table: KXXSCRTSM (Sampled)
   
    Description: Data gathered using custom scripts. It contains
     the output rows of the scripts currently running.

                                 attribute #5
   
    The OS agent sends events only if there are situations or
    historical collections using the pure event table; to
    completely avoid the sending of events, the Administrator can
    set to 'false' the environment variable:
   
    - KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)
    If set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each
    row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are
    visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be
    displayed and no historical collection data will be collected.
   
    No TEP workspace changes are introduced by this APAR, but a
    new built-in query named "Script execution results sampled",
    based on the new sampled tables, is provided.
