PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is it possible to deploy C&DS and Scoring Server into the same cell using the same nodes? 

What are the benefits and what are the downfalls? 

CAUSE
When installing Scoring Server, if you choose to do an 'Easy' deploy, a
copy of WebSphere Liberty is used. As a result, it does an automatic
deploy. However, when using other App Servers, including WebSphere
Application Server (WAS), it is required to perform a manual deploy.
When deploying Scoring Server, one can choose to deploy into the same
cell or a different cell as C&DS. Each cell will have its own Deployment
Manager. Even if one chooses to deploy into the same cell, it is
possible they will point to a different cluster within the cell. The 
topology in this scenario is: C&DS (nodeA/Server1 + nodeB/Server1) and
Scoring Server (nodeA/Server2 + nodeB/Server2). 

ENVIRONMENT
Linux RHEL 7.2
WAS 8.5.5.9 Cluster
Repository Oracle 12.1c (12.1.0.2.0)
C&DS 8.0
Remote Scoring Server 8.0
Essentials for Python
Modeler 18 Adapters.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Yes, it is possible, but the items to consider when installing in the same cell
are memory and resources. The whole design of the remote scoring server is to lessen
the impact on performance on the C&DS system and move that processing over to a different
system. This would allow the ability to increase java heap in the jvm for the remote scoring
server or the C&DS server independent of each other and remove the negative impact of having
to limit the memory due to both being on the same system.
