PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Capture 3.x & 4.x: SQLSetConnectAttr Failed. Scanner station suddenly is not w 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Capture 3.x & 4.x: SQLSetConnectAttr Failed. Scanner station suddenly is not working. Nothing has been changed recently. See P1 and P2 below: P1: Scanner station suddenly is not working, can not run any (old and new) Capture Path (on old and new batches) to scan images although ad hoc mode is still working... Nothing has been changed recently.

P2: In order to fix P1, I reinstalled the Capture and saw this error message after re-installation: "Unable to Open the Database 'Local Repository' - Driver's SQLSetConnectAttr Failed."

Resolution:
Since nothing has been changed recently, most likely something has been corrupted. As an example, the customer experienced that the Local Repository MDB file (LocalRIL.MDB) was corrupted.
What you need to do is to either repair the MDB file or to replace it with a new one (see Resolution 10001544).
To get the new MDB file, you can get it from other Capture station or from the backup copy.
As a tip, it is a good idea to back up the fresh copy of the MDB file right after the installation of FileNet Capture.
