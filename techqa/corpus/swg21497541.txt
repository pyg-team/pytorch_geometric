PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How does one delete a duplicate Data Collector from the SERVERS table? 

SYMPTOM
You will see duplicate DC's on the MS GUI, something like this where the DC in the red box is the duplicate one: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497541&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497541&aid=1]


CAUSE
This may be caused because the DC got corrupted during configuration or you did not disable the DC before reconfiguring it again.


ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for AD 7.1



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem and delete your duplicate DC, please follow these steps: 

1. First try to identify the valid DC that you need to keep. To do this, go to the Administration / Managing Server / Self-Diagnosis menu and click on Data Collector Controllers (on the left side.) This will display all your DC's. Look at your DC and see if you can identify your valid DC you want to keep. Look at the Component ID here. (See screenshot here.)

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497541&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497541&aid=2] 

 

2. Next you have to connect to the OCTIGATE database as your db2 instance owner, and delete the server you do NOT want to keep. Look at the ControllerID from the database and compare to the one in the screenshot above. Decide which Serverid you want to delete based on the ControllerID. 

Be careful here as once the server is deleted from the database, you can't get it back. (So if you are not sure, make a copy of the data in the SERVERS table first.) 

See the screenshots here showing how to connect to the database and how to delete the serverid you don't want to keep. In my example here, serverid 2 is the one to be deleted.

3. Once you delete the Server you don't want, simply go back to the Groups or Enterprise pages and refresh it. You will now see that the duplicate DC has been deleted and does not show up on the MS Enterprise / Group views.
