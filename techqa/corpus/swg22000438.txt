Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Open Source OpenSSL and zLib are used by IBM Netezza Analytics. IBM Netezza Analytics has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3732 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a propagation error in the BN_mod_exp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2016-9840 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9840]
DESCRIPTION: zlib is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c. By persuading a victim to open a specially crafted document, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120508 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120508] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-9841 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9841]
DESCRIPTION: zlib is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c. By persuading a victim to open a specially crafted document, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120509 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120509] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-9842 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9842]
DESCRIPTION: zlib is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an undefined left shift of negative number. By persuading a victim to open a specially crafted document, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120510 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120510] for the current score
