Title: IBM 'Test Connection' for MDM Data Source has a warning - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have configured our IBM InfoSphere MDM environment with Oracle database. Whenever we go to 'Resources' > 'JDBC' > 'Data Sources' > 'MDM' and run 'Test Connection', the connection succeeds but we get a warning. The text says, refer to JVM logs for details on the warning but no descriptive messages are logged within the JVM logs.

Why are we seeing this error and what should we do about it? 

CAUSE
'Test Connection' is a Websphere Application Server feature and hence the corresponding logging is controlled by Websphere. By default, this warning is suppressed from being logged but we can increase the logging level to get additional details. The warning text printed will be similar to the following:
000000ea DSConfigurati I DSRA8203I: Database product name : Oracle
000000ea DSConfigurati I DSRA8204I: Database product version : 11.2.0.3.0
000000ea DSConfigurati I DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name : Oracle
000000ea DSConfigurati I DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version : 5.1.0.000026 (F000026.U000003)
000000ea DSConfigurati I DSRA8030I: Successfully connected to DataSource, with 1 warnings.

To get description of the warning being encountered, go to Troubleshooting > 'Logs and Trace' > ServerName > 'Change log Detail levels', and enable trace by adding the following string in the properties section:

*=info:WAS.j2c=all:RRA=all:Transaction=all

For details on changing the logging level, you may refer to the following information center link to change logging level:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.release.installpostcfg.doc/topics/enabling_application_serverlogging.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.release.installpostcfg.doc/topics/enabling_application_serverlogging.html] 

Once enabled, the logs will show a warning similar to the following: 

000000ea DSConfigHelpe W DSRA0174W:Warning: GenericDataStoreHelper is being used.


After the test, you may change the logging back to normal.


ANSWER
The above test indicates that you are using wrong data store helper class for the corresponding data store. This is the default and the product has been tested with this setting and it should not cause any issues. No action is required for this warning. 


But still if you want to prevent this warning, you can use the Oracle11gDataStoreHelper with the ojdbc6.jar driver file with Oracle 11g or Oracle 10g database server. To do this, go to 'Resources' > 'JDBC' > 'Data Sources' > Name of Data Source (MDM here) > 'Data store helper class name' section > select 'Specify a user-defined data store helper' radio button, and enter the following string:

com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.Oracle11gDataStoreHelper
