APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The webserver CAServlet tool option for creating a browser
   certificate request does not give the security administrator the
   option to specify the key size(1024 or 512).  The option is
   currently available for the Netscape browser.  Depending on the
   level of encryption(US or Export) the customer may want to use
   the strong encryption method.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The browser creates the certificate request and not the
   webserver.  The Microsoft Internet Explorer browser determines
   the level of encryption by the user's browser level.  If the
   customer is using the IE export version the browser defaults to
   512-bit.  If the customer is IE US security the browser defaults
   to 1024-bit.  The customer will need to ensure users have the
   correct level of IE installed before the certificate request
   is created.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Those using the CA utility (CAServlet).      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When using the CA utility and an        *
   *                      Internet Explorer browser you do not    *
   *                      get the option to choose a different    *
   *                      key size when requesting a browser      *
   *                      certificate.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using the CA utility to create a certificate from an
   Internet Explorer browser the user does not have the option to
   choose the key size.  Internet Explorer does not allow the user
   to select the size key he/she would want to use even if it
   is less then what the browser can manage.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Internet Explorer Browsers only create keys the same size as the
   browsers they are requested from, so a browser with 128 bit
   encryption ability will only allow a 1024 bit key to be built
   and a browser with 56 bit encryption will only allow a 512 bit
   key to be built.  This is an Internet Explorer limitation.
   
   Changes need to made to the Certificate Authority utility
   appendix in the Planning, Installing, and Using books for
   releases 5.1 and 5.2, and Chapter 4 How do I act as a
   certificate authority and issue my own certificates in the
   Webmaster's Guide for release 5.0.  In the section that
   explains how to Request a Browser Certificate the following
   needs to be added:
   Note: Internet Explorer Browsers only create keys the same size
   as the browsers they are requested from, so a browser with 128
   bit encryption would receive a 1024 bit key, a browser with
   56 bit encryption would receive a 512 bit key from the CA
   utility.
   Internet Explorer does not allow the user to select the size
   key he/she would want to use even if it is less then what
   the browser can manage.
