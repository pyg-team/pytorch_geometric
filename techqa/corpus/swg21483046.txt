Title: IBM SPSS Text Analytics licensing error.  How to determine I am using the correct authorization code? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I licensed my SPSS product with a number of authorization codes, but I am still getting a license error when I start my product. How to determine the correct authorization code is being used if one of the following happened:

1 - I applied an authorization code for a different product or an authorization code for a different version of my installed version of SPSS

2 - Possibly an authorization code that is not set up properly because attempting to start my SPSS product I receive one of the following errors: 

SPSS Statistics:
Error # 7001
There is no license for SPSS for Windows.
This command not executed.
Specific symptom number: 18

Or

Error # 2072 
There was an unanticipated problem with the license for this product. 
This command not executed. 
Specific symptom number: 4 

Amos:
No valid license for Amos was found. (1, 18)
Or

No valid license for Amos was found. (11,4)

Clementine / Modeler:
No license key found: Subcode 18 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Each of our SPSS products come with a unique 20 character alpha-numeric code called an authorization code. These codes are specific not only to the product that needs to be installed, but the version of the product as well. Documentation that is provided by the SPSS sales department or your distributor defines what specific product and version your authorization code can be used for.

If you have any questions about your authorization code, please feel free to contact Client Care at tsmail@us.ibm.com
