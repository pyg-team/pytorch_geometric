QUESTION
 How to install the RAA Eclipse Plug-in for RDz? 



ANSWER
 

If you are using RDz 9.0.x and later versions, you can use Installation Manager (IM) to install RAA Eclipse plug-in in combination with RAA Fix Pack 16 (v6.1.0.16) or later. 

Here are the steps you can follow: 


1. If the RAA Eclipse plug-in for RDz was previously installed using the manual workaround (see above steps), undo that process before proceeding with plug-in installation by performing the following:
a) Close RDz 
b) Delete the RAA Eclipse plug-in .jar files (e.g. com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar and com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar) from the dropins subdirectory (e.g. C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\dropins)
c) Start RDz 


2. Download RAAiInstallRepository.zip (RAA Eclipse plug-in for RDz) from IBM Fix Central and add it to Installation Manager as a repository. 

3. Use Installation Manager to perform the install.

If you are using RDz 8.5.x and 8.0.x versions, you must manually copy the RAA plug-in jar files to the Eclipse dropins folder. 


1. The method of finding the jar files to copy depends on whether the full install or an install repository is being used. 
1.1) Finding the jar files in afull installzip file: 
Look in thead\pluginsfolder: 

 * Browse the toc.xml file. The entries look like: <file name='file000012' alias='com.ibm.dmh.raai_6.1.0.20130918.jar'/> 
 * Look for the com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar and com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar aliases 
 * Copy the two files (eg. file000012) to a temporary location and rename them back to the value of the alias entry (eg. com.ibm.dmh.raai_6.1.0.20130918.jar). 


1.2) Finding the jar files in an RAAiInstallRepository.zip file: 
Look in the pluginsfolder for the two files matching:  * com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar 
 * com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar 


2. To find the dropins folder, look at the properties for the shortcut used to start RDz. Look at the Target property to see where eclipse.exe resides (eg. C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP"), If that folder doesn't have a dropins subdirectory, create it.

3. Copy the 2 jar files to that dropins folder and then restart RDz. When starting RDz, use "Run as administrator" so that the plugins can be installed. 

4. After RDz starts, choose Window -> Preferences from the menu, and verify that you have an "Asset Analyzer" entry in the left pane.

NOTE: RDz 8.5.x and 8.0.x versions are End-of-Service( EOS) , you should upgrade to the supported versions and take advantage of fixes and enhancements.
