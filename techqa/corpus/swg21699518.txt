Title: IBM Java Security warning in ALGO Credit Limit Manager/Web GUI - United States

Text:
Algo Credit Limit Manager ACL java security TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users reported getting Java Security warnings when accessing the ALGO Credit Limit Manager/Web GUI.

Users were running Internet Explorer 8 and Java version 1.7.0_55 on their machines. 

SYMPTOM
Users receive a "Java Application Blocked" pop-up error window.


CAUSE
This is because new third-party security requirements were implemented starting from Java 7 Update 51 which prevent ACL from working as expected.

ENVIRONMENT
ACLM

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Users receive a "Java Application Blocked" pop-up error window with the following message.

Application blocked by Java Security. For security, applications must now meet the requirements for the High or Very High security settings, or be part of the Exception Site List, to be allowed to run.


Name: ws
Location: http://localhost:38002
Reason: Your security settings have blocked an untrusted application from running


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Java 7 is not supported on versions older than 4.7.0. 


For ACL 4.7.0 upgrade to 4.7.0.03 patch level 4.7.0.03_20130613 or higher.

As a work-around, add the ALGO Credit Limit Manager/Web GUI link to the Exception Site List in the Java Control Panel so that the application can run.
