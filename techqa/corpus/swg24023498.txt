IBM Installation Manager is a single installation program that can use remote or local software repositories to install, modify, or update certain IBM products. It determines and shows available packages, checks prerequisites and interdependencies, and installs or modifies the selected packages. You also use IBM Installation Manager to uninstall the packages that it installed. 

IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 feature packs are the first WebSphere Application Server products to be installed by IBM Installation Manager. Earlier tools that are based on InstallShield® MultiPlatform are used to install, update, and uninstall the Version 7.0 base product as well as previous versions of WebSphere Application Server.

Known Issues 
 * The Installation Manager does not synchronize with WebSphere Application Server if WebSphere Application Server is at higher fix pack level than recommended for the feature pack.
   
   Solution: Download the latest version of WebSphere Application Server import repositories and add it to the Installation Manager:
   http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/downloads/was/import/ [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/downloads/was/import/]
   
   
 * The import mechanism in versions of Installation Manager earlier than Version 1.4.0 does not correctly validate the prerequisite Installation Manager level and the synchronization check fails with WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 Fix Pack 11 and later. 
   
   Solution: You must use IBM Installation Manager Version 1.4.0 or later to install, modify, or uninstall a feature pack with WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 Fix Pack 11 and later.
   
   
 * Initially, the generally available version of IBM Installation Manager Version 1.4.4 does not have the links to the repositories for the WebSphere Application Server Version 7 feature packs listed in the Repositories section of the Preferences. A customer installing IBM Installation Manager Version 1.4.4 on top of an earlier version (Version 1.4.2 or Version 1.4.3 for example) should have the repository links saved from the previous installation.
   
   Solution: Missing repository links can be added manually. Go to File > Preferences > Repositories in the Installation Manager GUI, click Add Repository, and add the following two repository links: [https://www.ibm.com/software/rational/repositorymanager/repositories/websphere/repository.config] [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/repositories/repository.config]
