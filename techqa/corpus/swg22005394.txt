Title: IBM Modeler 18.1 and Statistics 25.0 REQUIRE the IBM SPSS Concurrent License Manager and Tools 9.1 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Modeler 18.1 and Statistics 25 are using the concurrent (network) licensing scheme, the latest version of the SPSS Concurrent Licensing Tools are required. If Modeler or Statistics client tries to get a license from an older license server, the following error message will be shown:

Unable to acquire a license token due to error 11 ...
A miscellaneous license related error has occurred.
Specific symptom: 25

To download the latest version, please go to https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/spss/spss-support/ [https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/spss/spss-support/] and select "SPSS Modeler, C&DS & Analytic Server" or "SPSS Statistics Versions 25, 24, 23...". 
Click "View resources", scroll down to "Looking for the license manager" and click download. Then choose the version appropriate for your OS. Make sure that the old license server is no longer active when you are ready to use the new one (uninstall the old one or make sure the service is no longer started).

Note that to install the authcode to your Sentinel License Server, there is no License Authorization WIzard anymore, use the licenseactivator command instead:
1. Start a command prompt (run as administrator)
2. Navigate (cd) to your C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel RMS License Manager\WinNT folder
3. Run the licensactivator command where <authcode> is your 20-char concurrent authorization code for Modeler 18.1 or SPSS Statistics 25
licenseactivator <authcode>

Note that the download file containing the SPSS Concurrent Licensing Tools 9.1 contains 2 folders, namely manager and tools. The manager folder contains the setup file for installing the Sentinel License Server, the tools folder contains the setup file for installing the Wlmadmin administration tool. This tool allows you amongst other things to check whether your concurrent licensing is setup correctly and to check the number of licenses that are in use. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the IBM SPSS Concurrent License Manager and Tools 9.1.
