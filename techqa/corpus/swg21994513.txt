PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rational Rhapsody fails to launch with error code 0xc0150002. 

SYMPTOM
After a correct installation you get this error message when attempting to launch Rhapsody. Also other executables like Diffmerge bring the same error code.


CAUSE
This can happen when an attempt is made to start an application compiled against RTI .Net libraries in a system where the "Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update" is not installed. 

 
The underlying cause is that the system is trying to find the "microsoft.VC80.CRT" file, provided in that Security Update. 


ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Windows



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In Windows "Control Panel > Programs and Features" the Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable 

1. is missing, or 
2. it is shown with a lower version number than 8.0.61001 (e.g. 8.0.56336), or
3. only the x64 version (64 bit version) is installed and not the 32 bit version.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the Redistributable Package MFC Security Update and then attempt to run Rhapsody again. 

 
The Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update can be obtained from the following Microsoft website:
