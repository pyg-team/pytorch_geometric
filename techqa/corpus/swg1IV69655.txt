APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM SAM 8.0.1.0 appliance shows error when searching LDAP groups
   in Management Authorization module LMI.
   No problem when looking for  users.
   Same steps performed on 8.0.0.5 works just fine.
   
   
   Recreation steps :
   
   1) add external LDAP in the Management Authentication
   2)  created a new Role in the Management Authorization module
   3) try to link this role to a group in our LDAP registry (ITDS
   6.3.0.33). However when we do a search for the group a System
   Error is shown in the LMI with the following error:
   ?LDAP search failed. Ensure that the appliance is correctly
   configured for a remote LDAP user registry and try again.
   4) When add users instead of a group this works as expected.
