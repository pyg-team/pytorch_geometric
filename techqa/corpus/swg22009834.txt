 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an "in" list as part of a where clause?


ANSWER
No, there is not a limit.
The only limit with large "in list" statements would need large memory to compile the query. If the query is too complex, you can potentially run out of memory.
