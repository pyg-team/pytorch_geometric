PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 <P>When preallocating a DSN with the exact same attributes as the sending DS, the transmission will fail with a SVTM030I ERROR. If DSN directory blocks are increased by 150% on the preallocated target DSN the copy works.</P> (SCI47154) 

SYMPTOM


When preallocating a DSN with the exact same attributes as the sending DS, the transmission will fail with a SVTM030I ERROR. If DSN directory blocks are increased by 150% on the preallocated target DSN the copy works.


SVTM030I **** FMH-74 ??RECEIVED AFTER STEP ERROR: WE ARE SNA PRIMARY 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


The Connect:Direct transmission on the receiving node is intercepted upon dataset
allocation by PDSMAN. If the dataset on the sending side is created
without member statistics and the the high level qualifier is NOT excluded
from PDSMAN, then PDSMAN will add member statistics. This requires
additional space and control blocks above the initial allocation. PDSMAN
is not allowing the allocation of any extents for the dataset to do this.
The Connect:Direct transmission will fail.



If the dataset on the sending side is created without member statistics
and the the high level qualifier IS excluded from PDSMAN, then PDSMAN will
NOT add member statistics and the transmission will not fail.
