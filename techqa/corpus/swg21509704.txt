 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to open jobs in DataStage. 
Opening a job fails with a popup window showing the error message "Unable to load RID - <id string>"

In the Websphere Application Server log (systemOut.log) you may see several errors similar to the following:
CNTR0020E: EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception during invocation of method "removeEvents" on bean "BeanId(ACS_server.ear#ACS_server.jar#LoggingQueryService, null)". Exception data: javax.ejb.EJBException: nested exception is: com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.SqlException: DB2 SQL error: SQLCODE: -968, SQLSTATE: 57011, SQLERRMC: null
com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.SqlException: DB2 SQL error: SQLCODE: -968, SQLSTATE: 57011, SQLERRMC: null


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The listed DB2 failure code occurs when the DB2 database is out of disk space or the database transaction logs are full. 

Your database administrator should look at the db2diag.log. The file is located on DB2 server , 
directory <db2instance_home>/sqllib/db2dump

If it contains an error stating disk is full, you will need to free up or add disk space to the database volume used by the DB2 xmeta database.

If there is no disk space error, check for additional errors. This error can also occur when the DB2 transaction logs are full.
