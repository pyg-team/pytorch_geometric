APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  java.lang.ClassCastException:
   org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransportFactory
   incompatible with
   org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportFactory

   ****************************************************************
   A ClassCastException is generated during the recovery process
   for the ActiveMQ resource which is configured as an Isolated
   Resource Provider.
   In normal processing, all the necessary ActiveMQ classes are
   loaded by the Isolated Classloader without any problems. But
   during recovery some of the classes are loaded by the
   ExtClassLoader in addition to the IsolatedClassLoader.  The
   ClassCastException is thrown as a consequence of the
   classes being loaded by these two different class loaders.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If the resource adapter is configured as an isolated resource
   provider, only the isolated classloader is used in the
   recovery processing of the resource adapter.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.13 and 9.0.0.6.  Please refer to the Recommended
