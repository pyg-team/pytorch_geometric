When using the Update Server in an environment with no internet connection, and when the Update Server is correctly configured to not perform downloads, then it might be possible for the health status of the Update Server to appear as "Unhealthy" with a failure on the "Ready For Files" health status.
There may also be errors containing failures to download the file: 
SiteProtector/sp_dlc_active.txt

The "Ready For Files" health status normally indicates whether the Download Center is reachable, and therefore fails when the Download Center is not reachable due to disabled downloads.
This update allows the "Ready For Files" health check to only check for files present on the filesystem when downloads are disabled. In an environment with no internet connection, it is expected that the files will be manually placed on the filesystem. Therefore, when downloads are disabled, the "Ready For Files" health check will only be marked as Unhealthy when a file is requested that does not exist on the filesystem.

Note: This update does not affect the behavior of downstream Update Servers that have downloads enabled, even if they are downloading from an Update Server that has downloads disabled.


SP Workitem 69544 / APAR IV72521

When downloading very large update files in SiteProtector, it might be possible for the signature verification of the file to fail, even if the file itself is good. The file will appear to download to 99%, then fail and be deleted.

This update allows SiteProtector to properly check the signature verification of very large update files.

Directory browsing for the Update Server has been removed to improve security.
