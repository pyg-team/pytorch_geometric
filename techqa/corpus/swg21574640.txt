 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I find versions of a file backed up by Veritas (now Symantec) NetBackupâ„¢? 

ANSWER
This document describes how to use the bplist command to find versions of backed up files.
To view a list of all the versions of a file that are being maintained on a Veritas NetBackup server, use the bplist command. The command resides in the /usr/openv/netbackup/bin directory. File permissions prevent you from seeing files from other NetBackup clients.

For example, if you need to find backups of the file /nz/data/postgresql.conf, you might run the following command:


 * bplist -l -R -PI postgresql.conf


The output would be similar to the following: 
 * -rwxr----- user1 eng 1002 Apr 2 09:59 /nz/kit.4.0/conf/postgresql.conf
 * 
 * -rwxr----- user1 eng 1002 Mar 28 09:59 /nz/kit.3.1.2/conf/postgresql.conf


The -l option provides a long listing that includes mode, owner, group, size in bytes and time of last modification. 

The -R option specifies a recursive search to a depth of 999 sub-directories. You can override the default and specify to which depth you'd like to recursively search. This option should only be used when performing path independent searches (-PI). 

The -PI option makes the search path-independent; if files bearing the same name exist in multiple directories, they would be backed up multiple times. Specifying -PI and the filename only will list both files. If you have a specific file in mind, you may omit the -PI option and instead specify the filename with its absolute path (for example, bplist -l /nz/kit.4.0/conf/postgresql.conf). 

Additional options include the following: 
 * -I performs a case-insensitive search 
 * -s mm/dd/yy [hh[:mm[:ss]]] specifies the date to start the search 
 * -e mm/dd/yy [hh[:mm[:ss]]] specifies the date to end the search 
 * -help displays the full command usage


The following options can be used with the -l option: 
 * -b displays the backup date and time rather than the last modification date and time 
 * -c displays the last inode modification date and time 
 * -u displays the last access date and time
