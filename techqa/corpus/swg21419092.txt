QUESTION
 Where can I look to help troubleshoot issues for the IBM Rational DOORS Quality Center 3.4/3.5 integration if I am getting an error that says "The data provider failed to initialize, if this problem persists contact your administrator" when using the integration Admin Tool? 

CAUSE
This error typical results when the Admin Tool can not make a connection to either DOORS or Quality Center. 

ANSWER
On the integration server machine, look in the 'C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\DOORSTDIServices\Logs' directory for a 'TDIService.log' file. This log can give you more information on why the error is being thrown. If you are unable to understand it, submit it to support for analysis.
