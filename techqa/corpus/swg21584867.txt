Resolution:

Before running the TIP fix pack 2.2.0.3 installation, you must ensure that all the TIP related Java processes are disabled. 

Otherwise, perform the steps below in order to disable the TIP service:

1. Under the Windows Services control panel, locate the service for Tivoli Integrated Portal.
2. Right-click on the TIP service and select Properties 
3. Select "Disabled" from the Startup Type dropdown box
4. Click Apply, and then OK.

Do not stop the service, as that will stop the TIP server process. You need that running for the TIP fix pack installation. 
Once you have disabled the service, please retry the TIP fix pack 2.2.0.3 install. 

If the issue still occurs, you need to collect the information from below technote and contact IBM Support.
