Title: IBM Cannot confirm Atlas hold notices in Lotus Notes version 8.5.3 or later. - United States

Text:
Atlas eDiscovery Policy Management; PolicyAtlas; Lotus Notes 8.5.3 Lotus Notes 9.0 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a custodian clicks "Submit Response" button on a hold notice to record the response, Lotus Notes opens the browser with invalid PolicyAtlas url instead of actual Atlas server in the url. The url is similar to http : // www.~web8073.htm / PolicyAtlas. 8073 is the random number. This number could be different each time the custodian presses the "Submit Response" button. 

CAUSE
There is a new Image Whitelist Policy that was introduced from Lotus Notes 8.5.3 and later. This policy breaks the java script based email forms. This policy is applied automatically when the Image security is turned on under Preferences even when there is no image in the email. 

More info can be found here.
