 *  New online Support experience for IBM Security is now live! [https://ibm.biz/Bdj8Ah] 
   In addition to the recently announced dW Answers forum process for IBM License Metric Tool, we are excited to announce that IBM launched a new online Support experience. This new tool replaces the way PMRs were handled. Most IBM Security products, including LMT and BigFix Inventory went live with this new technology on October 30. To access the Community directly, go to www.ibm.com/mysupport [www.ibm.com/mysupport] and log in with your IBM ID for a personalized experience. 
   
   Clarification on the move of ILMT to dW Answers forum [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/ilmt/entry/Updates_on_the_move_of_ILMT_to_dW_Answers_forum?lang=en&acss=danl_5057_email] 
   IBM's responsibility and ownership remain the same as if an IBM Support Community case was opened. Each forum post tagged with the "ILMT" tag is "owned" by an IBM Engineer and this Engineer has the responsibility to work the reported issue to a satisfactory close. When confidential data is required to investigate a forum question, the data will be conveyed to IBM via a secure communication layer, and customers will not be asked to to expose this data in the forum post.

It also provides fixes for APARs and defects found in the previous versions as well as serviceability improvements including optimization of the import of data. 
   
   BigFix Inventory version 9.2.10 [http://ibm.biz/bfi_update_9210]
