ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Windows 7 Users are could not able to log in to AA8.1, Domain
   Admin and
   other Admin users are able to login directly to AA 8.1 with out
   any
   issues, When one of  our normal user logs in with Admin account
   user
   can connect to the AccessAgent server. When he logs in with
   non-admin
   account he can't connect to the IMS server and attempting to log
   into
   AA creates an error saying the server is unavailable.
   Please find the attached logs with level as 3
   Error to logon from AA tray incon? ? Nobody Logged in? is the
   error
   We are not using EnGina
   Error we also see: IMS Server is not available( One of my user
   faced
   this issue), But  When I tried with normal user account Auto
   Login is
   not happening, for Admin user its working fine
   Every user who is having Active AD credentials can login the
   Domain with
   ESSO
   If I am logging into the Windows 7 standalone as workgroup with
   Admin
   privileges, AA is prompting me to provide credentials
   (Screenshot
   attached)
   After the user is registered with IMS, user will use his TAM
   ESSO
   password (which should be the same as his AD password due to AD
   password
   sync) to logon to IMS.
   It looks like system data is not properly propagated the
   machine. it
   could be an issue to contact IMS server ( the server is not
   available
   error.)
   also, if AD pwd sync is enable, and you run AA on an machine
   doesn't
   join the domain, you need to configure one machine registry
   policy
   Password Sync is enabled
   "ADVerificationOnLogonOption"=DWORD:0, under DeploymentOptions,
   you can
   check out policy doc for more detail
   I attached the AA registry here
   AD pwd sync is enable can be enabled on IMS server side too
   If you already enabled adpwd sync (and if it is required), you
   don't
   need to do anything from IMS side. You just need to configure
   the client
   machine, which is not a domain member
   Use Active Directory password as TAM E-SSO password Mark this
   checkbox
   if the password synchronizes with the Active Directory password
   (such
   as, enable Active Directory password synchronization). Clear
   this checkbox if users do not synchronize passwords with the
   Active
   Directory passwords.
   
   Windows 7 Users ( Normal User, with out any privileges) Could
   not able
   log in to Access Agent. Domain Admin and other Admin User are
   able to
   log in as usual.
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate: NA
   Desired Behavior:NA
   
   
   Environment:
   
   IMS 8.0.0, AA 8.1, Windows 7
   use IMS 8.0.0 with AA 8.1 as an interim solution, since they
   need Win7
   support.
