Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Links from SharePoint to content migrated to FileNet P8 do not resolve after the upgrade to Content Collector V2.2. 

CAUSE
Content Collector for Microsoft SharePoint V2.2 now resolves SharePoint-to-FileNet P8 links through the Content Collector Web Application. If you upgraded from a Content Collector V2.1.1 installation that had only the FileNet P8 and SharePoint connectors installed, several configuration settings are missing.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To enable SharePoint-to-FileNet P8 links to resolve correctly, you must configure these settings:


 1. In Configuration Manager, navigate to General Settings > Web Application.  1. Verify the settings under Web Application Definition, specifically Host name and Port. 
        The default value for Host name is the Content Collector server.
        The default value for Port is 11443. 
     2. Under Repository Connection, click Add. Select the FileNet P8 repository connection and click OK. Repeat for each existing FileNet P8 repository connection. 
     3. Save your changes.
        
    
    
 2. Select Archived Data Access.  1. Select Advanced. 
     2. For Configuration, click Import.  1. Navigate to the folder that contains the file afu_p8_sharepoint_search_config.xml. The default folder location should automatically load this location; for example, C:\Program Files\IBM\ContentCollector\Configuration\initialConfig\data\search 
         2. Select the afu_p8_sharepoint_search_config.xml file and click OK after the configuration is successfully imported.
        
        
     3. For Archive mapping, click Import.  1. Navigate to the folder that contains the file afu_p8_sharepoint_search_mapping_template.xml. The default folder location should automatically load this location; for example, C:\Program Files\IBM\ContentCollector\Configuration\initialConfig\data\search 
         2. Select the afu_p8_sharepoint_search_mapping_template.xml file. 
            For each Collection Name select the appropriate FileNet P8 Repository Connection and click OK after the configuration is successfully imported.
        
        
     4. Save your changes.
        
    
    
 3. Select Information Center.  1. Verify the Host name and Port. If needed, type the server name where the Content Collector Web Application is hosted. 
        The default value for Host name is the Content Collector server.
        The default value for Port is 8888. 
     2. Save your changes.
        
    
    
 4. Select Configuration Web Service and confirm settings under the Web Service Definition.  1. For Host name, the default value is the Content Collector server. 
     2. For Port, the default value is 11443. 
     3. For Use embedded Web Application Server, the default value is checked.  1. The JDBC driver directory is the directory containing JDBC files; for example: C:\IBM\SQLLIB\java 
         2. The JDBC port is the port number used to connect to your Configuration Manager database.
        
        
     4. If you modified the Configuration Web Service section, save your changes in Configuration Manager. This action initiates the restart and configuration of the Content Collector Web Application.
        
        If you did not modify the Configuration Web Service section, you must restart the Content Collector Web Application manually:
        
        From the Microsoft Windows Start menu:  * To stop: 
           Start -> Programs -> IBM Content Collector -> Stop Services -> Stop ICC Web Applications 
         * To start: 
           Start -> Programs -> IBM Content Collector -> Start Services -> Start ICC Web Applications
        
        
    
     * 
     * IBM Content Collector Web Application
     * 
     * Microsoft Management Console Services
     * 
     *
