APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and have installed Interim
   fix 007 as well (see APAR PM96712 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM96712]) which solved some issues with
   Python programming.
   However, with the Interim fix installed you are faced with
   another issue. When you use OUTPUT EXPORT or click file - Export
   as a Web Report on output viewer and open the exported web
   Report in a web browser like Firefox, Internet Explorer or
   Google Chrome you see that the web report is no longer editable.
   The controls stay disabled although Java scripts are enabled on
   your browsers.
   With web reports created in Statistics 22 without IF007
   installed you do not have such problems and the exported web
   reports are editable.
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS development.
