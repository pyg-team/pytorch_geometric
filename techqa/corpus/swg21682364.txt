Title: IBM Configuring the session timeout value in IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - United States

Text:
session timeout; web.xml.logged out TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I am logged on to the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control server and there is no activity, I am logged out after a period of time. How can I increase this time interval? 

CAUSE
A default time period of 30 minutes is set in the WEB. XML file that is installed with the server. 

ANSWER
You can increase the timeout value by editing the WEB. XML file. 

For a server that is installed by using the server installer, the file is in the following directory,
\[server installation directory]\wlp\usr\servers\trcserver\apps\TRCAPP.ear\trc.war\WEB-INF

For a server that is installed on a Linux operating system 
/[server installation directory]/wlp/usr/servers/trcserver/apps/TRCAPP.ear/trc.war/WEB-INF

For a server that is installed on WebSphere Application Server version 8.5
\[server installation directory]\trc_war.ear\trc.war\WEB-INF 



 1. Edit the WEB. XML file, 
 2. Edit the following property
    <session-config> 
    <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> 
    </session-config> 
 3. Set the timeout value to the number of minutes you require. 
 4. Save the file. 
 5. Restart the server service.
