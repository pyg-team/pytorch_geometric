APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Per customer and L2,
   
   When we have changed current item in one of Selects, we can
   observe change event fired once for each Select coach view + one
   more event. So, if we have 2 Selects within coach, we have 3
   events. All Selects bound to different variables, so only one
   variable was really changed. Both binding variable and
   selectedItems configuration options are different. So, per our
   understanding, we have false change events fired.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Coach views may not update properly when the name of one Coach
   variable (defined in human service) is part of the name of
   another variable. e.g. Coach has 2 variables, var_abcedf and
   var_abc.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard and Express users of
   New Generation Coaches that have multiple variables defined, and
   the names of those variables are similar.
   
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   When the value of some coach variable changes, coach framework
   needs to find out the set of coach view instances that might be
   affected. For example, if variable local.abc is changed, the
   view that binds (through data binding or configuration options)
   with local.abc.def should be refreshed. The old logic does not
   handle the comparison properly, which made the view bound with
   local.abcdef also refreshed. This is the root cause of the
   issue.
