APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a user attempts a CSV upload of targets to the Request
   Scope, and the CSV contains at least one incorrect record (e.g.
   incorrect Login ID) out of many correct ones, then the
   application will report to the user that there was an error
   during the import.
   
   Upon clicking "Close" for the error window, and "Cancel" for
   the import window, the user returns to the People in Scope
   screen, that shows "No items to display".  However, if you
   refresh the page, it will populate with all of the successfully
   uploaded records.  This is confusing to the user, as they may
   initially assume that no records were uploaded.
   
    Steps to recreate this issue:
   Logon to Atlas
   Click on Matters
   Open a matter
   Click on Requests
   On Requests page, go to "people in scope"
   Click on ADD on upper right hand-side
   choose "CSV import"
   import a csv file with people to be added
   When import is done, you will not see the imported people in
   the page list refreshed automatically.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Refresh Request Scope page after any errors to see successfully
   loaded individuals.
