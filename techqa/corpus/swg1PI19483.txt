ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Recreation steps:
   As admin, create a library and syndicate to a second Portal.
   Second Portal can be base or VP.
   On the syndicator server, rename the library, and wait for
   syndication.
   When syndication is complete, check the name of the library on
   the subscriber.
   The library name should now be the new name.
   On the syndicator, add a new content item to the renamed
   library
   and wait for syndication to complete.
   On the subscriber, confirm the content does syndicate but the
   library rename has still not been applied to the library on

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Recreation steps:
   As admin, create a library and syndicate to a second Portal.
   Second Portal can be base or VP.
   On the syndicator server, rename the library, and wait for
   syndication.
   When syndication is complete, check the name of the library on
   the subscriber.
   The library name should now be the new name.
   On the syndicator, add a new content item to the renamed
   library
   and wait for syndication to complete.
   On the subscriber, confirm the content does syndicate but the
   library rename has still not been applied to the library on
   the
   subscriber.
   Note the add content step is not currently do by the test
   RenameLibrary
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a library was updated the event log entry on the
   WCM_LIBRARIES table was updated, but the entry on the
   WCM_CONTROLLABLES table was not. This fix ensures both are
   updated when a library is modified.
