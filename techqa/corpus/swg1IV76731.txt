APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Our application (Log File Agent) is opening and reading from a
   log file and at the same time if anyone tries to rename the
   same log file it prevents you from renaming this log file.
   When new records are added to the log, our application will
   open the log, read the log and close the log.
   Unfortunately  when lots of events are written in a log file or
   the rate at which the log file is populated (0.8 and 0.5 events
   per second) is very high this opening, reading and closing of
   log seems to hold the file open.  Hence when you try to rename
   the same log it prevents you from renaming.
   
   NOTE: This issue specifically occurs on Windows (Log File Agent
   trying to monitor a log on Windows OS). See SCRATCHPAD for some
   of the test data.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - Depending on how frequently your file is updated, you could
   increase the PollInterval, but if there is a large volume of
   data the file will be kept open longer.
   - NumEventsToCatchUp=-1  seems to increase the frequency of the
   locking issue so resetting to 0 or commenting out may improve
   the situation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On Windows systems, when the agent is monitoring an application
   log, an attempt to rename or delete the monitored log file
   may fail because the file appears to be open or in use.  This is
   a result to operating system efficiencies and an older compiler
   used for the 32-bit agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Build the Windows x86-64 bit (WIX64) Log File agent using a
   later compiler.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently planned to be included in the
