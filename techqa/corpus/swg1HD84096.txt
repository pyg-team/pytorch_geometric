ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The behavior of "Secured By option" is not correct
   V5R18 SP7 HF6 HF15
   Database sent by Customer in as Exp_R18.dmp
   (ID=26DDC1D793A94A7FA031587E8D2CA0FB).
   Accordingly to call information this database was
   upgraded V5 R14 - R16 - R18.
   Accordingly to call information this database is
   some 'Old SmDemo', but really it is CHANGED by
   Customer DATABASE and SmDemo is
   only its name, not SmDemo setting.
   Real SmDemo setting related to Secure By shown
   in SmarTeam Data Model Designer for
   SmDemo_V5R18.
   The problem below does not relate to SmDemo, to
   old SmDemo, and to upgraded SmDemo.
   But the problem is next (found by VAR / Customer
   and related to 'middle class' problem).
   While in some database Documents Super Class IS
   NOT ASSIGNED for Secure By, but some Leaf
   Class ('middle class') as, e.g. Solid Edge IS
   ASSIGNED for Secure By, then Secure By
   checkbox IS DISABLED (grayed out) and next
   cases should be tested after fixing the problem:
   Scenario 1:
   1. User joe has a Role in Project-0063 ACME
   Manufacturing (Project Manager)
   2. User joe can successfully add Solid Edge Part,
   Assembly, Drawing, Weldment with Secure By
   USING SmarTeam Editor to this Project
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with joe
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly,
   Draft, Weldment, Sheet Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose same
   Project-0063 => Choose Link to Project and Add to
   Desktop => And click on Documents tree
   6. KO=NG: Secured By check box IS DISABLED
   (grayed out)
   Scenario 2:
   1. User joe has NO Role in some new created
   Project (created by bob and only bob has in the
   new Project some Role as Project Manager)
   2. User joe can successfully add Solid Edge Part,
   Assembly, Drawing, Weldment with Secure By
   USING SmarTeam Editor to this Project
   NOTE: it is since joe is Admin
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with joe
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly,
   Draft, Weldment, Sheet Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose created
   Project => Choose Link to Project and Add to
   Desktop => And click on Documents tree
   6. KO=NG: Secured By check box IS DISABLED
   (grayed out)
   Scenario 3:
   1. User bob has NO Role in Project-0063 ACME
   Manufacturing or in any other Project, including
   created ones for testing purposes
   2. User bob CAN NOT successfully add Solid Edge
   Part, Assembly, Drawing, Weldment with Secure By
   USING SmarTeam Editor to this Project using
   SmarTeam Editor
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with bob
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly,
   Draft, Weldment, Sheet Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose same
   Project-0063 or any other Project where bob HAS
   NO appropriated Role => Choose Link to Project
   and Add to Desktop => And click on Documents
   tree
   6. OK: Secured By check box IS DISABLED
   (grayed out).
   Scenario 4:
   1. User bob has a Role in any Project, including
   created ones for testing purposes
   2. User bob can successfully add Solid Edge Part,
   Assembly, Drawing, Weldment with Secure By
   USING SmarTeam Editor to this Project
   3. Launch Solid Edge integration with bob
   4. SmarTeam Save Solid Edge Part, Assembly,
   Draft, Weldment, Sheet Metal
   5. Project Manager appears => Choose any Project
   where bob has some appropriated Role => Choose
   Link to Project and Add to Desktop => And click on
