Title: IBM Excel metadata and Framework Manager data types - United States

Text:
Excel; Framework Manager; data types; column types TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Mapping Excel column types to Framework Manager data types. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Excel does not have ‘data types’ as a RDBMS does. Excel has ‘column types’ which are defined automatically by Excel depending on the data which is stored within the column. The column data types that are returned from Excel for an Excel data source are not identical in all cases to the data types in most programming languages and applications – Framework Manager included. Below is a summary of Excel metadata ‘data types’ and what to expect in Framework Manager. 

(Excel 2003 –> Framework Manager)
Numeric -> Float64
Currency -> Int16
Date/Time -> Date Time
Boolean -> Int16
Text<255 -> Char length 16
Memo -> Text Blob


Please note that before you can import Excel metadata, you must define a table within Excel 

Excel 2003:
1. highlight the section of your Excel sheet that you want to import into Framework Manager
2. in Excel, select INSERT > NAME > DEFINE….
3. choose a name and OK
