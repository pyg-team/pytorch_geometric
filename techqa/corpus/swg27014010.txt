Text:
 PRODUCT README

ABSTRACT
 You can use a script to reduce the destination queues in APAR JR29663, which might increase performance. 

CONTENT
To apply the performance fix to reduce destination queues in APAR JR29663, you are required to uninstall all applications, apply the interim fix, reinstall the applications, and restart the server. For some customers uninstalling applications is cumbersome and undesirable because they have too many applications installed inhibiting the possibility of uninstalling all application before installing the fix.


To avoid uninstalling all the applications, you can apply this script on WebSphere Process Server V6.0.2.x after installation of the interim fix for JR29663, which would delete the unnecessary queues no longer needed after applying JR29663. 

Apply the attached script using the following instructions: 

Usage: wsadmin [-conntype XXX ] -lang jython -f DeleteQueuePoint.py -busName <busName> [-wpsHome <wpsHome>] 

Notes: 

 * wpsHome is the WebSphere Process Server installation root 
 * busName is the SCA System bus name. This value might vary based on your cell name configuration.
