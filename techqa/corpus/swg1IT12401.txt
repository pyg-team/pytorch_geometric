APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "MQ Advanced V8.0 Virtual System Pattern Type for IBM
   PureApplication System Multilingual (CN7AEML)" includes a
   template "IBM MQ Multi-instance with 2 pairs" that includes
   a default value  for the "Storage Maximum limit (K,M,G)" of
   100M which is insufficient for 2 queue managers.
   
    When creating IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern Type patterns from
   existing templates with this preset default GPFS storage
   limitation value, the pattern with a pair of HA Multi-instance
   IBM MQ components will fail to deploy.
   
    One or both of the following might be witnessed:
    The active and standby queue manager in the VM fail to start.
    The trace.log shows the IBM MQ error (893).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When using the provided template to create your pattern, change
   the GPFS storage maximum value to 1G or higher depending on your
   requirements.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern Type patterns from
   existing templates with a preset default GPFS storage limitation
   value.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The pattern failed to deploy because the GPFS storage maximum
   limitation value in the pattern template provided was set too
   low. The value in the pattern template was 100M but should be
   higher.
   
   Each queue manager requires approximately 100M of space when
   created but this storage requirement will increase with further
   configuration and runtime processing of messages. The same GPFS
   partition might be used in multiple deploys, so the
   configuration needs to allow enough storage for the required
   workload
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ Virtual System Pattern Type pattern template has been
   updated to set the GPFS storage maximum limitation value to 1G
