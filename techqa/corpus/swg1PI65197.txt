APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Portal CF12 and beyond supports using JDK 8 with WAS 8.5.5.10.
   But if the managesdk.sh -setCommandDefault option is set to use
   JDK 1.8 or above then the EJBDEPLOY step in the Portal CF
   install will fail.
   
   This will be fixed in a future WAS CF level.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can either set the managesdk.sh -setCommandDefault option to
   use JDK 1.7.x or install the iFix associated with this APAR.
