Q&A 

Q1. What defines a real large database? I have an MMR user with 2.5 GB mail file does this qualify as "really large"? 
There is no hard number since the specific net/system performance characteristics affect this. I would take it as something to be aware of if there are application databases that are significantly larger than a typical mail file. And something that might need to be analyzed on these databases if there are performance issues. 


Q2a. Since changing iNotes auth from Domino to AD, iNotes unread status is out of sync. Why, and is there a fix for that? 
Unread marks are per user. Using a new credential name will create a new unread mark table. 


Qb. We reference the user's Domino name in a field in their AD account. Have not added the user's AD to our ACL. So it should be the same user, no?  * It was my first idea. I recommend to use the IBM tool to review the unread table. 
 * Maybe look to name mapping the AD folks to the Domino name so that the distinguished name Domino treats the user as is consistent to who they were known as before



Q3. In the iNotes issue, re bad user. What would happen with the user profile in iNotes (guess it would mismatch)? 
You'd have a different unread table for the mail file owner than the user logging in with delegate access. 


Q4. You indicated there is a log in the cache.ndk file. So what happens if a user shuts down Notes, deletes their cache.ndk file and other things because they're trying to get something working again. What happens with the unread marks at that point? When they start up and it builds a new cache.  * To my knowledge, the replication of the unreads via the newer activity unread log, which is what gets created when you enable replication of the unreads. That should be able to handle that properly. There's been some discussion of apparently some shortcomings when you either move replicas or when you move the cache on the client. It's not clear to me what all the issues are there. Without specific cases and without it a reproducible scenario, it's hard for me to answer that specifically. 

 * Technically when you create a new replica, part of the replication is to replicate across the Activity log. When you have replication enabled on the .nsf. I'm more accustomed working on it from server to server and that generally works. I'm not sure how the client interacts with it that could interfere with that at this point without having a specific problem to understand. 



Q5. State of the Activity log is dependent on the client time stamps. How far out of sync in time can the Notes desktop be with the server and still have things work correctly? Person's desktop is 10 minutes ahead or behind the server time. How much time difference is going to cause a problem?  * It should be able to get the deltas based on which server it is replicating with and pick up the new activity since then. It should be based on where you're pulling from relative to the replication history for that specific source and destination. It shouldn't interfere with different source and destination time. If there is an issue there I'm not aware of it. 

 * If the client was behind, I don't think that would be as bad as if the client was ahead. If the client was 30 minutes ahead, it wouldn't be able to sync - the time stamps would be wrong. Eventually it would catch up. If the client was ahead and time stamped documents 30 minutes ahead, eventually the replication task is going to see that and pick it all up. I think it's only a matter if we're saying 3 months ahead, then it's going to take 3 months for that to catch up. 



Q6. We have a customer who is geographically dispersed. We're considering using extended administration servers. In your presentation you mentioned the AdminP ini parameter. Where you have these extended administration servers (in various regions around the world), would you place that parameter on each one of those extended administration servers, in order for replication in that region to work as you described? 
Yes, I definitely would. Put it on any server that's going to initiate the new replica. 


Q7a. Question about the in-house tools that only IBM has access to. Why is that? I'm inclined frankly to skip over all of the troubleshooting and immediately open a PMR and troubleshoot with those tools. and use other information to supplement IBM's information to get a resolution when the problem is involved. So I'm wondering why we can't have those tools and what your thoughts are on that process? Should we be going to IBM right away for quick expedited resolution? 
- That's a really great question. From my perspective, I don't feel that I'm allowed to send out a tool that is listed as internal. I think the tool dump unread is useful. I don't know the reasons why it's not publicly available at this time and I actually hesitated to put it in this presentation. 

- You bring up a great point. Why not just skip all that and open a PMR and run the Unread Tool and see. The thing is that not all the issues have to do with the Unread table being incorrect. But what can help is maybe I have a renamed user or maybe I had two different user names (Joe User is Joe A User at the same time) . So I could see that information. It's only going to give me a subset of information. 

- Generally with internal tools, first of all they haven't gone through quality assurance so we can't release them from the perspective of there's risk involved and the tools haven't been properly tested, and how are users supposed to use them, and if they are allowed to use them under specific circumstances there could be a set of switches or features in those tools that could lead to higher risk. And the other issues are if they are used incorrectly or overly used, they could cause either performance problems or loss of data or things of that nature. 

- So basically the tool hasn't been productized in a way that users could use them in a friendly fashion and not get themselves in trouble, or we're just not sure. Also, it's not part of the product, it's not a feature so there are some legal reasons behind that too.. But if there are tools that are useful to you that you really think should be part of the product, please push so they can be made part of the product. If there's good reason to promote an internal tool to be something that's used for a lot of problem resolution, it'll save you time and money, as far as the development staff is concerned there can be some good motivations to either incorporate that into another tool/utility or promote the tool itself to be more available.

Q8. How many documents can a database handle?  * There's not really a document limit, it's more of a hard data limit. The maximum size of any Notes/Domino database is 64GB. You could have one document with a 63GB attachment or you could have millions of (small) documents.

 * Not related to total number of documents in a database but more so the nature of how they are going to affect things like ID tables which are used to represent things like Unreads and Searches. What could happen is that you could hit a soft limit way before the hard limit of databases due to the way we compress and store ID tables.
