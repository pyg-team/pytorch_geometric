ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product components impacted: MFP server
   Affected mobile development environments: N/A
   Mobile Devices Operating Systems impacted: N/A
   User roles impacted: Administrator
   Distribution: Fix Central
   Versions affected: 8.0
   When adapter is connecting with backend and while processing
   with the response, the following exception would occur in
   server log:
   [8/28/17 14:08:59:533 WIB] 0005a003
   com.ibm.mfp.server.js.adapter.internal.http.HTTP             E
   FWLSE0803E: Cannot find message for id 'contentTypeMismatch' in
   bundle
   'com.ibm.mfp.server.core.shared.messages'" + ". Error:'Can't
   find
   resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key
   contentTypeMismatch'.
   java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for
   bundle

   ServerLogger.java:302)
   This is because MPF detects that the expected content type of
   the response is differing from actual content type of the
   response. The exception indict the problem between
   communication of adapter and the backend.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When using Http adapter that connects to backend, the server *
   * will try to log a warning message if the response type       *
   * mismatch is detected. In MFPF 8.0, it is observed that the   *
   * message that is supposed to be printed was missing from the  *
   * resource bundle that results in the following error in the   *
   * server log:                                                  *
   *                                                              *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added the missing resource for the warning message that is
   supposed to be printed when response type mismatch is detected
   in http adapters.
