Title: IBM Problems with the Due Today count when marking or unmarking a message Waiting For / Needs Action - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When a user marks or unmarks a message either Waiting For or Needs Action with the due today attribute, the due today count for Needs action/Waiting for will be changed accordingly. However, if a user then reloads the page or refreshes the Needs action/Waiting for message list within a short amount of time (several minutes) after marking or unmarking the action, the due today count may not be correct.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Newly marked/unmarked due today messages may not be counted in the number of due today shown in Needs action/Waiting for bubble. It may take several minutes to get messages to be counted.
