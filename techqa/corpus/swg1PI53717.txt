   1.  Install RSA 9.1.2.  Only install the features selected by
   default.
   2.  Install RTC 5.0.2 plug-in
   3.  Restart RSA
   4.  Work Items Perspective is available
   5.  Exit RSA
   6.  Use Installation Manager to modify the RSA install:  Add the
   Requirement Management Integration feature
   7.  Launch RSA
   Work Items Perspective is no longer available
