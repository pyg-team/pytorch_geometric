ERROR DESCRIPTION

   **********************************************
   Title: Email address set by SAP NW adapter is unusable for SAP
   standard program to generate mails to users regarding leave
   system activities.
   
   Problem Description:
   ITIM system can set email address to SAP by SAP NW adapter
   without any error being logged in "View All Requests".
   However the email address is unusable for SAP standard program
   to generate mails to users regarding leave system activities.
   When user open the SAP GUI and retype the email address and
   save, the email address becomes usable.
   
   SAP support has involved, and concluded that the issue is ITIM
   SAP adapter sets "01" to CONSUMER column of ADR6 table, but it
   should be "001".
   
   The reason why updating the email on SAP GUI is that SAP sets
   "001" to the column.
   
   Since i don't know how the adapter sets the email address to
   SAP, (i don't know if the adapter directly sets "01" to the
   column.) Is the following email address format related to this
   issue ?
   
   
   Regarding email address, the adapter's manual says as follows.
   
   To enter an email address on the IBM Tivoli Identity Manager
   form, you must follow this syntax:
   
    a|b|c|d
    a= X for Standard email, or space for not Standard.
    b= is the email address.
    c= X for home email, or space for not home.
    d= is the sequence number.
   
   For example, to enter three email addresses for user Jon Doe:
   
    X|jon.doe@company.com| |01 (standard email)
     |jon.doe@home.com|X|02 (home email)
     |jon.doe@other.com| |03 (other email)
   Or, to enter one email address as the standard and home:
    X|jon.doe@company.com|X|01
   
   
   Can Customer Recreate: Yes
