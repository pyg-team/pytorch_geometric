ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAM ESSO v8.0.0-Windows password changed error
   
   When AD password is forced to be changed for an user during the
   logon
   process, ESSO pops up password change window after the login to
   the
   windows. That user will put a valid new password but it will
   prompt
   saying "Unable to complete the opertaion due to an unexpected
   error.
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   a) Create shared shared with RFID machine policy and Enable
   "RFID-only
   Logon"
       In user policies template -  set to 240 minutes for "time
   expiry, in
   minutes, for RFID -only logon.
   
       Syn the machine policy templates and user policies template
   to the
   target user and target machine.
   
   b) An user with RFID badge will badge in with Card. It will
   prompt the
   user for typing password manually because it is probably the
   first time
   this user logs on to the shared shared desktop first time in the
   day.
   
   c) AFter the login through  the desktop and sign into the ESSO
   wallet on
   the shared shared desktop
   
   d) Log off from the AA and exit the shared shared desktop
   session.
   e) AD admin set this user ad account to "force to change
   password at the
   next log on".
   f) Tap the badge to login to the shared shared desktop without
   asking to
   type in the user's password
       (RFID logon only turned on so that it will NOT  require to
   key in AD
   password anymore.)
   
   g) After getting through the desktop and ESSO will now pop up a
   windows
   says "Your Current password has expired. Please enter a new
   password.
   h) After putting new password and clicking on "Ok"., It will pop
   up a
   "Password Change Unsuccessful" window as below:
        Unable to complete the operation due to an unexpected
   error.
   
   
   Note:
   i) This problem is not seen on "Personal desktop mode" .
   ii) If you type AD password and username to login in Step f)
   when the AD
   account is forced to be changed at the next logon. Eventually,
   user can
   change password without any isue.
   
   
   Desired Behavior: should be changed password for ESSO wallet
   when AD
   passowrd is forced to change either by the AD admin or the
   regular AD
   password change cycle when you tap in RFID badge(without
   manually key in
   user's password - RFID only logon is turned on.)
   
   
   Environment: TAM ESSO v8.0.1.0.10 (Base) IMS, AA base 8.0.1,
   RFID, RFID
   only Logon
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  17741
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Change Password during RFID-only Logon fails immediately with an
   unknown error. This is because the user login state is not
   updated to contain the bind password. Instead, the required
   value is part of the encPassword attribute. Also, during
   synChangePin, the old password does not need to be verified in
   this case, since it is not provided during Forced Change
   Password scenario.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This will be fixed in TAM ESSO 8.0.1 Fixpack 3. LA iFix is
   available from support
