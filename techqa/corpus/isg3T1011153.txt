QUESTION
 How do you use ssh to log into CDE? How can I remotely display CDE environment through my SSH session on my PC? 

ANSWER
Enable X11 forwarding on AIX: 

- Check fileset levels for secure shell:
openssh.base.client
openssh.base.server
openssh.license
openssh.man.en_US
openssh.msg.EN_US
*Note: openssh* is located on AIX Expansion CD.

Check for (and, if needed, edit accordingly) the following entries in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
X11Forwarding yes
XAuthLocation /usr/lpp/X11/bin/xauth

Stop and restart secure shell daemon:
- stopsrc -s sshd
- startsrc -s sshd

Enable X11 forwarding on putty (freeware) or Xemulator application. Xemulator applications and putty are not supported by AIX Support. Here is an example of a putty configuration:

Log in to an AIX system from a PC using an Xemulator application (which is not supported by AIX Support). 

SSH tunnels the X11 session from the first AIX system to second AIX system:

ssh -X -l <user> <hostname>
OR
ssh -Y -l <user> <hostname>
