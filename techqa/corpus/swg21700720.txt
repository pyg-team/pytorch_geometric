VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100691 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0410 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0410]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151]https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100151] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: Multiple products could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
