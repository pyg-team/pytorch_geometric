 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rational DOORS HP Quality Center Interface synchronization fails if the Rational DOORS module is open in exclusive edit mode. 

SYMPTOM
Rational DOORS HP Quality Center Interface synchronization fails if the Rational DOORS module is open in exclusive edit mode in the following scenarios:

This issue was identified as a product defect and logged internally as defect 9533. 


ENVIRONMENT
Rational DOORS HP Quality Center Interface version 3.6 

HP ALM version 11.5x
