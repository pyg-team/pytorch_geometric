ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reproduced on V5R20SP6 PLMDB
   SCENARIO:
   1. Start MS SQL Server Management Studio, RMB on Server and
   select Activity Monitor, and expand the Processes. This will
   bring up the activity monitor.
   2. Open SMARTEAM and login.
   3. Start SMARTEAM Admin Console and log in.
   4. Select any project and go to documents.
   5. Link any document to another folder (for ex: Link
   ???Doc-0000041 c Jet ski  2008x BOM Released' to 'FLD-0000003
   Analysis  New').
   6. Repeat step 5 again (Again link ???Doc-0000041 c Jet ski
   2008x BOM Released' to 'FLD-0000003 Analysis New').
        ==>> Error message is given 'Link is already exists'.
   7. Now close SMARTEAM.
   8. Again open SMARTEAM.
       ==>> We can see that Doc-0000041 c Jet ski  2008x BOM
   Released is already linked to 'FLD-0000003 Analysis New???.
   9. Repeat step 5 (Again link ???Doc-0000041 c Jet ski  2008x
   BOM Released' to 'FLD-0000003 Analysis New').
       ==>> No duplicate link error message is given
       !!KO== > This is indicating the problem!
   10. In SMARTEAM Admin Console, start user maintenance and try
   to add a duplicate user. E.g. fill in the Login with an
   existing  user???s login.
   11. The Admin Console process hangs.  In activity monitor, we
   can see the objectlock.
   12. The SMARTEAM session is still active.
   a. If you close the editor you will get the ???unable to create
   duplicate link??? error message here and the Admin console
   session unblocks.
   b. If you do something else, like update a project (to add
   something to the description) you will also get the ???unable
   to create duplicate link??? error and the console session is
   Unblocks.
   Current Result== >
   1. When user again login to editor and tries to create the
   duplicate link, error message doesn???t come up.
   2. Database gets locked.
   Expected result== >
   1. Error message showing the duplicate link should come up
   when user tries to create a duplicate link.
   2. Database should not get locked.
