APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Metadata import in IBM InfoSphere Metadata Asset Manager using
   JDBC Connector fails due to the invalid "catalog" attribute.
   This error can happen when the driver specifies catalog value
   for the imported data schema objects.
   Error messages such as the following ones are written to the
   import log:
   CDIMR3790E] An error occurred while importing data from bridge
   or connector (CAS/JDBCConnector__1.0). ([CDIMR3857I] Additional
   import error details may be found in the Import Log.)
   [CDIMR0069E] There was an error querying all schemas in the
   database. Failed to parse the metadata XML: Failed to parse the
   metadata XML because the element Value was encountered with the
   invalid attribute catalog.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When serializing the metadata obtained from the data source into
    the XML form so that it can be stored to the metadata
   repository, the connector was incorrectly specifying "catalog"
   attribute instead of "owner" attribute to identify the owner of
   the schema. This results in invalid XML document and the error
   reported during the import process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The JDBC Connector connector code was fixed to correctly specify
    owner attribute instead of catalog attribute.
