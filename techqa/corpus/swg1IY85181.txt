   According to this definition for the S&P agent all data before
   1060422000000000 should be deleted.
   
   But it seems this doesn't work for entries of managed systems
   which are deleted.
   
   Accordingly, the collection, summarization and pruning
   is ALL done by ORIGINNODE (node name).  That is the design of
   the S&P agent.
   
   At worst, the data for 1 agent would be unpruned for 30 days -
   the most that would ever be left behind in the raw table would
   30 days worth and then some summarized data.
   There's really no distinction when a node goes offline and
   when it's uninstalled.
   
   As a S&P code change is unlikely for this issue since the
   S&P agent  always uses ORIGINNODE, my Level 3/Development peers
   have requested a DOC APAR in order to dicument that the DBA must
   manually remove the old data for a removed managed system if
   required.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None, doc issue only.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The administrators guide needs to mention that the Summarization
   and Pruning Agent does not prune data for removed managed
   systems.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A Tech note has been added in order to explain that the
   Summarization and Pruning Agent does not prune data for removed
   managed systems.
