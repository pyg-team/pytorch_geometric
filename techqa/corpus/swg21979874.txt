Ping probe TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If we have requirement to monitor server host availability using Ping Probe and
the requirement is , check availability every 5 mins and alert if host is unreachable for 2 tries. 
How this can be achieved using ping probe properties. 

ANSWER
Netcool/OMNIbus Ping 1.0.0 
we can use this equation to determine how best to set the probe 
property values based on the expected environment: 

(((number of hosts) * (Trip) ) /PingBurst ) + (((Average failures) * 
(Retry * TimeOut)) / PingBurst)

for eg : setting(poll and retry) configured 

Poll : 300
Interval : 10000
Retry : 2
TimeOut : 2500
MaxPingBurst : 5000
as per logs, if a host is unreachable, probe retries 2 more times(within 300 seconds) and mark it as unreachable apparently the interval that it retries is not fixed. 

our requirement is : Ping every5 minutes and need alert on omnibus if its unreachable on 2nd ping. ( i.e. if a node is down we get alert with minimum of 6 minutes and max 10 minutes time )

we want to achieve the following behaviour :-
Probe Pings : 10.56
Node goes down at 11:01
Ping probe pings : 11:02 - Down. probe retries 2 more time. here comes the TimeOut, MaxPingBurst properties and send alerts once its process the retry count of 2. 
Ping Probe pings : 11:07 - Down. 
Alert sent to omnibus : 11:07

we can create a example set of rules file code to discard the first unreachable event, using an array: unreachable_count_array
The example rules file counts the number of time the $host is unavailable, so we could extend the rules code to only send events after N pings as unreachable.
we need to remove the Retry property, setting it to 0 with the rules, as the Retry is unnecessary.
