QUESTION
 How can I limit the number of rows displayed in the DASH Clustered Bar Chart? 

CAUSE
Limiting the number of rows displayed based on a query condition in the DASH Clustered Bar Chart widget

ANSWER
The "Query Condition" setting can be used to control the number of rows shown. In the example below, the condition is to show all records that have a value 300 or greater ( value1 > 300 ). 

NOTE: This setting is in both the Bar Chart, and Clustered Bar Chart. 

Before Query Condition enabled:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21994191&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21994191&aid=2] 

 

After Query Condition set ( see above ), notice that only records with value1 > 300 are displayed.
