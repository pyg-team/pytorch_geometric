Text:
Install installing installed installation fail fails failing failed web sphere TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IA-TIPInstall-00.log shows: 'step_00022_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_eWAS-FP29' "install_6.1.0.29_JDK_for_LinuxX32-eWAS" - ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1. The ANT ant task failed. 

SYMPTOM
Installation on Redhat 5.5 stops with eWAS-FP29 failed to install


CAUSE
System too fast for the installation to continue

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Details of the problem:


Installing TKLM version 2 on a Redhat 5.5 64-bit OS failed with: 

"
Installation failed at step: Embedded WebSphere Application Server

Looking at the IA-TIPInstall-00.log shows below snippet:

Above error indicates that installation is failing when trying to install the SDK package of the eWAS fixpack on the machine. 

To find out the cause, look at this log which showed:

CWUPI0032E: 
Running processes have been detected that may interfere with the current operation. Before installing or uninstalling maintenance package, stop all WebSphere and related processes. Ensure that the following processes are not running:
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tiptklmV2/java/bin/java
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tiptklmV2/java/jre/bin/java
In order to install a TIP/eWAS fixpack, the server must be stopped. ...
...

Inside the installation, stopping the server takes a longer time than proceeding with the next step in the installation on fast systems. That step still detects the server is still running since not all processes have gone down, hence the error. A slower system won't exhibit this problem.

The work around is one of the following if using a VM image:
Either 
1) Reduce the number of processors assigned 
2) Lower the memory allocated.
3) "Disable acceleration for binary translation" would slow things down as well. 
Below is a screen shot how you control these variables:

If not using a VM image, a work around would be to rebuild the Redhat OS image but don't register the system with RHEL. This will prevent the latest Redhat updates from being installed on the system. Those updates speed up the system which may stop the installation as explained above. Then perform the install of TKLM.
