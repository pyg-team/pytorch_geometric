Title: IBM 'Automatic storage information not found for table space xx' seen during rebuild of the DB2 Recovery Expert V2.1 Versioning Repository - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When creating the DB2® Recovery Expert V2.1 Versioning Repository, the following error messages are encountered:

ARY1301E Error updating the Versioning Repository: [IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0100E Wrong number of parameters. SQLSTATE=07001 

ARY1301E Error updating the Versioning Repository: Automatic Storage information not found for table space 86. 

CAUSE
The error message does not mean that the table space uses automatic storage. The program was unable to determine whether or not the table space uses automatic storage (and if so, any related parameter settings). It is possible that an out-of-memory condition could prevent the program from obtaining the information necessary to determine if automatic storage is being used by the table space.

ANSWER
Check the db2diag.log for errors related to memory management. For example, if there are errors that relate to DBHEAP in the db2diag.log, increase the DBHEAP setting for that database and try creating the Versioning Repository again. If this does not resolve the situation, contact IBM® software support for the DB2 Recovery Expert product for further assistance.
