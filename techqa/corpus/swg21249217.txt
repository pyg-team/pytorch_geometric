PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You would like to know the appropriate zSeries cryptographic hardware required to exploit Web Services (WS) Security capability in CICS. This capability relies upon the z/OS Integrated Cryptographic Services Facility (ICSF). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The WS-Security capability can be divided into four areas - encryption, decryption, generating signatures and verifying signatures. Each of these areas uses a number 

of ICSF functions. The following sections detail the hardware required for each function needed for z/OS V1R4.0. (The ICSF function is given in brackets). 

Encryption:
For S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required for the following functions: 

 * Random number generator (CSNBRNG) 
 * Multiple Clear Key Import (CSNBCKM) 
 * Encipher (3DES) - (CSNBENC) 
 * PKA Encrypt (CSNDPKE)


For the Encipher (AES) - (CSNBSYE) function on the S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required. For the zSeries 990 server the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions is required. 

Decryption: 
For the Decipher (3DES/AES) - (CSNBDEC/CSNBSYD) function on the S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required. For the zSeries 990 server the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions is required. 

For the PKA Decrypt (CSNDPKD) function on the S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required. 

Generating signatures: 
For the One-Way Hash Generate (CSNBOWH) function on the S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required. For the zSeries 990 server the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions is required. 

For the PKA Key Token Build (CSNDPKB) function there are no special hardware requirements. 

For the Digital Signature Generate (CSNDDSG) function on the S/390 G5 and G6 Enterprise Servers and zSeries 800 and 900 servers the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature is required. 

Verifying Signatures: 
The Digital Signature Verify (CSNDDSV) function routes requests to the Cryptographic Coprocessor Feature or PCI X Cryptographic Coprocessor. On the zSeries 990, if a PCI Cryptographic Accelerator is active, then commands will be routed there. 


For z/OS V1R7.0 the following extra requirements apply: 

The following services are available when running on a z990, z890 or z9-109 without a PCI X Cryptographic Coprocessor or Crypto Express2 Coprocessor: 

Encryption: 
The PKA Encrypt (CSNDPKE) function with ZERO-PAD formatting only requires a PCI Cryptographic Accelerator. 

The Symmetric Key Encipher (CSNBSYE and CSNBSYE1) functions require the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions service. 

Decryption: 
The PKA Decrypt (CSNDPKD) function requires a PCI Cryptographic Accelerator. 

The Symmetric Key Decipher (CSNBSYD and CSNBSYD1) functions require the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions. 

Generating signatures: 
The PKA Key Token Build (CSNDPKB) function is provided. 

Verifying Signatures: 
The Digital Signature Verify (CSNDDSV) function requires a PCI Cryptographic Accelerator.
