Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Spectrum Scale (CVE-2018-1431, CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732, CVE-2016-0705 ) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Spectrum Scale where:
- a local attacker could obtain control of the Spectrum Scale daemon and to access and modify files in the Spectrum Scale file system, and possibly to obtain administrator privileges on the node (CVE-2018-1431)
- OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key (CVE-2017-3736)
- OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key (CVE-2017-3732)
- OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service (CVE-2016-0705)
