QUESTION
 Why is my STROBJCVN stuck in THDW status 

ANSWER
This is can be caused when STROBJCVN does not have enough memory or processor to efficiently complete it's task. 

Without enough memory, STROBJCVN will be thrashing ( constantly swapping memory in and out) and may never be able to complete. To check to see how much memory you have available, use WRKACTJOB to determine what subsystem your STROBJCVN is running in, then use DSPSBSD option 2 to see what memory pool(s) are used by the subsystem. Then use WRKSYSSTS to see how much memory that the pool(s) have allocated. If it is a very small amount, increase the amount of memory in the pool, or submit STROBJCVN to a subsystem that uses a larger memory pool. On most systems the *BASE pool would be fairly large, and using the QBATCH subsystem normally uses the *BASE pool. 


If your partition only uses .10 or .20 processor, it may take a very long time for STROBJCVN to complete, depending on how much you have to convert, it could take days. To check to see how much processor is allocated to your partition, do a WRKSYSACT, and check the current processing capacity. If it is .10 or .20, you will need to allocate more processor to this partition in order for STROBJCVN to complete in a reasonable amount of time.
