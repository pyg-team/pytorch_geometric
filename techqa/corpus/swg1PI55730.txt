ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 FP2 installed on Apple
   Macintosh OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite. The program runs fine.
   You click on Edit - Options menu, select Language tab. On
   Character encoding for Data and Syntax select Locale's writing
   system. From the dropdown select 'Hebrew' and click Apply or OK.
   This is not working. On output viewer you see the message below:
   
   Warning # 853 in column 143.  Text: Hebrew
   The LOCALE subcommand of the SET command specifies a locale
   for which collation and translation are not available.
   
   You also tried to use syntax to change the locale with below
   command, but receive the same error as above.
   
   Set locale = Hebrew.
   Show locale.
   
   By default Hebrew language is included in locl.map file, so you
   wonder why this is not working.
   On Finder go to Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23/. Right
   click on SPSSStatistics.app and select Show Package Content.
   Then click on contents/bin folder. Locate the file loclmap.xml
   and open it in  textedit.app.
   By default this file already includes a lot of locales, also
   Hebrew, scroll down the file to find the entries for Hebrew.
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   Please see below information as workaround: The loclmap.xml
   entries of IBM SPSS Statistics does not meet the Yosemite
   operating system settings for Hebrew locale.
   For example, when you open Terminal.app and type the below
   command:
   locale -a
   then you will get a long list of all locale settings of this
   Macintosh operating system.
   To get the list for Hebrew only you can also run:
   locale -a | grep he_
   
   You will get this output on 10.10 Yosemite OSX:
   he_IL
   he_IL.UTF-8
   
   When you compare the above parameters in loclmap.xml file of
   Statistics 23 you will see that he_IL.UTF-8 is not included:
       <client-locale name="Hebrew">
           <server-locale name="iw_IL.cp1255"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw_IL.ISO8859-8"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw_IL.8859-8"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw_IL"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="he_IL"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw"></server-locale>
           <server-locale
   name="he_IL.windows-1255"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw_IL.utf8"></server-locale>
           <server-locale name="iw_IL.UTF-8"></server-locale>
           <server-locale
   name="Hebrew_Israel.1255"></server-locale>
       </client-locale>
   
   So, to change this you need to add below line to loclmap.xml
   section for Hebrew:
   <server-locale name="he_IL.UTF-8"></server-locale>
   
   To do this, log in as Administrator of the Macintosh. On Finder
   locate the installtion path for Statistics 23, typically
   installed to Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23. Right click on
   SPSSStatistics.app and select 'Show package content'. After that
   click Contents folder and then bin folder.
   In bin folder you will find loclmap.xml file. Edit it and add
   above line in an XML Editor or with TextEdit.app.
