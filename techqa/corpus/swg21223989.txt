QUESTION
You launched the Domino Administrator client, and you do not not see all of the files and folders in the Domino Directory as expected.

ANSWER
In this case, the ".FT" folders are not displayed in the directory tree.
To resolve this issue, go to the top tool bar and select File -> Preferences -> Administration Preferences. In the Administration Preferences Dialog box, select the "files" tab.

In the "Files" section there is the option "Retrieve only (.NSF, .NTF, .BOX) Domino file types (faster)". Deselect this option, and click the OK button. Press F9 to refresh the Domino Administrator view. You can now see all of the folders.
