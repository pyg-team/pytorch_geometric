ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Agent Builder fails to start with java error:
   /opt/IBM/ITM/AgentBuilder # ./agentbuilder
   java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to locate bundle manifest:
   org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator_1.0.200.v20100503.jar
            at
   org.eclipse.equinox.internal.frameworkadmin.utils.Utils.
    getManifestMainAttributes(Utils.java:208)
   
   The Agent Builder fails to launch with return code 13.
   
   This is the same generic issue as previous DOC APAR IV24572 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24572] was
   opened to address, which listed the RPM packages that should
   provide the pre-requisite" libraries that the Agent Builder
   depends on.
   
   DCF Technote 1600903 was also opened to document the specific
   RPM packages for a specific 64-bit RedHat distribution.
   
   The current Agent Builder manual was updated with some generic
   RPM packages for Suse and RedHat Linux:
   
   Under the "Requirements" section of the 6.3 Agent Builder's
   guide:
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/index.jsp?topic
   =%2Fcom.ibm.itm.doc_6.3%2Fbuilder%2Fab_requirements.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itm.doc_6.3%2Fbuilder%2Fab_requirements.htm]
   ***
   Installing Agent Builder
   To install the Agent Builder, you must have:
   A computer with approximately 400 MB of space, plus the space
   that is required for the agents you develop.
   Agent Builder is supported on the Linux Intel 32-bit and x86
   64-bit, Windows, and AIX&#65449; Operating Systems. For the most
   current information about system requirements, see the Software
   Product Compatibility Reports. For more information about
   running a software product compatibility report specific to
   Agent Builder, see Generate a software product compatibility
   report for Agent Builder.
   Note: The Linux Agent builder requires the installation of the
   latest 32-bit versions of the following packages:
   libstdc++
   libgcc
   libXp
   gtk2
   Further, Red Hat Enterprise Linux requires:
   compat-libstdc++-33
   libXtst
   and SUSE Enterprise Linux requires:
   compat-libstdc++
   xorg-x11-libs
   These packages are available on the Linux operating system
   installation media and Service Packs. Each package can have
   multiple prerequisites which all must be installed.
   ***
   
   The actual RPM packages may have different names than what
   is lised in Agent Builder User's Guide depending on the
   specific distribution / version / architecture of
   Linux being used.
   
   The Agent Builder User's Guide should document the actual
   list of dependent libraries, not the RPM package names
   which may change from one release of Linux to another.
   
   The Agent Builder User's Guide also implies that these
   pre-requisite RPMs need to be available for install of the
   Agent Builder.
   
   The Agent Builder install does not do any pre-requisite
   checking before installation, so it is possible to install
   the Agent Builder without error, only to have the Agent Builder
   fail on launch with a RC 13 when a required library is not
   available.
   
   Suggest making a specific NOTE in the product manual indicating:
   ***
   NOTE: The Agent Builder installation assumes that the following
   pre-requisite libraries are available for when the agent builder
   is launched.  Installation does not verify that RPMs that
   provide
   necessary libraries are available.  The installation will
   complete even if pre-requisite RPMs are missing, but the agent
   builder will fail on startup indicating errors locating /
   loading
   libraries when pre-requisite packages are missing.
   ***
   The product manual should then document a complete list of the
   actual required libraries so that customers can determine the
   RPMs for their flavor of Linux.
