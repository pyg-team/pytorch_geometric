QUESTION
 TEP GUI ISM configuration panel shows ISM agent status = 'out of sync'. The "resync agent" button doesn't help and the agent status is still not OK 

CAUSE
Possible cause of this behavior is that the ISM application support code laid down on TEMS/TEPS/TEP systems is not exactly the same as the ISM agent version itself.

see example below :

ANSWER
In the above example, the ISM agent version installed is 07.30.00, but the ISM application support installed on TEMS/TEPS is not consistent, as it's v 07.30.01
So the ISM agent needs here to be upgraded here to same version, 07.30.01 in this example.
