PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If IBM Business Monitor, IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced, or IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard is installed on a machine and only a Deployment Manager (DMGR) node is created, the IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) will count the Monitor and BPM processor value units (PVU). The licensing inventory software has no way to distinguish between a Monitor/BPM DMGR installation and a Monitor/BPM node installation.

The ILMT count of these nodes is counter to the licensing of IBM Business Monitor, IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced, or IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard. These program profiles can be used in an existing WAS DMGR, on a remote server, without counting toward entitlement. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To exclude items from their PVU calculations in the ILMT:


1. Follow steps 1-3 in http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v53r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.lmt75.doc%2Fcom.ibm.license.mgmt.tutorials.doc%2Fl_excluding_instance.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v53r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.lmt75.doc%2Fcom.ibm.license.mgmt.tutorials.doc%2Fl_excluding_instance.html]

2. In step 4 "Select a reason for the exclusion from the drop-down list", select "Other" and use the following statement in the field:

Licensing term related to DMGR:

Components not used for Establishing Required Entitlements

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program components are not taken into consideration. In other words, Licensee may install and use the following Program components, under the license terms, but these components are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.

All components of the Program when used only for augmenting an existing, compatible Deployment Manager ("DMGR") profile and supporting the remote administration and network deployment of the Program. 

3. Click Exclude.
