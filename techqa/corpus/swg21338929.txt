Title: IBM Two dispatchers running when looking at server administration - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There are two dispatchers in Server Administration UI.
One with the hostname and port number, while the other one uses the fully qualified name of the host and port. The second one does not process any requests.
Trying to stop and unregister the second dispatcher seems to be successful, but re-login and going back to server admin screen shows that it is not removed. The cogserver.log and pogo_yyyy-mm-dd.log indicates TARGET_GUID_MISMATCH.
How do I cleanup this ghost dispatcher? 

SYMPTOM
Received request from a dispatcher that knows me by a different GUID.It sent GUID="47". My GUID is "1". This likely means I am registered in more than one ContentStore. Will reply with a fault.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
DNS entry is using the full machine name instead of the short name for the server.

Change the host names to the fully qualified name in cognos configuration will remove the extra dispatcher.
