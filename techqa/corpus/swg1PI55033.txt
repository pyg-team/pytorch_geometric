APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are importing a sheet from an Excel *.xlsx workbook into
   SPSS Statistics 23.0 FP2.  This is a multi-sheet workbook where
   the sheet names are in Japanese text.  Upon executing the GET
   DATA command, you see this error:
   
   >Error.  Command name: GET DATA
   >(2063) Error reading information for sheet.
   >* Sheet Name: "<Japanese text here>"
   >Execution of this command stops.
   EXECUTE.
   
   The error message gives the impression that it is the Sheet name
   that is the problem.  However, changing it to something mundane
   (like "Sheet1") does not resolve the issue.
   
   Workarounds thus far have been to save as *.xls instead of
   *.xlsx, OR restrict the workbook file to just this sheet.
