Title: IBM Installing ITM 6.1 and ITM 6.2 based Agents into a Windows 64-bit Environment (GSKit and Java considerations) - United States

ITM ITCAM GSKit Java fail install 64-bit hardware TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing ITM based Agents into a Windows 64-bit environment, problems may occur during the GSKit or Java feature installs causing the overall Agent install to fail. 

SYMPTOM
You may see one or both of the following symptoms during the install of ITM 6.1 or ITM 6.2 based Agents: 

1. The install may abort relatively early and create an Abort log under the InstallITM\ subdirectory of your install path.
2. The install may abort later after a failed attempt of installing Java and/or GSkit features, failing to find the required files in the target directories.

CAUSE
GSKit and Java features attempt to install into C:\Program Files by default, and this directory is reserved for 64-bit applications on 64-bit Windows systems. GSKit and Java features are 32-bit applications and as such should be installed into C:\Program Files (x86). ITM 6.1 and ITM 6.2 based Agents do not support installation into the directory C:\Program Files (x86) without manual intervention.



ENVIRONMENT
ITM 6.1 and ITM 6.2 based Agents on Windows 64-bit hardware.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Directories C:\Program Files\IBM\Java142, C:\Program Files\ITM\Java50, and/or C:\Program Files\IBM\GSK7 may contain a directory structure but no files.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, the GSKit and Java features can be installed manually using GUI or silent install as described below, forcing them into the 32-bit directory structure. This is strictly for local installations. Remote install is currently not supported with this method. 

GUI: 

GSKit: 

 * From the media, run the Windows\InsGSKit\setup.exe installer:
   setup.exe ITM61
   When prompted, change the target directory for GSKit from Program Files\IBM\GSK7 to Program Files (x86)\IBM\GSK7.


Java:  * From the media, run the Windows\InIBMJRE\ibm-java2-jre*.exe installer:
   When prompted, change the target directory for Java from Program Files\IBM\Java... to Program Files (x86)\IBM\Java...


Silent: To install GSKit and Java silently as 32-bit applications into the 32-bit C:\Program Files (x86) directory structure, this will require copying the media for the Agent to a writeable network drive or local drive. 

The following are steps to modify ITM or ITM based Agents to install GSKit and/or Java into C:\Program Files (x86)\ : 

 1. Prior to installing, copy the Agent media to a writeable drive. 
 2. Java - Modify InIBMJRE\setup.iss as follows:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
   For ITM 6.1 based Agents,
   szDir=C:\Program Files\IBM\Java142\
   to 
   szDir=C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Java142\ 
 *  
 * 1. GSKit - Modify InsGSKit\setup.iss as follows:
   szDir=C:\Program Files\IBM\GSK7
   to
   szDir=C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\GSK7 
 * 2. Start the silent install from the updated copy of the Agent media, passing the required silent install parameters as described in the ITM based Agent documentation.
