PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM InfoSphere DataStage jobs with IDoc stages designed with IBM InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP R/3 6.5 or earlier do not run with IBM InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP Applications 7.0 

SYMPTOM
Jobs fail with the following (or similar) error message in the InfoSphere DataStage log:

Parallel jobs:
main_program: Fatal Error: Fatal: Shared library (dsidocldenu.so) failed to load: errno = (2), system message = ( 0509-022 Cannot load module 
0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.)

Server jobs:
ds_loadlibrary: Win32 error in LoadLibrary of dsidocld.so - The specified module could not be found. 

or 

ds_loadlibrary: error in dlopen of /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSSAPbin/dsidocd - ld.so.1: uvsh: fatal: /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSSAPbin/dsidocd: open failed: No such file or directory


CAUSE
The IDoc Connector stages in IBM InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP Applications 7.0 are not compatible with the IDoc stages of version 6.5 or earlier. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two possible solutions: 

 1. Manually migrate your IDoc jobs as described in the technote listed below. 
 2. On Information Server 8.5 only: perform an upgrade installation from InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP R/3 6.5 to InfoSphere Information Server Pack for SAP Applications 7.0. Note, however, that this means that the IDoc stages of version 6.5 will co-exist with the IDoc connector stages of version 7.0 and that the jobs in question will continue to run with version 6.5.
