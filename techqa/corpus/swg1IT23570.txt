APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Due to un-anticipated time zone discrepancies as a result of
   daylight saving time ending on different dates at various
   locations around the world, Spectrum Control was unable to
   correctly interpret performance metrics and displayed an
   inexplicable spike in performance graphs.
   
   In an observed case, the Spectrum Control server was located in
   the US Eastern Daylight time zone, while a monitored SVC was
   located in the Atlantic/Azores time zone.  The Atlantic/Azores
   time zone ended Daylight Saving time on October 29, 2017; while
   the US Eastern time zone ended DST on November 5.
   
   The performance monitor trace logs in this case displayed
   duplicate sets of samples starting from 10/29/17 12:00:47 AM GMT
   which I believe it is 2017-10-28 20:00:47 local time (SC server
   time) as shown here:
   
   2017-10-28 20:57:18.679 HWNPM2123I Performance data for resource
   timestamp 10/29/17 12:50:47 AM GMT+00:00 was collected and
   processed successfully. 5890 performance data records were
   inserted into the database repository.
   2017-10-28 21:02:05.864 HWNPM2124W Performance data continuity
   has been broken. The device might have been reset or rebooted.
   87376 performance data records were discarded.
   2017-10-28 21:07:10.258 HWNPM2123I Performance data for resource
   timestamp 10/29/17 12:00:47 AM GMT-01:00 was collected and
   processed successfully. 5882 performance data records were
   inserted into the database repository.
   
   Better handling of this scenario is needed to avoid displaying
   spikes for this reason.
   
   
   
   RECREATE STEPS:
   Observe spikes displayed in performance graphs when DST ends at
   a different time for the monitored storage device as it does for
   the Spectrum Control server
