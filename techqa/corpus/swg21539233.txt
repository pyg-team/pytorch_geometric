QUESTION
 Why is the difference in space allocated for stats ESDS and KSDS not the same percent as the difference in number of records specified in the IDCAMS define? (7.0.4100290.2251524) 

ANSWER
ESDS and KSDS have different record sizes. The KSDS records are much smaller than the ESDS records.

So when the KSDS is defined with 75% of the number of records the ESDS is defined with, the space allocated to the KSDS is not 75% of the space allocated to the ESDS.
