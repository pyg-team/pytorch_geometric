QUESTION
 Does the FIPS option in the appliance setup wizard turn on compliance for FIPS 140-2? 

ANSWER
 

The FIPS option in the appliance setup wizard does not turn on compliance for FIPS 140-2. It turns on compliance for NIST SP800-131a only. 

The current product documentation regarding the FIPS 140-2 Mode Configuration option contains the following incorrect statement: 

"Enable the FIPS mode to turn on compliance for FIPS 140-2 and NIST SP800-131a." 

The correct statement should be: 

"Enable this option to turn on compliance for NIST SP800-131a." 

Note that although the user interface shows the relevant option name as "FIPS 140-2 Mode Configuration", enabling this option does not turn on compliance for FIPS 140-2.
