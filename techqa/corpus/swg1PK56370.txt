APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem is with the display of a multi line static text:
   Create a new field short string or multiline string, add a stati
   c text to the form and add this initialization script:
    my $val=hello.\n\n.my.\n\n.world.\n\n;
    $entity-?SetFieldValue($fieldname, $val);
   this should display:
   hello
   my
   world
   and on the windows client, it is working fine.
   However, on the Eclipse client, it shows just
   hello
   and on the web client it shows
   hello my world
   on just one long line.
   The problem has been reproduced on ClearQuest 7.0.0.0, 7.0.0.0 i
   Fix02, 7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.1 iFix04
   Attached  the customer document with screenshots and the SAMPL d
   atabase where I reproduced the problem
