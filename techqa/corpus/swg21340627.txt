Text:
Permissions filesystem share ntfs access TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While attempting to open a cube in Analysis Studio an error is returned. These cubes may have opened correctly at a previous time. 

SYMPTOM
DPR-ERR-2088 The requested Server Group '' does not exist.


CAUSE
1.) The permissions on the folder or share where the cubes (.mdc) reside may have changed.

2.) The user account running the IBM Cognos service may have been changed to another account.

3.) The privileges of the account running the IBM Cognos service may have been changed.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the user running the IBM Cognos service has Read and Execute access to the directory that the cubes are stored.

If this is a multi-server installation make sure that the account being used to start the Service is the same on all servers. Having different accounts start services in a multi-server install can cause sporadic errors as jobs are executed on the various servers.
