APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating a project in rule designer (RD) from decision
   center, none of the project elements (rule, BOM, ruleflow, ...)
   are downloaded to the workspace if the subbranch name contains
   period / dot [.] (although from the enterprise console every
   project element can be seen).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either use minus sign [-] or underscore [_] in place of period.
   Or, because the problem is specific to ODM 8.5.1, upgrade to
   ODM latest version and, at least, the next version ODM 8.6.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The issue occurs when trying to retrives a baseline and when
   handling the case of baseline with dots in their name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
