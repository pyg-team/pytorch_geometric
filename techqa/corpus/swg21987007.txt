ITNCM; SRVE0068E; Exception TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which logs should I send over to IBM Support to investigate Intelliden related java exception logs in TIP and ITNCM Server? 

CAUSE
We want to know why the following Intelliden related exceptions appear at the SystemOut.log in the TIP server . This TIP server has ITNM/ITNCM Integration.

An example of the exception is shown below : 

"[6/8/16 9:39:41:135 GMT+00:00] 00000024 servlet E
com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception created in one of the service methods of the servlet AuthenticationServlet in application Intelliden R-Series. 
Exception created : java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Array index out of range: 1"


ANSWER
In order to best troubleshoot exceptions - it's crucial to know exactly which task could have contributed or will reproduce the same error . The problem statement when requesting assistance from IBM Support should show this scenario with screenshots if possible.

Then proceed to collect the logs below 

1. On the TIP server :
i) All logs that relate to the timestamp of the issue from the directory - '.<TIP home>profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1 "
ii) Alternatively use the pdcollect tool to gather these logs - the technote below can assist with this :

2. On the ITNCM Presentation Server : 
(a) Screenshot of the problem as described above
â€‹(b) /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/ncm/config/rseries_version.txt
(c) /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/ncm/drivers/.installed_drivers.txt 
(d) Intelliden.log 
(e) Server.out 
(f) Server.err 
(g) WebSphere.out (please take note that we need the real file and not the symbolic link) 
(h) WebSphere.err (please take note that we need the real file and not the symbolic link) 

 

These files should then be reviewed and sent over to IBM Support as seen fit.
