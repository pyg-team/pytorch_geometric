PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 No data in TEP for Data Sources for ITCAM for Application Diagnostics WebSphere Agent 

SYMPTOM
ITCAM for WebSphere TEP workspace Datasources has no data.


CAUSE
WebSphere datasource is defined but there is no traffic for the application using the datasource

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Review the following:


1. Ensure the ITCAM monitoring agent is at level 2 monitoring. This can be set by either configuration or a take action command. 

2. The ITCAM Monitoring agent may need to have the Request Sampling Rate increased beyond the default of 2%. 

3. The application must use Datasources via J2EE Connectors. Consult your application developer to determine if your application uses J2EE connectors to attach to the DB, or its own code. Even if data sources are defined in WebSphere Application Server, the application still may not be using them if the application attaches using its own code. If the application is using WebSphere Application Server data sources and you see SQL activity on the Resource Analysis Tivoli Enterprise Portal workspace, then you should see something on the datasource workspace.

4. The DataSources workspace will show real time data - so it will only be populated with information collected at the time when requests are going through that involve the use of JDBC connections. 
A good way to check if you should have data in this screen is to do the following:

Go to the Request Analysis workspace and check the if the current requests are utilizing any time in the SQL columns (in the Requests - Current Interval table scroll to the last couple of columns) If you can see some metric values in this workspace, go to the JDBC Connections workspace and check if you have current active connections open.
