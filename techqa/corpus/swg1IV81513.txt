APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In customer's environment capacity scan was failing at:
   ---
   continue if {(exists file (parameter "compressedfile" as
   string) whose (size of it <= ((value of setting
   "_BESClient_ArchiveManager_MaxArchiveSize" of client as string
   ) as integer)))}
   ---
   It turned out that the"BESClient_ArchiveManager_MaxArchiveSize"
   parameter was not set on the failing endpoint. Configuring it
   to a value similar like on other endpoints resolved the problem.
   In order to produce scan outputs, it is required to prepare
   compressed archives. Without the parameter in question, the
   scan task action was failing as it was not possible to compare
   the size of output with the boundary parameter value.
   If ILMT/BFI scan fixlets rely on specific parameters, relevance
   conditions should check if this parameter exists/has the right
   value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Access IEM console, go to "Computers" section and access "Edit
   Computer Settings" for the failing endpoint. Next click on the
   "Add" button and create the
   "BESClient_ArchiveManager_MaxArchiveSize" with value of
   "52428800" or similar, like in case of other working endpoints.
   Click on "OK" to confirm.
   
   Wait for the "Action: Change Multiple Settings" to complete. If
   this is OK, then next retry "Run Capacity Scan and Upload
   Results" action for the failing endpoint. This time it should
   work.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * The capacity scan fails when the
   * BESClient_ArchiveManager_MaxArchiveSize property does not
   * exist on the endpoint.
   * EXPECTED RESULTS:
   * If the BESClient_ArchiveManager_MaxArchiveSize property does
   * not exist on the endpoint, it is set during the capacity scan.
   * The scan succeeds.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply appropriate update when available.
