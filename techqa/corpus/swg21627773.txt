Title: IBM A non-primary WebSphere administrator is not allowed by ram.setup application to configure the Rational Team Concert server - United States

Text:
rtc; ram.setup; primary; user; id; Websphere; Rational Team Concert; security.xml TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ram.setup application does not allow non-primary WebSphere administrator to configure Rational Team Concert server. 

SYMPTOM
Error: The User ID: <user id> for login into the Rational Team Concert does not match the primary administration: <user id>


CAUSE
The ram.setup application requires a primary WebSphere administrator to install and configured RAM. For non-primary WebSphere administrators, they cannot configure Rational Asset Manager lifecycle. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two ways that users can validate whether they are the primary administrators of their WebSphere servers. Method #1 provides a friendly GUI; however, users may not know the primary Administrator ID. 

Method #1: 


 1. Login to WebSphere Administrative Console as an WebSphere administrator 
 2.  
 3. Select User and Groups 


A WebSphere Administrator must have "Administrative user roles" and Administrative group roles" options. 

Method #2 
 1. Go to <WAS Installed Directory>/profiles/<profile name>cells<cells name> 
 2.  
 3. Open the security.xml file with a text viewer application
    Note: Users should not manually edit this file. If the files must be edited, please stop WebSphere server and make a backup file of security.xml 
 4. Search for the "primaryAdminId=" attribute to find the primary Administrator ID.


To resolve this Rational Team Concert configuration issue in ram.setup, non-administrators must change their USER ID role to the "primary Administrator" and restart ram.setup from the beginning.
