 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities in Network Security Services (NSS) component affect IBM SAN Volume Controller, Storwize Family and FlashSystem V9000 products. Though the CVE descriptions below document the vulnerabilities in the context of the Mozilla product, the IBM SAN Volume Controller, Storwize Family and FlashSystem V9000 products have resolved the vulnerabilities in the context in which the underlying NSS service is used by these products. 
The applicable CVEs are CVE-2016-2834 CVE-2016-5285 CVE-2016-8635. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2834 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2834]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113870] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-5285 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5285]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in PK11_SignWithSymKey / ssl3_ComputeRecordMACConstantTime when handling invalid Diffie-Hellman keys. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash a TLS/SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119189] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-8635 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8635]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Mozilla Firefox, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a small subgroup confinement attack in Diffie Hellman Client key exchange handling. By confining the client DH key to small subgroup of the desired group, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover private keys.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119190] for the current score
