APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a queue manager ends other than in the normal way via endmqm
   (e.g. due to a sudden machine reboot), then recovery actions by
   the queue manager on restart may result in a damaged queue.
   
   The queue is at risk of becoming damaged in that circumstance,
   if it is used with a mixture of persistent and non-persistent
   messages. This problem may be more prevalent for transmit
   queues, which can often hold both persistent and non-persistent
   messages.
   
   It is also possible that the problem could manifest as the
   reappearance of previously got persistent messages on the
   queue, rather than the queue being reported as damaged.
   
   There is only a very small possibility of encountering this
   problem, due to a number of factors needing to co-exist for it
   to occur.
   
   The typical damaged queue resulting from this problem will be
   of size 1712 bytes, or more likely, 10240 bytes. Examination of
   the q file (by IBM Service) would reveal a non-null head of
   message chain, but no message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   You may encounter this issue if you do not always end the queue
   manager gracefully, via endmqm. In addition, to encounter the
   problem you must also be using some queues with a mixture of
   persistent and non-persistent messages.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   This problem requires the following sequence of operations to
   occur (some are user driven, and some are driven by the queue
   manager itself):
   
   Put some persistent messages to a queue.
   
   Flush the persistent messages to disk, other than by a
   checkpoint. That can happen when setting queue attributes.
   
   Get all of the persistent messages.
   
   Initiate a checkpoint.
   
   After initiating the checkpoint, but before the queue itself is
   checkpointed, put a non-persistent message.
   
   
   That sets up a possibility that the queue checkpoint will fail
   to flush a null head of message chain, and it may also truncate
   the queue to below the q file message area. It is important to
   flush a null head because all the persistent messages have been
   got and we had previously flushed the persistent messages to
   disk.
   
   If the queue manager is hard-crashed immediately after the
   checkpoint, then on queue manager restart the queue file may
   contain persistent messages that had previously all been got.
   Or, if the queue checkpoint operation before the queue manager
   crash truncated the queue, then the queue will be reported as
   damaged on attempting to access it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The queue checkpoint logic was revised to correctly handle the
   problem situation described.
