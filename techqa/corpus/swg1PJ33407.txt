ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   Description of Problem (full details)
   If you have a pick list with icons associated with it, and you
   export the configuration, you can see in the exported xml file
   that the icon information is there, however, when you import
   that xml file, the icon information is not imported.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since testing
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   Yes, occurs on all stations
   Is there a workaround? :
   Modify Bp8Conf.ExpImp.xml and add the following entry under the
   <Import Table="PICK_LISTS_ITEMS" mssql="1" oracle="1">
   section:
   <Icon Name="ICON" Null="1"/>
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Some items are not imported as expected.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   Yes, it can be replicated on multiple systems within CSS
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1 Go into BPF explorer and modify the properties of a picklist
   2 Add icons to one or more pick list items
   3 Export the configuration
   4 Look at the exported xml file and see that icon information
   is included in the xml file
   5 Import that same xml file and look at the pick list items in
   BPF Explorer and notice that the icon information was not
   imported
   Actual Results:
   Icon properties are blank when imported
   Expected Results:
   icon properties should be imported
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s
   ecmdb369572 documents a problem when the icon information was
   not exported in the first place, which was fixed.  This defect
   is for the case where that same information is not imported.
