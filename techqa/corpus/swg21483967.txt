Title: IBM Adding Greenplum ODBC database driver to available ODBC sources for SPSS products - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Currently the Greenplum database does not appear to be supported by SPSS.

I have visited datadirect.com (your ODBC provider) and saw that they have the ODBC for the Greenplum database.

Testing this on my system shows it can work with your products but I need to purchase my own license to continue using this ODBC driver (as the one on datadirect.com is a trial license).

Can you include the Greenplum ODBC driver in future releases of your products? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
An Enhancement Request has been submitted and will be considered for future releases of IBM SPSS Modeler. 

Update: 

Modeler supports Greenplum with Modeler 15; FP1. Please review the Modeler product's compatibility report available on the Support Portal for version and driver information.
