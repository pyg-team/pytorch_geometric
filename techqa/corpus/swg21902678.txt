Title: IBM How to configure IIS URL Rewrite with TM1Web - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 This purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the steps required to use the Microsoft IIS URL Rewrite functionality with TM1Web and TM1 Applications. 

This IIS functionality can be used to remove the default port number 9510 from the URL. It also allows HTTPS access to TM1Web and TM1 Applications, using SSL on IIS web server instead of Applications Server (Tomcat) that is packaged with TM1.

This document does not provide steps to configure https with IIS web server.



ANSWER
1 - Install the Application Request Routing and URL Rewrite extensions of IIS. These can be download here:
[http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing]
http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing [http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing]
http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite [http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite]

2 - Open the IIS management tool, select the server name, and open the Application Request Routing settings.

5 - Select the Default Web Site then select URL Rewrite. Note that we already assume that HTTPS is enabled in IIS.

6 - Add the following inbound rule.

7 - If you use TM1 Applications (pmpsvc) you will also need to create a corresponding rule. Replace tm1web with pmpsvc for the pattern and Rewrite URL property.

8 - If CAM authentication is used, update the URLs listed in the tm1web.html file and planning.html file in the Cognos BI gateway (remove the port number). For example, in the planning.html file you would change this:

var planningServices = ["http://tm1web.sampledomain.com:9510"];

to this

var planningServices = ["https://tm1web.sampledomain.com"];

The URL entries in these files reflect what users enter into their web browser to reach the TM1Web or pmpsvc website.

Also note that this configuration doesn't block access to the TM1Web or TM1 Applications on port 9510. A firewall rule to block incoming requests on port 9510 can be used.
