APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem replicated by development.
   
   DirectSQL() function caches DataSource configuration & does
   not recognise edits unless the ImpactServer is restarted.
   
   
   Steps to replicate:
   1. Start two ObjectServers.
   2. Create a DataSource to connect to ObjServ1.
   3. Creat a Policy with DirectSQL() function running SQL to
   created DataSource.
   
   4. Run Policy.
   5. Edit DataSource to connect to ObjServ2.
   6. ReRun Policy.
   7. Policy continues to access ObjServ1.
   
   8. Restart ImpactServer.
   9. ReReRun Policy.
   10. Policy now accesses ObjServ2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Bounce the ImpactServer to read in DataSource edits to the
   DirectSQL() function cache.
