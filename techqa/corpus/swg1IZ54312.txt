ERROR DESCRIPTION

   Task 20 I did not give a flow action
   Task 30 I did not have a flow action

   Task 20 and 30 should not have a Flow Action.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Anyone using Flow Control to the extent of   *
   *                 supplying a FlowAction value to the JobTasks *
   *                 in a JobPlan.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A JobPlan is a template for a Work      *
   *                      Order and its JobTasks are templates    *
   *                      for Tasks of the Work Order.  Different *
   *                                                              *
   *                      JobTasks can have different values for  *
   *                      many fields, the intention being that   *
   *                      the Tasks created will in turn have     *
   *                                                              *
   *                      different values for the given fields.  *
   *                      This was not working correctly for the  *
   *                      FlowAction field.  A value specified    *
   *                                                              *
   *                      for the first JobTask of a JobPlan was  *
   *                      being copied not just to the first Task *
   *                      created but to all Tasks created when   *
   *                                                              *
   *                      the JobPlan was applied to a Work       *
   *                      Order.                                  *
   *                                                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The FlowAction value in the first JobTask of a JobPlan was
   being copied to all the Tasks created when the JobPlan
   
   was applied to a Workorder (or Change, Release, etc.).  The
   FlowAction value should have been copied only to the
   
   first task and all other tasks should get their FlowAction
   values from the JobTask from which each of them is copied.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem no longer occurs.  The FlowAction field of each
   JobTask is now copied to its proper Task at JobPlan
   
   application time.
