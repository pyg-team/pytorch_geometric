Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the QRadar Risk Manager Policy Monitor, the XML Import action erases all windows settings. 

SYMPTOM
When you follow these steps, submitted questions do not return results and no warning messages are issued: 


1. In QRadar Risk Manager, export Windows Security / Setting Questions in an XML file.

2. Import the XML file from one appliance to another.

3. Open a Question. If you view settings under the question, the settings are blank.

There is no warning for the user, and submitted questions do not return any results. 

The expected behavior is that the import and export function properly on all appliances. The customer cannot use this feature. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, follow these steps: 


1. Review the Status column for warnings. 

2. If a question contains a warning, open the question and edit the dependent parameters. 

3. After you configure the parameters, you can save the question. 

4. Create the components and content, such as assets, saved searches, and references sets, or re-select the windows settings.
