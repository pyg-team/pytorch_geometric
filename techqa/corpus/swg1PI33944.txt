APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the WASService.exe or wasservicehelper.bat command is used
   to create a Microsoft Windows service, and the name specified
   for the service includes a blank space, the service will not
   be used when starting the server via the command line.
   
   For instance, if a service for the dmgr server is created with
   "Deployment Manager" specified as the service name, then the
   service will not be used when using the startManager.bat or the
   startServer.bat commands.
   
   The following error will be seen in the cmd window and in the
   startServer.log file:
   
   ADMU7713E:  WASService command for server dmgr failed.
   Unexpected exit code 3 from running
   C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\WASService.exe -status Manager
   
   The dmgr server will start, but it will not be connected to the
   Microsoft Windows service.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are two workarounds:
   
   1) Start the windows service from the windows service manager.
   
   2) Do not include a blank space in the service name.  (ie,
   specify "DeploymentManager" rather than "Deployment Manager".

   ****************************************************************
   When the WASService.exe or wasservicehelper.bat command is used
   to create a Windows service, and the name specified for the
   service includes a blank space, the Windows Services Panel
   will not detect that the process has started if we start the
   server process from the command line.
   For instance, if a service for the deployment manager is
   created with "Deployment Manager" specified as the service
   name, then the service will not be used when using the
   startManager.bat or the startServer.bat commands.
   The following error will be seen in the cmd window and in the
   startServer.log file:
   ADMU7713E:  WASService command for server dmgr failed.
   Unexpected exit code 3 from running
   C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin\WASService.exe -status Manager
   The deployment manager server will start, but it will not be
   connected to the Windows service.
