PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users can find that file uploads to IBM's Service Request (SR) system experience issues when the upload traffic passes through a Security Network Protection (XGS) sensor that has Outbound SSL inspection configured. 

SYMPTOM
The file upload traffic might be slowed significantly or the upload connection might be lost unexpectedly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be resolved by adding a rule to the sensor to ignore traffic to the IBM SR sites.


 1. Edit the Outbound SSL Inspection policy.
    
 2. Add a rule to the policy to ignore traffic to *www-947.ibm.com. Detailed instructions for configuring rules in this policy can be found in the online Outbound SSL Inspection rules documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_configuring_outbound_ssl_inspection.htm?lang=en].
    
 3. Save and deploy your changes.
