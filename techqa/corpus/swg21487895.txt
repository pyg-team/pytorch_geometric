 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After a complete install my Text Analysis for Survey as Admin and launch TAFS 4.0; I am getting error message "invocation.invalidlicense." I have a network license. I don't get this error doing the same network install for TAFS 3.0. What is wrong with this version? How can I fix this error? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error usually happen when your product is not reading any license. Please confirm make sure that you did activate the license for the particular version. If you are using a network license, make sure the license is being activate on the server. This should resolve the error if you do have proper license
