Title: IBM Cannot take ownership of nodes. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The application is set to offline, a few admin links are run then it is set back online. Unfortunately we cannot take ownership of some nodes, however if we set allow bouncing to be turned on and then we have the submit right to the node. 

SYMPTOM
User <username> is editing the data, do you want to take ownership from <username>? Click "Yes" but still cannot take ownership.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run GTP for the application. A "VALIDATE_USERS" job is created and executed. When it completes, the user can take ownership of the node from other user.
