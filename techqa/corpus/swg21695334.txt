Title: IBM The frs-curi.sh script fails to import widgets - United States

Text:
dash widgets frs-curi import operation failed registry services dash dashboard restcli installation WASX7017E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Creating the Registry Services Dashboard Provider fails during the import of widgets 

SYMPTOM
During the create process of the Registry Services Dashboard Provider, the following error may be displayed while executing the frs-curi.sh (both install and update) script:
Widget import operation did not complete successfully
WASX7017E: Exception received while running file "frs-curi.py";
exception information: com.ibm.bsf.BSFException: exception from Jython:
Traceback (innermost last):
File "<string>", line 624, in ?
File "<string>", line 203, in _update
File "<string>", line 252, in _importWidgetDefinitions
Exception: Widget import operation did not complete successfully


ENVIRONMENT
Jazz for Service Management 1.1.0.3

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The installation logs are indicating that the frs-curi.sh script failed at the very last step, where it will import Registry Services widgets:


In the wsadmin.traceout log:

... 

Since the widgets were not imported, when trying to open one of the pages (which uses these widgets), you will get errors in Jazz.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The installation can be manually patched by importing the Registry Services widgets into DASH, using this command:

<DASH_HOME>/bin/restcli.sh import -username <username> -password <password> -source <widget_definition_file>

For example:
/opt/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin/restcli.sh import -username <was_username> -password <was_password> -source /opt/IBM/JazzSM/registry/installableApps/frs.dash.widgets.zip

Note that you have to replace <was_username> and <was_password> with the user and password used to install JazzSM (usually smadmin).

After importing the widgets, you will have to restart DASH and Registry Services applications in Websphere.
