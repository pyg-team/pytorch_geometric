Title: IBM OmniFind Enterprise Edition: SharePoint crawler gives 'Unable to connect to server' - United States

Text:
OEE; SharePoint TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using OmniFind Enterprise Edition and I have installed fix pack 2.
Now I am trying to create a crawler against SharePoint 2007. As I go through the crawler setup Wizard, after I enter the Web service URL and port number, I get the following error message:

FFQED0002E Unable to connect to server http://test.ibm.com/_vti_bin/ESSPServices.asmx with user xyz\userid. 

SYMPTOM
You are entering a Web service URL similar to the following: 

http://test.ibm.com/_vti_bin/ESSPServices.asmx


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Web service URL to use during crawler creation should be similar to the following: 

http://test.ibm.com/

If that does not work, try using the IP address that corresponds to the Web service URL instead:
http://123.456.789.1/
