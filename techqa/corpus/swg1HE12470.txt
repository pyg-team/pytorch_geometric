APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Indexing Microsoft Exchange message return receipts with IBM
   Content Collector P8 Content Search Services Support fails with
   failure code 1024 indicating that the parsing of the XML failed
   because the XML is not well formed. Error messages like the
   following ones are written to the IBM Content Search Services
   log:
   
      IQQI0005E The document with ID {<docid>} cannot be indexed.
   Causes of the problem:
      IQQP0028E The XML document {<docid>} cannot be parsed because
   its format is invalid. Error details:
      Character reference "&amp;#27" is an invalid XML character.
      IQQG0020E org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Character reference
   "&amp;#27" is an invalid XML character.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Usually, IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Services
   Support ensures that the XML document being generated for the
   email document does not contain any invalid XML characters. With
    message return receipts, however, a message file contains other
    embedded message files. For these message files, no filtering
   for such XML characters was applied. Thus, invalid characters
   were added to the XML document causing indexing to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, IBM Content Collector P8 Content
   Search Services Support also filters embedded message files for
   invalid characters, so that such characters are not added to the
    generated XML file.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
