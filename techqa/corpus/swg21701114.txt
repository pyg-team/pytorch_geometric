Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Transactions. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]

DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information.

This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

CVSS Base Score: 5.00
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For ISM disable the RC4 ciphers in all monitors. To disable the RC4 ciphers, update the monitor properties: SSLCipherSuite and BridgeSSLCipherSet. For example, to disable RC4 ciphers in the HTTPS monitor, update the https.props file to include

SSLCipherSuite : "AES:3DES:DES:!EXP"
BridgeSSLCipherSet : "AES:3DES:DES:!EXP"
