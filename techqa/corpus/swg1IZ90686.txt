ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Mobile Connect Mobility Client for Nokia release 6.1.4.
   
   The Lotus Mobile Connect install program for Symbian uses a
   Nokia API to create entries in the device communications
   database and then programmatically adds the VPN service
   records.  Once this is complete the install program verifies
   that all of the communication database records are pointing
   to each other as appropriate.  With the release of the Nokia
   S^3 devices there has been a small change in the relationships
   between the commuications database records and therefore the
   existing Mobility Client install verification logic is failing
   the install.  This APAR is being written to address that
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The reported problem will not be resolved by the Lotus Mobile
   Connect development team.  After carefully weighing the work
   required to allow the Mobility Client to run on the Nokia S^3
   devices and the apparent Nokia strategy to embrace the Windows
   Phone operating software a decision was made not to move ahead
   with the work required to resolve the reported issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The documented issue with the Mobility Client on Nokia S^3
   devices will remain unresolved and closed as a Permanent
   Restriction for the product.
