PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in version 5.0
   In compact mode, we reduced the horizontal padding too. This
   allowed the text in the cell to flow further to the right and be
   clipped. Increased the right padding fixed the problem. This
   forces the text to wrap 'sooner'. This doesn't affect the
   'compactness' of the row, since the compact row is to reduce the
   row height.
