APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
   overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns
   backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual
   A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS
   response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and
   execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application
   to crash.
