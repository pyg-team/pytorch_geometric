PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <This is fixed as how it works in REL 7. A yes/no message will
   be popped up when a new location is entered:
   
   The location and asset combination you have entered would
   default a different GL account than is currently specified on
   the work order. Would you like to update the work orders GL
   account based on the new asset/location.combination? Clicking
   Cancel will return you with no changes.
