APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following message is issued repeatedly in the CMAS during
   startup:
   .
     EYUTS0063E applid Topology encountered an error processing
     a change to a CICS system group.
   .
   The stack for the abending task is: XLOP, TIST, TSLA, TSEC, XZPT
   and the trace shows an exception entry with debug test RecurGrp
   trace point ID 6.  The exception occurs on function EXTPSGC.
   This error occurs as CMASes are starting up and receiving
   updates to the DREP that occurred while they were down.
   .
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): If a CSYSDEF or
   CSYSGRP is removed in the MP CMAS for a CICSplex, after
   repository synchronization completes with a MP CMAS it is
   possible to receive the following messages in the non-MP
   CMASes:
   mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss EYUTI0004I applid  Topology Initialization
                                  complete.
   mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss EYUTS0013E applid CICS System sysname
                                  Not Found.
   mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss EYUTS0009E applid CICS System Group grpname

   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all CMASes must be restarted.  Note    *
   *                 that the restarts do not need to occur at    *
   *                 the same time.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   When a CMAS initializes, method EYU0TIML (TIML) is called to
   perform initialization for the Topology component.  As part of
   this processing, TIML calls method EYU0TIPC (TIPC) to read all
   Topology records for each CICSplex from the data repository, and
   create data structures for them.
   
   If records are added after initialization, then after the record
   is written to the data repository, method EYU0XDCR (XDCR) will
   generate an event to the Topology long running task TIST, which
   will then cause the appropriate data structures to be built for
   the record.
   
   If a CMAS is the maintenance point for a CICSplex, then it is
   not possible for records to be added to the data repository for
   the CICSplex until the CMAS completes initialization.  However,
   if a CMAS is a non-maintenance point CMAS, then it could receive
   updates for the data repository from the maintenance point CMAS
   while it is performing Topology initialization.  When this
   occurs, it is possible for TIST to attempt to build data
   structures for records that have already been processed by TIPC,
   which can result in the errors described above.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A non-maintenance point CMAS receives data repository updates
   from the maintenance point CMAS through method EYU0XDRS (XDRS).
   On entry, XDRS acquires a lock exclusively to serialize
   processing of all XDRS executions.  Method TIML has been updated
   to acquire this lock exclusively prior to calling TIPC, and to
   free if after TIPC completes processing.  This will ensure that
   records processed by TIPC are not also processed by TIST.
