QUESTION
 How to review AMM reporting power source issues. 

ANSWER
Message log is showing is showing the following output:
Warning: Got error from DevMgr task:/nz/kit.7.2.0.6/bin/adm/ibm_amm --loc=spa1.mm --status, RetCode:5, 

Listing out ssh mm001 list -l 2 showed the power connections where not 
listed. I saw no power issues.. 

ssh mm001 list -l2 

stem> list -l 2

ssh mm001 fuelg - to check the power domains:

system> fuelg 
Note: All power values are displayed in Watts. 

Total DC Power Available: 5760 
Total AC Power In Use: 1593 
Total Thermal Output: 5435 BTU/hour 

Power Domain 1 
-------------- 
Status: Power domain status is good. 
Modules: 
Bay 1: 2880 
Bay 2: 2880 
Power Management Policy: Basic Power Management 
Power in Use: 807 
Total Power: 2880 
Allocated Power (Max): 2634 
Remaining Power: 246 

Issuing a force restart of the AMM cleared the condition:
ssh mm00x reset -T mm[x]

This cleared the issue and stopped the sysmgr log reporting the power issue.

a ssh mm001 list -l2 showed all connections.

If this does not work I would suggest a fail over of the AMM.
Followed by a site visit by a field tech to reseat the AMM.
The followed by a replacement if necessary.

Additional commands to use in problem determination.

To get AMM FRU:
ssh mm001 info -T mm[1] 


fail over Amm1 to Amm2
ssh mm001 reset -T mm[1] -f 


snmp walk on amm
snmpwalk -c public -v1 mm010 system
