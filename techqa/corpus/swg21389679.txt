CAUSE
Java and/or netman process is still running from a previously failed or uninstalled TWS installation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check for any java processes that may be running under the TWS user and kill the process. 

NOTE: If there are multiple instances of TWS installed on the workstation, kill the Java process for the uninstalled/failed installation instance only. 

Also, check that the netman process is not running. Again, ensure that you kill the netman process for the uninstalled/failed installation instance only. 

Log in as root, kill - 9 these processes, and start the TWS installation again.
