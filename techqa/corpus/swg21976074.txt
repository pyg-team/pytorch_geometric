 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do we get an error when we view certain attachments of type pdf on collection notes in IBM Atlas using Google Chrome?


CAUSE
We get " Duplicate headers received from server error" when you launch the attachment in the browser. This is caused by a comma in the pdf attachment name

ANSWER
To make those problem attachments work across browsers, the attachment should not have a comma in the file name.
