PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We have configured Single Sign On (SSO) via SPNEGO on FileNet Workplace XT (WPXT). When I log out on WPXT from "Browse" or "Search" page, SSO works properly. However, when I tried to log ou from "My Workplace" page, it will return blank page. 

ENVIRONMENT
Websphere Application Server 8.x

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 The following error can be found from Systemout.log

"[10/18/13 13:46:38:456 EDT] 0000010a WASSessionCor E SessionContext
