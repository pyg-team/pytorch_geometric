APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are trying to DISABLE the JVMSERVER after seeing
   pthread_create failures. You notice that the JVMSERVER never
   gets disabled after issuing the command to do so.
   
   The SET JVMSERVER DISABLE command is leaving the
   JVM stuck in a DISABLING state as a direct result of the
   pthread_create failures.  These pthread_create failures have
   caused the JVMSERVER current thread count to get incremented by
   1 each time.  In the SJ Domain in the dump you can see that the
   count is a non-zero value even though no tasks are running in
   the JVM.  The disable processing will wait for the count to
   reach 0 before terminating the JVM.  In this scenario that will
   never happen.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: JVMSERVER unable to be disabled after   *
   *                      a failure to create a thread due to     *
   *                      insufficient below the line storage.    *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A JVM server is serving Java requests and CICS region has nearly
   run out of below the line storage. A request comes in and
   DFHSJTH is called to handle it. DFHSJTH calls CICS dispatcher to
   create a new T8 TCB which fails due to insufficient below the
   line storage. DFHSJTH does not back out the thread/TCB
   allocation and leaves an incorrect thread counter. This counter
   results in the JVM server cannot be disabled unless CICS is
   recycled.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSJTH has been changed to back out the thread allocation when
   CICS dispatcher fails to create a new T8 TCB due to insufficient
   below the line storage.
