For Busines Admin UI the issue can be resolved by applying the fix manually. If the UI has been customized and the source code is already available skip step #1 and #2. 

1. Locate the com.ibm.mdm.sample.ba.webapp.ear.zip file from MDM sample. 
2. Import the projects into RAD and follow Downloading, configuring and deploying the sample [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.5.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.dat.stdshp.doc/t_download_configure_ear.html] 
3. Open SessionFilter.java from CommonUIModel 
- In doFilter method add the below code provided code at line number 75 

//PSIRT 88737 - X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. 
httpResponse.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN"); 

- After the code changes do build all 

4. Export CustomerBusinessAdmin as EAR 
Then From RAD, File -> Export -> Ear File (Under Java EE) 
in EAR Export wizard 
- select EAR Project name as 'CustomerBusinessAdmin' 
- Then provide the destination , that earfile name 

5. Deploy the this new exported EAR on server 
Note: Before installing EAR on server make sure ClientAuthentication.properties and mdmUIConfiguration.properties of propertiesUI.jar have valid connection properties. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
