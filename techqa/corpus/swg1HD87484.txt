PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   Additional
   Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   Is the DLNAME
   supported by SmarTeam CATIA integration?
   .
   Reason:
   The answer
   is in the CAI user documentation: "Administration
   Task/Mandatory Setting/Document localization
   strategies"
   SmarTeam (CAI) manages the links of documents
   saved in the database in this hierarchical order:
   Priority 1:
   folder of the pointing document (to find documents in the
   user's work directory)
   Priority 2: folder of the link (to
   find shared non-revision managed documents)
   .
   DLNAME are not
   part of  Folder of the Pointing  and  Folder of the link
   strategy.
   So it is NOT supported. Hence Documentation update
   is not necessary.
