PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 7.0 modifications will be available in the January
   2010 update to the Information Centers. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   The modified documentation will be available in the January
   2010 update to the Information Centers.
   
   The following Version 7.0 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: PM03896
   Problem: You can configure a timeout for connection validation
   by the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver through a
   data source custom property in the data source configuration
   panels of the administrative console. By default, connection
   validation is disabled. When you save the configuration for
   the data source, the administrative console supplies only the
   option that is selected. In the case of an Oracle data
   source, the Validation by JDBC Driver selection item in the
   administrative console is disabled unless the
   validateNewConnectionTimeout property is added to the custom
   properties for the WebSphere Application Server data source.
   
   The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server does
   not include information on this relationship. It might be
   confusing that the "Validation by JDBC Driver" option in the
   administrative console is disabled when an Oracle data source
   is used.
   
   Resolution:  The "Configuring connection validation timeout"
   and "WebSphere Application Server data source properties"
   topics will include a note to indicate that the
   validateNewConnectionTimeout property is required for an
   Oracle data source. Both topics will include the following note:
   
   Avoid Trouble: For an Oracle data source, Validation by JDBC
   Driver displays on the administrative console only after the
   validateNewConnectionTimeout property is added to the custom
   properties of WebSphere Application Server data source
   properties. The validateNewConnectionTimeout property is used
   for JDBC 4.0 driver validation and can be specified using the
   administrative console.

   ID: 633356
   Problem: When you use the MapEnvEntryForWebMod option for the
   AdminApp object install, installInteractive, edit,
   editInteractive, update, and updateInteractive commands using
   wsadmin scripting, you need to be aware of using "null" in the
   description. The MapEnvEntryForWebMod option edits the
   env-entry value of the Web module and you can use this option
   to edit the value of env-entry in the web.xml file. If you
   leave the description as "null" after running the default
   bindings, WASX7017E and WASX7111E exceptions occur. You must
   change the description to "*" to avoid the exceptions. The
   Information Center for WebSphere Application Server does not
   describe this issue.
   
   Resolution: The "Options for the AdminApp object install,
   installInteractive, edit, editInteractive, update, and
   updateInteractive commands using wsadmin scripting" topic
   will be updated. Specifically, the MapEnvEntryForWebMod
   information will be updated to add a note about using a "null"
   value for the description. The following note will be added:
   
   Avoid Trouble: After running the default bindings, change the
   null value to * before you run this task. The * value is the
   wildcard value that lets any description be a match. If you
   leave the value as null, WASX7017E and WASX7111E exceptions
   will occur when you run the MapEnvEntryForWebMod task.
