Title: IBM How to configure the batch number format for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
batch number ID TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I change the batch numbering configuration for Taskmaster? 

CAUSE
When Taskmaster Client runs a batch creation task, such as a scan task, it first requests a new batch number from the Taskmaster Server. Taskmaster Server generates a new number via a component called batchn32.dll. A library of files comes with the Taskmaster install that can be used to overwrite the default batchn32.dll to change the batch numbering scheme. These files are named batnewXX.dll where XX is a number from 01 to 15 and represent the different formats available. 

Note: This method is replaced with the batch numbering template system in 8.1 and newer. For information on batch numbering in 8.1, see What's New in Version 8.1 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/datacap/v8r1m0/topic/com.ibm.dc.install.doc/dc_whats_new.htm] in the Datacap Information Center.


ANSWER
Procedure 

 1. Stop Taskmaster Server. 
 2. Copy the desired BATNEWxx.DLL from the \Datacap\dcshared\batchnew folder to \Datacap\dcshared\BATCHN32.DLL, changing the name to overwrite the existing file. 
 3. Using the appropriate database tool, edit the Taskmaster engine database, enginfo table. 
 4. Clear the db_LastBatch, db_lastQueue and db_LastDate fields. This is not necessary for all changes, but if you cannot create a batch after making the change, be sure to do this step. 
 5. Restart Taskmaster Server.
