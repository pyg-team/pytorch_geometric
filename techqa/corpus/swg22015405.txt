Title: IBM File descriptor leak in Oracle 12c Client code can lead to failures and / or crashes in Launcher - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A known file descriptor leak in the Oracle 12c Client code has been identified. The open file descriptors are possibly due to using secure connectivity feature between the Oracle Client and the Oracle Server. When the Launcher system has been running for a certain period of time, the available file descriptors can be exhausted, causing a number of issues, including function / map failures and maybe even a crash. 

SYMPTOM
Using the pfiles utility, it is possible to list the file descriptors used by a process, and a large number of entries, such as the following example for one of the leaking file descriptors, can be seen as open and never closed (the pfiles list that would keep increasing the number of these entries).

O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE
/devices/pseudo/random@0:urandom



CAUSE
The cause is a known file descriptor leak in the Oracle 12c Client code

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Launcher 9.0.0.x on the Solaris platform where the system uses the Oracle adapter.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use the pfiles utility to monitor the open file descriptor list / count.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Either downgrade to Oracle 11g client or obtain a fix from Oracle.
