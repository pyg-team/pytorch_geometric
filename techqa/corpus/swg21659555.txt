QUESTION
 Is Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 supported with Datacap Taskmaster? 

CAUSE
Microsoft has set Internet Explorer 11 to automatically install as part of Windows Updates on operating systems that currently have Internet Explorer 10 installed.

ANSWER
Internet Explorer 11 is supported as of Datacap Taskmaster 8.1 Fix Pack 2. If using an earlier version of Datacap, users running Internet Explorer 10 should do the following to prevent an automatic upgrade from occurring. 

 1. Run Internet Explorer 10. 
 2. Select Help, About Internet Explorer. 
 3. Uncheck Install new versions automatically. 
 4. Close the browser.


If using an earlier version of Datacap and the browser has already been upgraded to Internet Explorer 11 it must be uninstalled. 

 1. Through Control Panel, select Programs and Features. 
 2. Select View installed updates. 
 3. Locate Internet Explorer 11 on the list, right click on it and select Uninstall. 
 4. Reboot the workstation.


After uninstall, Internet Explorer will automatically revert back to running Internet Explorer 10 and the previous procedure may be run.
