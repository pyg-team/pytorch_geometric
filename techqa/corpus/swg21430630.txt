PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The pure event situation of the Extended Oracle Database agent does not fire on the subnode where the subnode ID is longer than or equal to 25 characters. 

The format of the subnode ID is <DBConnection>-<Instance>-<Hostname>.

The pure event situation is defined for the following pure event attribute groups for the Extended Oracle Database agent:
Agent_Event, RDB_Alert_Log_Details, ASM_Alert_Log_Details. 

SYMPTOM
The pure event situation does not fire even if the condition is satisfied. 

Set RAS1 trace parameter at agent side,
KBB_RAS1="ERROR (UNIT: kra all)"

Similar information is displayed in the krzagent log file:
(4B9687B9.02BD-12:kraafira.cpp,3673,"CheckDistributionList") No match - ORIGINNODE RZ:<DBConnection>-<Instance>-<Hostname>:RDB1100309183905000 not present in the distribution list of situation A_RZ_OracleAlertLogWarningExist.


CAUSE
If the subnode ID has longer than or equal to 25 characters, the agent framework truncates the ID. The truncated subnode is not present in the distribution list of situation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the following workaround for this problem: 


1) Reconfigure the Extended Oracle Database agent. 
Change the agent instance name or the database connection name to have fewer characters, and let the length of subnode ID <DBConnection>-<Instance>-<Hostname> be less than 25. 

2) Restart the Extended Oracle Database agent.
