Title: IBM ICM XML: DKDDO.toXML() writes content from memory only - United States

Text:
toXML; DKDDO::toXML; DKDDO.toXML TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I call DKDDO.toXML(), but some or all of the data does not appear in the XML file. Does DKDDO.toXML() retrieve any information before writing to XML? 

CAUSE
DKDDO.toXML() only writes to file what is retrieved into the DKDDO object in memory. Any information not available to the toXML() operation will not appear in the XML file.

ANSWER
Call retrieve with any desired retrieve options to adequately populate the DKDDO prior to calling DKDDO.toXML(). 

Example 

 * 
 * // Given a DKDDO object in variable named 'ddo'.
 * ddo.retrieve(DKConstant.DK_CM_CONTENT_ITEMTREE + DKConstant.DK_CM_CONTENT_YES); 
 * ddo.toXML(new DKNVPair("FILE","C:\\temp\\myFile.xml"),"C:\\temp\\",0);
