APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  REP_RT_ACTIVE_HOLD_DETAILS_VW has performance issues.  Running
   a simple select count(*) from the view does not return even
   after 8+ hours of  running.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer may try increasing their application server connection
   timeout, if the Atlas product log indicates that the connection
   was rolled back due to timeout.  If this is why the Report was
   not able to complete, then increasing this value may allow the
   Report to complete. Note that, depending on data volumes and
   relationships, Reports may take several hours to complete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The reporting views, rep_active_hold_details and
   hold_notice_for_performer, do not allow acceptable performance
   response for extremely large volumes of data.   It affects the
   Who's on Hold and Hold Notice Confirmation Reports, the Matter
   Metrics Extraction Task and Matter Real Time Metrics Extraction
   Task.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now from FixCentral in 6.0.3.3
