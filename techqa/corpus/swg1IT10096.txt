APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  <html>Managed File Transfer is using the user.dir system
   property to
   set the path for the output0.log and the trace output. This is
   incorrect behavior as these log files should still be written
   to the default log directory within the agent directory
   structure.
   </html>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  <html>Remove user.dir system property.
   </html>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   The issue affects users of WebSphere MQ Managed File Transfer
   V7.5 and V8
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The user set the User Working Directory via the system property
   "user.dir" for the agent's Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When this
   was set, the Managed File Transfer agent logs and the
   File/Database logger logs were written to the path set for the
   "user.dir" property. This is incorrect behaviour, the agent log
   files should be written to the default log directory within the
   agent directory structure and the File/Database logger logs
   should be written to the default logger logs directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue has been corrected so the agent log files are written
   to the agent logging directory and the File/Database Logger logs
   are written to the logger logging directory regardless of the
   value of the "user.dir" Java System Property.
