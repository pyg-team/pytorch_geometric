ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CANNOT CUT AN INSTANCE FROM A NHA IF THE
   SAME CHILD INSTANCE IS LOCKED BY SOMEONE
   ELSE.
   .
   Problem Description-CANNOT CUT AN INSTANCE
   FROM A NHA IF THE SAME CHILD INSTANCE IS
   LOCKED BY SOMEONE ELSE.
   .
   SCENARIO :
   Starting structure
   PRC
   |_ASSY1
   | |_ASSY3
   | |_PART1
   | |_PART2
   | |_PART3
   |
   |_ASSY2
   |_ASSY3
   |_PART1
   |_PART2
   |_PART3
   1) We lock the parts as shown in the below
   2) User1 cut the the PART3 on which he have the
   lock
   PRC
   |_ASSY1
   | |_ASSY3 (lock usage+reference user1)
   | |_PART1
   | |_PART2
   | |_PART3 (lock usage user1) <--- CUT (MOVE)
   |
   |_ASSY2
   |_ASSY3 (lock reference user1)
   |_PART1
   |_PART2
   |_PART3 (lock usage user2)
   3) The system give the following error message
   For the cut: "Instance lock by some other user"
   .
   ERROR MESSAGE(S) : "Instance lock by some
   other user"
   .
   SEVERITY JUSTIFICATION :
   There is no viable way to identify which usage is
   being lock by another user, other then loading all
   the usages.
   This could greatly impact concurrent engineering if
   some locks (that grant no modification authority to
   the owner), prevent the work of other users who
   have, in theory, met all the conditions to do a
   change.
   .
   Actual result -Its not authorized for the creator to
   cut a part whose other usage has been locked by
   some other user,whereas the creator haslocked the
   reference of the parent assembly.
   .
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   We should be able to modify an assembly if we
   have the lock on the assembly's reference and
   since just other usage of the part is locked by
   some other user, the creator of the part is not able
   to perform cut in his original assembly.

COMMENTS
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   ENOVIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 14.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   ENOVIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 15 GA level AND ON
   V5R14SP06.
   .
   In an unconfigured case (IR does not specify
   whether prod structure is conf/unconfig ......but IR
   is recreatable only in unconfig case)
   cut fails with an info msg that Instance is locked by
   some other User.
   This is a bad message but is working as
   designed . In an unconf case , cut of the ii leads to
   a delete of the AR . In PS model ,
   prior to deleting the AR , we check to see that none
   of the instances pointing to the AR are locked . If
   they are , then do not allow delete as seen in our
   scenario.
   In config case , the cut succeeds. This is OK
   because nothing is actually changed on the AR ,
   just the effectivity pointing to the AR .
