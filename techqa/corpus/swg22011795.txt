ANSWER
To support WAS version 9.0.0.0 and above, you can manually download WAS DC version 7.0.0.14 [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager+for+Applications&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAM_DC-IF0014&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc] (7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAM_DC-IF0014, ITCAM Data Collector for WebSphere Version 7.2.0.0 Interim Fix 14) from Fix Central, and install/configure it according to README file in the fix.
