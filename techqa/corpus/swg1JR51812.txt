   ****************************************************************
   The Failed Event Manager accesses a random application cluster
   member to invoke the Recovery MBean. When the randomly
   selected cluster member is not running, a misleading error
   message is displayed on  the Failed Event Manager page in the
   administrative console.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 that allows
   administrators to use Failed Event Manager in the
   administrative console when only part of the application
   cluster members in  the target deployment environment are
   running.
