APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When asynchronous parsing is enabled at the XU level
   (asynchronousRulesetParsing=true), a slow DB connection can
   cause the parsing of the (even small) test ruleset of the RES
   console to take long and generate an error during the diagnostic
   as the 2 execution uses the first version of the ruleset: "Not
   all XUs have been updated with the new ruleset"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  set asynchronousRulesetParsing to false before running the
   diagnostic.
