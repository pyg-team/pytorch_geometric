Warning  * 
 * What's Changed in the Documentation
 * 
 * 
 *  "The Portable Document Format (PDF) versions of these documentation plugins are no longer being maintained. You can find the old ones, last updated for V7.0.0.1 from the WebSphere MQ Library web page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/] ."

How to access PDF for older versions of MQ  * 
 * 
 *  For WebSphere MQ V6 or V7.0 on AIX, HP, Windows, Solaris, Linux : 
   The WebSphere MQ documentation is supplied separately on a CD-ROM alongside the product. You can either view the documents directly from CD, or you can install them on your computer (either before or after installing the WebSphere MQ product). 
 *  For MQ V7.0.1 and all previous versions, start from the WebSphere MQ Library web page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/], select the version of MQ that you want to view. 
 *   * For MQ V7.0.1 or MQ V7.0.0 you will have to access the Information Center version of the documentation and then create PDF files following the directions below. 
   
    * For MQ V6.0 and previous versions, under the list of versions you can select the category of books that you want to view. For example you may select V6.0 and then select "z/OS specific books" then you will be presented with a list of available books that you may download in PDF format.
