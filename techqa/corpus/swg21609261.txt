 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are the following two relationships considered as duplicates?

OriginalContractId DestContractId RelationshipType 
A B C
B A C



ANSWER
Yes, they are duplicated. if you add the relationships as described in the question, you will get error:
<ErrorMessage>Duplicate record already exists for the following:ContractRelationship</ErrorMessage>


 As it's documented in Developer's Guide and Transaction Reference Guide, 
"Duplicate Check 

This validator makes sure that the ContractRelationship that is to be added is not a duplicate of an existing ContractRelationship. A ContractRelationship is considered a duplicate if the OrigContractId, DestContractId, and RelationshipType values are found to be identical."

Additionally, OriginalContractId, DestContractId, and RelationshipType are considered as a set of data, it doesn't matter if it's from or to. 

Finally, EndDate is not a consideration for Duplicate Check.
