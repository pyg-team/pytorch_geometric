QUESTION
 How to check if I have the required P8 prerequisites for IBM Content Collector? 

ANSWER
 

 * You need both the .NET Clients and Java Clients components

 * To check if you have the .NET Clients component, on the IBM Content Collector server:  1. Go to Control Panels 
    2. Add or Remove Programs 
    3. Look for Content Engine .Net API 4.x.x. 
   
    * If it is present, you have already installed it. 
    * If it is missing, you can install it through the FileNet Content Engine installer.
   
   
 * To check if you have the Java Clients component, examine the content of the file ceclient_install_log_4_5_0.txt under the FileNet Content Engine Client installation folder. 
   For example: C:\Program Files\FileNet\CEClient\ceclient_install_log_4_5_0.txt
    * UPDATE_OTHER=1 means the Java Clients component is already installed. 
    * UPDATE_OTHER=0 means the Java Clients component is not yet installed and you can install it through the FileNet Content Engine Client installer by means of the "Other Applications" option.
