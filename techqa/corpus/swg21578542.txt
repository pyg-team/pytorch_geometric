PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DFHPG0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'58CC' in module DFHPGCR. 

SYMPTOM
DFHPG0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'58CC' in module DFHPGCR.


CAUSE
Storage overlay caused by Trillium

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Kernal error data in the dump shows:

=KE: Error Number: 00000001
Error Code: 0C4/AKEA Error Type: PROGRAM_CHECK
Error happened in program DFHPGCR at offset 000058CC
CICS Registers and PSW.
PSW: 478D2000 A3E16B8C Instruction Length: 6 Interrupt Code: 10

The CICS code is running in refstep dfhpgcr_locate_container. CICS finds the cpcb_container_anchor and then runs a chain of containers. The container control blocks have been overlaid as part of a very large overlay. That causes EBCDIC characters to be pulled into register 4 and that leads to the program check.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade to Trillium V7.12. That release includes 2 patches for the storage overlay.
