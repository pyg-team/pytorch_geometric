However, when this problem occurs, the New button is not displayed as expected.


CAUSE
This problem is a result of installing the WebSphere Portal Server offering. The WebSphere Portal Server offering does not provide all features of Web Content Manager.

To get complete web content management capabilities, you can perform either of the following steps: 

 

 * Uninstall WebSphere Portal Server, and then install either WebSphere Portal Enable or WebSphere Portal Extend.
