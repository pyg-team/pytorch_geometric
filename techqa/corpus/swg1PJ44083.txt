APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Internet Explorer stops responding when you use drag and drop to
   move properties from a property table container in Properties
   View Designer.
   
   In Case Manager Builder, you can design a custom property view
   with Properties View Designer. One of the containers that you
   can use in a custom property view is the property table
   container.
   
   If you add multiple property fields to a property table
   container and then later move these fields from the property
   table container by dragging and dropping the property to an area
   outside of the property table container, the browser stops
   responding when you move the last property field from the
   property table container.
   
   This problem occurs only with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use drag and drop to remove a property field from the
   property table container. Instead use 'cut' and 'paste' or
   'delete' to remove the property field.
   
   An alternative is to use a different browser such as Mozilla
   Firefox or Google Chrome.

   * Update to 5.2.1.4-ICM-FP004 or later.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.4-ICM-FP004.  With this fix, when you use drag
   and drop to move properties from a property table container in
   Properties
   View Designer will no longer cause Internet Explorer to not
   respond.
