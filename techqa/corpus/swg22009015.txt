VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-1000381 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000381]
DESCRIPTION: c-ares could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the ares_parse_naptr_reply() function when parsing NAPTR responses. By sending specially crafted DNS response packet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read memory outside of the given input buffer and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/128625 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/128625]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-11499 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11499]
DESCRIPTION: Node.js is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a flaw related to constant HashTable seeds. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to flood the hash and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129465 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129465]for the current score
