Title: IBM SOAP fault "Trying to read events from a parser that already reported an error before" from a CICS WEBSERVICE - United States

Text:
axis2 PIPELINE ; SOAP fault ; faultstring org.org.apache.axiom.om.OMException ; javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException ; Trying to read events from a parser that already reported an error before ; 5655S9700 R670 670 R700 700 HCI6700 5655-S97 5655S97 KIXINFO TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive the following SOAP fault from a CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) WEBSERVICE configured with an axis2 PIPELINE: 

<faultstring>org.org.apache.axiom.om.OMException: javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: Trying to read events from a parser that already reported an error before</faultstring> 

CAUSE
The version of axis2 shipped with CICS TS V4.2 can issue an erroneous SOAP fault when processing invalid XML. For example, mismatched start and end tags: 

<element1>data</element2>

In this case, the end tag should be </element1>


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the XML is valid. Consider enabling the WEBSERVICE validation capability in CICS in order to force a full validation of the SOAP messages. See Validating SOAP messages [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.webservices.doc/tasks/dfhws_validation.html] in the CICS TS V4.1 information center for more information.

If SOAP messages are generated by tools, then you are unlikely to experience this problem. However, if SOAP messages are constructed manually (perhaps hard-coded within application code), then it is much easier for errors to be accidentally introduced. Consider using tools to generate the SOAP messages.
