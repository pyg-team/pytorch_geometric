 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Several security vulnerabilities have been reported against Apache Struts 2 through May 2014. IBM Platform Cluster Manager’s GUI uses Struts 2 as a framework for Java web applications. A version of the package that is vulnerable to these issues is included in several past versions of IBM Platform Cluster Manager. The latest versions of Struts 2 address all the vulnerabilities and can be applied through the fix detailed in the Remediation section. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-0094 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0094]
DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in ParametersInterceptor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server.

CVE-2014-0094
CVSS Base Score: 5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92205 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92205] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-0112 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0112]
DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to ParametersInterceptor and the failure to restrict access to the class parameter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0112 
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92740 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92740] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-0113 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0113]
DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to CookieInterceptor and the failure to restrict access to the getClass() method. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CookieInterceptor when configured to accept all cookies to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server to execute arbitrary code on the system.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0113
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92742 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92742] for more information

CVEID: CVE-2014-0116 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0116]
DESCRIPTION: 
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly restrict access to the getClass() method by the CookieInterceptor class. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0116
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93024 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93024] for the current score
