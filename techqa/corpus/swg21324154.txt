QUESTION
 How can I configure Rhapsody to generate a *.h file (where some variables can be declared)? 

ANSWER


To generate a *.h file from within Rhapsody, follow the steps below:  1.  Within the browser click on the "+" sign besides Components. 
 2.  Right click on the DefaultComponent and add a new file. 
 3.  Double click the newly created file to invoke its features. 
 4.  Name the file as desired and change the type to Specification (the default is Logical). Click OK. 
 5.  Press Ctrl+F7 to generate the DefaultConfig (create the .h file). 

Now the header file created can be edited by right clicking on it and selecting "Edit File". 

If any particular class needs to have access to this .h file, right-click the class and choose Features ->Properties -> CPP_CG: Class:ImpIncludes and add the .h file there. 7.1 AnswerProduct versionPartner ContentInternal ContentCategoryReference IDAuthor
