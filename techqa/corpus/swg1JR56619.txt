APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you use administration services in the Process Admin Console
   in Internet Explorer, you might notice problems rendering of
   coaches of the administration service. Some coach views might
   not display properly. For example, the section header of a
   section might be missing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To avoid this problem use one of the following workarounds:
   
   -Use a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome to work in
   the Process Admin Console.
   
   -Expose the administration service as a dashboard in IBM Process
   Portal and handle access to the dashboard by using the "Exposed
   to" setting.
   
   -Expose the administration service as a URL and handle access to
   the URL by using the "Exposed to" setting. Then, implement an
   administration service that embeds a custom HTML coach control
   that opens a new browser window and calls the intended service
   from teamworks/exposeServiceByName with the respective
   information of the service, for example
   
   <script type="text/javascript">
   window.open("/teamworks/executeServiceByName?processApp
   =<PA>&serviceName=<MyAdminService>", "NewWindow" )
   </script>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An administration service is implemented as a human service that
   includes coaches. The administration service runs in the
   Process Admin Console and, therefore, uses the same browser
   settings as the Process Admin Console. The Process Admin Console
   must run in Internet Explorer 8 Compatibility Mode while the
   coach views in IBM BPM V8.5.6 are guaranteed to work only in
   newer versions of Internet Explorer.
