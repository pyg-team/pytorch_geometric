Title: IBM Batch structure is not valid with MClaims Fixup in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
MClaims fixup batch structure members Attachments TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a batch through MClaims Fixup, it fails with the message:

DotScan
The batch structure is not valid. The batch will be placed on Hold.
The Comment field shows:
TM######:Not enough members. The batch has too few documents or the document has too few pages of a given type. 

CAUSE
MClaims by default is set to limit documents to have no more than 20 Attachment pages. If there are more, Fixup generates this error. This limit is configurable using the procedure below.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To allow an unlimited number of Attachment pages to be associated with a document, do the following: 

 1. Run Datacap Studio and log in to the application. 
 2. Lock the Document Hierarchy (DCO) for editing and expand the tree to show the Attachment page. 
 3. Right click on Attachment and select Manage Variables. 
 4. Change Max to 0 and click Done. 
 5. Save and lock the Document Hierarchy.
