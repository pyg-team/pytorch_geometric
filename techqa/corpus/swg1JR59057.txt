APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following vulnerabilities affect only IBM Business Process
   Manager (BPM) users who use the Configuration editor.
   
   CVEID: CVE-2017-3738
   DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain
   sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2
   Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with
   1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
   obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to
   exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the
   DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an
   option since CVE-2016-0701.
   CVSS Base Score: 3.1
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 for
   the current score
   CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
   CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
   
   CVEID: CVE-2017-3737
   DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in multiple Oracle
   products could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low
   confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and high
   availability impact.
   CVSS Base Score: 5.3
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
