Title: IBM Latency issues with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
SQL; truncate; audit; Admin DB; Engine DB TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Over time, increasing delays are experienced throughout operations, from logon through every aspect of batch creation and export. 

SYMPTOM
With Rulerunner, the processing delays may become serious enough to cause intermittent hangs, crashes, and other errors.


CAUSE
The database has grown overly large, with tables such as the audit table in the Admin database potentially containing millions of records.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Tables need to be truncated, backed up, or purged. Possible tables needing attention include the following:


 * Admin database  * audit - contains user login/logouts.
   
   
 *  Engine database  * debug - optionally can contain batch state changes. 
    * de2kst, exportst, fixup2kst, recog2kst, scan2kst, taskstats, uploads - contains reporting and statistical information.
