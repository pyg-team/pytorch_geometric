Title: IBM Unable to select an interview questionnaire when creating a new interview. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to create a new interview, an existing interview questionnaire that is active does not show up in the Resource Chooser list. 

SYMPTOM
An active interview questionnaire does not show up in the Resource Chooser to be selected.


CAUSE
A question in the interview questionnaire is of type "Confirmation" question.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A confirmation question is only valid for a hold created with a virtual interview. If you are trying to create a standalone interview, make sure that the interview questionnaire does not have any confirmation question(s). If they do, you can edit the question to make it a choice question instead. After making the change and saving the questionnaire, you will be able to see it in the interview plan.
