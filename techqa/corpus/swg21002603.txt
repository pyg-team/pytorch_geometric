QUESTION
 Why am I getting error messages when I bring up ImagePlus Object Distribution Manager (IODM) through the startup CICS (Customer Information Control System) transaction for IODM, (which is called OIUP), and after rebinding my IODM plans?

After completing FWA version 3.1.0 migration, I receive the following error message when attempting to bring up IODM through OIUP: -818.

Using the database request modules (DBRMs) that were shipped on the installation productivity option (IPO), I can successfully rebind all IODM plans except EKCPOIUP, EKCPOTBL, EKCPMIGR, and EKCPUTIL. I am able to successfully rebind using my production DBRMs, but when I try to bring up IODM, I get error message: -922.

What's happening? 

ANSWER
Check your IODM bind job; you might only be referencing DSN310 dbrm. Also, ensure that you have a SYS1.CBRDBRM. 

Rebind and grant EKCPDISP; if you rebind without a grant, you risk getting error message: -922 from Object Access Method (OAM). Next, rebind all IODM plans using SYS1.CBRDBRM to restore your system.
