Text:
RN7.1; RN7.1.0.1C; PK80118 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 RequisiteWeb is unable to display some documents. These documents have requirements in tables and the requirements use rich-text formatting, such as bullets, images, or another table, or they have very large document names.


SYMPTOM
RequisiteWeb is having problems displaying some documents. 

Some documents can be edited without any problem by using the client for Windows®, but if you try to open them using RequisiteWeb, an error is displayed: 

 * Error creating HTML document. The requested member of the collection does not exist. 
 * Error creating HTML document. Cannot edit Range. 
 * Error creating HTML document. Object has been deleted.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 


When a document fails to display in RequisiteWeb, you can perform one of the following workarounds: 

 * Edit the document by using the client for Windows. 
 * Avoid rich-text formatting, such as bullets and images, in requirements that are in tables. Move the requirements outside tables or manage them as plain text.

You should also avoid very large document names. They should be 45 characters or less. 

This issue is fixed in Rational® RequisitePro® version 7.1.0.1.
