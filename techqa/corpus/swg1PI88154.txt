APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using a multi-tiered map design (master map calling child
   maps with a RUN() function) and the StreamMaxMemLimit is revised
   to lower values in the dtx.ini file, it may be observed that
   sporadic input validation failures can occur in the child maps.
   
   Activation of input backup on error shows that the data received
   from the parent map (via an ECHOIN() or HANDLEIN() function) has
   been slightly corrupted.  This may occur for only one iteration
   in many hundreds of thousands of calls of the child map.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ITXCQ - ITX00058125
   PB / PB
   As a workaround, higher values of StreamMaxMemLimit appear to
   mitigate this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   ITX Transformation Extender customers who process data larger
   then maximum stream size defined by StreamMaxMemLimit dtx.ini
   option.
   
   Problem Description:
   When MPI stream flushes to file after reaching
   StreamMaxMemLimit, it could possible corrupt the data.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed issue when MPI stream flushes to file after reaching
   StreamMaxMemLimit, it could possible corrupt the data.
