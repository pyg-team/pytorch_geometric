 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Loging into AppScan Enterprise Console with a newly created account results in "CRWAS2123E User does not have permissions to login to AppScan Server.‚Äù 

SYMPTOM
Newly added user receive the following error when trying to login to AppScan Enterprise Console: 

An error occurred while logging in: CRWAS2123E User 'username' does not have permissions to login to AppScan Server. 

Existing users are not affected, only new users are affected. 


CAUSE
This may be caused by AppScan having been configured to use Windows Integrated authentication instead of the intended LDAP Authentication.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To check what Authentication type is in use in the AppScan Enterprise Console, go to the following registry key: 

HLKM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\IBM\AppScan Enterprise\Config\ASE\CCAuthType
It is set to: 
1 - when Windows Integrated Authentication is in use
2 - when LDAP Authentication is in use



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-run the Configuration Wizard and ensure that: 

 * Check the following options at the Server Components" page: 
   - User Administration
   - Enterprise Console 
 * At the Authentication Mechanism page, select LDAP authentication and configure correctly all the remaining fields at the page. 
 * Leave the default values on the other pages as they are. 


Note: At the last step of the Configuration Wizard (after clicking the Finish button) the AppScan services will be stopped, making AppScan Enterprise inaccessible to users until the Configuration Wizard completes.
