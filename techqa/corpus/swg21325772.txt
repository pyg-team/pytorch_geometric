QUESTION
 In my <database_path>\st_root\tmp\check directory I can see some files with names like the following:UOBJ.trx_KEKJBBFIUOBJ.trx_QNJJBBFI, what are they and can I delete them? 

ANSWER
These files are a by-product of the "ccm fs_check" program which checks the database cache and archive integrity. 


These files are usually deleted when each check completes, but if the fs_check program is interrupted, then the temporary files can remain behind and have to be deleted manually. You can specify an alternate temporary directory for fs_check with the -d option as described in the on-line help. 


Providing no fs_check is running on the database at this time, then it is quite safe to delete these temporary files. 

Please review the Help documentation for the fs_check command as found in the Information Center here: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rsdp/v1r0m0/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rsdp/v1r0m0/index.jsp]
