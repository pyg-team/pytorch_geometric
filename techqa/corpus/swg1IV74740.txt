APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the user creats and clones widgets in rapid succession,
   sometimes we get a widget with incomplete data (the "mode" is
   missing, and should typically be "view").
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When the javascript widget object is created, we now check that
   its mode exists, and if not go ahead and create it as
   mode="view".
