ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CQ input language switches back from English to Arabic every tim
   e.
   On Arabic workstations users have English as second input langua
   ge which is used for ClearQuest. They switch language to English
    on the language bar or press (Shift + Alt) when opening CQ. Swi
   tching between the various applications (without closing them) s
   hould switch input language automatically. This works fine with
   other applications and with CQ native client 2003.06.15 but fail
   s with 7.0.0.1 CQ for Windows client.
   Operating System: Windows XP Professional SP 2
   ClearQuest Version 7.0.0.1
   Label BALTIC_PATCH.D060929
   In Regional and Language Options:
   Regional Options, Standards and formats: Arabic (Saudi Arabia)
   Languages, Details, Text Services and Input Languages: Default i
   nput language: Arabic (Saudi Arabia) - Arabic (101)
   Advanced, Language for non-Unicode programs: Arabic (Saudi Arabi
   a)
   With these settings, open CQ, in the Language bar set the langua
   ge to EN
   Run a query, language switches back to AR.
   Modify a record, set language to EN again. Click on a field to e
   nter data, language switches back to AR.
   In this one record in an editable state the language switches be
   tween EN and AR when moving the cursor from one field to another
   . Impossible to work with.
   The above scenario, toggling between Polish (as default) and Eng
   lish or Dutch (default) and English does not reproduce the probl
   em.
   The problem doesn't happen with the CQ Eclipse client; setting t
   he language once, it will be kept for the duration of the client
    session.
   
   If I set Regional and Language Options, Advanced, Language for n
   on-Unicode programs: English, the language switch to EN at CQ pr
   ogram start is kept during the session. Proposed this as a worka
   round. Customer tested this but said 'this cannot help us becaus
   e it affected other applications that we uses heavily causing th
   em not display Arabic characters (TOAD for example).
   We are looking for fixing this issue ASAP.'
   I have tested the same configuration with CQ 2003.06.15 (the cod
   e page has to be set to nochecking, to avoid an error) and could
    not reproduce the problem.
   
   I did initially point out that switching between input languages
    is not controlled by the applications that run on the system. I
   t is configured and controlled by the operating system. (http://
   www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getWR/steps/WRG_kybrd.mspx)
   I now log a defect because:
   - it works with CQ 2003.06.15 on same OS and same configuration
   but fails in Baltic.
   - it works for other applications.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This is a third-party limitation or defect in the MFC
   CRichEdit control, which the ClearQuest Native Client on
   Windows uses to edit and display rich text.  A simple
   non-ClearQuest MFC application using CRichEdit will show the
   same behavior and we have not found any way to control that
   behavior.  This thus cannot be fixed in ClearQuest code.
   The Web and Eclipse Client interfaces do not have this
   problem and can be used to avoid it.
