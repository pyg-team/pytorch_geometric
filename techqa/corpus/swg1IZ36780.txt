ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Both of the USERID prints disapear, should be the USERID used
   during the creation of the SAP accont and HR linking is failing
   
   
    We
   created 3 accounts in ARD 203 using HR# 50000030.  The first
   time Bruce
   was totally out of PA30.  User ID and email were updated
   successfully.
   Second time Bruce was in PA30, but on a different account than
   50000030.
   User ID and email address were updated successfully.  Third time
   Bruce
   actually had HR# 50000030 open in PA30.  In this final instance,
   User ID
   and email address were not updated.  However, according to TIM,
   the
   account was updated successfully.
   
   Conclusion -
   
   Simply being in PA30 does not cause the transaction to fail -
   the
   specific record that you are attempting to update has to be open
   (and
   thus locked) for it to fail.
   
   
   
   Customr Recreate:   yes
   
   L2 Support Recreate:  none
   
   Desired Behavior:
   
   Steps Duplicate:
    1). In the logs there should be the following lines displayed:
   
    ....
    DBG:08/10/31 04:33:24 Thread:004040 Linking Username within the
   Add:
   <USERID>
    ...
    DBG:08/10/31 04:33:25 Thread:004040 Linking Username within the
   emplcomm_change: '<USERID>
    ...
   
   Both of the above USERID prints should be the USERID used during
   the
   creation of the SAP account. If this is we should see a
   successful
   result of the HR linking. If not we are still losing the
   reference to
   the userid
