QUESTION
 You are upgrading to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS CICSPlex SM (CPSM) V5.4 and need to run multiple versions of CPSM in the same z/OS LPAR. You need to know, is CPSM V5.4 downward compatible with the older releases of CPSM V5.x and CPSM V4.x that you are still running? 

CAUSE
Currently in your production z/OS LPAR, you have a CPSM V4.1 SEYULPA library in the link pack area (LPA). You would like to know if you can use the new CPSM libraries in the LPA instead of the CPSM V4.1 libraries. Your production regions will be running CPSM V4.1 and a test regions will be running V5.4 in the same LPAR.

ANSWER
CPSM modules are release dependent and not downward compatible. However, library SEYULPA should be empty initially. You can optionally populate this library with the CPSM V5.4 LPA eligible modules at a later stage, when you are ready to move CPSM V5.4 into production. However, you do not need to worry about the CPSM V5.4 library SEYULPA being empty prior to this.


If you currently have the eligible CPSM V4.1 or V4.2 modules in the LPA, you will need to run with LPA=YES in your CICS TS V4.1 or V4.2 regions and LPA=NO in your CICS TS V5.4 regions. Remember, the LPA system initialization table (SIT) parameter only applies to the eligible LPA modules and not the mandatory eight modules in SDFHLPA. If you have two releases only one of them can specify LPA=YES. 

For more information, refer to Installing CICSPlex SM modules in the MVS link pack area [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.4.0/installing/dfha1cb.html] in the CICS information center. Also, refer to the explanations of the usermods in the comment lines in the individual PDS members within the CPSM SEYUSAMP library. For example, usermod EYU$UM01 moves local MAS modules (EYU9..01 modules) from SEYULOAD to SEYULPA. You can check whether the usersmods were applied or not by looking for modules with EYU9..01 names in the CPSM.SEYULPA library.
