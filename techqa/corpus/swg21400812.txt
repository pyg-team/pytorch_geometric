QUESTION
 Can I deploy Rule Team Server/Decision Center to a cluster and how should I proceed? 

ANSWER
Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center (DC) can be deployed on a cluster configuration as any Java EE application.
Refer to the WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS Version 7.1: Java EE add-ons [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC.html] or Decision Center V8.0 > Configuring Decision Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dcenter.config/topics/wodm_dcenter_config.html] for topology and configuration details on each supported application server.


Note: 

 * Prior to JRules V7.0, the only limitation is that fail-over is not supported : the session is not restored, so the user needs to log-in again. 
 * Starting in V7.0 fail-over is working as expected.
