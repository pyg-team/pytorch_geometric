QUESTION
 Procedure for the removal of old and invalid properties following an upgrade 

CAUSE
Reapplying the configuration using nci_import can overwrite modern properties with legacy properties that have no bearing on the behaviour of the distribution, but can cause confusion as to their purpose.

ANSWER
The Service, such as the EventProcessor, would then operate with default settings and though the legacy properties should not affect this operation, it is best to remove them. This is achieved by the following procedure: 

While the ImpactServer is running:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * mv $NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_eventprocessor.props $NCHOME/impact/etc/[ImpactServerName]_eventprocessor.ConfBackUp 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The process of saving will write a new [ImpactServerName]_eventprocessor.props file that contains only current properties.
