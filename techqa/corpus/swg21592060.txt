QUESTION
 How do I migrate to WebSphere ILOG JRules v7.1? 

ANSWER

This document focuses on migration to v7.1 from v6.x. For migration to WebSphere Operational Decision Management v7.5, refer to Migrating from JRules to WODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725].

Start with the 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global70.html], which details how to migrate to v7.1, especially How to migrate from JRules 6.x [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global78.html] and Migrating rule projects for rule authors [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global79.html].

Before proceeding with rule project migration, determine how you use Rule Studio and Rule Team Server (RTS) for managing your rules. The documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global78.html] describes the scenarios as follows: 

 * Scenario 1: You use Rule Studio exclusively for managing your rule projects, and do not use RTS. In this case, the migration is done solely using Rule Studio. Follow the instructions in Migrating a Rule Project to JRules v7.0 and v7.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591800]. 
 * Scenario 2: Both Rule Studio and RTS are used to manage your rule projects, but the source of truth is Rule Studio, and RTS users synchronize with Rule Studio to get the latest project state. Migrate your rule projects using Rule Studio, by following the instructions in Migrating a Rule Project to JRules v7.0 and v7.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591800]. Publish the rules to the newly created schema for the latest RTS version. You can discard the previous RTS version's schema, instead of also performing RTS database migration, since the assumption is that only the latest artifacts from the Rule Studio project need to be maintained in RTS. 
 * Scenario 3: RTS is the source of truth for all rules. Rule Studio is also used to make changes to the rule projects, but all the changes are published to RTS for maintaining the latest state. Follow the recommendations in Migrating to RTS v7.0 and v7.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21591798].


Once you have migrated your rule projects,  * Migrate RuleApps [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590082] to Rule Execution Server v7.1. 
 * Migrate your execution code [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global124.html]. 
 * Migrate test data [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global120.html] from Rule Scenario Manager. 
 * Migrate any customized Web components [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global134.html].
