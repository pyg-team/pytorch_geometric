PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the error, "Default DB path is not set", occurs when adding a connection with IBM® Rational® ClearQuest® on RedHat Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) 5. 

SYMPTOM
When running the command cqreg add_dbset, this error occurs:

"Default DB path is not set"
"Default version is 7.0.0"
/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/7.0.0 does not exist. Use cqreg initialize first. 

CAUSE
Normally, at the end of a ClearQuest installation on UNIX® based platforms, the cqreg initialize command runs automatically. The command creates the registry structure for database sets. During the installation, the command did not run successfully.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that the CQDB_rgys directory exists, as defined in the installation options. The following is the default registry location: 


/opt/rational/clearquest/CQDB_rgys/cqdb_registry/

If not present, then the cqreg initialize command was not successful.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run cqreg initialize. The add_dbset command will run successfully afterwards. However, should the same error persist, make sure the command is run as the root user. 



Also make sure that the CQ_DATABASES environment variable is set to the desired registry path. If it is not, set the variable accordingly, then run the previously mentioned commands again.
