Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 This TechNote describes how to remove certain actions when a user has clicked on the 'More...' link. E.g. Users can remove the 'Run with options...' option when they are within the 'Perform an action' page. 

ANSWER
In the following example, this will remove the following options for all users when clicking 'More...' for a Report;

- Run with options
- Open in Report Studio
- Open with Cognos Workspace Advanced
- Modify the Schedule
- Remove the Schedule

To do this; 
1) Go to your <Cognos Installation>\templates\ps\portal 

2) Open up the file named "system.xml" 

3) Locate the the line "<object class="report">" (Beneath this line, you should see other elements within it called 'action name=...')

4) Replace this line with: 
<object class="report" exclude="run_options edit schedule run_once">

5) Restart the Cognos Services in order for the changes to take place.

*Note: If you want to specify more entries to exclude within the actions page, add the action name to the 'exclude' attribute. 
E.g. if you wanted to remove the "View run history" option from the action page, you would type <object class="report" exclude="run_history"> 

The above steps can be done for various other objects within Cognos Connection such as a Query Service Task.
