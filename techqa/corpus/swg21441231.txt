PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Changes in Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy) security policy parameters do not get applied in IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances. 

SYMPTOM
When changes are made in WS-Proxy security policy parameters, these changes do not take effect in the WS-Proxy service.


CAUSE
Even if you modify and save the policy parameters, it does not get saved until the dynamic actions generated by the security policy are rebuilt. 

ENVIRONMENT
Modifications to the WS-Proxy service

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If changes to policy parameters do not take effect, follow these steps.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To save the policy parameters:




 1. Modify the parameters. 
 2. Save your changes. 
 3. Edit the local endpoint and Apply. 
 4. Click Apply on the WS-Proxy main page. This action forces the security policy to rebuild all the dynamic actions with the right parameters.
