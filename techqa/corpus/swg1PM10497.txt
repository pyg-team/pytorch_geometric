APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Rational Quality client the result screen of a test suite
   does have a section Weight Distribution, but no sliders.
   
   In the test result screen of a suite, you don't see the sliders
   although the help in the question mark icon says that you can
   use the sliders.
   
   You can see the sliders in a test case result screen.
   
   
   When you click on the question mark icon, a help screen opens.
   It says:
   
   Use the sliders in this section to manually edit weight
   distributions for execution outcomes. For instance, even if a
   test fails, you might want to track that 80% of the test
   actually passed. If the test case has a weight of 100 points,
   you record that 80 points passed, while 20 points failed.
   The following formulas are used to calculate the combined weight
   distributions for tests:
   
       * Pass + Fail + Inconclusive <= Total Weight
       * Pass + Blocked <= Total Weight
       * Attempted >= Pass + Fail + Inconclusive
   
   Note: Weight is a measure of execution effort and can be based
   on tester hours, units of work, or priority. For example, a test
   case that requires twice as much time to execute could have
   double the weight as another test case. Reports that measure
   your progress take the weight value into account when
   determining status.
   
   The Test Suite results page does not have sliders. That is by
   design. The Suite Result points are rolled up from the
   individual testcase results for the suite.
   However, the Help details are incorrect. The help is the same as
   the Testcase results page which is a defect.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is fixed from the UI perspective and the csHelp is
