Title: IBM JRE 1.7 up40 errors when accessing WebGUI after patch - United States

Text:
Missing Permissions; Missing Codebase; manifest; jre; 1.7; java console TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 'Missing Permissions manifest attribute' messages appear in java console when using jre 1.7_u25 or greater when using WebGUI 7.4.0.1 or WebGUI 7.3.1.6 / TIP 2.2.0.7+ 

SYMPTOM
Missing Permissions manifest attribute for: 
https:// : /ibm/console/webtop/classes/applets.jar 
Missing Codebase manifest attribute for: 
https:// : /ibm/console/webtop/classes/applets.jar 


CAUSE
 

These messages are due to the security enhancements introduced in Oracle's Java 7 Update 25. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/security/manifest.html for a description of the Permissions and Codebase attributes. These messages will appear for all applets (i.e., not specific to Web GUI, but for other applications such as ITNM and TBSM as well) using JRE 7 Update 25 or later.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


According to Oracle these are not error messages, but are warning messages. They can be safely ignored for now. The current JRE 7 updates applets such as the AEL are expected to work despite the warning messages. 


NOTE: When Oracle release Java 7 Update 51, scheduled for January 2014, the Permissions (but not Codebase) attribute will be made a required attribute such that applets will no longer work if this 
attribute is not set within the applets. This is described at https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/new_security_requirements_for_rias. For Web GUI, we currently have in plan to release 7.4.0 FP2 in/before January 2014 with this attribute added to its applets, and a solution for Web GUI 7.3.1 (via 7.3.1 FP7 or otherwise) to follow shortly after. 

WORK AROUND NOTE: Oracle introduced another feature in Java 7 Update 40, Deployment Rule Sets, where desktop administrators can white-list Java applets so as not to be affected by Update 51, and may also remove the 'Missing Permissions/Codebase manifest attribute' warning messages. See
