CVEID: CVE-2013-0169 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0169] 

Description: The Transport Layer Security protocol does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plain-text recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue. 

The attack does not require local network access nor does it require authentication, but some degree of specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit may impact the confidentiality of information but the integrity of data, or the availability of the system would not be compromised.
