APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If ChlAuthEarlyAdopt is enabled and an error condition exists
   causing the currently active channel to be blocked, you may see
   a queue manager log entry showing-
   
   AMQ9777: Channel was blocked
   
   EXPLANATION:
   The inbound channel '<ch_name>' was blocked from address
   'localhost (<nnn.n.n.n>)' because the active values of
   the channel matched a record configured with USERSRC
   (NOACCESS). The active values of the channel were
   'CLNTUSER (<some_user>) ADDRESS(localhost)'.
   
   
   When the CLNTUSER value is expected to be <MCAUSER> rather than
   the displayed user name .

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM MQ with queue managers configured with the
   "ChlauthEarlyAdopt=y" setting.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A logic error when generating the AMQ9777 message meant that it
   was possible for this function to fail to insert the correct
   MCAUSER if using ChlauthEarlyAdopt.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The programming error has been resolved to display the correct
   MCAUSER in the AMQ9777 message.
