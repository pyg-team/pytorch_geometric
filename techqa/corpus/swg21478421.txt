Title: IBM Can't request license codes because echoid does not start. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I've installed the Sentinel License Manager and am trying to get a license. I don't have Internet access on this machine, and I was told to run echoid.exe from a command prompt to get the Lock Code. The problem is that when I do that I get the following error message:

This application has failed to start because msvcr71.dll was not found 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The echoid.exe utility expects to find a copy of the Microsoft library file msvcr71.dll in the \windows\system32 folder. If it's missing, you'll receive this error. Many other applications on your machine may have their own copy in their own directory. 

One possible workaround is to search your machine for the file and place a copy into your \windows\system32 folder. If this fails, contact IBM SPSS Support.
