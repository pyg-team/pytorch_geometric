Title: IBM Product updates not found when using IBM Installation Manager 1.7.3.1 or earlier - United States

Text:
IM; rad; TLS protocol; Update Site; Installation Manager TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using IBM Installation Manager to search for product updates, latest updates might not be detected and you may see errors related to some repositories under https://www.ibm.com/ [https://www.ibm.com/] not connected. 

CAUSE
The IBM Update Site currently requires the use of the TLS protocol; however, the TLS protocol is not supported by IBM Installation Manager 1.7.3.1 or earlier. 

ENVIRONMENT
Any of the following Rational Integrated Development Environment products can be installed by IBM Installation Manager: 

 * Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/application] 
 * Rational Business Developer [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/busdeveloper] 
 * Rational Developer for AIX and Linux AIX COBOL Edition [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/dev-aixcobol] 
 * Rational Developer for AIX and Linux C/C++ Edition [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/dev-c-cpp] 
 * Rational Developer for System z [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/developerforsystemz] 
 * Rational Developer for i [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/dev-ibm-i] 
 * Rational Software Architect [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/ratisoftarch] 
 * Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software [http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/swarchitect-websphere]

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, you need to update IBM Installation Manager to version 1.8 or later. 


 

WORKAROUND: 

You can work around this issue by adding the Service Repository URLs of the products in the repository list. 

Complete the following steps: 

 1. Start IBM Installation Manager. 
 2. Click File > Preferences. 
 3. In the Preferences window, from the list, click Repositories. 
 4. In the Repositories window, click the Add Repository button. 
 5. In the Add Repository window, add the service repository URL and click OK.


The service repository URL needs to be in this format:
https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/localService/[OfferingID]/ 


where [OfferingID] is the offering ID of your product. 

For example:
https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/localService/com.ibm.rational.application.developer.v91


Note: To find the offering ID of all the installed products, you can look at the file names in the following location: 

 * Microsoft Windows: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager\installRegistry\metadata\Offerings
   
 * Linux: /var/ibm/InstallationManager/installRegistry/metadata/Offerings


For each of the jar files there, the string before the _ character is the offering ID. For example, for the file com.ibm.cic.agent_1.7.2000.20140227_0303.jar, the offering ID is com.ibm.cic.agent.
