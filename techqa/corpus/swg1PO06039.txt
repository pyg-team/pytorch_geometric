ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Curam Social Program Management Platform, when using the
   Spell Checker from within a modal, the modal can become all
   white, if the browser used is MS IE, and certain input text is
   used.  The issue occurs after clicking the "Replace" or
   "Replace All" buttons a certain number of times, which can vary
   depending on the input text used.  A javascript error in
   ckeditor.js similar to the one below, can be observed if using
   the F12 Developer Tools in MS IE:
   SCRIPT5007: Unable to get property 'type' of undefined or null
   reference
   This issue has been reproduced in MS IE 8, 9, and 10 without
   any emulation.  The issue is not reproducible, however, in MS
   IE 11 unless emulating MS IE 8, 9, or 10.

    Previously, the spell checker used by the rich text editor, had
   issues with certain characters in the text. The presence of
   these characters could cause the rich text editor modal to
   become all white and therefore block out all actions and
   content from view. This would prevent the user from completing
   the spell check and also from saving the text entered. To
   resolve this, the spell checker now handles these characters
   correctly and will complete successfully.
