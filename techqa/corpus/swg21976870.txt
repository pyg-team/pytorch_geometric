QUESTION
 How to disable Edit Mode in the site toolbar for Portal 8.5? 

CAUSE
Managed pages are portal pages that are stored in Web Content Manager. By managing portal pages from within Web Content Manager, you can apply web content features like workflow, version control, and syndication to portal pages. This support provides a robust and integrated method for performing site management by ensuring that changes are coordinated and published together. 

A graphical toolbar integrates managed pages functions directly into your portal pages. The toolbar provides quick access to editing features, projects, and workflow actions that apply to the page. However, Portal administrators may want to hide this functionality from end users to prevent unintended changes to the page.

This technote applies to Portal 8.5. For Portal 8.0, refer to technote 1644811 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21644811].


ANSWER
If managed pages is enabled, set theme.disable.edit.mode parameter with a value of true on any label or page where you want to disable Edit Mode. This can be applied to labels or pages near the top of the hierarchy for the child pages to pick up the setting. 


1. Log into the Portal admin console
2. Navigate to the label or page using the Managed Pages portlet
3. Click Edit Page Properties
4. Select Advanced options > I want to set parameters
5. Add theme.disable.edit.mode parameter with a value of true
6. Click Ok. And then click Ok again.

NOTE: theme.disable.edit.mode will not work if applied to a toolbar page. A code fix has been provided in APAR PI45337 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI45337] (included in CF08 and later) to log a warning message to make Portal administrators aware of the limitation.

If managed pages is disabled, follow these steps to disable the Site toolbar:

2. Navigate to Resource environment providers > WP VirtualPortalConfigService > Custom properties
3. Change the following properties to false:

global.toolbar.enabled
default.toolbar.enabled

4. Apply and Save the changes. (Sync the nodes, if clustered)
5. Restart Portal



Disabling the toolbar for non-administrators
Staring with Portal 8.5 CF05 and later versions, a new feature was introduced that allows the site toolbar to be shown only to administrative users. Refer to the following article for more details.
