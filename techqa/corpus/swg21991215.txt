QUESTION
 How do you create a Redundant Concurrent User License for SPSS products such as Statistics, Amos and Modeler? 

CAUSE
A standard Concurrent User License has been used in previous versions, however, a Redundant License system is now required to meet an organisation's business requirements.

ANSWER
Please follow the steps below in order to create a Redundant Concurrent User License. Pre-requisites are:
* Access to the License Key Center;
* Creation of an Authorisation Code for your Concurrent User License.


Step 1 – Login to the License Key Center [https://spss.subscribenet.com/control/ibmp/login]
Step 2 – Locate the product you wish to create the Redundancy License key. E.g. Amos
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=1]
Step 3 – Select the version you wish to create. E.g. Amos 24.0
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=2]

Step 4 – Select 'Generate' to create a new Authorisation Code or 'View codes' to use existing codes: 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=3]

Step 5 – Instead of entering a Lock Code for a normal license, tap the ‘Add Locking Codes’ plus icon to create your Redundancy License:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=4]

Step 6 – Enter your Lock Code in the order of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary License Managers. Then tap the Activate button to create your license key. For example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991215&aid=5]

Step 7 – Gather the Redundant Concurrent User License that is generated and then follow the instructions in our Concurrent License Administrator's Guide to complete the setup.
