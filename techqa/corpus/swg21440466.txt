QUESTION
 How to collect the logs and configuration info on the Data Collector for ITCAM for AD 7.1 on a Windows system. 

ANSWER
The location of the logs has changed in ITCAM for Application Diagnostics v7.1 on the Data Collector. There are two kinds of logs that are available and can be collected: WAS server logs and the Data Collector logs. If you have the WAS TEMA also installed, then you may also need to collect the TEMA config and logs info. See the Related links info below. 

This technote is specifically for Windows systems. Here is the Linux/Unix [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439078] equivalent of this technote.

(Note: In this technote, the Windows 2008 default directories are used. If you are using non-default directories then you may have to collect the logs and config info manually using the non-default directories.) 

* Collecting the WAS server logs: The default WAS server logs for the profile AppSrv01 and server server1 are located in this directory. (See first screenshot below.) To collect these WAS Server logs you can use the standard zip command or use the ITCAM-provided cyn_collector.cmd script (see second screenshot below) to collect the WAS server logs and the WAS server config info. Send the output file to your friendly IBM support engineer for further analysis.

* Collecting the Data Collector logs: Simply use the cyn_collector.cmd script again, this time with just the -a option as shown here. This will collect the DC logs, the DC config info and the WAS server logs too. Send this output file to your friendly IBM support engineer for further analysis.
