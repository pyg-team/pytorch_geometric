Title: IBM VOB "Minimum client feature level" - United States

Text:
Clearcase; Minimum Client Feature level TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the purpose and effect of "Minimum client feature level", as set by
cleartool protectvob â€“min_client_flevel 

ANSWER
TechNote 1119269 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21119269] states that, "VOB feature levels should be raised only after all client hosts have been upgraded to the corresponding ClearCase version." However, raising the VOB feature level will not cause ClearCase server processes to refuse to respond to back-version clients. 

Most access to ClearCase VOBs by back-version clients, including all "read" access, is "harmless". 

Some update access, however, can cause VOB corruption. 


Minimum client feature level offers a way for the ClearCase administrator to enforce that there is no access by back-version clients.

For example, when planning a Feature Level 7 upgrade, the administrator could set "Minimum client feature level" to 7, and see whether users complain. "Minimum client feature level" could be set back to 6, and the users given a deadline to upgrade. As the deadline passes and upgrade date approaches, "Minimum client feature level" could again be raised, ensuring that no back-version clients access the upgraded VOB.

Note: The actual Feature Level of a VOB can never be lowered.
