PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After configuring Single Sign-on in the Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) component of Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM), the navigation icons in DASH do not display when logging into DASH. 

CAUSE
LTPA keys generated in DASH for an existing, working SSO configuration for a Console Integration were deleted when the command to regenerate the LTPA keys was executed again. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Log into DASH using the DASH server IP address instead of the fully qualified domain/host name (FQDN) in the login URL. That will bypass the SSO configuration which prevents the DASH navigation tasks from appearing. Go to Settings > Console Integrations and note any existing console integration definitions. The solution in this technical note only applies if there are existing console integration definitions.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Launch the Websphere Administration Console in DASH (Settings > Websphere Administration Console)




 1. Go to Security > Global Security, LTPA. 
 2. Export the LTPA keys. 
 3. On all other Websphere instances where SSO with DASH is required, import the LTPA keys. 
 4. Restart all Websphere instances.
