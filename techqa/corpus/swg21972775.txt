SYMPTOM
The overall Product installation fails during the TIP upgrade portion of the install when attempting to install a WebSphere fixpack.


CAUSE
The pathname to the WebSphere Update installer responsefiles directory was incorrect: Incorrect: UpdateInstallerresponsefiles Correct: UpdateInstaller/responsefiles 

ENVIRONMENT
Product with TIP upgrade embedded, WebSphere 6.x

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The core failure of the TIP portion of the Product upgrade is detailed in the TIP install log and the de_trace.log: IA_TIPInstaller-00.log ( Failure message will indicate where the TIP install log is located ) ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1.

Invocation string: [C:\ibm\tivoli\tiptklmV2\UpdateInstaller/update.exe, -options, C:\ibm\tivoli\tiptklmV2\UpdateInstallerresponsefiles/install_eWAS_6_1_0_ 45_WinX32-ResponseFile.txt, -silent], com.ibm.ac.common.hosts.UpdateFailedException: : 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The pathname to the WebSphere Updateinstaller responsefiles directory needs to be fixed in the installArtifact.xml file, which is located on the Product cdimage downloaded from IBM: \COI\DeploymentSteps\ \META-INF NOTE: where "eWAS_FP" will be in the specific eWAS fixpack that is failing to install, in this case it is "eWAS_FP45" 1) Make a backkup of the installArtifact.xml file in the install cdimage: " \COI\DeploymentSteps\ \META-INF" directory. 2) Edit the installArtifact.xml file: Here is an example of what needs to be changed, each line in the installArtifact.xml file for the specific eWAS fixpack that is failing needs to be changed. From: $(IAGLOBAL_WUI_HOME)responsefiles/install_eWAS_6_1_0_45_WinX32 -ResponseFile.txt TO: ( a forward slash is added after "$(IAGLOBAL_WUI_HOME)" $(IAGLOBAL_WUI_HOME)/responsefiles/install_eWAS_6_1_0_45_WinX32 -ResponseFile.txt 3) Put the new installArtifact.xml in this directory: \COI\DeploymentSteps\ \META-INF 4) Retry the Product upgrade.
