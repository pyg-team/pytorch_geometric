QRadar Support Newsletter - May 6, 2014

IBM Security QRadar Community,

We are pleased to announce the second monthly support newsletter for QRadar users and administrators. The purpose of this newsletter is to provide support information, news, "how-to" articles, and tips for IBM Security QRadar SIEM and other associated QRadar products directly to QRadar users and administrators. Our goal is to provide knowledge and solutions to help security specialists complete their day-to-day activities. 

What's new
New DSMs and scanners supported by QRadar
A number of new Device Support Modules (DSMs) and new support for an additional vulnerability scanner was released in Q1 2014 for QRadar. We wanted to highlight new DSM releases as we know that administrators are busy and do not always have time to review new DSMs added to QRadar through automatic updates.


 * Amazon AWS CloudTrail: This DSM uses the Log File protocol to retrieve and process audit 
   events from your AWS CloudTrail account. 
 * Arbor Networks Pravail: This DSM uses the Syslog protocol to collect DDoS detection and 
   mitigation events. 
 * Avaya VPN Gateway: This DSM uses Syslog to collect OS, system control process, traffic 
   process, start up, configuration reload, AAA subsystem, and IPsec subsystem events from 
   Avaya VPN Gateway installations at v9.0.7.2 
 * EMC VMware vShield: This DSM uses Syslog to collect audit and system events from 
   VMware vShield installed with software v5.x. 
 * Fortinet FortiGate: An update was made to the Fortinet FortiGate DSM to include events from
   Fortinet FortiAnalyzer appliances. 
 * IBM Security Directory Server: This DSM uses Syslog to collect directory service, 
   authentication, and LDAP events from IBM Security Directory Server v6.3.1 and above. 
 * Juniper DDoS Secure: This DSM uses Syslog to collect DDoS detection and mitigation events
   from appliances installed with Juniper DDoS Secure v5.13.x. 
 * Microsoft Hyper-V: This DSM leverages WinCollect 7.2.0 to collect Microsoft Hyper-V events 
   that are stored in the application log of Microsoft Server 2008 or Microsoft Server 2012 hosts. 
 * Oracle Fine Grained Auditing: This DSM polls for database audit events that have fine grained 
   auditing enabled from Oracle databases at v9i and above using the JDBC protocol. 
 * Proofpoint Enterprise Protection/Enterprise Privacy: This DSM uses Syslog to collect 
   system and email security events from Proofpoint Enterprise Protection or Proofpoint Enterprise 
   Privacy installations at software version v7.0.2, v7.1, or v7.2. 
 * SafeNet DataSecure: This DSM uses Syslog to collect activity logs, audit logs, system logs, 
   and client event logs from SafeNet DataSecure installations at v6.3.0 and above. 
 * STEALTHbits stealthINTERCEPT: This DSM uses Syslog to collect Active Directory audit 
   events directly from Microsoft Domain Controllers. 
 * Vormetric Data Security: This DSM uses Syslog to collect audit, alarm, warning, learn mode, 
   and system from Vormetric Data Security Managers at version 5.1.3 and Vormetric Data Security 
   agents at version 5.2. 
 * Digital Defense Automated Vulnerability Scanner: This scanner generates XML-based
   vulnerability data that is imported to QRadar through HTTPS API requests.
