PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
When IBM Websphere Application Server is used to host Jazz-based applications such as IBM Rational Team Concert, and is configured to only allow the TLS encryption protocol (For example: FIPS compliance), the Firefox 3.5.X browser may get into a state where it insists on using the SSL encryption protocol, and therefore fails to connect to the server.

SYMPTOM
After successfully connecting to and navigating a Jazz-based application deployed in Websphere Application Server, Firefox 3.5.X suddenly starts reporting "connection interrupted" errors, and can no longer connect to the application.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Using Firefox 3.5.X 
 * Jazz-based application deployed is deployed on a Websphere Application Server Server 
 * Websphere Application Server Server configured to only allow TLS encryption, not SSL 
 * Errors like these appear in the Websphere Application Server SystemOut.log file:
   
   [11/4/10 10:28:53:903 EDT] 000000b9 SSLHandshakeE E SSLC0008E: Unable to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or security settings have expired. Exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol SSLv3 not enabled or not supported


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, try either of the following options: 

 * Restart your browser 
 * Upgrade to Firefox 3.6.X appears to eliminate the problem.
