ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a customer set a default value in a FileNet P8 document
   class, for example the text value "NO" or a document property
   named "group" with the value "Contract" and hide this property
   in a Workplace XT entry template, the Content Navigator does
   not save the default value of the class property to a new
   document instance.
   
   In our customer use case, the existence of the "group" and
   "document class" property value does fire a subscription
   because the ICN does not save the hidden property values of the
   class definition. If the same is done in Workplace XT the new
   document created contains the default values of the used
   document class.
   
   The XT entry template setting for used P8 properties are not
   correctly used.
   The flags are "editable", "hide/editable" or "hide".
   Editable settings show the property to the user and save the
   used value to the document instance.
   Hide/Editable is the same but do not disable the property to
   the user in creation step. If a value is selected in a
   choicelist, the value is predefined in the entry template xml.
   
   The "hide" setting should hide the property from the user AND
   do not save any value selected in the entry template but use
   the default value given from the class definition for the new
   document.
   
   This issue had already been a software problem in 201 release of
   content navigator and was fixed with an APAR by Ron Kyker.
