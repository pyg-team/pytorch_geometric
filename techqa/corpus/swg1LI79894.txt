ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to add Datapower Gateway on linux by CMC, it fails
   with following error:
   --------------
   Firmware update failed. Error log:
   Loading firmware failed: Key decryption error:

   APIC tries to enable AppOpt feature on gateway, but it does not
   work well and causes this error.

   add gateway. Please contact IBM support to get AO activation
   tool.
