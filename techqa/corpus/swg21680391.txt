 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service cannot be started successfully due to database corruption. 

SYMPTOM
Cannot start the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service


CAUSE
Transaction log gets corrupted when IBM Content Collector server runs out of disk space. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Shutdown the IBM Content Collector Configuration Store Service if it is running. 
 2. Make a backup copy of all files under the following directory:
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore
    
    C:\ProgramData may be hidden by default. Show hidden folders by changing the configuration in Folder and Search options > View tab > Hidden files and folders > Show hidden files, folders, and drives. 
 3. Free up disk space on the drive 
 4. Delete the following files:
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\logs\*
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solmsg.out
    C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\solerror.out
    
    Important: 
    Delete only the files under C:\ProgramData\IBM\ContentCollector\ConfigurationStore\logs\. 
    Do not delete the folder itself.
    
 5. If restoring the configuration store to a previously backed up copy is required, run afuConfigStoreTool -backup to restore the backup copy. See production documentation for more information on running this tool. Otherwise, proceed to the next step. 
 6. Restart IBM Content Collector services.
