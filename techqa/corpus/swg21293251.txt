QUESTION
 I have one folder containing two application groups. These application groups have identical definitions, and they contain applications that have identical definitions, too. I select Options -> View Combined Documents in the thick client to concatenate the selected documents and display them as a single document in one viewing window. After I query the folder and get multiple returned hits, I select several of them and click on View All Selected. I am then prompted with a dialog box: "The documents are incompatible. Do you wish to view them separately?" Why do I receive this message? 

CAUSE
To use the View Combined Documents option, the following criteria must be met. Otherwise, you will receive the error message: 

 * All selected documents need to be from the same application group and the same application 
 * All selected documents need to have the data type of line 
 * No selected documents can have large object support

ANSWER
The error message is probably generated because your selected hits do not come from the same application group and the same application.
