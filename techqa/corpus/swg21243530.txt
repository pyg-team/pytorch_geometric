Title: IBM Cannot run WebSphere Application Server Ant tasks in Rational Application Developer or WebSphere Studio Application Developer - United States

Text:
Ant tasks; setupCmdLine; PMR 64270024649; RAD; WSAD; 1243530 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Errors occur when you are invoking IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Ant tasks in an Ant script running from IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) or WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD). A typical error you might see would be:
Unable to parse setupCmdLine: null\bin\setupCmdLine.bat (The handle is invalid.) 

SYMPTOM

Unable to parse setupCmdLine: null\bin\setupCmdLine.bat (The handle is invalid.)


CAUSE
WAS Ant tasks have their own initialization and environment setup requirements as specified in WAS documentation, such as using the ws_ant.bat file, and because of the differences in how the test environment is launched compared with using the full WAS server, those tasks cannot be accomplished while running inside WSAD or RAD. 

It is not supported to mix WAS Ant tasks with WSAD or RAD Ant tasks in the same Ant script, when they are running inside WSAD or RAD. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To avoid this problem, try to find WSAD or RAD Ant tasks which will perform the same functionality as the WAS ANT task. If no such tasks exist, then you must use separate Ant scripts and environments for running the respective Ant tasks.
