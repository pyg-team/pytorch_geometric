Title: IBM DataStage web service client gets error " INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified." when processing web service response - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing Information Server 8.1 fix pack 1, jobs created using Information Server 8.1 and containing web service client stage may be unable to process response from web service, instead getting error: 
Message: APT_CombinedOperatorController,0: Fatal Error: Fatal: 0026`:`com.ascentialsoftware.wsclient.ServiceInvocationException: Service invocation exception: INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Information Server 8.1 fix pack 1 changed a delimiter character from space to tab so web service jobs imported from a prior maintenance level will no longer have a delimiter between the namespace entries since the existing space character is no longer considered a delimiter. 

The result is that on the "input arguments" and "output arguments" pages for the web service client stage properties, the namespace entries may all appear on one line instead of one reference per line. 

Examine the input and ouput argument pages for your web service stage. If multiple references appear on one line, then delete that line then click button at bottom of page to reload the definitions. They should now correctly appear on separate lines. Save then compile job and confirm this change resolves the problem. 


Note: There are other possible causes for the error "INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified"....the above scenario is just the one issue known to occur after installing fix pack 1 for jobs which worked ok prior to fix pack 1. For example, another possible cause for the above error occurs when the hostname for web service is unreachable or no data is returned for other reasons.
