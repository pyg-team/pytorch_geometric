APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Android Verse clients send mail, it is formatted as HTML
   (text/html content-type).  Most human read mail clients will
   display this HTML content.  However, there are some (relatively
   old) clients that might only display or otherwise rely on the
   plain text (text/plain content-type) content of the mail.
   Therefore, the Traveler server attempts to ensure that both
   text/plain and text/html content is available on the mail when
   it is sent (adding text/plain based on the text/html if the
   text/plain does not already exist).  An issue was identified
   where if the HTML contained a <p> tag that the text/plain
   content might lose the line feed characters (new lines) causing
   too much text to appear to run together on a single line rather
   than multiple lines.  This Traveler server change exposes the
   configuration options as well as removing the <p> tag from the
   default list.  This change improves some text/plain content of
   the mails by allowing the line feeds to remain.
