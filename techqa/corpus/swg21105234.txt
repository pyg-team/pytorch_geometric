QUESTION
 What attributes should you use to define the MVS log streams for the log of logs and forward recovery logs when you are using CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR)? 

ANSWER
Use the following attributes when defining the coupling facility (CF) log streams for the log of logs and forward recovery logs:
HIGHOFFLOAD(80)
LOWOFFLOAD - range of 40 to 60 (not zero) 
AUTODELETE(NO)
RETPD(0)

Use the following attributes when defining the DASD-only log streams for the log of logs and forward recovery logs:
HIGHOFFLOAD(40)
LOWOFFLOAD - range of 0 to 10 (not zero for UNDO logs) 
AUTODELETE(NO)
RETPD(0)

Then, use CICS VR to set retention periods for your log streams and have CICS VR automatically deregister and delete outdated log stream blocks and log stream copies. See Setting automatic log stream deregistration criteria [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQJMU_5.2.0/dwwig/dwwig000135.html] in the CICS VR documentation for more details.
