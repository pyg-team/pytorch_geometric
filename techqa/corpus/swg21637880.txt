QUESTION
 How do I record items to the debug table in the Engine database for foreground tasks such as HardScan, SoftScan, FlexID, and Verify? 

CAUSE
While logging to the debug table for background tasks is controlled from the settings in Rulerunner Manager, enabling debug logging for foreground task requires modification of the apps.ini file.

ANSWER
The foreground tasks can be enabled to write to the Debug table by setting the debug value to 1 in the apps.ini file for the client application being used (e.g. \tmweb.net, DotEdit or DotScan). 

 The apps.ini file does not exist by default for DotEdit or DotScan. Copy it from tmweb.net directory to the DotEdit or DotScan directory and modify the debug value.
