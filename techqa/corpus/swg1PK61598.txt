ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You will this exception when trying to apply any interim fix for
   WCM after upgrading to v6.0.1.3:
   =============================
   A product prerequisite relationship was not satisified.
   The product IBM WebSphere Portal MultiPlatform (with ID MP) is
   installed.
   The product IBM WebSphere Portal Document Manager (with ID PDM)
   is installed.
   The product IBM WebSphere Portal Personalization (with ID PZN)
   is installed.
   The product IBM WebSphere WebSphere Portal Web Content Manager
   (with ID WCM) is installed.
   The product IBM WebSphere WebSphere Portal Web Content Manager
   (with ID WCM) is installed.
   The fix PK58305 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK58305] is not supported on any of these products.
   
   Please fix the problem or remove the invalid efix from the list
   and try again
   
   UpdateInstaller.puiReturnCode is 9
   End of [ ./updatePortal.sh ]
   =============================
   
   This is due to an extra .product file in the
   PortalServer/version directory for WCM. This file is created as
   a backup during the 6013 upgrade and is called:
   
   <PortalServer root>/version/WCM.6013.rollback.product
   
   This file references the version of WCM found prior to
   upgrading. Because it is a .product file, WebSphere Portal reads
   this as the currently installed version of WCM and as a result,
   WCM interim fix installations for 6.0.1.3 can fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To resolve this issue,
   
   1. Rename the WCM.6013.rollback.product file to
   WCM.6013.rollback.product.original. DO NOT REMOVE THE FILE as it
   might be needed for future reference.
   2. Run the fix installation again.
