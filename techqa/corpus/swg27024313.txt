 * Routine SQL statement tuning with InfoSphere® Optim™ Query Workload Tuner has been improved to now collect the actual access plan information from DB2 databases, including runtime statistics for the operations performed to execute the SQL statements.
 * From the Data Source Explorer, you can now use the routine editor to open triggers that are defined on tables or views in DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows v10.1 Fix Pack 2 and later databases.
 * You can now create and debug anonymous PL/SQL blocks in the SQL and XQuery editor when you are connected to DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows v10.1 Fix Pack 2 and later databases.
 * Enhanced routine editing and debugging:  * Improved performance for debugging routines.
    * The routine debugger now supports nested routines.
    * For routines that are deployed on a DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows v10.1 Fix Pack 2 and later databases, you can now set and remove breakpoints from routine source code in the routine editor in the routine editor and debugger.
    * Now, all breakpoint information is persisted with each routine.
    * In the debugger, you can now view ARRAY, ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY, ARRAY of ROW, and global variables in the Variables view.
   
   For more information about the routine debugger, see Routine debugger [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dstudio/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.debug.spd.plsql.doc/topics/cbsovrv.html].
 * Use IBM Optim Configuration Manager to share and synchronize connection information for DB2 databases between your Data Studio clients. Use IBM Optim Configuration Manager to store your connection information in a single repository to share among team members. For more information, see Sharing database connection information through a repository database [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dstudio/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.datatools.common.nav.doc/topics/cdbconn_share_repodb.html].
 * Installation enhancements:  * Enterprise deployment now supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. Use IBM Installation Manager and the scripts and sample response files that are bundled with the product to deploy the product installation to other computers in your enterprise. For more information, see Enterprise deployment of IBM Data Studio [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dstudio/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.datatools.base.install.doc/topics/chxcon_mdenterprise.html].
    * You can now install the product into a shared package group (also referred to as shell-sharing) with other 64 bit Optim and Rational products.

DATA STUDIO WEB CONSOLE The Data Studio web console includes the following feature enhancements:

 * Schedule database blackout events to disallow monitoring and job execution on databases for a specified period of time.
 * Create and share alert views to identify problems associated with managed databases.
 * Create alert actions to run jobs when alerts are triggered.
 * Installation enhancement:
   The installation wizard has been upgraded to use IBM Installation Manager so you can now manage both the Data Studio client and web console product installations from the same tool. Important: 
   
    * To install the Data Studio web console, you must have administrator privileges. In the launchpad, you must select Administrative Installation because the Non-Administrative Installation option is unsupported.
    * It is recommended that you upgrade to the Data Studio web console v3.2 if you upgrade to the Data Studio client v3.2. To use the job manager in Data Studio web console v3.2 with versions of the Data Studio full client v3.1.1, you must open the web console interface in a web browser. Managing jobs from the Job Manager tab in the 3.1.1 version of the Data Studio full client is not supported.
