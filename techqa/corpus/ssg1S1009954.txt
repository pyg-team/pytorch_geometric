Why is the next generation Hyper-Scale Manager GUI better than your current XIV GUI?
The development and breakthrough design was done in the last 3 years together with almost 80 customers around the world. They gave insights, ideas and helped us shape this new product to a better state. We listened to you and still listening to your feedback to make it even better! 

What do we offer you in Storage Management? 

 * Reduced Management TCO - lower the number of clicks and time it takes for each operation to complete. Faster and easier than what you’ve seen before. 
 * Web - stop maintaining JAVA on your client desktops. No need to upgrade your clients. Only one server, multiple web browsers with no plugins. 
 * Cognitive and analytics - our new application “learns” your habits and behaviors and suggests where to go next. At first, you’ll be amazed, and then you’ll find it extremely helpful in minimizing activities. 
 * Trending/forecasting – now embedded inside the UI, host/pool/system capacity trends are obtained by the application and forecasts are displayed including exact dates to reach thresholds. 
 * Top and current performance metrics are embedded seamlessly. 
 * And there’s a lot more. Watch the new Tips & Tricks for 5.2 here: https://youtu.be/Wywvwr6xqQU [https://youtu.be/Wywvwr6xqQU]

Customers are loving it! Here are some quotes:

"I was just super impressed with how much work you guys have done [on the new FlashSystem management interface] and how much easier to use it is…I think it's just like night and day." - Richard Myers, Sr. Network Engineer, APWU Health Plan

"Wow, that is a huge time saver- being able to click on a volume and see its mappings and performance data on same screen"

" I love the google type ahead feature so I can just start typing and find what I am looking for -- that is huge with all of our systems and hosts!! "

".....Their Storage Admin was mesmerized by the GUI! In fact, as Andrew explains in the video, Storage Admins can now do in 1 or 2 clicks what it took 7, 8 or 9 clicks to do previously. They were hooked!...."

"The next generation taking the ease of use to new level" 

"After working 3 days with this GUI, I will definitely go with the new one over the old. It makes the work more effective and much simpler."
