QUESTION
 What are the recommended preparations for your agents and your load tests for IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) Extension for Citrix Presentation Server? 

CAUSE
You need to anticipate the amount of remote agent computer and the Citrix environment to use for the load test.

ANSWER
First, review the supported Citrix environments [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21459253] and the Citrix Testing Guidelines [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rpthelp/v8r3m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.test.lt.citrix.doc%2Ftopics%2Fccitreqs.html]. 

For RPT Citrix load tests sizing, a good number is 20 virtual testers (VTs) per Gigabyte (Gb) of RAM on an agent computer. Above 20 VTGb-1 of RAM, you might encounter performance issues.


For Citrix and especially for long load test durations, the Long Run Mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rpthelp/v8r3m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.test.lt.doc%2Ftopics%2Ftrunlongtests.html] is usually the right choice.
