ABSTRACT
 SupportPac CB12 demonstrates application modernization for IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS), by modeling a general insurance application. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac page was last updated on December 8, 2015. See New in this release for details of any changes.


The primary purpose of this SupportPac is to demonstrate application modernization, by providing a general insurance application (known as GENAPP) for IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS). The GENAPP application has been developed in-house by the IBM Hursley CICS Development team to help with their testing of new CICS releases.

GENAPP is designed to exercise various components of CICS TS; containing functions to insert, query, and delete policy information. In its original form GENAPP is driven using 3270 input, where the insurance policy information is stored in a DB2 database.

GENAPP illustrates how a 3270-based 'green screen' application can be transformed to use many of the rich features and functions of the newer releases of CICS TS.

Further details about GENAPP are available in the IBM Knowledge Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.samples.doc/topics/genapp.html].

Possible Uses
To test a variety of functions and components of CICS TS, using a typical application. GENAPP can be used to modify an existing legacy application to utilize new CICS functions and capabilities.

Skill level required
Intermediate, with knowledge of CICS systems configuration, operation, and applications.
