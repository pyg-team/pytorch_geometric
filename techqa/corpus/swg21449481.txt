Title: IBM Non-administrative users cannot access Edit Profile (Selfcare) portlet - United States

Text:
Profile Management; Selfcare; Self Care; Edit Profile; EJPSG0044E; Virtual Resource TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You provide a means for non-administrative users to update their passwords using the out-of-the-box Profile Management portlet (Edit Profile portlet, also called the Selfcare portlet). When non-admins attempt to access the portlet, a permissions-related message displays. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, update Portal Access Control as follows:

1. Log in as the Portal administrator and navigate to Administration --> Resource Permissions --> Virtual Resources --> USER SELF ENROLLMENT.

2. Click the Assign Access key icon and add the All Authenticated Portal Users group to the Editor role of this Virtual Resource.

3. Restart Portal.
