APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQSI commands fail with the following error message on machines
   which do not have dynamic page size support:
   
   JVMJ9GC032E System configuration does not support option '-Xlp'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V7.0 or higher running on
   AIX.
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   There was a defect in the JRE shipped with WebSphere Message
   Broker 7.0.0.3 which caused a memory leak in shared memory
   owned by the JVM. To work around this defect the broker was
   modified so that command line JVMs were created with the -Xlp4K
   option which specifies the use of 4K pages.
   
   It is possible to configure an AIX system with dynamic page
   size support disabled which results in a failure to create
   command JVMs with the error:
   
   JVMJ9GC032E System configuration does not support option '-Xlp'
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The shared memory leak was addressed in Java SR10 which is
   shipped with WebSphere Message Broker 7.0.0.4.  WebSphere
   message Broker has therefore been modified to no longer pass
   the -Xlp4K command line option when creating command JVMs.
