Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM i (CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2015-3197) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities affect IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0701 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0701]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, caused by the use of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters based on unsafe primes that are generated and stored in X9.42-style parameter files. By performing multiple handshakes using the same private DH exponent, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
