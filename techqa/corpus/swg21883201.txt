QUESTION
 MTTrapd probe : What is the minimum number of destinations? 

CAUSE
Customers who use the standard production, user acceptance testing, and test environments require a description of the options and best practices.
The Peer-to-Peer configuration requires two identical trap sources to function, and both probe servers to be allocated the same resources, such that the master and slave probes are processing traps in sequence.


ANSWER
 

Customers who use the three stage design in their Netcool/OMNIbus environment can forward traps to three destinations, allowing them to receive traps in their production environment and test environments, as shown below:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883201&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883201&aid=1] 

The Netcool/ITNM [Precision] now called TNCM includes a trap forwarder [ncp_trapmux] but there are other trap forwarders available, as well as high-availability tcp forwarding solutions. 

The benefit of forwarding to three destinations is that the production environment is not being compromised by any trap forwarding. 

If a high-availability solution is available for trap forwarding, then a single destination is acceptable, with the high-availability software being responsible for trap delivery to the individual probe environments.
