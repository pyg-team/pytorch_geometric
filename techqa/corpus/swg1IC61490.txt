APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A connection from the WebSphere MQ V7 Explorer to a queue
   manager cannot be secured using the cipher spec
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA. Attempting to do so will lead to
   an error:
   
   Queue manager QM1 is not available for client connection due to
   an SSL configuration error. (AMQ4199).
   
   with an accompanying error in the queue manager error log:
   
   AMQ9665: SSL connection closed by remote end of channel '????'
   
   
   A trace of the Explorer taken at the time of the will show the
   following:
   
   RemoteTCPConnection.parseCipherSpec(String)() rc=0
   [0x26ca26ca] Exception caught [idx=2]:
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot support
   SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA with currently installed providers
   or cipher suite is not legal in FIPS mode.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects all users attempting to secure a connection
   from the WebSphere MQ V7 Explorer to a queue manager using the
   cipher spec TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA.
   
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) shipped with the Explorer
   does not ship the unrestricted policy files needed for 256 bit
   encryption, and so this level of encryption cannot be used to
   connect from the Explorer to a remote queue manager unless the
   unrestricted policy files are added to the JRE used by the
   Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The cipher spec TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA can not be used to
   secure a connection from the Explorer to a queue manager unless
   the unrestricted policy files are added to the JRE used by the
   Explorer.
   
   References to this cipher spec in the documentation should make
   a note of this fact.
   
   The supported list of cipher specs can be found in the
   following sections of the WebSphere MQ V7 InfoCenter:
   
   Using Java
   -> WebSphere MQ Classes for Java
   --> Writing WebSphere MQ Classes for Java applications
   ---> Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support
   ----> SSL Cipher Specs and Cipher Suites

   The policy files can be accessed from
   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/50 and are
   also available in the gskit/jre/lib/security directory of the MQ
   Server install.
