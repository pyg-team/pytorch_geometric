QUESTION
 This technote shows how to find the ibm-slapdCryptoSalt value for a Directory server. 

ANSWER
Cryptographically synching two servers requires knowing the cryptographic seed value (entered when an instance was figured configured) and the cryptographic salt value of the first server. While there's no way to recover the original cryptographic seed value (if you remember it already), there is a way to find the cryptographic salt, using the following search: 

idsldapsearch -D <admin_dn> -w ? -b cn=crypto,cn=localhost -s base objectclass=* ibm-slapdCryptoSalt 

For example:
idsldapsearch -D cn=root -w ? -b cn=crypto,cn=localhost -s base objectclass=* ibm-slapdCryptoSalt

cn=crypto,cn=localhost
ibm-slapdCryptoSalt=secretsecret

Note, however, that if the cryptographic salt value wasn't specified at instance configuration time, then it will be a random computer-generated string that looks quite a bit different than the one above.
