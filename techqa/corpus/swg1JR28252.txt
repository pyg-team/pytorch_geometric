APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Application install performance can be improved by batching
   queue creation when installing an SCA module. We have written a
   prototype that accomplishes this and saves 120 seconds (15%)
   when installing the OrderProcessing application.

   ****************************************************************
   Depending on number of Service Component Architecture (SCA)
   components, exports and imports in a WebSphere Business
   Integration Module, there can be a large number of internally
   generated Service Integration Bus (SIBus) destinations that
   needs to be created during the module install time. These
   destinations were created one by one and is a time consuming
   process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After applying this interim fix, these SIBus destinations are
   created in batch fashion saving a lot of time during module
   installation.
