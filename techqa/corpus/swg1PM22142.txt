APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM workspace Log Analysis misses component attribute.
   Although this item is shown in the related queries, it is not
   shown in the corresponding workspace.
   
   Attribute "Component" of "Log Analysis" attribute group is
   contained in the 3 pre-defined associated queries (Log Analysis,
   Log Analysisand Log Analysis 6.2).
   
   If one tries to create a query starting from either of the
   above, one can't actually add "Component" as an attribute.
   Attribute "Component" can't be used as a valid
   filter, hence can't be displayed in the Log Analysis table view.
   
   However, going into the attribute file kyn.atr, one can see that
   this attribute is the only one defined for YN agent as "hidden":
   
   entr HIDDEN
   name Log_Analysis.Component
   usag H
   affi 0000m0000000000000000000000000I1##000000000
   colu COMPONENT
   atom Y
   type 10
   slng 32
   cost 9
   msid KYN1512
   opgr 0
   atid 00030114
   
   This attribute should display the abbreviated name of the
   logging component that issued the message or trace event.
   This is typically the class name for WebSphere Application
   Server internal components, but can be some other identifier for
   user applications.
   
   This APAR has been opened to remove the hidden condition.
