You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

For 6.2.x IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.
