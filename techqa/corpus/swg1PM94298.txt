APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to build and run a Java application with a switch
   nested within try-catch might result in:
   
   java.lang.VerifyError: JVMVRFY012 stack shape inconsistent
   
   when targeting Java 7.0 for compilation.
   
   Problem:
   
   The error was found when compiling and running their application
   using Java 7.0.  When targeting Java 6.0 the application works
   correctly.  When targeting Java 7 the application fails to run
   and it throws:
   
   Exception in thread 'main' java.lang.VerifyError: JVMVRFY012
   stack shape inconsistent; class=test/com/EclipseVerifyError,
   method=method()V, pc=1
    at java.lang.J9VMInternals.verifyImpl(Native Method)
    at java.lang.J9VMInternals.verify(J9VMInternals.java:85)
