APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A CICS OSGi JVM Server has been configured to load the MQ
   V8.0.0.4 OSGi bundles:
   
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_8.0.0.4.jar
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclientprereqs_8.0.0.4.jar
   
   as described in the "Setting up the JVM server environment"
   topic in the IBM MQ V8 section of IBM Knowledge Center. When a
   JMS application is deployed into the OSGi JVM Server that has
   the Java system property:
   
   -Dosgi.compatibility.bootdelegation=false
   
   set, the application fails to start with an error similar to the
   one below:
   
   [ENABLE_OSGIBUNDLE_Thread-10][com.ibm.cics.osgi.impl] @Error:
   Controller.enableBundle() - ID = 28
   org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Exception in
   my.application.Activator.start() of bundle my.bundle.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS OSGi bundles
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes for JMS OSGi bundles.
   - The IBM MQ V8.0 IBM MQ V8.0 OSGi bundles called:
   
        com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version number>.jar
        com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclientprereqs_<version number>.jar
   
   who are running JMS applications inside an OSGi environment.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The OSGi bundle:
   
     com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq.prereq_<version number>.jar
   
   provided with WebSphere MQ V7.1 and V7.5, and the OSGi bundle:
   
     com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclientprereqs_<version number>.jar
   
   shipped with MQ V8.0, contains the prerequisite JAR files that
   are needed by the other MQ OSGi bundles to be able to run JMS
   applications.
   
   The JAR files contained within these bundles required access to
   the following packages
   
   - javax.naming
   - javax.naming.directory
   - javax.naming.event
   - javax.naming.ldap
   - javax.naming.spi
   
   If the OSGi environment was configured in such a way that these
   packages were not explicitly available via OSGi boot delegation,
   then an error similar to the one below would be reported when a
   JMS application started up:
   
   WebSphere MQ V7.1 and V7.5
   -----------------------------------
   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
   javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactory
       :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :
   Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactory cannot be found by cannot
   be found by com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq.prereq_<version_number>
   
   MQ V8.0
   ----------
   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
   javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactory
       :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :
   Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   javax.naming.spi.InitialContextFactory cannot be found by
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclientprereqs_<version_number>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The OSGi bundle:
   
     com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq.prereq_<version number>.jar
   
   provided with WebSphere MQ V7.1 and V7.5, and the OSGi bundle:
   
     com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclientprereqs_<version number>.jar
   
   shipped with MQ V8.0,  have been updated to import the packages:
   
   - javax.naming
   - javax.naming.spi
   
   This allows the prerequsite JAR files contained within the
   bundles to load classes within these packages that are needed to
   run JMS applications.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:
   
   Version    Maintenance Level
   v7.1       7.1.0.8
   v7.5       7.5.0.7
   v8.0       8.0.0.6
   v9.0 CD    9.0.1
   v9.0 LTS   9.0.0.1
