ABSTRACT
 Sample WebSphere pattern applications use the same cookie name and path, which causes ELB proxy attributes to be overwritten when the ELB proxy shared service is deployed in the same cloud group. 

CONTENT
Problem: The applications provided with the sample WebSphere virtual application patterns use the same cookie name and path ("/"). 

If the ELB proxy shared service is deployed in the same cloud group as the sample WebSphere virtual application patterns, you might see the SRVE0255E error message in your browser when viewing more than one sample web application. When more than one of these applications is accessed in the same browser, the ELB proxy attributes are overwritten, causing the error. 

 

Resolution: Take one of the following actions: 

 * Option 1: Before deploying a sample WebSphere virtual application pattern to a cloud group that is using the ELB proxy shared service, disable the ELB routing in the pattern.  1. Open the pattern to edit it. 
    2. Select Add policy to pattern. 
    3. Select the routing policy. 
    4. Set the routing choice to Disable Routing. 
    5. Save your changes and specify a new name.
   
   

 * Option 2: Deploy the sample WebSphere patterns in a cloud group that is not using the ELB proxy shared service.


 * Option 3: Use a different browser to access each sample WebSphere virtual application.


 * Option 4: Clear the browser history or delete the cookies from the browser that you are using to access the sample WebSphere virtual applications, before accessing the next WebSphere virtual application.
