   After analyzing the internal structure of the
   document (at code level), there is some features
   aggregating under the detail views and pointing
   some external 3D elements.
   Such aggregation under detail views cannot be
   possible with default installation. In order to
   investigate further,  Development team will require
   detail scenario which leads to current situation. As
   this information is not available, reported scenario
   considered as restriction
