ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product: UX OS Agent
   Severity: 3
   Approver: gdc
   Compid: 5724C040U
   Release: 6.2.2
   
   
   Problem
   Description: On AIX the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS kuxagent
   process can take a very long time to collect process
   information due to a retry mechanism implemented to
   workaround an AIX issue with the getargs API.
   
   A configuration parameter is needed in order to give the
   customers the capability to set the needed delay for the
   getargs retry mechanism.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No work around available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The OS Agent does not report data on AIX machine
   
   On AIX the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS kuxagent process can
   take a very long time to collect process information due to a
   retry mechanism implemented to workaround an AIX issue with the
   getargs API.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A configuration parameter is needed in order to give the
   customers the capability to set the needed delay for the getargs
   retry mechanism. New variable is KUX_GETARGS_DELAY that can
   accept values between 0 and 1000 milliseconds
   
   Install Actions
   
   In order to gain the effect of this fix, you need to add into
   the CANDLEHOME/config/ux.ini file the environment variable
   "KUX_GETARGS_DELAY" and assign it a value of nnnn milliseconds.
   It can accept values between 0 and 1000 milliseconds.
   
   Example:
     KUX_GETARGS_DELAY=500
   
   After the value is set, stop and start the agent for it to take
   affect.
