 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are there new SYSTEM queues added in WebSphere MQ 7.1, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 9.0.1? 

ANSWER
Yes, these are the new SYSTEM queues.
*** For MQ 7.1:

SYSTEM.ADMIN.PUBSUB.EVENT 

WebSphere MQ > Monitoring and performance > Event monitoring > Instrumentation events
Event types [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.mon.doc/q036170_.htm?lang=en]


WebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering multicast
Multicast application monitoring [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q021510_.htm?lang=en]
The status of the current publishers and subscribers for multicast traffic (for example, the number of messages sent and received, or the number of messages lost) is periodically transmitted to the server from the client. When status is received, the COMMEV attribute of the COMMINFO object specifies whether or not the queue manager puts an event message on the SYSTEM.ADMIN.PUBSUB.EVENT. 

SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ACTIVITY.QUEUE 
[http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.mon.doc/q037540_.htm?lang=en]WebSphere MQ > Monitoring and performance > Application activity trace > Application activity trace messages
Application activity trace information collection [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.mon.doc/q037540_.htm?lang=en]
Activity records are written to the new system queue SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ACTIVITY.QUEUE. They collect information about the MQI operations that an application performs while connected to a queue manager.

SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE
WebSphere MQ > Troubleshooting and support
Troubleshooting channel authentication records [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.tro.doc/q039490_.htm?lang=en]
Behaviour of SET CHLAUTH command over queue manager restart
If the SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE, has been deleted or altered in a way that it is no longer accessible i.e. PUT(DISABLED), the SET CHLAUTH command will only be partially successful.

SYSTEM.DOTNET.XARECOVERY.QUEUE
WebSphere MQ > Developing applications > Using .NET > Getting started with WebSphere MQ classes for .NET > Recovering Transactions
WebSphere MQ .NET Distributed Transaction Processing – Recovering Transaction [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q029340_.htm?lang=en]
To recover an incomplete transaction the recovery information is required. The transaction recovery information must be logged to storage by the resource managers. WebSphere MQ .NET classes follow a similar path. The transaction recovery information is logged to a system queue called SYSTEM.DOTNET.XARECOVERY.QUEUE.

SYSTEM.JMS.TEMPQ.MODEL
WebSphere MQ > Developing applications > Using WebSphere MQ classes for JMS > Writing WebSphere MQ classes for JMS applications > Accessing WebSphere MQ features
JMS persistent messages [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q032380_.htm?lang=en]
The JMS Layer can use SYSTEM.JMS.TEMPQ.MODEL, instead of SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE. 
SYSTEM.JMS.TEMPQ.MODEL creates permanent dynamic queues that accept persistent messages, because SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE cannot accept persistent messages. If you wish to use temporary queues to accept persistent messages, you must therefore use SYSTEM.JMS.TEMPQ.MODEL, or change the model queue to an alternative queue of your choosing.


*** For MQ 7.5:

SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.MODEL.QUEUE
WebSphere MQ > Configuring > Configuring a queue manager cluster > Managing WebSphere MQ clusters
Adding a queue manager to a cluster – separate transmission queues [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.con.doc/q017380_.htm?lang=en]
Every time the queue manager creates a cluster-sender channel to send a message to a queue manager, it creates a cluster transmission queue. The transmission queue is used only by this cluster-sender channel. The transmission queue is permanent-dynamic. It is created from the model queue, SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.MODEL.QUEUE, with the name SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.ChannelName.

SYSTEM.PROTECTION.ERROR.QUEUE
SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE
These 2 queues are used by WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Security (AMS)
WebSphere MQ > Security > WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Security > WebSphere MQ AMS overview > User Scenarios [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q014700_.htm?lang=en]
Quick Start Guide for UNIX platforms
The queue SYSTEM.PROTECTION.ERROR.QUEUE is used to put error messages generated by the AMS code.
The queue SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE stores the policies defined by the MQ Administration for protecting other queues with the AMS function.

Even if you are not using AMS, you may see entries in the error logs regarding this queue. See the following technote for more information:

WebSphere MQ 7.5 client generates rc 2085 for missing queue SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE on WebSphere MQ 7.0 or 7.1 queue managers that are enabled for local events [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623002]

*** For MQ 8.0:

SYSTEM.DDELAY.LOCAL.QUEUE
DESCR('WebSphere MQ Deferred Delivery Queue')

WebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > WebSphere MQ > Developing applications > Developing JMS and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition applications > Using WebSphere MQ classes for JMS > Writing WebSphere MQ classes for JMS applications > Using JMS 2.0 functionality > 
JMS 2.0 delivery delay [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q119200_.htm?lang=en]
SYSTEM.DDELAY.LOCAL.QUEUE
A new system queue, SYSTEM.DDELAY.LOCAL.QUEUE, is used to implement delivery delay. 
- On distributed systems, SYSTEM.DDELAY.LOCAL.QUEUE exists by default. The system queue must be altered so that its MAXMSGL and MAXDEPTH attributes are sufficient for the expected load. 
- [z/OS] On WebSphere MQ for z/OS®, SYSTEM.DDELAY.LOCAL.QUEUE is used as a staging queue for messages that are sent with delivery delay to both local and shared queues. On z/OS, the queue must be created and must either be defined so that its MAXMSGL and MAXDEPTH attributes are sufficient for the expected load. 

SYSTEM.INTERNAL.REQUEST.QUEUE
DESCR('WebSphere MQ Internal Request Queue')
Note: No information available yet in the MQ 8.0 Documentation

SYSTEM.MESSAGE.ASSOCIATION.QUEUE
DESCR('WebSphere MQ Message Association Queue')
Note: No information available yet in the MQ 8.0 Documentation


*** For MQ 9.0:

SYSTEM.AMQP.COMMAND.QUEUE
Used for MQ Light

*** For MQ 9.0.1:

SYSTEM.REST.REPLY.QUEUE
Used with REST API
