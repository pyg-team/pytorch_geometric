ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description of Problem (full details)
   The installer could not recognise a "maxdsiz" kernel
   configuration of "0x80000000". This is
   actually greater than the required "0x10000000".
   
   Installation was successful but IS software failed with
   cfg_verify
   failures. Determined that the 64bit maxdsiz value was set to
   4GB.
   Reduced this to 256MB. Software successfully started. Could
   initialize
   isolate region and launch workflows.
   
   Customer cannot set the maxdsiz value to such a low level. We
   increased
   the value to 2.5GB but the software still fails.
   Error encountered when running vwtaskman when the kernel
   parameter is
   set to 2.5GB or higher. We do not get any problems when it is
   set to
   256MB.
   
   
   Error:
   
   Error while retrieving the security settings:
   /usr/lib/dld.sl:Dld daemon
   response is invalid, cannot load:
   
   /fnsw/lib/shobj/libvwcppv.sl
   
   /usr/lib/dld.sl:No such file or directory
   
   
   What value does BPM 4.0 require for maxdsiz 64 bit in order to
   function?
   We did not even know that the 64 bit variable was utilised.
   Also unable
   to apply BPM4.02 due to VPD errors during the install.
   
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   n
   Is there a workaround? : yes.
   Reduced "maxdsiz" kernel configuration to "0x10000000".
   
   HP-UX server had to be bounced as "maxdsiz" is a "Static"
   configuration.
   Re-ran installer.
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Customer cannot set the maxdsiz value to such a low level.
   Increasing
   the value to 2.5GB caused the software to fail.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  N
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)

   Actual Results:
   Reduce the maxdsiz value to 256MB everything starts up fine.
   But increasing
   the value to 2.5GB caused the software to fail.
   Expected Results:
   Are there any similar or related Defects? ecmdb00556682
