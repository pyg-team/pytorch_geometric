APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attribute 'Server Name' in XS Catalogs workspace and XS Servers
   workspace is limited to 48 characters. The value for it is
   a result of combining node name and server name:
   <NODE_NAME>\<SERVER_NAME>
   
   When this value exceeds 48 characters then <NODE_NAME> and
   <SERVER_NAME> are truncated from middle characters, for
   instance:
   WXSNode02\LongNameGrids_cache1xxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   is truncated to:
   WXSNde02\LongNameGrids_cachexxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   
   If on the same node there is a server with name:
   WXSNode02\LongNameGrids_cache2xxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   then it is also truncated to:
   WXSNde02\LongNameGrids_cachexxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   
   In such case user sees only one server in Catalogs
   or Servers workspace.
   
   Users Affected:
   ITCAM for Application Diagnostics 7.1 users who monitor eXtreme
   Scale environment which has long names of grid and catalog
   servers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change server names if it is possible.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ***************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM for Application Diagnostics 7.1 users
   * who monitor WebSphere eXtreme Scale environment which has
   * long names (exceeding 48 characters) of grid or catalog
   * servers.
   ***************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * When full name of WAS XS grid or catalog server
   * (<CELL>\<NODE_NAME>\<SERVER_NAME>) exceeds 48 characters,
   * then in some cases 'Catalogs' or 'Servers' workspaces may not
   * show all servers from WXS Zone.
   ***************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Use ITCAM for AD 7.1.0.3 interim fix 3
   * (7.1.0.3-TIV-ITCAMfAD-IF0003) or newer to resolve this issue.
   ***************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When full name of WXS grid or catalog server name
   (<CELL>\<NODE_NAME>\<SERVER_NAME>) exceeds 48 characters then
   it's name gets truncated by removing middle characters from
   <CELL>, <NODE_NAME> and <SERVER_NAME>, for instance:
   WXSNode02\LongNameGrids_cache1xxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   is truncated to:
   WXSNde02\LongNameGrids_cachexxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   
   If on the same node there is a server with name:
   WXSNode02\LongNameGrids_cache2xxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   
   then it is also truncated to:
   WXSNde02\LongNameGrids_cachexxxx_xxxxx0002Node02
   
   In such case user sees only one server in Catalogs
   or Servers workspace.
   
   The fix for this APAR ensures that truncated server names
   (aliases) are unique. Additionally, fix provides a possibility
   to customize generated alias.
   
   The fix does NOT change aliases which are already generated.
   This must be done manually after fix is applied. The following
   steps should be applied:
   
   1. Stop the agent
   2. Edit file ${hostname}_yn.xml
      (${ITM_HOME}/config/${hostname}_yn.xml on Linux, Unix or
      ${ITM_HOME}\TMAITM6\${hostname}_yn.xml on Windows)
   3. a) Method #1 - custom aliases:
    Change value of 'alias' attribute in <entry> tag
    (XPath: /AgentConfig/wXSConfig/aliases-catalog/dictionary
    [@name='containers']/entry) or /AgentConfig/wXSConfig/
    aliases-catalog/dictionary[@name='catalogs']/entry
       for example:
       <dictionary name="containers">
       <entry
   alias="WXSNde03\LongNameGrids_cachexxxx_xxxxx0001Node03"
       name="nc049142DmgrXSCell\WXSNode03\
    LongNameGrids_cache1xxxx_xxxxx0001Node03">
       </entry>
       </dictionary>
       to:
       <dictionary name="containers">
       <entry alias="WXSNode03\LongNameGrids_cache1"
       name="nc049142DmgrXSCell\WXSNode03\
    LongNameGrids_cache1xxxx_xxxxx0001Node03">
       </entry>
    </dictionary>
      b) Method #2 - generated aliases:
         Remove all <entry> child tags of:
     - <dictionary name="containers">
     - <dictionary name="catalogs">
   
      Note: Duplicate aliases will be altered by adding
      -1, -2, -3, ..., -999 endings.
   4. Start agent
