   'Update if present' is selected on the CARMA ADD ELEMENT UI
   screen.

   01.The RDz Endevor RAM needs to include UPDATE in the generated
      SCL when 'Update if present' is selected when using the "Add
      to Endevor" menu option from the RSE view.
   02.If FEKFERRF & listds commands are executed in the same TSO
      gateway session almost at the same time, one command might
      pick up the result of the other command and send the result
      to RDz client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The RDz Endevor RAM is being updated to to include UPDATE in
      the generated SCL when 'Update if present' is selected when
      using the "Add to Endevor" menu option from the RSE view.
   02.Now, both commands are not executed on the TSO gateway
      session.
