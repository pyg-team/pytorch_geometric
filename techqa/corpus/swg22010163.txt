 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why my Classic dataserver log does not including the diagnosis log? 

ANSWER

I believe you must use log stream. 
Do you specify STREAMNAME under CACLOG task? Something likes:

STREAMNAME {CHANGED}=CDC123.DIAGLOG 

If so, you will need to print them from the log stream you have set up.
