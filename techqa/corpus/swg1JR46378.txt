APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a BPD instance is persisted at an activity which has
   multiple attached event handlers, and then a product
   migration from a WebSphere Lombardi Edition version
   happens, this BPD instance cannot continue navigation.
   Instead, a ConcurrentModificationException is thrown.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   If a BPD instance is persisted at an activity which has
   multiple attached event handlers, and then a product
   migration from a WebSphere Lombardi Edition version
   happens, this BPD instance cannot continue navigation.
   Instead, a ConcurrentModificationException is thrown.
   
   Problem Summary:
   To support advanced scenarios, a thread safe list
   implementation is used in BPM for storing attached event
   handlers. This thread safe list implementation was not
   necessary and therefore not in place in prior versions.
   Therefore, BPD instances persisted with prior versions
   are continued with the thread unsafe list implementation
   that will throw the ConcurrentModificationException
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After applying the interim fix, migrated BPD instances
   will continue to work without the observed
   ConcurrentModificationException.
