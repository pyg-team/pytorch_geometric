List of Enhancements

-- Enhancement 193773 --
You can now configure the security policy so that only users of a specific 
group or role are displayed in the User selection window on the People tab. 
Previously all the users were listed on User selection window by default.


Additional Notes related to Enhancement 193773

1. User Group is a part of the list that is displayed on the User visibility page 
when at least one Distributed Marketing Role is assigned to it at the group level.

2. Notify Field Marketers task of Corporate Campaign behaviour is not affected by 
this enhancement. The task adds all Field Marketers that have records in the 
generated list to the People tab.


List of Fixes

-- APAR PO05263, DEF 235556 --
When user preference is in user locale, some messages in Cognos are displayed in 
English Cognos is accessed through IBM EMM Distributed Marketing. This issue has 
been fixed.

-- PMR 162549, Defect 135340 --
A Flowchart version mismatch error is displayed in Distributed Marketing logs if 
users make minor changes to a flowchart that are not related to forms and do not 
republish the flowchart. The Flowchart version mismatch error also occurs when 
flowcharts and templates are migrated from one environment to other and are not 
republished. This issue has been resolved now.

-- APAR PO06391, Defect 227391 --
If a user creats a flowchart with a name that has 44 characters and publishes to 
a form, a new form is created with a unique name that aligns with the flowchart 
name. If the user creates a second flowchart with the same name as the first 
flowchart, modifies the name to a name that contains 46 characters and publishes 
the flowchart to a form, a form is created with the same name as the first 
flowchart. If the second flowchart is now modified and the form is republished, 
one of the two forms disappears. This issue has been resolved.

-- APAR PO05970, Defect 217396 --
A CSRF error occurs in the IBM Distributed Marketing application while creating or 
editing Distributed Marketing objects like On-demand campaign or List, when 
Domain Name in the configuration was set in different case then navigation urls. 
This issue has been resolved now.


Additional Notes related to PMR 162549, Defect 135340

While migrating flowchart across different database environments, imported 
flowchart might have to published again along with redo the field mapping in
Snapshot Process-box. This is applicable in scenarios where Flowcharts are 
migrated from SQL Server environment to Oracle or DB2 environments where 
Database schema owners are different


New Supported Platforms
NA


Known Issues

1. If a List, On-demand Campaign, or Corporate Campaign instance created from a
template having recurrence enabled does not contain any recurrent stage, the 
recurrence upgrade pop-up will be shown to mark recurrent stages when a user 
tries to modify recurrence settings of that instance. However, the user cannot
correctly mark recurrent stages as there are none available. The workaround to
this issue is to completely clear the instance workflow by deleting all stages
and underlying tasks, and then modify recurrence settings. This would re-create
instance workflow exactly same as template workflow.

2. Changing recurrence settings on a template workflow (marking different stage 
as recurrent or deleting tasks/stages) can result in inconsistent behavior 
while changing recurrence settings of an existing List, On-demand Campaign or 
Corporate Campaign instance.

3. While recreating occurrences of a recurrent stage, dependencies are not 
changed as per the new stage or task number if the recurrent stage is before 
a non-recurrent stage and tasks from a non-recurrent stage depend on 
tasks of recurrent stage.
