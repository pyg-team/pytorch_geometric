QUESTION
 How do you determine the current character set for the client and for the schema repository in IBM Rational ClearQuest? 

ANSWER
The current code page information for ClearQuest can be retrieved by using the command line tools. 

The installutil lscodepage command will return the current code page as set on the ClearQuest client workstation.

Run the following command from a Microsoft Windows command prompt:

installutil lscodepage -dbset <connection_name> <admin_user> <admin_password>


Where:


installutil Name of the utility. lscodepage Command to return the code page information. -dbset Identifier for the connection name as it appears in the Maintenance tool. connection_name The actual name of the connection. admin_user The super user login used to login to ClearQuest. admin_password Password for the super user of ClearQuest. 
This command will return two lines. The first line returns the code page for the schema repository, the second line returns the code page for the client workstation. For example: 

Code page of 2003.06.00: 20127 (US-ASCII) (default)
Code page of client: 1252 (ANSI - Latin I)

In this example, the workstation and the repository are set differently. The client workstation is set to support the Latin I code page. The ClearQuest schema repository is set to only allow for US-ASCII characters.  

Note: There are numerous factors to consider before setting the code page. For more information on codepages in ClearQuest, refer to these topics in the ClearQuest Information Center [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg27010159]:
