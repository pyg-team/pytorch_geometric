QUESTION
 How to create a task route to perform Business Process Management (BPM) on SMTP emails? 

CAUSE
IBM Content Collector (ICC) only provides BPM task route template for Lotus Domino or Exchange emails. No BPM template is available for SMTP emails. 

ANSWER
You can create a BPM task route for SMTP emails by using the SMTP connector tasks. 

In this technote, the task route is based on the following business requirements: 

 * Email and attachments are stored in the same content element of the P8 document. 
 * Email properties such as the email subject needs to be saved into a P8 property. 
 * SMTP emails are provided manually by users in a shared folder and not sent directly by email server.


 1. Ensure IBM Content Collector for SMTP is installed. If not, re-run the ICC installation package and add that option. 
 2. For business process management, email documents can be stored into any document class. It is not required to follow the ICC email data model. 
 3. As the SMTP emails are provided manually by users in a shared folder, IBM Content Collector SMTP Receiver service is not required to be running. 
 4. In the ICC configuration manager, Connectors > SMTP, configure the Message queue directory. In that directory, manually create the following folder structure:
    <message queue directory>\<short hostname>\0000
    
    For example, if the message queue directory configured is C:\SMTPFolder and the short hostname of the IBM Content Collector server is server0123, then create the following folder structure:
    C:\SMTPFolder\server0123\0000
    
    For any SMTP emails that need to be processed, place them in this directory. 
 5. Create a task route and include the following tasks (in order):  * SC Collect All Email 
     * SC Extract Metadata 
     * SC Prepare Email for Archiving 
     * P8 Create Document 
     * P8 File Document in Folder (optional) 
     * SC Delete Email 
     * Audit Log (optional)
    
    
 6. Since the business requirement is to save email and attachments in one content element, in the SC Prepare Email for Archiving task, uncheck the option Save document without attachments. 
 7. To save email properties such as the email subject into a P8 property, in the P8 Create Document task, assign the P8 property with values from the Email system metadata. For example, <Email, Subject>. 


Task route may be different based on the actual business requirements. Contact IBM Support to receive further assistance.
