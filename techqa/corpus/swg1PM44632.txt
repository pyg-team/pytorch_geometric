 *  zWSRRInstall script uses pwd to get the current directory name
   and if the use Symbolic links and after IPL change the symlink
   it will not find the old one.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After installing WSRR on the z/OS platform using the
   zWSRRInstall.sh script and specifying symbolic links for
   -wsrr-smpe-root and/or -was-home, the IPL might fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The zWSRRInstall.sh script used the PWD command to obtain the
   directory/folder name for -wsrr-smpe-root and -was-home
   parameters. This caused a problem when a symbolic link was
   specified for one of these parameters and the link changes
   when there's an IPL.
   
   The zWSRRInstall.sh script now has a new -absolutepaths
   parameter to handle this situation. The Infocenter has also been
   updated to document the new parameter.
   
   The parameter description is:
   
   This parameter specifies that the paths provided in the
   -wsrr-smpe-root and -was-home parameters are treated as absolute
   paths. You must use this parameter if either of the paths
   provided are symbolic links. If this parameter is not used and
   symbolic links are included, the utility will link through to
   the underlying fields and directories, and if the links change
   in the future you are required to rerun this utility.
   Note: Provide the absolute paths instead of relative paths when
   using this parameter.
   
   This change is targeted for inclusion in fix pack 5 for WSRR
   v7.0 and fix pack 2 for WSRR v7.5. The Infocenter updates will
   be available following the next Infocenter refresh.
