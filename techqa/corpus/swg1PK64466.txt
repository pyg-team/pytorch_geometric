ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Queue Sharing Group with a mixture of Queue Managers at
   V6 and V7 need to be able to tolerate the differences in
   each version in order to work together.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Enable Version 6 and Version 7 queue    *
   *                      managers to coexist in a queue sharing  *
   *                      group.                                  *

   ****************************************************************
   This APAR provides the coexistence PTF, documented in the
   "Migrating queue-sharing groups to Version 7.0" section of the
   Migration Information manual, which will allow both Version 6
   and Version 7 queue managers to coexist in the same
   queue sharing group.
   
   Once the PTF for this APAR has been applied and the actions in
   the hold information followed, a Version 6 queue manager will be
   able to participate in a queue sharing group which already
   contains Version 7 queue managers. In addition, once the PTF has
   been applied to all the queue managers in a queue sharing group
   that currently only contains version 6 queue queue managers, a
   version 7 queue manager will be able to participate in the queue
   sharing group.
   
   If the coexistence PTF has not been applied, as detailed above,
   then the queue manager that is attempting to participate in the
   queue sharing group will fail to start. Message CSQ5005E will be
   issued and the queue manager will terminate with reason
   00F50029. Also, the ADD QMGR function of CSQ5PQSG will fail with
   error message CSQU555E, and the MIGRATE QSG (or DSG) function
   will fail with error message CSQU584E (or CSQU581E).
   
   After applying the PTF it is necessary to start a queue manager
   in a queue sharing group to update its compatibility
   characteristics which are visible to peers.
   
   Application of the PTF to all queue managers in a queue sharing
   group is a prerequisite for migrating any of the queue managers
   in that queue sharing group to Version 7. The PTF must be
   applied to all queue managers in a queue sharing group prior to
   running the Version 7 supplied CSQ45ATB job which performs the
   queue-sharing group migration actions (for further information
   refer to the "Migrating queue-sharing groups to Version 7.0"
   section of the Migration Information manual).
   
   Prior to migrating from V6 to V7 you should also review the
   backward migration APAR, PK64463 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK64463].

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The coexistence functions provided in this APAR broadly cover:
    - only recognizing QSGDISP(GROUP) objects and their attributes
      which are relevant to a Version 6 queue manager
    - handling responses to DISPLAY commands which have been
      routed via CMDSCOPE to Version 7 queue managers
    - changing configuration information in the ADMIN_B_QMGR
      table so that other queue managers in the queue sharing
      group can recognize this enhanced capability.
