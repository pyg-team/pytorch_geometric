Problem: Hung workstation causing tasks to back up in CICS 

 
Action taken: Customer saw an OWMS transaction connected to an IWP 
workstation waiting on ZCIOWAIT and other transactions queued up 
behind it. This has happened only to one workstation. No others seem to 
be, to date. Fearing that the system might go to MAXTASKS, he 
purged the OWMS transaction. All other transactions quickly 
executed and completed, thus eliminating system threat. Customer wants to 
know why this got hung and how to implement the automatic safeguards to 
protect the mainframe from hung transactions; 

Action plan: 


I discussed with customer. ZCIOWAIT means that the host is waiting for 
IWP to respond. Further investigation as to why the workstation got 
hung needs to be done by IWP support. As for protecting the host, however, I 
advised the customer to set RTIMOUT - which was currently set to NO to 
indicate that no timeout processing was occurring - to some low value 
(e.g., 30 seconds), so that CICS automatically purges the transaction 
after the specified number of seconds, thereby safeguarding the system 
from further delays.
