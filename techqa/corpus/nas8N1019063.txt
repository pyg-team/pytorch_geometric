Title: IBM Microsoft Excel Data Transfer Add-Ins: Convert UNICODE to CHAR - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document contains instructions for setting up the Excel Add-in for Data Transfer so that the scan defaults to CHAR (rather than UNICODE) for character data. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Prior to V5R3 iSeries Access for Windows, when the Excel Data Transfer Add-In scanned an Excel spreadsheet, the SCAN field types defaulted to CHAR for character data. When using the V5R3 (and above) client(s), the scan field types default to UNICODE for all character data. 

How can the scan be set up so that the default for character data is CHAR rather then UNICODE when using the V5R3 (and above) version of the Add-In?

Note: Starting with IBM i Access V6R1, a switch was added to the Data Transfer to IBM i properties. When going through the Data Transfer to IBM i wizard, click Properties and select the Scan Data Options tab. The option is then given to choose the desired 'Default character data type:'. Choose the desired option from the drop down box..

When using Client Access Express V5R3 with service pack SI20055 or newer and iSeries Access V5R4 or newer, a executable called cwbtfdft.exe is included with the iSeries Access client. This executable contains a switch that can be used to set the default to CHAR or UNICODE. To read the help text and learn how to use the switch, open a PC DOS command prompt and type the following:

cwbtfdft /?

Following is a listing of the help text:

Format:

CWBTFDFT
[ /DFTCHAR:0-2 ]
[ /ALLUSERS ]

/DFTCHAR: - 0 = CHAR, 1 = UNICODE, 2 = Data Transfer default (reset)
/ALLUSERS - Settings apply to all users of the PC

Examples:
cwbtfdft /dftchar:0
would set the default for the current user to CHAR
cwbtfdft /dftchar:1 /allusers
would set the default for all users to UNICODE
cwbtfdft /dftchar:2 /allusers
would reset the default for all users

Note: If you specify /ALLUSERS and do not have administrative authority, only the current user setting is modified.

Run this command one time to set the default behavior. After running the executable, the default will stay at the new setting unless cwbtfdft is run again.

Note: This switch applies only to the Excel Add-In.

This option was documented in V5R3 APAR SE19885.
