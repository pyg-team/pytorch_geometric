APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I run these steps successfully:
   "Importing virtual system patterns" with the
   'BPM_PATTERN_V855_RHEL.tgz' that was downloaded.
   
   Now we have the patterns available.
   
   However:
   1.) Not all patterns could be opened without error, as it asks
   for a base RHEL image and a DB2 image that do not come in the
   pattern.
   2.) No images are created, thus I think there are no images in
   glance... no OVA to transform and import.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For support statement, see
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036093 .
   There is a section listing prerequisites. Since this is a
   pattern type, it requires a base RHEL image (for instance, IBM
   OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems V2.1.0.1 for VMware
   Multilingual CN3CHML) The eassembly for BPM includes IBM DB2
   with BLU Acceleration Pattern V1.2.0.1 Multiplatform
   Multilingual (CN30GML) BPM 8.5.5 vSys Pattern requires a base
   RHEL image. To use BPM 8.5.5 vSys Pattern on ICO, the steps are:
   1. It should be ICO 2.4.0.1
   2. Import the BPM 8.5.5 vSys Pattern.
   3. Import DB2 Pattern (CN30GML) if customer wants to use BPM
   patterns with embedded DB2. DB2 Pattern (CN30GML) is included
   in BPM 8.5.5 Pattern license. When customer searches CRT40ML
   for BPM 8.5.5 Pattern they can find DB2 Pattern available and
   downloadable.
   4. Unfortunately, there is no base image license included in BPM
   Pattern. So, customer should provide the base image. IBM OS
   Image for Red Hat Linux Systems V2.1.0.1 (CN3CHML) will work.
   Or customer can use their own base image that is documented in
   ICO infocenter.
   5. Clone the predefined BPM Pattern and make necessary changes,
   such as adding flavor settings that is specific to ICO.
   6. Deploy the pattern.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  It was needed to demonstrate the deployment of the BPM8.5.5
   CN3JPML and DB10.5 CN30GML patterns running in ICO 2.4.0.1
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The steps were explanined to deploy the patterns. It was also
   decided to document all these basic patterns in the knowledge
   centre
