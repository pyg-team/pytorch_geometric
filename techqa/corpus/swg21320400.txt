PROBLEM
As the system administrator of your IBM Lotus Domino server, you see multiple occurrences of Lotus Notes users being denied access to nsf files. In this case, it is unknown why those Notes users are accessing the targeted databases in the first place.

SYMPTOM
User shows errors attempting to open multiple databases at the same time. This causes the log file to grow very rapidly.

09/18/2008 10:22:50 AM ATTEMPT TO ACCESS DATABASE Address Books\jbealnames.nsf by Notes User/Dallas/AJAX was denied
09/18/2008 10:22:50 AM ATTEMPT TO ACCESS DATABASE Address Books\jbealnames.nsf by Notes User/Dallas/AJAX was denied

CAUSE
The administrator stores the users' personal address books on the server instead of on the local Lotus Notes client. When the personal address books were originally created, the administrator created one address book, and then created OS level copies for each Notes user, renaming each file to reflect the names of the individual database owner. Then the ACL's were modified to suit the owner of the mail file. Later when the user attempts to access the database from the client, the client attempted to locate the address book based upon replica ID number. This caused the client to attempt to access every Personal Address Book stored in the directory. Since the user was not listed in the ACL of every database, the "Deny Access" error was generated. To resolve this issue, each Personal Address Book was recreated using a unique replica ID number. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use Lotus Notes or Domino Administrator Client--not the operating system--to create the new copies of the personal address book. Using Lotus Notes or Domino Designer will allow for a unique replica ID to be generated for each new copy, ensuring that they are do not interfere with one another. 

 

 1. Open the original personal address book 
 2. Click File -> Application -> New Copy
