APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Qpid-JMS 0.11.1 client attempts to connect via an IBM AMQP
   channel using Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
   they are able to pass their credentials (through PAM on the OS)
   successfully.
   
   However, when the Qpid-JMS 0.20.0 api is used. the
   authentication fails and the user receives an "MQRC 2035
   MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED [condition = amqp:unauthorized-access]
   error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The MQ V9 AMQP channel
   
   who have MQ Light or Qpid-JMS client applications that:
   
   - Use SASL authentication when connecting to a queue manager
   using an instance of the AMQP channel.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The new version of the Qpid-JMS client (version 0.20.0) changed
   how SASL data was being flown. The new SASL flows were not
   understood by the IBM AMQP channel, because SASL data was
   expected to arrive with a certain order. Due to this, the
   Qpid-JMS clients were not able to be authorized with the queue
   manager and received the following error:
   
        MQRC 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED [condition =
   amqp:unauthorized-access]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM AMQP channel has been updated so that it is can handle
   the new SASL flow and successfully authorize the Qpid-JMS client
   with the queue manager.
