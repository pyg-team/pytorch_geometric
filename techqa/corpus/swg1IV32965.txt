ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Getting error:
   Failed Image Backup with error (id:19487) is missing a property
   value for the 'virtual_server.uuid' key.
   .
   Starting with the newer iFixes TPM changed the data
   model and expects the uuid in the variable
   virtual_server.uuid where the variable was
   named "uuid" with older TPM versions.
   .
   If you create a virtual server under TSAM 7.2.1.4
   or 7.2.2.0/1 and then upgrade to TSAM 7.2.2.2 or
   later, the VMware_CloudHostPlatform_ImageSave workflow
   might fail with the above error
