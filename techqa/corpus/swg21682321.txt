WASPatternsV1RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A pattern was created that is not based on the templates provided by IBM. The OS-NODE memory field is not set to the correct parameters. 

SYMPTOM
You receive an error similar to the following example: 


CWZKS0075E: The virtual image in the pattern does not meet the requirements for OS_Node, which has these requirements: disk size: 12288MB, processor: 1, and memory: 2528.0MB. The virtual image in the pattern provides these resources: disk size: 12,288MB, processors: 1, and memory: 2,048MB


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can resolve this problem before you deploy the pattern or after you receive the error. 

 * To resolve the problem before you deploy the pattern, ensure that the OS_Node memory is set to at least 4028. 
 * To resolve the problem while deploying the pattern:  1. On the Deployer page, choose the pattern that you want to deploy. 
    2. Click Quick deploy. The deployment fails and the error CWZKS0075E is displayed. 
    3. Click OS-NODE memory and increase the memory value to at least the number listed in the error message. 
    4. Click Quick deploy. You can view the virtual instance deployment progress and status.
