ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Infosphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server
   provides the feature to search for items in a catalog.
   Following are the steps to use this feature:
   1. In the left pane navigation, select the Search tab.
   2. Click on "New Search" and then "Item Search" buttons.
   3. Provide the catalog name in the "Search in Catalog" drop
   down.
   4. Specify your search criteria and click "Search" on the top
   left to execute it.
   We can use the "Search within categories" section with a text
   filtering section to limit the search to certain categories.
   But this text filtering section does not work if one of the
   categories has a primary key of "Unassigned". In such a
   situation, the filtering section will become unresponsive and
   we will not be able to use it.
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a spec whose primary key is of type String and then
   assign it to a hierarchy.
   2. Use the hierarchy created in step1 to create a catalog.
   3. Create a category in the catalog with the primary key of
   "Unassigned".
   Create other categories as well to test the search result.
   4. From the top of the left pane navigation, select the Search
   tab.
   5. Click on "New Search" and then "Item Search" buttons.
   6. Provide the catalog name in the "Search in Catalog" drop
   down created in step2.
   7. Try to select any category from the text filtering section
   next to "Find" in "Search within Categories" section.
   The text filtering section will become unresponsive.
   Keywords: "new user interface", "new UI", result set, corruption
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the name of the category from "Unassigned" to something
   different, say "unassigned".

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem was report in 10.0.0. The fix is available only in
   11.0.0 (and later releases).
   While users are not recommended to define categories with the
   name "Unassigned" as there is a folder "Unassigned" out-of-box,
   the function in MDM Collaborative Edition v11.0.0 returns the
   correct filtered list of categories matching the pattern input
   by the user. The pattern matching is done in case-insensitive
   manner. The one exception to this case-insensitive pattern
   matching is the out-of-box "Unassigned" folder in which case
   case-sensitive pattern matching is performed.
