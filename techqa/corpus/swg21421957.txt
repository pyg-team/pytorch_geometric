PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, Error executing "/opt/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS/bin/ihs_startup" operation (status=1), that can occur when performing a silent installation of IBM Rational ClearCase 7.1.x. 

SYMPTOM
 

Silent installation of ClearCase 7.1.x with Change Management (CM) Server halts and reports error:

135 INFO 27:35.89 Error occurred in phase: install 

SU: ratl.IHS.sun5 7.1.1000.0000-7-1-1-D091028 

IU: ratl.IHS.service.control.sun5 null->999.999.999.-503920873 

Message: Error executing "/opt/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS/bin/ihs_startup" operation (status=1). 

See agent output log for more information: /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs/native/20100106_1352.log 

136 INFO 27:35.89 Elapsed time 25:13.89 for: Performing "install" phase 

137 ERROR CRIMAF37550BFE 27:37.00 Error executing "/opt/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS/bin/ihs_startup" operation (status=1). 

See agent output log for more information: /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs/native/20100106_1352.log 


The installer then rolls back the install and ClearCase fails to install.

CAUSE
This can be caused by not having a valid user and group to start the IBM HTTP Server (IHS) server process. 


Check the logs 
./IHS_logs/logs/ihs_start.log 



httpd: bad user name www 


This is due to an invalid user name and group in the response file:
<data key='user.Common_IHSUserName' value='www' />
<data key='user.Common_IHSGroupName' value='other' />


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit the response file to use a valid user and group name, and run the silent install again.
