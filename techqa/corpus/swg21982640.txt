Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While configuring TSA (Tivoli System Automation) with 'db2haicu' command, 
'2632-322' error happens on the network quorum/tiebreaker configuration step.

hostname2: 2632-122 /usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net validate Address
"192.168.1.1" Log "1" Count "9": The following error was returned from
the TieBreaker subsystem:
/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.


SYMPTOM
hostname2 > db2haicu
....<snippet>.. 
Create the domain now? [1] 

1. Yes
2. No
1
Creating domain ha_new in the cluster ...
Creating domain ha_new in the cluster was successful.

( TSA domain itself is created successfully. )

Configure a quorum device for the domain called ha_new? [1]
1. Yes
2. No

(Input IP address and then error happens.)
...<snippet>....


hostname2: 2632-122 /usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net validate Address
"192.168.1.1" Log "1" Count "9": The following error was returned from
the TieBreaker subsystem:
/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.



CAUSE
"/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net" file is responsible for network quorum/tiebreaker configuration.
And this function belongs to TSA.

It happens when TSA is not correctly installed.
For example, the current TSA bundle version in DB2 V10.1 and V10.5 release is 3.X.
This TSA version is not supported in AIX 7.2 version.



ENVIRONMENT
AIX 7.2



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Check if the file actually exists on the system.
ls -l /usr/sbin/rsct/bin/samtb_net

2. Run the following TSA command and check if it does not report an error.

samversion
samlicm -s
lssrc -ls IBM.GblResRM
lssrc -ls IBM.RecoveryRM
lssrc -ls IBM.TestRM



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the operating system version which is supported by the TSA version you intend to install.
Or install supported TSA version manually that is compatible with the DB2 and operating system version.

Supported TSA version for each DB2 release/fixpack can be found from 'IBM compatibility check' web page.
( See 'Supported software' tab of 'Detailed System Requirement' page related each DB2 fixpack version. )
