APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you follow below steps,
   1. Create Background Service and onEvent UCA 'UCA1'
   2. Create BPD 'BPD1'which starts from Start Message Event
   3. Link created UCA to the Start Message Event
   4. Create Service for invoking the UCA: Start-UCA1-End
   6. Invoke the UCA
   Then the instance of the BPD appeared in Process Inspector for
   Process Center.
   
   7. Create Snapshot and install it on Runtime Server
   8. Invoke the UCA on Runtime Server
   9. Observe Process Inspector
   Then no instances of the 'BPD1' are started on Runtime Server.
   
   But the expected result is that the instance of the 'BPD' should
   be started on Runtime Server after UCA is invoked.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create one more Snapshot and install it on Runtime. Make just
   installed Snapshot default manually in Process Admin Console.
   Invoke UCA. As the result instance is started in the second
   Snapshot.
