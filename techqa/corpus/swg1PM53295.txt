APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 20 and create a custom table
   with a layer variable. In the viewer you double click on the
   table and on Format - Table properties dialog you would like to
   change the font size for the layer text to a higher pt size than
   the default on the Cell Properties tab.
   However, you notice this is not possible for fast rendered
   tables. The font size is not changed for the layer text.
   
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS Development. As a workaround
   on Edit - Options dialog, pivot tables tab select the option
   "Render as legacy tables" and create the table again (SET
   TABLERENDER = FULL). Then you will be able to change the font
   size for layer text.
