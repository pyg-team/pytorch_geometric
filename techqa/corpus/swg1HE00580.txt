ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario:
   1) Launch Smarteam Editor V5R20SP3 with PLMDB database.
   2) Create two Projects , project1 and project2.
   3) Select Project 1 and go to documents tab.
   4) Delete all the folders present there.
   5) Select Project 2 and go to documents tab.
   6) Except one folder delete all.
   7) Select the view as Horizontal type.
   8) Add the folder form Project 2 to Project 1 through drag.
   9) Right click and select tree properties.
   10) Select visual settings and go to General links.
   11) Check to the documents.
   12) Go to Visual settings tab and select expand level 1.
   Result ==> When viewing the General links in the project
   tree, when I expand the project2, I can see the folder, but I
   cannot expand the folder. In this scenario the expand level
   is 1.
   But if I expand the project1 then I can expand the folder and
   it shows the project links, and also I can see the project in
   the first project now.
   Expected Result ==> In Project 2, the folder should get
   expanded when the Project 2 is expanded.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN I-PLM Collaborative
   Innovation
   Additional Closure Information:
   For the general links we don't calculate general links that
   are not the the same super class.
   In this case, we don't calculate the general links of the
   folder.
   We show only general links that are kept in the memory from
   the same screen that were already
   calculated (project 1 is shown when showing for project 2).
   By-Pass : Set the expand level as 2 instead of 1.
