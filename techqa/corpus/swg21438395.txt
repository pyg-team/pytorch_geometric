Title: IBM Existence of application support files for "TH" agent (ITCAM for Tx MQ Tracking agent) - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 Are application support files for the TH agent (ITCAM for Transactions MQ Tracking agent) available, for seeding on ITM TEMS server ?


CAUSE
This agent code is available for the TEMA (Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent) component to install this agent, but there is no product support option for this agent to seed the TEMS (or TEPS).
While trying the TH agent support using 'itmcmd support' command 
(e.g.: ./itmcmd support -t connm37-tems th) following error occurs:
KCIIN252W Application support files are not installed for product th. Unable to continue.


ANSWER
In fact, there is no TEMS (or TEPS) support for the TH agent on any architecture available (neither z/OS, nor distributed). The TH agent is essentially a stand alone agent that does not have any of its own workspaces, although it does of course contribute to the TU/TO Transaction Collector and Transaction Reporter workspaces, and can be managed via MTEMS (Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services). 


For reference, here is the documentation for the installation and configuration of the TH agent:
