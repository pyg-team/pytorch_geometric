   *                      2. Add PROCSTEP to RCDS REPORT output   *
   *                                                              *

   ****************************************************************
   The APAR changes the format of CICS VR 5.1 RCDS backout record
   to tolerate a CICS VR 4.2 or 4.3 RCDS and adds the PROCSTEP
   column to the RCDS REPORT UNDO output.
   
   The APAR also changes the RCDS migration utility for RCDS
   migration from version 5.1 to version 5.1 with APAR PM89649.
   
   The APAR also fixes some english popup messages and panels.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following publication changes to publication SC34-2813-00,
   CICS VSAM Recovery Implementation Guide and Reference Version 5
   Release 1, correspond with APAR PM89649.
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The text of section "Migration from earlier CICS VR release"
   till JCL Sample EXEC sentence must be replaced with following
   text:
   
   CICS  VR stores all recovery information in the CICS VR
   recovery control data sets (RCDSs). The RCDS format in CICS VR
   V5R1 with APAR PM89649 applied is the same as the RCDS format
   in CICS VR V4R2 or V4R3, so migration of these data sets is not
   required. However, if you have CICS VR V5R1 without APAR
   PM89649 applied and have already migrated the RCDSs, additional
   migration is required.
   
   If you are migrating from CICS VR V4R2 or V4R3 to CICS VR V5R1
   with APAR PM89649 applied, you do not need to migrate
   the contents of your existing CICS VR RCDSs. If you have
   already migrated from CICS VR V4R2 or V4R3 to CICS VR V5R1
   without APAR PM89649 and have already run the DWWMIW utility
   to migrate the contents of your existing CICS VR RCDSs, use
   the following procedure:
   
     1. Apply APAR PM89649.
     2. Create the target CICS VR V5R1 RCDSs.
     3. Run the CICS VR DWWMIW migration utility again.
   
   CICSVR V5R1 implements the MIGRATE RCDS command to migrate
   CICSVR Server AS defaults from previous releases. See
   MIGRATE RCDS: Specify migration option for a detailed
   description of the MIGRATE command.
   
   The following sample JCL to run the CICS VR migration utility
   contains an example of running the DWWMIW program to migrate
   RCDSs:
   Figure 1. Sample JCL to run the CICS VR V5R1 migration utility
   //MIGRATE JOB (ACCOUNT),MSGLEVEL=(1,1),MSGCLASS=H,REGION=4M
   
   The description of sentences 7-9 and 10 in JCL Sample should be
   replaced with following text:
   
    7 - 9  Specifies the RCDSs to be migrated.
   
    10  DWWIN defines the data set that contains the CICS VR
   commands. You can either specify a sequential data set with
   80-byte, fixed-length records, or include the CICS VR MIRGATE
   RCDS command in-stream as shown. You can also specify dummy or
   empty input data set for using default value for option
   DEFAULT(NO).
