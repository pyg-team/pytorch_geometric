APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) documentation does not
   specify that when you use the Process Admin Console to undeploy,
    it first stops and then undeploys the BLA. A BLA is an IBM
   WebSphere Application Server configuration artifact that is
   created only for a snapshot that has advanced content generated
   in IBM Integration Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In a network deployment environment, make sure that all the node
    agents are active before you stop a BLA. If a node is inactive,
    the BLA enters the UNKNOWN state instead of the STOPPED state
   and fails to stop, although the stop command runs asynchronously
    and completes without an error. The failure to stop along with
   the UNKNOWN state prevents you from undeploying the BLA.
   
   For more information, see "BPMStop command"
   (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ib
   m.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rref_stopprocessapplication.html).
   
   A more general workaround is keep advanced content in
   stand-alone Integration Designer projects. When IBM BPM projects
   do not contain advanced content (artifacts that were authored in
   Integration Designer), advanced deployment does not occur and
   commands such as BPMStop are not needed. You can avoid advanced
   content by implementing Advanced Integration services in
   stand-alone Integration Designer modules. Calls from Integration
   Designer projects to processes and BPDs can be made from
   stand-alone modules. For more information, refer to
   "Implementing an Advanced Integration service"
   (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ib
   m.wbpm.auth.stp.doc/processcenter/topics/timplementwpsservice.ht
   ml) and "Creating an import to start a BPD in a stand-alone
   module"
   (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ib
   m.wbpm.auth.stp.doc/processcenter/topics/tcrtimport_standalone.h
   tml). "Develop Advanced Integration services for IBM Business
   Process Manager V8.5.6"
   (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/bpm/library/techarticles/160
   2_pacholski-trs/1602_pacholski.html) introduces the stand-alone
   module pattern.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The BPMStop command or Stop operation in the Process Admin
   Console silently fails when at least one node agent is stopped
   but will report that the command succeeded. Because the BLA must
    be stopped in all appServers in a multi-cluster environment,
   you can't undeploy the snapshot.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Topics in the IBM BPM V8.6 documentation that are related to
   stopping and undeploying advanced applications will be updated
   in future release of IBM BPM.
