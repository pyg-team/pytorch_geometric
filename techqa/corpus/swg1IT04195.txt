APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a shared monitoring service is installed in the cloud
   group for a virtual machine and the virtual machine is part of
   a virtual system or virtual application where the monitoring
   agents are installed, there is a Monitor link on the virtual
   machine page that displays that virtual machine in the
   Monitoring Portal.
   
   When that link is clicked a warning popup with the following
   message may be displayed:
   KFWITM088W Additional
   Topology Information not available at this time. The network
   configuration might be changing at this time. Please try again
   later.
   
   The workload monitoring agent is installed and started on one
   virtual machine in a virtual system or virtual application.   It
   may transition to another VM during the life of the virtual
   system, and that movement is tracked by PureApplication System.
   If the transition is improperly tracked the KFWITM088W message
   is displayed indicating the workload agent is not currently
   available.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart of the transition event handling process will cause
   reprocessing of all deployments as if it were the first time
   the process were ever started.    Any transition event handling
   errors will be discovered and corrected during this
   initialization step.
   
   To restart the event handler process, restart the Monitoring
   Portal Server (TEPS) using the steps below. The monitoring
   portal will be unavailable while the TEPS is restarting.
   
   * Workload Console > Instances > Shared Services
   * Select the Shared Monitoring Service
   * Select the Manage link upper right
   * Select the Operations tab
   * Click on ITM-Hub-TEMS.Hub-TEMS on left
   * on right expand Restart Portal Server
   * Select Submit
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The root cause of this issue was a problem occurring during the
   monitoring virtual machine location transition. The error
   indicated that the agent was no longer running where expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided so that the change in location of
   the monitoring virtual machine will be picked up when the
   monitoring portal is launched.
