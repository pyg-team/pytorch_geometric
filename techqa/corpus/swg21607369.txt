PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I try to automatically push and install my IBM SPSS Statistics 22 with site license using licenseactivator in a Microsoft SCCM environment but it fails to connect to the license server: cannot connect to the Internet. 
However, running the licenseactivator manually works fine. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Currently push installation and licensing in a SCCM environment is not supported. 

It has been submitted as Enhancement Request to IBM SPSS Development for consideration in a future IBM SPSS Statistics release (Reference ID: ECM00181572). 

You can still push out the license using the MSI along with the creation of your own batch file using the licenseactivator command.

You'll find more information about pushing and licensing an installation on the Site License Administrators Guide.pdf on the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038407] web page. RELATED INFORMATION
