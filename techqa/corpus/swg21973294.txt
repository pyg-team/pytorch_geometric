QUESTION
 In What Version(s) of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator is SHA-256 Supported? 

ANSWER
Beginning with IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SI) 5.2.4.2 support for FIPS 140-2 Level 1 is certified with using the Certicom Government Service Edition (GSE) cryptographic module that is distributed within SB2Bi.
While previous product releases allowed you to check-in or even generate a SHA256 RSA certificate, the underlying support to utilize that hash level was not present. To be fully compliant at a SHA256 level you must be running version 5.2.4.2 or higher.

SHA256 is the same as SHA2 or SHA-2
