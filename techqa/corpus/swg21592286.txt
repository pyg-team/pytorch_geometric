QUESTION
 Which Web browsers are supported by Guardium 8.x? 

ANSWER
Guardium 8.x supports the following Web browsers: 

- Mozilla Firefox 10.0 or later 

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 or later 


IBM InfoSphere Guardium Support will make every reasonable effort to fully support newer versions and updates to the above Web browsers, even if not clearly listed nor tested. In some cases, this support might include some limitations.

Newer versions and updates to supported Web browsers do not always work as expected with content served by InfoSphere Guardium. IBM product development, test and support teams must wait for the official release of the Web browser to be able to test them and provide full support so there is often a gap between the time a Web browser is released and when it's fully tested with current releases of InfoSphere Guardium.


Some of the above browser versions might be no longer supported by Mozilla or Microsoft. In this case, we may have to ask for upgrade the browsers to the supported versions by themselves.
