Title: IBM IZ59744: UPGRADE DOCUMENT NEEDS AMMENDMENT ON PAGE 33 OF ILMT72_UPGRADE_GUIDE. PDF - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrade to LMT 7.2 customer tried to verify the upgrade.
   According to upgrade document:
   
   "Verify that the program was upgraded successfully by logging
   into the
   Integrated Solutions Console (http://administration server
   IPaddress:portNumber/ibm/console/login.do) and checking if
   Tivoli Asset
   Discovery for Distributed 7.2 appears in the navigation bar."
   
   However there is no Tivoli Asset Discovery for Distributed. I
   think doc should read as follows:
   
   
   "Verify that the program was upgraded successfully by logging
   into the
   Integrated Solutions Console (http://administration server
   IPaddress:portNumber/ibm/console/login.do) and checking if
   License Metric Tool 7.2 appears in the navigation bar."
