APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

 *  The encoding of the cache key resulted in the inclusion of a
   '%2F' character that negatively affected the handling of said
   key by WebSphere Extreme Scale (WXS). This caused cached
   documents to unexpectedly be
   retrieved from the backend upon subsequent requests in certain
   situations.
