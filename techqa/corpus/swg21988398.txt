Title: IBM Auto update of Attorney and Paralegal when adding them as alert recipients - United States

Text:
alert ; recipient; atlas TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When we add Attorney and Paralegal as alert recipients in Atlas for a matter , why does the corresponding roles are not getting updated automatically on a matter? 

CAUSE
Atlas expects to have a attorney and paralegal for a matter before you add any other to matter alert recipients.

ANSWER
When an attorney or a paralegal is set for a Matter they are added as alert recipients automatically. It is not the case when you add them as alert recipients for a Matter. The reason is that you can add more than one alert recipient for attorney or paralegal. This is working as expected.
