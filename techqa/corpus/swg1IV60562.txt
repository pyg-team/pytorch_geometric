APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  According to QRadar Documentation it is possible to have
   multiple UDPMultiline Syslog log sources use the same listener
   port:
   
   From DSM guide for Cisco ISE:
   "However, all Cisco ISE appliances can forward their
   events to the same listen port on QRadar that you configure."
   
   However when a second log source of any type (openldap for
   example) is added the following error is received:
   "There is already a listener using that port"
   is received if the PROTOCOL-UDPMultilineSyslog-7.2-775067 is
   installed.
   
   This does not happen on hosts with the following protocol
   installed:
   PROTOCOL-UDPMultilineSyslog-7.2-570475.noarch
   
   No errors are logged when tailing qradar.error.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A protocol source RPM was released that updated the UDP
   Multiline Protocol to allow multiple configurations to use the
   same port.
   PROTOCOL-UDPMultilineSyslog-7.1-839479.noarch.rpm
