Title: IBM Error seen when setting up event notification to default JMS queue - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An error may be seen after configuring MDM for event notification against the default JMS queue and then sending a test message, indicating that the message was unable to cast to the queue. 

SYMPTOM
Error is similar to below: 

[2/20/15 13:33:43:118 CST] 00002010 JMSClassifica W XJMS0021E: Unable to map destination and bus to workclass. Aborting the xd classification filter for the current request. Request context information is com.ibm. ws.xd.jms.proxy.impl.AsynchJMSServiceContextImpl@d1bede5<bus=MDM.SIB.MDM,destination=xxxxxx>.
[2/20/15 13:33:43:229 CST] 00002011 EventDetector W com.ibm.ws.sib. api.jms.impl.JmsTextMessageImpl cannot be cast to javax.jms.ObjectMessage


CAUSE
Incorrectly configured event notification setup.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please make sure that you correctly and accurately configure event notification in MDM Workbench per the documentation. eg for v11.0 (documentation link here: http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.event_notification.doc/Topics/c_defaultjmsqueue.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.event_notification.doc/Topics/c_defaultjmsqueue.html] ) the setup, at time of writing this technote, should be as follows:

Queue name (Destination Name) is MDS.Queue 

NB: The destination name MUST be specifically as above. You cannot choose your own queue name if you wish to use the default.
JNDI name is jms/QMDS
JNDI name for the queue Connection Factory is jms/EMQCF

If you want to use the default JMS queue and default JMS event handler, you must specify this queue when you create your event notification as:

Handler name: jms
Handler arguments: cfJNDI=jms/EMQCF^qJNDI=jms/QMDS

Once configured in MDM Workbench, deploy your configuration and then restart the WAS server containing the MDM engine. Your messages should now work.
