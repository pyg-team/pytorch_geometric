Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Mozilla Firefox vulnerability issues in IBM SONAS - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are security vulnerabilities in versions of Mozilla Firefox that are shipped with versions 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7 of IBM SONAS 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
IBM SONAS is shipped with Mozilla Firefox. There are vulnerabilities in certain versions of Mozilla Firefox shipped in certain versions of IBM SONAS. These vulnerabilities concern the potential ability of a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVEID: CVE-2017-7809 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7809]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after free when an editor DOM node is deleted prematurely during tree traversal while still bound to the document. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVEID: CVE-2017-7807 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7807]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to hijack the domain. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to invoke AppCache and hijack a URL in a domain.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVEID: CVE-2017-7802 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7802]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after free when manipulating the DOM during the resize event of an image element. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVEID: CVE-2017-7801 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7801]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after free when recomputing layout for a marquee element during window resizing. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SONAS 

The product is affected when running code releases 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7

REMEDIATION/FIXES
A fix for these issues is in version 1.5.2.8 of IBM SONAS. Customers running an affected version of IBM SONAS should upgrade to 1.5.2.8 or a later version, so that the fix gets applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Workaround(s) :
Normal operation of IBM SONAS does not require or call for customers to use Firefox to access the Internet. Although IBM recommends that you install a level of IBM SONAS code with a fix, you can avoid these vulnerabilities by not using Mozilla Firefox within your IBM SONAS system to access the Internet.

Mitigation: None
