Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been found that affects certain level of TSSC code. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 lib/x509/verify.c in GnuTLS before 3.1.22 and 3.2.x before 3.2.12 does not properly handle unspecified errors when verifying X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted certificate. 

Vendor Vendor ID Vendor Title Included CVEs RedHat [https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0246.html] [https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0246.html]RHSA-2014:0246 [https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0246.html] 
Important: gnutls security update CVE-2014-0092 
The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. This vulnerability may allow for modification of files on the TSSC host from an unauthenticated user when accessing the TSSC remotely through the service web page. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91486 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91486] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
TSSC 7.0-7.2

REMEDIATION/FIXES
TSSC 7.3.15 contains GnuTLS 2.8.5-13, which has been patched to fix this vulnerability. Upgrade to 7.3.15 is recommended.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
No known workarounds. TSSC should be updated to 7.3.15 to address this issue. No fixes are planned for 7.0-7.2.
