QUESTION
 ServiceIP (virtual IP) within a HADR environment is not coming online 

CAUSE
In the case of an automation policy for a DB2 HADR environment, there is often an IBM.ServiceIP resource grouped with the HADR database resource.
To allow TSAMP to bring the ServiceIP online, the HADR resource group must be unlocked. Often the HADR is locked because the HADR pair are not in a peer connected state. The DB2 engine has the capability to lock the HADR group when the HADR pair are not in a peer connected state ... and unlock the group once back in a peer state.


ANSWER
If you do have a locked HADR resource group, then your next step should be to unlock it. You can do that by running the following as the root 

user (from either node):
rgreq -o unlock <name_of_your_HADR_group>
