[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21452449&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21452449&aid=1]

The resolution is to make sure the user that's installing is part of the DB2 groups DB2ADMINS and DB2USERS (on Windows). If you're using Unix/Linux make sure the user that's installing the ITCAM software has permissions to start and access the DB2 database. If the user doesn't have the right permissions/access to start and use the DB2 database, you will get the above error.
