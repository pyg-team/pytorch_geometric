APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enabled an OOTB workflow Generic Sequential Approval
   Demo, when all the subscriptions are modified to disable
   the manual launch of the workflow, the generic sequential
   approval workflow gets triggered  for the manual launch. We
   cannot disable the OOTB workflow that appears to have been
   enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  one possible temporary workaround solution is for the customer
   to write a response filter for the "/p8/getTransferedWorkflows"
   service and remove the "ICNParallelDocumentApproval" and
   "ICNSequentialDocumentApproval" items from the response JSON.
