APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPD Instances are not shown in Process Inspector when the
   following method it used to start the BPD.
   
   The BPD is started via the POST (start) method of the
   /rest/bpm/wle/v1/process REST API and the optional snapshotId
   parameter is not set. If only the processAppId is set then the
   BPD is started for the default snapshot.
   
   The BPD instance is created with the TIP column of the
   LSW_BPD_INSTANCE table set to 'T' instead of 'F'. This causes
   the BPD to not be visible in the Process Inspector of the
   Process Designer. It could also lead to other issues since the
   BPD instance is incorrectly associated with the TIP.
   
   Here is an example of the REST API used to start the process:
   http://myServer:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process/action=start
   &parts=header|data [http://myServer:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process/action=start&parts=header|data]
   &bpdId=25.1fbaa86d-ea86-4517-bdb3-457ab075a4c2
   &processAppId=2066.796ee9c4-80ed-4181-93cd-ea3707091c14
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use snapshotID instead of processAppID when starting the BPD via
   the REST API

   Problem Description:
   A REST API may be used to start a process using either the
   processAppId, snapshotId, or both. &#130; &#160; If the snapshotId is not
   specified, and the process is being started in a Process
   Server runtime instance (as opposed to Process Center), then
   the resulting process will not be displayed from Process
   Inspector. &#130; &#160; Here is an example of the REST API used to start
   the process:
   http://myServer:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process/action=start&parts=
   header|data&bpdId=25.1fbaa86d-ea86-4517-bdb3- [http://myServer:9080/rest/bpm/wle/v1/process/action=start&parts=header|data&bpdId=25.1fbaa86d-ea86-4517-bdb3-]
   457ab075a4c2&proces
   sAppId=2066.796ee9c4-80ed-4181-93cd-ea3707091c14&params={ &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#166;
   The problem occurs due to an error in the BPM runtime which
   caused the process to appear to be running in Process Center,
   instead of the Process Server runtime instance. &#130; &#160; As a result,
   the Inspector did not display the process when filtering on
   the server name and snapshotId number. &#130; &#160; The problem can be
   seen by examining the database table &#130; &#160; LSW_BPD_INSTANCE for th
   snapshotId. &#130; &#160; The processes that do not display in Inspector
   will have the value 'T' in the TIP column.
   Possible workaround: the problem can be avoided by specifying
   snapshotId instead of processAppId when starting the process
   with REST.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem was fixed in APAR JR43362, available in fix central.
   It is also fixed in future fix packs and releases.
   Install/Dependency information is available in the
   readme.txt on FixCentral. When the user goes to the download
   files page in FixCentral the readme will be available with the
   fix package as a seperate download.
