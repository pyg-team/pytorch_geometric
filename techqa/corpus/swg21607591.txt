Title: IBM Omnibus upgrade fails (replace DE from backup) - United States

Text:
java.io.FileNotFoundException; Permission denied; Object Server TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 A Fix Pack implementation on an existing Omnibus v7.3.x installation fails with the following message in the log file:

"Incorrect install location. The path you entered did not have any Netcool/Omnibus
components installed. Please check and try again" 

CAUSE
The Omnibus distribution was installed by a different user from the one who is attempting the upgrade.

ANSWER
At times, it is still possible to install the Fix Pack as the original user after the above failure, however this will not work if the Deployment Engine (DE) has become corrupted. 

If that occurs, the only way to resolve this is to replace DE from the backup ObjectServer host as follows: 

 

1. Take a backup of DE from the backup server. 
"<DE_INSTALL_LOCATION>\bin\de_backupdb -bfile backupFile" 

2. Copy the DE "backupFile" from the backup server to the primary server. 

2. Make a backup of the "/usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos" - i.e, copy repos folder to another location on the primary server. 

3. Restore DE backup on the primary server 
"/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_restoredb -bfile backupFile" 

Re-try the installation.
