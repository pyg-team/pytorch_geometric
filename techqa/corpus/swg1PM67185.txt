APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem can be reproduced as follows:
   - Find a member on a PDS that has no ISPF statistics
   
   - Copy/paste the member to a folder on the local machine using
   RSE's Local Files --?  Drives
   
   - Note that at this point the copied member does not have any
   change date in RDz properties nor any Date Modified in Windows
   Explorer
   - Edit the local file via LPEX  (or any RDz editor) and save and
   exit the editor.
   
   - Open the file again in LPEX (or any RDz editor) and you see
   the changes you made in the previous step
   
   - Open the file from Windows Explorer using Notepad/WordPad and
   the changes you made in RDz will not be seen
   - Edit and save the file via NotePad/WordPad in Windows Explorer
   and the file now shown there now has a last modified date  and
   now it all works from RDz as expected
   
   It appears that RDz uses another cached version of the file than
   what is accessible from Windows Explorer.
   
   This problem does not occur for files that have ISPF statistics
   when they are copy-pasted from the host to the local machine.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a data set was copied to the local connections without ISPF
   statistics, the timestamp of copied file was 0 but 0 timestamp
   was handled as an invalid cache state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The RDz client was fixed to set the copied time to the copied
   file if the data set has no ISPF statistics.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
