 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION

Does ITM work with Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9) and Firefox ESR 10?
What browsers does TEP support?
Does OMEGAMON 510 support zOS 1.13?


CAUSE
ITM Users and administrators often want to know what operating systems are supported by IBM Tivoli Monitoring software and ask questions similar to the above set. They also ask questions about specific AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, i5/OS, and z/OS versions.

ANSWER
To start, check the documentation. For ITM 6.3, look at the Hardware and software requirements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itm.doc_6.3%2Finstall%2Fplan_prereqs.htm] section of the Installation Guide. 

There is also a nice table of what is supported and what is no longer supported in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.3 Supported Operating Systems technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623341].

For versions prior to ITM 6.3 and for any Tivoli product, you can use the Software Products Compatibility Reports [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp] tool. For examples on how to use the reports tool, see the blog post: Determining compatibility between Tivoli products/solutions, operating systems, etc...
