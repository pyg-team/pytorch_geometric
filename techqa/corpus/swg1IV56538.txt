APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control version  9.0 Web Session
   Timeout
   Official documentation does not outline guidelines to change
   the session timeout setting on the TRC web portal for TRC
   version 9
   .
   In this version the file web.xlm to be changed is located in
   a different path:
   C:&#65415;Program Files
   (x86)&#65415;IBM&#65415;Tivoli&#65415;TRC&#65415;server&#65415;wlp&#65415;usr&#65415;servers&#65415;trcserver&#65415;apps&#65415;TRCAP
   P.ear&#65415;trc.war&#65415;WEB-INF&#65415;web.xml
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  dcf created
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Configuring the session timeout value was not previously
   documented. It has now been added to the IBM Endpoint Manager
   for Remote Control Administrators Guide.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes have been made to the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote
   Control version 9.1 documentation.
   
   In the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Administrators
   Guide a new section is added in the Troubleshooting and Help
   chapter that provides details of how to extend the session
   timeout interval.
