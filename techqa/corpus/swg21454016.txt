PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An ETL failure with an exception in the JDBC log might occur when running the IBM Rational Insight ETL process to extract large amount of data from IBM Rational Quality Manager running on IBM WebSphere Application Server that has the default LTPA timeout setting. 

SYMPTOM
The ETL process fails after running for a long time; for example, after running for more than two hours. A message similar to the following snippet is logged in the SystemOut.log file of WebSphere Application Server running Rational Quality Manager: 


SECJ0371W: Validation of the LTPA token failed because the token expired with the following info: Token expiration Date: Tue Apr 13 13:22:45 CST 2010, current Date: Tue Apr 13 13:22:46 CST 2010.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the LTPA timeout to be 240 or higher. 

 

If the Rational Quality Manager server is running on WebSphere Application Server 6: 

 *  Open the WebSphere Application Server console at http://hostname:9060/admin. Navigate to Secure administration, applications, and infrastructure -> Authentication mechanisms and expiration -> Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers. Set the LTPA timeout to a value of 240 or higher. 


If the Rational Quality Manager server is running on WebSphere Application Server 7:  *  Open the WebSphere Application Server console at http://hostname:9082/ibm/console/ Navigate to Global security > Administrative authentication > LTPA. Set the value in the LTPA Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers field to 240 or higher. 


Restart WebSphere Application Server after you make the above changes.
