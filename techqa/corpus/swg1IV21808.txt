APAR STATUS

   when the Data Collector for WebSphere Message Broker
   (KK3UserExit) is active and the PROPAGATE DELETE NONE statement
   is used in a Compute node.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Customers using ITCAM for Transactions 7.3
   * Message Broker data collector in an environment with complex
   * message flows involving a combination of HTTPRequest nodes,
   * MQOutput nodes, and a Compute node with the PROPAGATE DELETE
   * NONE statement set.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The propagate delete none causes the
   * message flow to persist any HTTPRequest header that was set by
   * the data collector through out the message flow.  This HTTP
   * header will causes problems at the MQOutput node.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 fix pack 1
   * when available.
