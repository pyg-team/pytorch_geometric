APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To reproduce:
   
   Go to Application Designer and open up the workorder tracking
   application.  On the list screen add the GLACCOUNT field as an
   additional column and specify the lookup in the Control
   Properties for this Table Column as GLNAVIGATOR.  Save your
   changes.  Then goto the workorder application and you should see
   your new column header.  Click on the lookup and the GLNAVIGATOR
   will appear .  Enter Organization and Site and then select
   values to complete the GL Account.  Then click on the OK button
   in the GLNavigator.  We are expecting that the GL Account value
   will contain the value selected in the GLNAVIGATOR but instead
   it is blank.
