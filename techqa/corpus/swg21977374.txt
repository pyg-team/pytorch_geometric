Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A GNU C library (glibc) stack-based buffer overflow in getaddrinfo() vulnerability affects IBM Security Access Manager for Web. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None.
