 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The purpose of this technical document is to show all the steps to perform the following tasks for IBM MQ in a Linux x86 64-bit machine:
1) Installing MQ 8.0.0.2
2) Applying Fix Pack 8.0.0.4
3) Uninstalling the Fix Pack 8.0.0.4
4) Uninstalling MQ 8.0.0.2
Note: The principles and steps apply also to MQ 9.0 and Fix Packs for MQ 9.0 

CONTENT
The MQ 8.0.0.2 installation code available from IBM Passport Advantage is a "rebase" of the original MQ 8.0.0.0 code, plus Fix Packs 8.0.0.1 and 8.0.0.2.


Note: The principles and steps apply also to MQ 9.0 and Fix Packs for MQ 9.0 


This document describes a scenario in which there is ONLY one version of MQ installed in the machine, in the default location of: /opt/mqm
This means that the utilities "crtmqpkg" and "crtmqfp" are NOT used. These utilities are ONLY needed when installing/maintaining the 2nd or 3rd or another installation location, when there are multiple MQ installations coexisting in the same machine.

A test queue manager will be created for a quick test for putting a message into a queue via local bindings.

The chapters are:

Chapter 1: Summary of commands
Chapter 2: How to get the installation images
Chapter 3: Create userid "mqm" and group "mqm
Chapter 4: Installation of MQ 8.0.0.2 (Installation1 in /opt/mqm)
Chapter 5: Making this installation the Primary one
Chapter 6: Creating a test queue manager, quick verification test
Chapter 7: Installation of the Fix Pack 8.0.0.4
Chapter 8: Uninstallation of the Fix Pack 8.0.0.4
Chapter 9: Uninstallation of the base 8.0.0.2
