Title: IBM Accessing static content of web fragment in a fragment bundle - United States

Text:
WASV85RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Web application bundles (WAB) cannot serve static content from the META-INF/resources directory of a web-fragment if the web fragment archive is not in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the WAB. For example, this problem can occur when a bundle fragment is attached to the WAB. 

SYMPTOM
The installation displays the following error: The Java Runtime Environment that is specified in the JRE installation location is either invalid or it does not meet the minimum JRE version requirement. The minimum JRE version required is 1.6.0.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can complete one of the following temporary options: 

 * Add the static content from the web fragment to the root directory of the bundle-fragment, if there is a bundle-fragment that is contained in a web fragment archive. 
 * Move the the web fragment archive to the WEB-INF/lib directory of the host bundle and update the host bundle-classpath accordingly.
