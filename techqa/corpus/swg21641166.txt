QUESTION
 ODBC gateway : Will the product be GA released shortly? 

CAUSE
The ODBC gateway is to be replaced by the JDBC gateway and at present there are no plans to GA release the current test fix patch.

ANSWER
There are no plans to GA release the ODBC gateway. 

The ODBC gateway can be replaced using the JDBC gateway and server-provided JDBC drivers. 

Please plan to migrate to the JDBC gateway. 

If you require the ODBC gateway you can still download the last GA product from passport advantage for proof of concept. 

However, it is recommended that you request the latest test fix patch from IBM Support before deploying in a production environment. You should also request the latest ODBC drivers if you plan to use the one's provided with the ODBC gateway. 

 

The ODBC Gateway test fix patch is not available for Netcool/OMNIbus 8.1 or above.

Netcool/OMNIbus Gateway for ODBC

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to a Sybase data source, if setting the Database attribute
results in you getting errors like:
11/07/08 14:43:03: Error: E-UNK-000-000: SQLExecDirect: [S0002] [BM][ODBC Sybase Wire Protocol driver][SQL Server]REPORTER_STATUS not found. Specify owner.objectname or use sp_help to check whether the object exists (sp_help may produce lots of output).

then you need to set the InitializationString attribute to command the ODBC
connection to use your intended target database. This can be done by adding
the following to your Sybase data source settings:

InitializationString=use REPORTER

replacing REPORTER with your desired database. The gateway should now
correctly find your database, and continue as normal.


If you have turned on ODBC tracing (in odbc.ini), then you must make sure
that the target trace output file is owned or writable by the gateway,
else the gateway fails to open the file and crashes. By default, tracing
is not enabled, so this issue can only affect you if you require tracing
for some reason.
