PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to install new BES clients using the MSI file 

SYMPTOM
This technote will state how to install agents with a new MSI file if you upgraded your BigFix deployment from one version to another. Or if you simply updated your license and the masthead file has changed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
================================================
1) If you upgrade the deployment (say upgrade from BigFix 9.0 to BigFix 9.1; 
or upgrade from 9.1 to 9.2) the fixlet that will update the installer files
will do bake-in for you as follows: 
======================== 
The fixlet name is "Updated Windows Installation Folders - IBM Endpoint
Manager version x.y.z Now Available!". 
Once you deploy it to the your BigFix server, the individual .exe 
installer files and the MSI file for the agent will be updated. 
You should see a Last Modified timestamp update for the MSI file which 
is located on the BigFix server at: 
X:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Installers\ClientMSI 
======================== 

2) If you do not update the deployment but say you purchased additional 
products and the system detected a license change. Say you ran the BES 
Admin Tool to make the new license take effect and it propagated to all 
your clients okay. At this point what you would: 
======================== 
Download the appropriate installer for your bigfix environment at: 

http://support.bigfix.com/bes/release/ [http://support.bigfix.com/bes/release/]


Make a backup of the masthead you just updated. The masthead file will 
be named actionsite.afxm and will be on the BigFix server at: 
X:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\actionsite.afxm 
Be sure to make a backup of it just in case. 

You would then run the Installer you got from bigfix.com and choose "I 
want to replace the masthead file in my installation". 

The installer will then update the masthead you're using and update the 
MSI file accordingly. 

You will see the timestamp for the MSI file updated at: 
X:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Installers\ClientMSI 

You can then use just that msi file by itself to deploy agents.
