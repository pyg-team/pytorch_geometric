ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using WebSphere MQ v7, along with WebSphere Process Server v6,
   WebSphere Application Server v6, and WebSphere Message Broker
   v7, attempts are made to establish a High Availability setup.
   WebSphere MQ V7 JMS application is reporting the connection
   Manager received a fatal connection error from the Resource
   Adapter. The following error message is being recorded:
   
   J2CA0056I: TheConnection Manager received a fatal connection
   error from the Resource Adapter for resource <RESOURCE>. The
   exception which was received is com.ibm.msg.client.jms.

   connection has occurred. An error has occurred with the
   WebSphere MQ JMS connection. Use the linked exception to
   determine the cause of this error.:com.ibm.mq.MQException:
   JMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2'
   ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2009' ('MQRC_CONNECTION_BROKEN').:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere MQ V7 classes for JMS and
   classes for Java who make use of channel send exits and XA. This
   includes users of WebSphere Application Server that use
   WebSphere MQ messaging.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere MQ V7 classes for JMS and classes for Java may
   cause communication data inconsistencies when used with send
   exits. This results in invalid data being transmitted to the
   queue manager, which terminates the connection as a result.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ V7 classes for JMS and classes for Java have
   been updated to prevent the data inconsistencies occurring and
   leading to a broken connection.
   
   The MQRC_CONNECTION_BROKEN (2009) reason code continues to be
   used validly in situations where network communications between
   the queue manager and WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS client
   are interrupted or terminated unexpectedly.
