Title: IBM Assigning different DocClasses to documents in IBM FileNet Capture Professional - United States

Text:
document class TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I assign different DocClasses to documents using Capture Professional? 

CAUSE
The DocClass for a document is determined by the Settings Collection assigned to the batch, requiring that all documents within a batch have the same DocClass. Therefore, it is necessary to have each document in a separate batch so that they may each be assigned a separate DocClass.

ANSWER
If the documents currently exist in a single batch, Event Activator rules need to be created to break documents into separate batches, and assign Settings Collections to each batch containing the desired DocClass.

Detailed instructions on how to create Event Activator rules can be found in the FileNet Capture Administrators Guide available on the Product Documentation for FileNet Capture [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3276&context=SSNVMX&uid=swg27010327] page.
