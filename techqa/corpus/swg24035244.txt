KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS
1. Problem: During the installation of WebSphere MQ configuration manager (product code: cf) on 64-bit Windows systems, a question dialog is displayed with an error message saying "Building the Configuration Management data source failed possibly dues to an incorrect User ID or password. Would you like to re-try?". 

 Solution: This problem is caused by APAR IV43040 of IBM Tivoli Monitoring version 6.3. Click No on the dialog to proceed and the internal kcf database will be selected and installed by default. 

2. DB2 database type is not supported by the WebSphere MQ configuration manager (product code: cf) on the monitoring server installed on 64-bit Windows and Linux x86_64 systems. Only the internal KCF database type is supported on these two systems.
