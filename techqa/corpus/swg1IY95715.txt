APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity: 4
   Approver: dmh
   
   Environment:
   
   ITM 6.1
   
   Problem Description:
   
   ESR: I am trying to send ITM6.1 UA data across to TEC. I have
   changed the om_tec.config file on my TEMS, created a mapping
   file and cycled the TEMS.
   
   However there is not much information on this whole process.
   
   What I was really looking for is the syntax to the mapping files
   which relate a situation to a TEC class. I understand that these
   mapping files where used for migration from DM to ITM6.1 (I
   think). I was just trying to find out if we could come with our
   own mapping files to correlate our ITM6.1 situations directly
   to a TEC class.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
   None needed.
   
   Related Files and Output:
   
   None needed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  possible use of OPAL website is available.  See PMR for details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Document how TEC mapping files correlate to ITM situations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is currently documented in appendix C of the ITM 6.2 User's
   Guide. More detailed documentation has also been created and
   will be documented in a technote searchable on the IBM support
   site.
