Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere MQ Explorer does not protect credentials (CVE-2015-1967) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM WebSphere MQ Explorer can be configured to send userid and password credentials to a remote queue manager for authentication. When compatibility mode is unchecked in MQ Explorer, the password should be sent in a protected form in the absence of any transport level security, such as TLS.

An error in the MQ Explorer implementation in IBM WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.2 and earlier maintenance always causes compatibility mode to be used and password credentials to be sent in cleartext. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-1967 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1967]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere MQ could allow authentication credentials to pass in plaintext, even when the server is configured to protect passwords. An attacker could obtain this information using man in the middle techniques.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103583 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103583] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.2 and earlier maintenance levels

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The error in MQ Explorer is corrected in fix pack 8.0.0.3 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043086#8003]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM strongly recommends using transport level security on the channel connection between MQ Explorer and remote queue managers by configuring a channel CipherSpec. 

A channel that is configured to use a non-NULL CipherSpec will not only protect any password credentials, but all data exchanged between MQ Explorer and the queue manager.
