Title: IBM Upgrading the SDKs and JREs provided with WebSphere MQ fix packs - United States

Text:
 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 The SDK and JRE shipped on the original installation media does not contain some important changes such as newer daylight savings time (DST) information and some security patches. IBM has included in the WebSphere MQ maintenance package, updated SDKs and JREs which include these changes and customers are now able to upgrade the SDKs and JREs. 

CONTENT
What are JRE and JDK?

The JRE is the Java™ Runtime Environment, which is the minimum set of programs required to run Java applications.

The JDK or SDK is the Java/Software Development Kit, the package which allows a software application developer to build and run Java Applications/Clients. The JDK and SDK contains a JRE with various development tools like the Java source compiler, development libraries, bundling and deployment tools, debugger and so on.


Why does WebSphere MQ include an SDK in WebSphere MQ v5.3 FP13 and WebSphere MQ v6.0.2.0 (or higher)?

When WebSphere MQ is originally installed, the installation media provides an optional Java SDK which can be installed and used for developing software written in Java. The version shipped on the original installation media does not contain some important changes such as newer daylight savings time (DST) information and some security patches. IBM has included in the WebSphere MQ maintenance package an updated SDK installation which includes these changes, and customers are now able to upgrade any installation which used the SDK from the original WebSphere MQ installation media.

When should you install the SDK included in WebSphere MQ v5.3 FP13 or WebSphere MQ v6.0.2.0 (or higher)?

If you installed the optional SDK provided with the original WebSphere MQ 5.3 or 6.0.0.0 installation media, then you should apply this updated SDK to take advantage of security and DST fixes.


What do you have to do to upgrade the SDK included in WebSphere MQ v5.3 FP13 or WebSphere MQ v6.0.2.0 (or higher)?

If you have installed the SDK which ships with the original MQ media, you need to replace it with the new one included in the WebSphere MQ maintenance(FP13 for WebSphere MQ v5.3 installations, WebSphere MQ v6.0.2.0 or later for WebSphere MQ v6 installations). 

Windows: Need to uninstall the existing version of Java SDK through the control panel and install the latest version provided in WebSphere MQ.
Linux: Need to uninstall the existing version of Java SDK using rpm –e <SDK Name> and install the latest version provided with WebSphere MQ.

Please use the output of the command "java -version" or "java -fullversion" to verify/validate the version information of any installed JRE or Java SDK.
