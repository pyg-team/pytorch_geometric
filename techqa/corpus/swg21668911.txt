Title: IBM Cognos Reports do not show images - United States

Text:
tcrcognos TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After manually importing Cognos reports into Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR), the images within the reports appear as broken images. 

CAUSE
Cognos report packages do not contain images, so after importing a Cognos-based report package, the TCR administrator will need to copy the static images to the correct folder depending on the type of TCR installation in order for the images to display.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Confirm gif files are in the images directory at the TCR server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Prior to copying the gif files to the TCR server, the images appear broken.

Expand the zip file that contains the Agent reports and find the "images" directory (the location of this images directory will vary depending on the Report package). 

 

Example of find command ran on a UNIX/Linux server used to locate the images directory after expanding the ITM 6.3 Fixpack 2 OS Agents zip file. 

# find . -name images -type d -print 

 

Output of the command:
./cognos_reports/osagents/images


Copy all gif files from the images directory to the appropriate directory depending on the type of TCR installation.

TCR 2.1.x Install
