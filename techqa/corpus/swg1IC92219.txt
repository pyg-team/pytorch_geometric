APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an application references a connector project, and the
   application also references a library that references a Java
   project, an invalid validation error such as the following can
   appear in the problems view of the toolkit:
   
   "The project 'MyJavaProject' cannot be a member of multiple
   applications or libraries. The project is currently a member
   of the following applications or libraries: MyApplication,
   MyLibrary"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0 who reference
   connector projects and libraries from applications, and Java
   projects from libraries.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Validation was incorrectly treating the reference from the
   connector project to the Java project as a non-dynamic reference
   and therefore incorrectly reporting the duplicate error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit now does not report a
   validation error when an application references a connector
   project, and the application also references a library that
   references a Java project
