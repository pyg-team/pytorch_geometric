ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AD reverse password sync plug-in does not function
   if ins in path that contains a space
   
   Description:
   If the AD reverse password sync plug-in is installed in
   path that contains a space, such as "c:\program files", then it
   does not
   work.  No pwdsync.log file generated and password sync does not
   intercept password changes on the domain controller. Also latest
   versions of AD reverse password sync fail trying to import CA
   cert when
   there is the space in the install path.
   
   Steps to Duplicate: Install the AD reverse password sync plug-in
   in a
   path that contains a space, for example under "c:\program files"
   location.
   
   Desired Behavior: For the AD reverse password sync to function
   correctly
   if installed in a path that contains a space in the path.
   
   Environment: AD reverse password sync plug-in, all versions
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround: The AD reverse password sync plug-in currently needs
   to be
   installed in a path that contains no spaces to function
   correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Password Sync module fails when instlled in a d
   irectory which has a space in the name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix shipped in WinAD adapter 5.0.12 and 5.1.
   7 (pw sync 5.0.1009)
