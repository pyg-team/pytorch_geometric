CVEID:CVE-2016-5547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5547]
DESCRIPTION:An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE Java SE Embedded and Jrockit related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service resulting in a low availability impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher that is used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337]for the current score
