QUESTION
 How do I configure SACL entries? 

ANSWER


Starting Connect:Direct version 3.8, with SR 1366119, a record for root is required. Also, a new parameter value has been added for the deny.access paramter, 'd' which indicates disabled. Here are the new deny.access parameter values:

y indicates no processes can acquire root authority
n indicates pnode processes can acquire root authority, but not snode processes
d indicates any process can acquire root authority
