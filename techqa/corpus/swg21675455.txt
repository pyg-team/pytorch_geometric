 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to use the VIOS Premium Agent without an SSH connection to the HMC? 

ANSWER
Yes. There is no harm to the system to run without HMC access, but you will not get all the data for some attribute groups. Most of the VIOS Premium agent attributes do not require the SSH connection to the HMC. From the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, all the workspaces under Virtual IO Mappings require the SSH connection for at least some data in each 
view. The associated attributes are in the Network Mappings, NPIV Mappings and Storage Mappings attribute groups.

For example, without a SSH connection to HMC, some attributes in the workspaces under Virtual IO Mappings will be blank or show value '0'.

If the SSH connection to HMC exist, VIOS premium agent will get the data.
