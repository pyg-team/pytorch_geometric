Title: IBM User unable to run batches from the Taskmaster Client Job Monitor in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
Taskmaster Client; tmclient.exe; Run Task dialog; Job Monitor; privilege TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An operator cannot run batches through Taskmaster Client's Job Monitor window. 

SYMPTOM
When logged into Taskmaster Client, the operator can only run batches using an Operations shortcut. Running a batch through the general Job Monitor does not work by double-clicking the QID or Job Monitor record number, and the Record | Execute menu option is disabled.


CAUSE
The user or group is missing the Run Task dialog privilege.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Grant the user or group the 'Run Task dialog' privilege.


 1. Run Taskmaster Client and login as admin or a user with full rights. 
 2. From the Settings menu select Users (or Groups). 
 3. Highlight the user (or group) to grant the privilege to and check the Run Task dialog box. 
 4. Click Apply, then Done to close the window.


Note that the 'Run Task dialog' privilege allows users to run any batch listed in the Job Monitor regardless of his or her user/group and station permissions. Granting this privilege to specific users or groups will depend upon exact business requirements.
