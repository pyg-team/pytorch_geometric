Title: IBM Change the IBM Installation Manager agent data location - United States

Text:
agent data location; v70rnotes TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When installing WebSphere Process Server through the launchpad, the IBM Installation Manager agent data location is defaulted. Can I change where the agent data location gets created? 

ANSWER
Yes. The default location for the IBM Installation Manager agent data location can be changed by using the following procedure: 

NOTE: If IBM Installation Manager has already been installed you cannot change the agent data location. This procedure only changes the location when WebSphere Process Server is installing IBM Installation Manager for the first time. 

 

Steps 

 

 1. Obtain information from the IBM Installation Manager product documentation on the Agent data location [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.7.3/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/r_app_data_loc.html?lang=en]. This information provides you the default location as well as what pieces of information are kept in the agent data location.
    
    
 2. Modify the <imageLocation>/launchpad/content/global.properties file, where <imageLocation> is the location of the installation image of WebSphere Process Server.
    
    
 3. Decide which of the following lines you need to modify based upon where you are installing and what user privileges you have:
    //IM install and import WAS
    import[windows]=['IM\\installc', '--launcher.ini', '%1', '-input', '%2', '-log', '%3']
    import[unix]=['IM/install', '--launcher.ini', '%1', '-input', '%2', '-log', '%3'] 
    
    //IM install and import WAS - non-root
    import_nonroot[windows]=['IM\\userinstc.exe', '--launcher.ini', '%1', '-input', '%2', '-log', '%3']
    import_nonroot[unix]=['IM/userinst', '--launcher.ini', '%1', '-input', '%2', '-log', '%3'] 
    
    
 4. Modify the appropriate line by inserting in the following text between the %3 and the ] at the end of the line. Replace <NEW_AGENT_DATA_LOCATION> with your preferred location:
    ,'-dataLocation','<NEW_AGENT_DATA_LOCATION>'
