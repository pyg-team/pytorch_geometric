ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:  Uninstalling and reinstalling WebSphere Application
   Server V7.0 after it is imported into Installation Manager will
   cause Installation Manager to be unable to properly install or
   uninstall Feature Packs on the WebSphere Application Server
   product.  The product will need to be reinstalled to recover
   from this problem.
   
   Details:
   Several feature packs are available for WebSphere Application
   Server V7.0.  These feature packs are installed using the
   IBM Installation Manager utility.
   
   In order for Installation Manager to work with the
   WebSphere Application Server V7.0 product, it is necessary to
   use Installation Manager's "Import" function on the product.
   This registers the WebSphere Application Server V7.0
   instance with Installation Manager.  The "Import" process also
   injects several files into the product installation which are
   critical to the Feature Pack installation process.
   
   Once WebSphere Application Server V7.0 is processed with the
   Import function, it should never be uninstalled using the
   "uninstall.exe" program in the product's "uninstall" directory.
   If the product is uninstalled using uninstall.exe, Installation
   Manager is unaware that the product is missing, and Installation
   Manager will no longer function properly.
   
   If WebSphere Application Server is uninstalled using
   "uninstall.exe", but then it is later re-installed to the same
   product directory, then Installation Manager will appear to
   recognize the re-installed product instance.  However, there are
   actually significant problems with this scenario.  The problems
   are not immediately apparent, because some Installation Manager
   functions will appear to be successful.
   
   Installation Manager will report errors when attempting to
   perform certain installation and uninstallation operations.
   Typically, it will fail to install a feature pack, then report
   the following error:
   
   Unable to find custom install operation
   com.ibm.ws.exec.command.Exec java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   com.ibm.ws.exec.command.Exec
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If WebSphere Application Server V7.0 is installed and then
   imported into Installation Manager, do not uninstall the
   WebSphere Application Server product using the "uninstall.exe"
   program.  Instead, use Installation Manager's "Uninstall"
   function to uninstall the product.
   
   If WebSphere Application Server V7.0 was uninstalled using the
   "uninstall.exe" program, and then it was reinstalled, the
   product cannot be used with Installation Manager.  It will not
   be possible to install or uninstall Feature Packs or fix packs
   using Installation Manager.  In order to resolve this, the
   product must be uninstalled again using Installation Manager.
   
   Once the product is uninstalled using Installation Manager and
   Installation Manager no longer indicates that any products are
   installed in the product's directory, it can be reinstalled and
   then imported into Installation Manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  v7 who need to re-import the re-installed   *
   *                  WebSphere Application Server v7 instance.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: IBM Installation Manager does not       *
   *                      re-import a WebSphere Application       *
   *                      Server v7 instance that has been        *
   *                      uninstalled and re-installed by         *
   *                      legacy technology                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Previously imported WebSphere Application Server v7 instance
   was manually uninstalled not using IBM Installation Manager
   (IIM) but by legacy ISMP-based install technology and Update
   Installer.
   Then, another WebSphere Application Server v7 instance was
   re-installed to the same location using legacy installers.
   IIM's import capability would not re-import the re-installed
   WebSphere Application Server v7 instance into IIM and
   re-synchronized its inventory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue will be addressed in IBM Installation Manager 1.4.4.
   
   IIM's import capability will detect such a situation and
   attempt to re-import the re-installed WebSphere Application
   Server v7 instance and re-synchronizes its inventory.
