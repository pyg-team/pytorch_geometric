PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem was determined that a JNDI property that we were
   looking for was not available on the IBM Websphere instance that
   the customer was using.  We have determined by using fnlog4j
   logging, that the JNDI properties that we were looking for was
   
   not always there. This was partially caused by the inability to
   get the initialContext from the WebSphere application server. It
   seems that it was looking for a different
   java.naming.provider.url than in the working scenarios.  The
   result of us not finding this JNDI property is that we ended up
   using separate ORBs to communicate to the PE server, instead of
   
   re-using the global ORB.
   
   We have made changes to the PE Client APIs so that we do a
   better job of detecting for WebSphere. If the application
   server is WebSphere 6.0 and the JNDI property does not exist,
   
   we will still try to re-use the global ORB.
