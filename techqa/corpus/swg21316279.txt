Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer-provided background information (also known as MustGather data) helps in problem determination and saves time when resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). This technote provides a description of the background information IBM® Support will need. 

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere, WebLogic, and JBoss on all supported operating systems

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Begin by collecting MustGather data early, even before opening the PMR. The MustGather data helps IBM® Support quickly determine the root cause of the problem. With this data, Support can determine the following: 

1. Is the issue a known problem (rediscovery)? 

2. Is the issue a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved? 

3. Is the issue a known defect for which a workaround has been developed? 

4. Is the issue a new problem that has been discovered and requires a fix? 

 

Gathering General Information  * 

Provide the following information to assist IBM in finding a solution: 

1. A complete description of the problem. Include the following information: 
 * a. The detailed steps required to reproduce the problem. 
   b. A brief explanation of what the expected results were. 
   c. A description, if applicable, of any workarounds that are available. 
   d. How frequently the problem occurs. 
   

2. Server deployment information. Include the following information: 
 * a. AE, CE, and PE version number (release and fixpack level). 
   b. Application server type (such as WebSphere) and version number. 
   c. Hardware platform and Operating System version. 
   d. LDAP server type and version number. 
   e. Whether or not it is a clustered deployment. 
   f. Any firewalls, load balancers, or proxies in use. 
   g. Whether or not SSO is configured. 
   h. Whether or not the AE, CE, and/or PE are co-located. 
   i. Whether AE, CE and/or PE installed are installed on a virtualized platform, such as VMWare. 


3. If the issue involves Application Integration or File Tracker, include the following information:
