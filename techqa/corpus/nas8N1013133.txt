PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document explains how to retrieve RPG ILE source when compiled with debug view *all or *list. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Disclaimer: IBM accepts no responsibility for its correctness. 
If you want to retrieve RPG source from a program when the code is not available on the system, the options are limited. However, if the program was compiled with Debug of *ALL or * LIST, there is a way to copy and paste the entire source using System i Navigator Debug. Take the following steps to copy and paste the entire source: 

1. Under Databases, right click on the system name and select Run SQL Scripts ...: 

This shows how to get to run sql scripts. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=1] 



2. Select Run->Debugger: 

This shows how to then get to the debugger. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=2] 


3. Enter the program name and library, and press Enter. This will bring up a debug view of the program in a style that allows copying and pasting the entire source: 

System Debug print screen [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013133&aid=3] 
Note: A strict copy and paste will not result in executable code. You must look through the code and remove the characters and statements inserted by the debugger.
