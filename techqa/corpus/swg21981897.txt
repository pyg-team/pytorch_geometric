QUESTION
 Will IBM Host On-Demand support Session Manager APIs and Portlets when Firefox and Chrome browsers discontinue support for Java? 

ANSWER
IBM Host On-Demand can no longer support Session Manager APIs and Portlets without the support of Java within the browsers. Refer to IBM Host On-Demand Browser Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980025]. Oracle also announced that browser plug-in based Java applications (applets) will be deprecated in Java Version 9 and removed in future versions. Refer to Moving to a plug-in free web [https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/moving_to_a_plugin_free]. 

 
With HOD 12.0, IBM provided a way for users to seamlessly migrate to a browser plug-in free HOD client. HOD 12.0 allows users to access HOD's HTML pages using all the latest browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge by dynamically converting Java's browser plug-in based clients (Cached and Download clients) to plug-in free Web Start clients automatically.

As part of IBM's continuous effort to improve the user experience of browser plug-in free solution of HOD, some functions of HOD will be deprecated. These functions will continue to work as long as Java's browser plug-in works with the browser. The following functions are deprecated with HOD 12.0 as the browsers no longer support Java:




Function/Feature Usage Remarks/Justification for deprecation Session Manager API Using Session Manager APIs, application developers can write JavaScript code that manipulates data from the data stream presentation space (such as 3270, 5250, and Virtual Terminal) without requiring any Java coding. Session Manager API Can only work with Java's browser plug-in based applications (applets) as interaction with JavaScript that runs in the browser is a must. Portlets Portlets organize content from different sources (such as Web sites, e-mail, and business applications) and display it on a single HTML file in a browser window. The WAR or EAR files generated by the Deployment Wizard used to launch Host On-Demand sessions can be deployed as portlets, enabling users to access Host On-Demand through the portal interface. Java's browser plug-in is required to show Host On-Demand in a browser Window. 

IBM Portlet API is deprecated starting WebSphere Portal Server 8.5. Refer to Unsupported and deprecated features for V8.5 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYJ99_8.5.0/reference/intr_depc.html].
