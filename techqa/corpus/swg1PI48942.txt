APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OpenPages 7.0.0.x is certified for Oracle DB 11gR2. This means
   OpenPages customers can go to Oracle DB 11.2.0.4.
   
   After patching the oracle database, the
   OP_PROCEDURAL_CODE_VERSION view no longer compiles properly.
   This is causing OPBackup and OPRestore to fail because an ERROR
   is thrown when recompiling the view.
