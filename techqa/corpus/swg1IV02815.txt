ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   
   Approver Initials:    LD
   Severity:             3
   Reported Release:     6226
   Compid:               5724C04BR
   ABSTRACT:Non-agent bundle deploy does not handle ls3266 platform
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   The Remote deploy descriptor (.dsc) file of a non-agent bundle
   does not include the ls3266 (Linux S390 R2.6 (64 bit)) platform,
   when the "Linux (64-bit ZSeries) operating system is selected to
   deploy the bundle on.
   
   The deployment status from a "tacmd addSystem" command results
   in the Error Message :
   
   KDY0010E:  The agent bundle <bundle name> was not found in the
   agent bundle depot on <TEMS name>.
   
   The agent bundle specified for deployment is not installed on
   the agent bundle depot for the target operating system.
   
   The "tacmd addBundles" command does not include a bundle (Host
   Version) for the 'ls3266':
   
   Host Version : ls3226,ls3245,ls3246,ls3265 <----- No ls3266
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   When creating the Agent Builder non-agent remote deploy bundles
   thru the Remote Deploy Bundle Editor, select the Operating
   System "All Linux". Even though "Linux (64-bit zSeries)" is
   checked the corresponding architecture "ls3266|Linux S390 R2.6
   (64 bit)|" bundle is not created.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually edit the XML generated by the Agent Builder and add the
   missing platform to the end of the <PlatformCodes> XML tag as
   follows,
   
               <PlatformCodes>
   
               ...
   
                   <PlatformCode>
                       <Code>ls3266</Code>
                       <DefaultPCDesc>Linux S390 R2.6 (64
   bit)</DefaultPCDesc>
                   </PlatformCode>
               </PlatformCodes>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The remote deploy descriptor file
   (<bundle_identifier>ls3246.dsc) of a non-agent bundle generated
   by the Agent builder does not include the platform:  ls3266
   (Linux S390 R2.6 (64 bit)), when the operating system "Linux
   (64-bit ZSeries)" is selected on which to deploy the bundle.
   This occurs on Agent Builder v6.2.2.7 and prior.
   
   The <bundle_identifier>ls3246.dsc does not contain the
   <PlatformCode> stanza as indicated below:
               <PlatformCodes>
                  . . .
               <PlatformCode>
                 <Code>ls3266</Code>
                 <DefaultPCDesc>Linux S390 R2.6
   (64-bit)</DefaultPCDesc>
                   </PlatformCode>
                    . . .
     </PlatformCodes>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added <PlatformCode> stanza for platform l3266 to the list of
   Linuz ZSeries 64bit platforms for remote deploy.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in
   - IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Agent builder,
     Multiplatform, English (CZZ3KML)
   available on Passport Advantage.
