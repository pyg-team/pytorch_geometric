SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. OpenSSL is used by cqperl and ratlperl for SSL communications. Rational ClearQuest has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearQuest versions:



Version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.7 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.14 Affected 7.1.2.x (all versions) Affected 
Not all deployments of Rational ClearQuest use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearQuest includes any of these configurations: 
 1. You use SSL connections in perl scripts run by ratlperl or cqperl, or by ClearQuest hooks. In this situation, you should review all the fixes provided by the OpenSSL project to see which ones apply to your use of OpenSSL. See the references link below. 
 2. You integrate with ClearCase. See Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect Rational ClearCase (CVE-2014-3570, CVE-2014-3572, CVE-2015-0204) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694288]

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to update to the latest fix pack. 


Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.1.x Install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 8 (8.0.1.8) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039864] 8.0.0.x Install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 15 (8.0.0.15) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039862] 7.1.2.x Customers with extended support contracts should install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 18 (7.1.2.18) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039860] 
You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable the any script that uses SSL and runs in ratlperl, cqperl or ClearQuest hooks until you apply the fixes listed above.
