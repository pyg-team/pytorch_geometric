LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the IBM MQ .NET Redistributable client
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The logic to locate the MQ .NET runtime library (amqmdnet.dll)
   when running a .NET application has changed with redistributable
   clients. A coding error within this change meant that the MQ
   .NET client was unable to locate runtime library when a client
   of lower version is installed in the environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ .NET redistributable client has been updated to correctly
   locate the runtime library from the client directory when a
   lower version of client is installed.
