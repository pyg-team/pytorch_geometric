APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On AIX, the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS does not
   display aggregate CPU data on the System...CPU% workspace when
   there is only one CPU on the system.
   
   Environment:      All releases
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  UNIX OS Agent does not display aggreate CPU data on a system
   where there is only one CPU on the system for the SMP CPU
   attribute group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment a new environment variable has been added,
   KUX_AGGREGATE_CPU.   When set to TRUE, the aggregate CPU
   information will be displayed on a single CPU system.  The
   default is FALSE, meaning no aggretate line will be displayed.
   The following is an example of setting the variable
       in the $CANDLEHOME/config/ux.ini file:
            KUX_AGGREGATE_CPU=TRUE
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle:
   
      | interim fix | 6.2.3.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0004 |
      | interim fix | 6.3.0.7-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0001 |
