 Creating a WAR file from within the Websphere Workbench IDE 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
QUESTION: 
How do I create WAR file from within the Websphere Workbench IDE?


ANSWER:
When you do a File->Export in Websphere Workbench and view the resultant Export dialog you will notice that the export destinations are limited to 'File System', 'JAR file', 'RAS file' and 'Zip file', i.e. there is no option to export to a WAR file. Unlike Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD), Websphere Workbench (WSW) does not support this feature.

If you are looking to create a WAR file from within WSW then you can use the following workaround:
Rational XDE does give you the ability to deploy Java Web Applications using WAR files. First create a Java project that contains a Java code model and the Java classes (.class files) that you want to deploy. In the Model Explorer or a diagram window, right click on a Java element and select More Java Actions->Deploy. 

This is a wizard driven process. You can use XDE to "deploy" a WAR file and then copy the created WAR file wherever you want it. The deployment wizard creates the WAR in the C:/Temp/DeployTemp/classes/webapp directory by default before trying to deploy it to an application server. If you don't have an application server, you'll get an error, but you'll still have the WAR file.
