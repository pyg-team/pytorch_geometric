QUESTION
 Error ADMU0118E appears in <TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/serverStatus.log when I run serverStatus.sh | bat and I'm unable to stop the TIP/WebGUI server. Why? 

ANSWER
This could happen if the install is a non-root install and someone started the TIP server as root. This causes a bunch of the files to be owned by root, and then when the server tries to start as non-root, it can't write the files. Check the <TIPPROFILE>/logs/server1 directory and make sure none of the files are owned by root. If some are, then run the steps below to change ownership back to the non-root user (in the example we've used the user 'netcool'):
1. As the root user, cd $TIPHOME
2. chown -R netcool.ncoadmin *
3. Log back in as the "netcool" user and retry stopping the TIP/WebGUI server
