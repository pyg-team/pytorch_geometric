 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
When selecting "Mark for Delete" action on a page in FixUp panel, the page's status is "Overridden" instead of "Deleted".


SYMPTOM
 

1. Launch the Datacap Navigator and log in with admin and admin's password.
2. Allow "Mark for Delete" in FixUp or Verify task in Datacap administration view.
3. Click a Fixup task and the Fixup panel appears.
4. Select a page in Batch structure and select Actions -> Mark for Delete.
5. The page's status becomes "Overridden" instead of "Deleted".


CAUSE
 

The reason that a page becomes "Overridden" after "Mark for Delete" in "Fixup" panel is that in the Fixup task, the "Ignored pages status" is: 0,2, and "2" means "Overridden".

Complete the following steps to double check:
1. Open Datacap administration view:
2. Click "Workflows".
3. Double click workflow name, for example: "TravelDocs".
4. Click "Jobs" tab.
5. Double click "Fixup Job".
6. Click "Tasks" tab.
7. Double click "FixUp" task.
8. Click "Advanced" tab.
9. Scroll down to "Navigation" section.
10. Check the "Ignored pages status", it is: 0,2.

In "Ignored pages status" field, the first value is the status of document, the second value is the status of page.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Update "Ignored pages status" to "128,75" for Fixup task, and save the change. Then log out and log in to Datacap navigator, repeat the "Mark for Delete" action on "Fixup" panel. The page's status will be changed to "Deleted" now.
