APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The forward slash in a dynamic property value caused the
   interpreter to assume the slash to refer to a path versus a
   property name.  This caused a root directory structure to be to
   it.  The property value with the forward slash fails to map to
   any uuids and so the attribute cannot be interpreted.
   
   The end result is the rule fails when the dynamic property has
   a forward slash.
   
   For examle of failing property format:
   Dynamic Property name:   Department
   Dynamic Property value:   News/Weather
