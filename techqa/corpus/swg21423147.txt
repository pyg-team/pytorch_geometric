PROBLEM
A mail file owner tries to add another Notes user as a calendar delegate, but it fails with the error "Error creating AdminP request, please contact your administrator".

SYMPTOM
You're unable to add a delegate. You get the error "Error creating AdminP request, please contact your administrator". No request gets submitted to the admin4.nsf database.


CAUSE
In this case, the customer was running an 8.0.2 server, but the user's mail file was based on the mail6.ntf template.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After upgrading the user's mail file to the mail8.ntf template they were immediately able to add the delegate.
