PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are receiving an error "Cannot display the webpage" when trying to launch DOORS Web Access URL using HTTPS 

SYMPTOM
To configure DOORS Web Access for HTTPS, you will need to have a keystore containing the server certification. You can create and manage a keystore using the standard Java keytool facilities as documented on the Sun web site http://java.sun.com/ [http://java.sun.com/]. 

Once keystore is created, you need to modify 'server.xml' file located under server's conf directory. DOORS Web Access "Installing_dwa.pdf" guide on page 20 stated as below: 

 

 * 
 * 
   *** text start ***
 * <!-- Delete this line from the file 
 * <Connector port="8443“ maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" 
 * maxThreads="150" inSpareThreads="25“ MaxSpareThreads="75“ 
 * enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true“ 
 * acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true“ 
 * clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" 
 * keystoreFile="c:\dwaServer\keystore.ks" 
 * keystorePass="password" 
 * /> 
 * --> Delete this line from the file 
 * *** text end ***
   


After modifying 'server.xml' file as mentioned above, launch DOORS Web Access using HTTPS; you receive an error "Cannot display the webpage".

CAUSE
This is a known documentation defect in Rational DOORS Web Access which has been logged as APAR ID: PK90830 

The reason you're receiving this error because there is a vital line missing from the documentation. Because we mandate that an IBM JRE is used, we need to use the IbmX509 algorithm for authentication. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue: 

 

 1. Open the 'server.xml' file for edit 
 2. Modify the last two entries 'keystoreFile' and 'keystorePass' as shown below:


 *  
   *** text start *** <Connector port="8443" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
   maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
   enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
   acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
   clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
   keystoreFile="c:\DOORS\DWA\keystore"
   keystorePass="changeit" algorithm="IbmX509" 
   
   /> 
   
   *** text end ***
   
   
   

3. Please note: the second last line on the above new entry was created a self signed certificate using the keygen tool using the IBM JRE ($DWA\win32\ibm-java2-i386\jre) and applied the changes above in the 'server.xml' file.
