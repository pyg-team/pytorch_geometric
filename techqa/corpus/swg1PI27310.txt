APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users affected
   ----------------
   J2EE DC 7.1.1 and Tomcat 5.5.27 (5.5.x)
   More details
   --------------
   The DC trace is filled in with exceptions whose stack trace is
   similar to this:
   javax.management.AttributeNotFoundException :
   Cannot find attribute stateName at
   org.apache.commons.modeler.BaseModelMBean.getAttribute(BaseModel
   MBean.java:260) at
   com.sun.jmx.interceptor.DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor.getAttribu
   te(DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor.java:666) at
   com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer.getAttribute(JmxMBeanServ
   er.java:638) at

   P .getStatus(TomcatSP.java:47) at
   com.ibm.tivoli.itcam.toolkit.appmon.config.AppCfgMgr.getAppStatu
   s(AppCfgMgr.java:430) ...........
   Also, looking at the JMX Proxy full listing:
   http://<ip-address>:8080/manager/jmxproxy/?qry=
   and [http://<ip-address>:8080/manager/jmxproxy/?qry=and] searching for tomcat 5.5.x mbean object name, you see that
   "*:j2eeType=WebModule,name=" has the value "state" and not the
   value "stateName".
   A fix in "reqaggr.jar" is needed to support this, as agreed
   with Keyuri.
