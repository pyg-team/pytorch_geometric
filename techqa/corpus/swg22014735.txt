Title: IBM XML containing a date field with leading spaces leads to missing data on output. - United States

Text:
ITX WTX XML Date blank output well-formed schema validation TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An XML defined date with leading spaces mapped using an IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) map may produce blank output if the well-formed option is used. 

SYMPTOM
Output is either blank or incomplete.


CAUSE
Using well-formed XML validation the leading space is not validated with the Xerces parser (and therefore not automatically removed) so the TODATETIME() and FROMDATETIME() map rule functions fail and no date is written to the output.

ENVIRONMENT
Using IBM Transformation Extender (ITX)/IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) map to validate XML data with a date defined as xs:date with a leading space contained within the data. The map rule for the date uses TODATETIME/FROMDATETIME functions. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using ITX/WTX with well-formed XML validation a date which contains a leading space is not present in the output.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can either use 'Schema validation' instead of well-formed or you could use a combination of map functions to get the expected date in the output. 

For example :
=TODATETIME (SUBSTITUTE (TEXT (input), " ", ""))
