PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ***************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of ITCAM for Application Diagnostics
   * 7.1 used with ITCAM for WebSphere 7.2 Data Collector.
   ***************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * TEP shows an incorrect WebSphere status "Unconfigured"
   * after stopping monitored WebSphere server. The correct status
   * should be "Disconnected".
   ***************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Use ITCAM for AD 7.1.0.3 interim fix 3
   * (7.1.0.3-TIV-ITCAMfAD-IF0003) or newer to resolve this issue.
   ***************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere agent checks configuration status by reading files
   from Data Collector directory. Those files are stored in
   agent's directory tree: <ITM_HOME>/<platform>/yn/wasdc.
   ITCAM for WebSphere 7.2 Data Collector's files are stored
   outside WAS agent directory tree and DC disconnection was
   treated as it's configuration was removed.
   
   The fix for this APAR provides correct handling of ITCAM for
   WebSphere 7.2 DC disconnecting.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
