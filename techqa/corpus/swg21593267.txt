Title: IBM How do I enable debugging in the engine logs? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Errors are being seen in the engine logs however there is not enough information to explain why the errors are happening. Turning on debug will help with the troubleshooting of the errors. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are different methods to enable the engine timer logs that are dependant upon your version. 

For versions 7.5 - 9.0 you will modify the engine.properties file and change the MAD_DEBUG=0 to MAD_DEBUG=1. 

9.2 and above in the log4j.xml file you will need to change the following lines from: 

 <logger name="com.initiatesystems.hub.logging.NativeLog"> 

 <level value="INFO"/> 

to: 

 <logger name="com.initiatesystems.hub.logging.NativeLog"> 

 <level value="DEBUG"/> 

A restart of the engine will need to be performed in order for the change to take place. Debug will remain on until the above changes are reverted back and the engine is restarted. 

If you would like to turn on debugging for a short period of time without having to stop and restart the engine this can be done through Hub Manager (7.5 and older) or through Workbench (8.0 and above). For more information on how to utilize this functionality please refer to the "Initiate Workbench User Guide" for your version.
