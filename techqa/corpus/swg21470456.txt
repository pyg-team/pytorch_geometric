 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What JDBC drivers does Business Process Framework support? 
Does Business Process Framework support the same JDBC drivers as IBM FileNet P8? 

ANSWER


The JDBC requirements that are described in the Business Process Framework V4.1 installation documentation do not match the JDBC requirements that are described IBM FileNet P8 V5.0 Hardware and Software Requirements documentation.


IBM FILENET P8 V5.0 STATEMENT
The IBM FileNet P8 V5.0 Hardware and Software Requirements document, which is available from the IBM Support Portal at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654], states that IBM FileNet P8 supports the following JDBC drivers:

 * For Microsoft SQL Server, the Microsoft JDBC driver version that corresponds to the Microsoft SQL Server version is supported.
 * For Oracle, the JDBC driver version that corresponds to the Oracle database version is supported. 

BUSINESS PROCESS FRAMEWORK V4.1 STATEMENT
The JDBC driver requirements [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.installingbpf.doc/bpfpi017.htm] topic in the Business Process Framework V4.1 installation guide, which is available in the IBM FileNet P8 V5.0 information center at http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.installingbpf.doc/bpfpi017.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r0m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.installingbpf.doc/bpfpi017.htm] states that Business Process Framework V4.1 supports the following JDBC drivers:

 * For Microsoft SQL Server, jtds-1.x.y.jar is supported.
 * For Oracle, ojdbc14.jar is supported.

QUESTION
Does Business Process Framework support the same JDBC drivers as IBM FileNet P8?

ANSWER
At the time of this publication, Business Process Framework V4.1 supports the following JDBC drivers:

 * For Microsoft SQL Server, the following drivers are supported:  * jtds-1.x.y.jar is supported.
    * sqljdbc.jar is supported for BPF Web only.
    * sqljdbc4.jar is supported for BPF Web only.
   
   
 * For Oracle, the following drivers are supported:  * ojdbc14.jar is supported.
    * ojdbc5.jar is supported.
    * ojdbc6.jar is supported.
   
   

Business Process Framework V4.1 supports the same JDBC drivers as IBM FileNet P8 V5.0 with the exception that BPF Operations supports only the jtds-1.x.y.jar driver for Microsoft SQL Server.

Important: To use Business Process Framework with the following drivers, you must implement the workaround described later in this document:

 * sqljdbc.jar
 * sqljdbc4.jar
 * ojdbc5.jar
 * ojdbc6.jar

Remember: For Microsoft SQL Server, BPF Operations requires the jtds-1.x.y.jar driver. If the BPF metastore database is Microsoft SQL Server, you must download and install the jTDS JDBC driver regardless of the JDBC driver that you use for the BPF Web Application. You can download the jTDS JDBC driver from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/files/ [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/files/].
