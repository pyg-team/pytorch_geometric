QUESTION
 Upgrading the ITM Agent fails with KCI1148E, KCI1133E, KCI1007E errors. 

The original or first error was: KCI1148E. 
---------------------
Initializing ...
install.sh : processing base CI package.
install.sh : installer level 623 /100.
install.sh : computed architecture = "li6263".
install.sh : processing JRE packages.
install.sh : About to check for installed JRE.
install.sh failure: KCI1148E This is not a supported platform or the installation media does not contain any components supported on this platform.. 
---------------------
After re-downloading the bundle, I am now getting error: 

install.sh failure: KCI1133E cannot read file "/opt/IBM/ITM/registry/archdsc.tbl" - please try the install again. 

I have successfully installed this bundle on other servers with same OS.

Linux prs72743 2.6.5-7.282-bigsmp #1 SMP Tue Aug 29 10:40:40 UTC 2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux 

Latest attempt: 
While installing the agent, I got this error:

CAUSE
The bundles was generated for a different OS or Platform. This bundle was generated for the Linux x86 64 bit platform. The system where the installation was attempted was Linux x86 32 bit.

ANSWER
The KCI1148E message that came first indicates the cause. You can not install using a Linux x86 64 bit bundle on a Linux x86 32 bit platform. 

This lz bundle is for the lx8266 (Linux on x86_64 64 bit) platform only. Besides the name of the bundle directory itself, you can see that there are only packages for the lx8266 platform in the unix directory of the bundles. 

The system is an li6263 (Linux on i686 32 bit) 
computed architecture = "li6263" 
Output of uname -a 
Linux prs72743 2.6.5-7.282-bigsmp #1 SMP Tue Aug 29 10:40:40 UTC 2006 
i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux 

You need to get the correct bundle for the system type. 

If you do not have bundles for li6263, then you must generate them. 

If you are going to generate bundles, you should review the tacmd exportbundles documentation for the release installed at your TEMS. There is an option "-os LINUX" that will generate a bundle containing all of the Linux platform variants except for zLinux. The bundle will be significantly larger, but you will not have to be bothered with problems like this one where you tried to apply a bundle for Linux 64 bit on to a Linus 32 bit system.
