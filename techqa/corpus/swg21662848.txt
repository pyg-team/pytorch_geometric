   The system cannot find the path specified.


CAUSE
When you install using the launchpad, the launchpad will try to find out any available IBM Installation Manager (IIM) installed in the machine through the Registry. The two possible keys with IIM are the following:

'HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\IBM\\Installation Manager'
'HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\IBM\\Installation Manager'

Check your registry, and check that keys point to an existing location of IBM Installation Manager.
It could happen for unknown reason that IBM Installation Manager has been uninstalled and is missing, but registry key still exists. So if the launchpad finds the first location and assumes that IIM is there but eventually, it's not, then it fails as the actual files for IBM Installation Manager do not exist.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have a registry key pointing to somewhere where IBM Installation Manager is not installed anymore, delete it. 

Then run the launchpad again and it will complete successfully.
