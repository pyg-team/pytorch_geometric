APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a Windows locale is set to "hr" versus "hr_HR" due to a
   problem with the installation of the Microsoft Langauge
   Package support for Croatian ? Croatia (Hrvatski) ITM will
   not honor only the Region (hr) setting. ITM Requires hr_HR.
   
   The user will see in their ITM logs the following error
   message when this condition occurs.
   
   krabufwk.cpp,159,"CTIRA_Set_DefaultCodepage") *INFO:
   Default IRA codepage set to 37 - ibm-37_P100-1995,
   Language 1 -
   
   Since the hr_HR is not recognized as a valid Region +
   Language, but just a Region, the Globalization support
   defaults to the EBCDIC Codepage (37).  The setting of
   this default results in various ITM components incorrectly
   interpreting text data.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   Install Windows 2008
   Install ITM Monitoring Agent for Windows OS
   Set Region to "hr" using Regions/Language
   Start the OS Agent
   Observe in the OS Agent log file the message:
   
   krabufwk.cpp,159,"CTIRA_Set_DefaultCodepage") *INFO:
   Default IRA codepage set to 37 - ibm-37_P100-1995,
   Language 1 -
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Temporarily set the locale of the machine to en_US.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On Windows, running IBM Tivoli Monitoring in Croatian results in
   missing data.
   
   
   If the locale on a Windows system is set to "hr" versus "hr_HR",
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring will not honor the region setting (hr) on
   its own due to a problem with the installation of the Microsoft
   Language Package support for Croatian ? Croatia (Hrvatski). A
   message similar to the following may be seen in the log when
   this condition occurs:
   
   krabufwk.cpp,159,"CTIRA_Set_DefaultCodepage") *INFO:
   Default IRA codepage set to 37 - ibm-37_P100-1995,
   Language 1 -
   
   Since "hr_HR" is not recognized as a valid region/language
   combination, the globalization support defaults to EBCDIC
   codepage 37, resulting in various components incorrectly
   interpreting text data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For Windows servers configured in Croatian, the product now
   supports both the region/language combination (hr_HR) as well as
   just the region on its own (hr).
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   
   packages:
   | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0009
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Set the region/language to hr_HR using the Windows Regions and
   Languages Dialog of the Windows OS. If using this dialog does
   not alter the setting from hr to hr_HR, then the Microsoft
   Language Pack for HR must be installed.
