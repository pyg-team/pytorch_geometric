ABSTRACT
 This SupportPac provides a WebSphere MQ Java client for iSeries V6 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac contains the IBM WebSphere MQ Java client components for iSeries V6.0. 

The components you can install on iSeries are: 

WebSphere MQ client
The WebSphere MQ Java client code for your iSeries platform for both WebSphere MQ Java classes and Java Message Service 

Possible Uses
Why use WebSphere MQ clients?

Using WebSphere MQ clients is an efficient way of implementing WebSphere MQ messaging and queuing. 

You can have an application that uses the MQ Java API or Java Message Service running on one machine and the queue manager running on a different machine, either physical or virtual. The benefits of doing this are: 

There is no need for a full WebSphere MQ implementation on the client machine. 
» Hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. 
» System administration requirements are reduced. 
» A WebSphere MQ application, running on a client can connect to multiple queue managers on different systems. 
» Alternative channels using different transmission protocols may be used. 

What applications run on a WebSphere MQ client?

The WebSphere MQ client on iSeries supports only Java applications that use WebSphere MQ classes for Java or WebSphere MQ classes for Java Message Service (JMS). It does not support applications that use the MQI directly. 

The following functions are not supported: 

» An application that needs syncpoint coordination with other resource managers. 
» Get(signal) on z/OS. 

Note:


 1. An application running on a WebSphere MQ client may connect to more than one queue manager concurrently, or use a queue manager name with an asterisk (*). 
 2. The application will have to be changed if you want to link to the queue manager libraries instead of the client libraries, as this function will not be available. 
 3. Service is available for this SupportPac for as long as the WebSphere MQ for iSeries V6 server product is supported by service.
