QUESTION
 How can you tune the Virtual Image Library for IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator for the best performance in a very large environment? 

ANSWER
To tune for the best performance, complete the following steps: 

 1. Increase the JVM heap size for the Virtual Image Library up to 3 GB using the WebSphere Application Server Administrative Console.  1. Access the administrative console at the following location: http://Central_Server_2_IP:9043/ibm/console 
        
     2. Login as wasadmin.
        
        
     3. Click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere Application Servers > ImageLibraryServer. Under Server Infrastructure, click Java and Process Management > Process Definition > Java virtual machine.
        
        
     4. Specify the new heap size in the Maximum heap size field.
        
        
        Note: It is not possible to set the heap size to 4 GB in the WebSphere Application Server Administrative Console. However, If needed, you can increase the heap size to a maximum of 3696 MB by manually editing the /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/imageLibraryProfile/config/cells/cell_name/nodes/node_name/servers/imageLibraryServer/server.xml file on Central Server 2 and setting maximumHeapSize=3696.
        
        
     5. Click Apply.
        
        
     6. Click Save to save the changes to the master configuration.
        
        
     7. Restart the Virtual Image Library by using the service vil restart command.
        
        
    
    
 2. Disable the Virtual Image Library instance discovery. To make this change, on Central Server 2, edit the /etc/imageLibrary/library.properties file and set Connector.instances.discovery=off. 
    
    
 3. Restart the Virtual Image Library.



Note: When you synchronize the Virtual Image Library repositories manually, synchronize them sequentially one repository at a time.
