ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JSC displays the following permission error unexpectedly when
   changing priority of the job with ALTPRI security setting.
   
   GJS0089E
   AWSJSY508E You do not have permissions to perform the operation
   "DELDEP" on the following object type "JOB" with object key
   
   Environment:
   MDM: TWS 8.4 + FP0006 on AIX
   JSC: JSC 8.4 + FP0003 on Windows
   
   Replication steps:
   1. Define a security of a user.  JOB and JOBSTREAM has ALTPRI
      setting.
   For example:
   USER OPERATOR
           CPU=@+LOGON=testuser
   BEGIN
     USEROBJ CPU=@
   ACCESS=ADD,DELETE,DISPLAY,MODIFY,ALTPASS,UNLOCK
     JOB     CPU=@   ACCESS=ALTPRI,DISPLAY,LIST
     SCHEDULE        CPU=@   ACCESS=ALTPRI,DISPLAY,LIST
     :
   
   2. Using JSC, "all scheduled job" -> right click -> properties
   -> change priority -> OK -> error is displayed.
   
     => It can be confirmed that ALTPRI operation is actually
        performed.
   
   Notes: Performing the same scenario to job stream completes
   without any error messages.
   
   Notes:
   The issue occurs on the following environment also.
   1. TDWC 8.5.1 + TWS 8.5.1.
   2. TDWC 8.6.0 + TDWC 8.6.0
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ignore the message.
