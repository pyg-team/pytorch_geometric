ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Knowledge Center article "Queue manager error logs"
   contains a list of error messages that can be suppressed using
   the parameter SuppressMessage under the QMErrorLog stanza of the
   queue manager configuration file, qm.ini. Although AMQ9489 is an
   error message that can be suppressed, it is not listed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the product documentation at the page mentioned.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The page does not show that AMQ9489 is an error message that can
   be suppressed. There are also other errors and omissions within
   the lists that will be corrected at the same time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The page will be updated to show AMQ9489 is an error message
   that can be suppressed. In addition to this, other errors in the
   documented lists at these pages will be corrected.
   
   For all releases, these lines will be added:
   5211 - Maximum property name length exceeded.
   6254 - The system could not dynamically load shared library
   9489 - SVRCONN max instances limit exceeded
   9490 - SVRCONN max instances per client limit exceeded
   9637 - Channel is lacking a certificate
   
   For MQ 7.0.1, these lines will also be added:
   5973 - Distributed publish/subscribe subscription inhibited
   5974 - Distributed publish/subscribe publication inhibited
   
   For MQ 7.0.1, these lines will be removed, since they apply only
   to 7.1 and later releases:
   9776 - Channel was blocked by user id
   9777 - Channel was blocked by NOACCESS map
   9782 - Connection was blocked by address
