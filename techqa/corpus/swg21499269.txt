PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Robotic scripts playback on ITCAM T6-RRT agent but no applications or transactions data displays in the TEPS. 

SYMPTOM
No detailed data for T6-RRT agent playback of RPT/RFT scripts.


CAUSE
ITCAM environment configuration

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
There are many possible configuration issues that prevent data from displaying in the TEPS. Here is a checklist of items that must be configured correctly for all T6-RRT data to show up properly in the TEPS:



 * Verify the scripts are playing back successfully.
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499269&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499269&aid=1]
   
 * Check for any errors in the trace-robotic logs found in the default Tivoli common logs directory:
   
   Windows: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\ibm\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\*
   
   Unix/Linux: /var/ibm/tivoli/common/BWM/logs/ 
   
 * There can only be one T3-AMC agent in the ITM environment. Verify with the following commands:  * Logon to HUB-TEMS and run the following command:
      ITM_HOME/bin/tacmd login -s tems-server -u sysadmin -p sysadmin-password 
    * On Windows, run the following command:
      ITM_HOME\BIN\tacmd listSystems | find ":T3"
      result : velocity:T3 T3 07.40.02.00 Y 
    * On Unix/Linux, run the following command:
      ITM_HOME/bin/tacmd listSystems | grep \:T3
      result : velocity:T3 T3 07.40.02.00 Y
      
   
   
 * Verify that the application support for the T3 and T6 agents is applied appropriately.
   
 * Verify there are no space issues on the T3 and T6 agents.
   
 * If the RPT Workbench is installed on the T6 agent do not run RPT while the T6 agent is started.
   
 * Verify the T3 agent is at the highest version of any ITCAM agent 
   
 * Playback the script in the Rational environment (on the RPT/RFT workbench) to verify successful completion.
   
 * Verify the AMC is pointing to the HUB TEMS
   
 * The correct version of RPT/RFT must be installed with the correct ITCAM plugin on the RPT/RFT workbench. 
   
 * The correct extensions must be installed for RPT/RFT 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After verifying these items, if the data still does not display in the TEPS, 

 * Open a case for Tivoli support. 
 * Copy the list above into the case text along with the result of your findings for each of these items. 
 * Zip into a file the kincinfo -t (Windows) or cinfo -t (UNIX) data from the TEMS/TEPS/T6/T3 servers and the default Tivoli common logs directory (noted above) and upload to the case.
