ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SmartBox - Items Remain Bold after Reading
   this issue is with the SMARTEAM Web - Inbox
   There is a mesage that remains bold, even after
   opening it.
   There are few of those in the system.
   1. It is something that I cannot reproduce.
   2. I was looking in the tables to see which table has
   the information
   if a message/process was read or not - but could
   not find the table.
   3. I know that there was an issue with CCed
   messages that remaind bold
   (As unread) but this is not the case, since it is not
   CC, but
   "To".

PROBLEM SUMMARY

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Execute the following sql and it will solve the
   problem.
   delete from TDM_SF_PROCS_LOC where class_id1
   not in (select class_id from tdm_class where
   super_class_id = (select class_id from tdm_class
   where upper(class_name) = 'FLOW PROCESS'))
   You can first run the sql:
   select * from TDM_SF_PROCS_LOC where
   class_id1 not in (select class_id from tdm_class
   where super_class_id = (select class_id from
   tdm_class where upper(class_name) = 'FLOW
   PROCESS'))
   and see that there are a few records that in the
   field ?CLASS_ID1? there are class id?s that were
   deleted from the DB.
   The problem is probably in the DMD. Maybe the
   customer deleted flow processes with the DMD and
   already initiated processes were not deleted
   properly.
