APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a CPU is temporarily unavailable, and strmqm is
   issued, if any of the CPU lists in the qmproc.ini file
   contain the unavailable CPU, the EC fails the validation
   of the whole rule set and the queue manager starts up,
   but with the default set of rules. Unfortunately these
   rules have a functional impact on the queue manager
   (especially channels that use alternative TCP/IP stacks).
   CPU unavailability is a normal operational situation and
   should be tolerated. The EC will allow CPU lists to
   contain unavailable CPUs on strmqm.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   If a cpu is down when the queue manager is
   started the EC validation rules are not applied. This can cause
   issues with channels if a non-default TCPIP process is
   configured for channel rules in the qmproc.ini
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Allow EC process management rules to
   continue validation process if a unavailable cpu is found when
   the queue manager is started. A message will be logged:
   MQ8832: Warning: An unavailable CPU was found in the Process
   Management rules.
