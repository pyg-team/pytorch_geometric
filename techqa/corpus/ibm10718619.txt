Title: IBM How do I disable a TWS / IWS dynamic agent? - United States

Text:
 HOW TO

SUMMARY
If dynamic scheduling is not being used then one may want to disable the resource scanner, agent, and JobManager processes from starting.

OBJECTIVE
Prevent unused processes from launching.

STEPS
If you are not using dynamic scheduling, the easiest way to stop the dynamic agent from running is to disable the system startup script. These are located here and can be removed.

UNIX: 

rc0 . d / K01tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc1 . d / K01tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc2 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc3 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc4 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc5 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc6 . d / K01tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 



AIX: 

rc2 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc3 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc5 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc4 . d / S99tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 

rc6 . d / K01tebctl - tws_cpa_agent_ * 



Windows: 

This is a service called "IBM Common Platform Agent: tws_cpa_agent_ *"

Right-click, select Properties, then set "Disable" under "Startup type".

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The above steps will prevent the agent processes (JobManager and "agent ") from starting again upon reboot. If you want to stop them during the current session, you can run ShutDownLwa from the TWSHome .

The definitions for the agents will still show in conman and "Monitor Workstations". If you want to prevent these from showing, you can delete the Dynamic Agent definitions using DWC or composer.
