APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating a new datasource from the Analytics application,
   it leaves
   open 16 connections in IP version 6 SSH and they do not close
   until
   restart the Analytics application.
   
   When performing the creation of a Datasource remotely by
   Analytic GUI
   this must create an ssh connection for each Datasource created
   but this
   generates 11 IP v6 connections, after finish the configuration
   of the
   Datasource these 11 connections remains open and they only close
   if
   the Analytic is restarted.
   
   The problem occurs every time you want to add a new Datasource,
   the
   system works, but saturates the server, which impacts
   performance and
   it is not feasible to restart the server every new configuration
   and
   interrupt the service in order to establish a new datasource.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You have to restart the Server to drop the Connections
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   connection
