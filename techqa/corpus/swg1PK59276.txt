APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Messages seen in LOCKED state on a destination, after a
   JMS send failed with a SIMPLimitedExceededException
   within a transacted MDB.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the messaging engine with the queue point for the
   destination.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the default messaging provider for  *
   *                 WebSphere Application Server V6.1            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If a failure to send a JMS message      *
   *                      occurs within a transaction, and the    *
   *                      application is connected via a          *
   *                      network to a messaging engine,          *
   *                      the transaction remains in-doubt        *
   *                      within the messaging engine.            *
   *                      The transaction is not resolved until   *
   *                      the messaging engine is next            *
   *                      restarted.                              *
   *                      This may result in messages             *
   *                      remaining in LOCKED state on            *
   *                      destinations (if those messages were    *
   *                      consumed in the same transaction as     *
   *                      a send that failed) or a build-up       *
   *                      of state information associated         *
   *                      with transactions.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A transaction can contain multiple service integration bus
   actions, such as consuming and sending messages.
   A typical example is a message driven bean, which processes a
   request and sends a response. Both the consume of the request
   message and the send of the response message are contained in
   the same transaction.
   Another example is an application which sends multiple
   messages within a single transaction.
   
   When an application is connected via a network to a messaging
   engine, a failure to perform a JMS send (in a transaction) is
   not reported until an attempt is made to complete the
   transaction - at the 'prepare' action of a two-phase commit,
   or the 'commit' action of a one-phase commit.
   
   The problem was that although the failure to perform the
   send was reported to the transaction manager (using an
   XA_RBOTHER exception code), the other JMS actions
   contained in the transaction were not rolled back.
   
   As the transaction manager had been informed all JMS actions
   were rolled back (the XA_RBOTHER return code), it made no
   further attempt to rollback the transaction and messages
   remained in an in-doubt state in the messaging engine.
   In cases where a message is consumed within the transaction
   containing the failing send, messages will be seen in the
   administrative console to be stuck in LOCKED state until
   the messaging engine is restarted.
   However, internal state data associated with transactions
   may build up due to this issue without observing LOCKED
   messages (if transactions contain only send calls).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR resolves the issue, and ensures that all JMS actions
   are rolled back when a failure to send a message is reported
   to the transaction manager at prepare/commit stage.
