ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM DataPower Appliance
   
   
   ITCAM for SOA displays TEP values of "-1" and transaction ending
   times into the future
   
   In error or fault situations such as backend connection errors,
   DataPower can supply an erroneous, large value for the
   transaction elapsed time for ITCAM SOA data collection.
   Symptoms for the problem include display of the elapsed time as
   -1 in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal and log data for faults
   accumulating in the KD4/CACHE directory for the ITCAM SOA
   data collector.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ITCAM server cache/logs can be cleaned out every few days as a
   work around
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Corrected back latency provided to ITCAM SOA when backend
   connection fails or other faults occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix will be in 3.7.2.14, 3.7.3.13, 3.8.0.7, 3.8.1.5 &
   3.8.2.0
