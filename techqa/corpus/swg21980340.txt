PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CLP Plus shortcut does not work. 

CAUSE
IBM Data Server Runtime Client does not include JRE/JDK which is needed by CLP Plus. This was done to keep footprint of installation small.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If your system has an existing installation of DB2 then set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of the JRE/JDK.


Windows:
Create new System Environment variable (Control 
Panel->System->Advanced Tab->environment variables) below to point to an
existing JRE/JDK. 

JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\IBM\SQLLIB\java\jdk"

This example assumes it is from another DB2 installation, but your system may differ. It may be an Oracle JDK located somewhere else.


OR 

Use IBM Data Server Client which includes an IBM JRE/JDK.
