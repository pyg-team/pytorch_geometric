Text:
Connection Manager; Failover Arbitrator disabled TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does onstat -g cmsm shows message : Failover Arbitrator: Failover is disabled ? 

CAUSE
Missing sysadmin database

ANSWER
After starting connection manager see below message in onstat -g cmsm 

 Failover Arbitrator: Failover is disabled 


Unified Connection Manager: mySampleCM Hostname: minos

CLUSTER pri_root_cluster LOCAL
SLA Connections Service/Protocol Rule
sla1_prim_cm1 0 5115/onsoctcp DBSERVERS=primary
sla2_sec_cm1 0 5116/onsoctcp DBSERVERS=HDR,primary

Failover Arbitrator: Failover is disabled
ORDER=HDR TIMEOUT=0 RETRY=1 PRIORITY=0

Looking at the connection manager log see below message:

Cluster pri_root_cluster Arbitrator FOC string = ORDER=ENABLED TIMEOUT=10 RETRY=5
FOC TIMEOUT = 10
FOC RETRY = 5
The server type of cluster pri_root_cluster server sec_root is HDR.
Connection Manager successfully connected to sec_root
FOC converted from 'DISABLED' to 'ORDER=DISABLED TIMEOUT=0 RETRY=1'
Error: Arbitrator requires sysadmin database for failover but cannot find sysadmin in pri_root
Error: FOC: Failover Arbitrator disabled.
Connection Manager started successfully

If $INFORMIXDIR/etc/sysadmin/stop file exists, remove it and restart the server. 
Make sure sysadmin database is created. After sysadmin database is created successfully restart the connection manager. You should see below in connection manager log :

Listener sla1_prim_cm1 DBSERVERS=primary is active with 4 worker threads
Connection Manager successfully connected to pri_root
The server type of cluster pri_root_cluster server pri_root is Primary.
Cluster pri_root_cluster Arbitrator FOC string = ORDER=ENABLED TIMEOUT=10 RETRY=5
FOC TIMEOUT = 10
FOC RETRY = 5
The server type of cluster pri_root_cluster server sec_root is HDR.
Connection Manager successfully connected to sec_root
Connection Manager started successfully
CM mySampleCM arbitrator for pri_root_cluster is active

Also onstat -g cmsm should show :

onstat -g cmsm
