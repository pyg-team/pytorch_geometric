Title: IBM TIP Changing LDAP password fails for non-administrator users - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to change LDAP password for Non-administrator users in Tivoli Integrated Portal 

SYMPTOM
We have a issue with changing an LDAP password via TIP. It only works for users with an 'administrator' role assigned. All other users get the notification 'Password changed successfully', but the password does not get changed in LDAP. Users still need to use their old password to login. 

 
While changing the password for non-administrator users, an error appears in
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log.

[11/26/13 16:19:42:849 CET] 00027c28 SystemErr R com.ibm.websphere.wim.security.authz.AuthSystemException: CWWIM2003E An error occurred while performing an access verification for the 'user:SSORealm/uid=hema_demo,ou=Users,o=ServiceviewLDAP' principal. 

When changing the password for an administrator user, this error does not appear and the password gets changed correctly.


CAUSE
Multiple Argus files are introduced by TIP 2.2.0.9 fix pack by mistake and that caused this issue and even TIP 2.2.0.11 fix pack has not rectified this.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if you have multiple Argus files under $TIPHOME/plugins directory as below: 

 com.ibm.sec.authz.ibmsecauthz_7.0.jar and com.ibm.sec.authz.ibmsecauthz_7.3.1.jar 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The 7.3.1 version of Argus file is not required and hence remove the "com.ibm.sec.authz.ibmsecauthz_7.3.1.jar" file and restart the TIP server for the changes to take effect.
