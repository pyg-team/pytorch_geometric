Title: IBM Error: Failed to connect repository 'Passport Advantage' when using the -connectPassportAdvantage option - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You use the listAvailablePackages command from either the IBM Installation Manager command line, IMCL, or the IBM Packaging Utility command line, PUCL. The -connectPassportAdvantage option fails to connect to the IBM Passport Advantage repository. 

SYMPTOM
You run a listAvailablePackage command that includes the -connectPassportAdvantage option: 

 * imcl listAvailablePackages -connectPassportAdvantage [ -secureStorageFile storage_file -masterPasswordFile master_password_file | -keyring keyring_file [ -password password ] ] 
 * pucl listAvailablePackages -connectPassportAdvantage [ -secureStorageFile storage_file -masterPasswordFile master_password_file | -keyring keyring_file [ -password password ] ] 
 * pucl listAvailablePackages -connectPassportAdvantage -prompt


You receive the warning message: CRIMC1011W WARNING: The following repositories are not connected:
WARNING: Failed to connect repository 'Passport Advantage' either because the repository does not exist, the repository is closed or the repository server can not be reached.


CAUSE
An error in versions 1.5.2 to 1.6.2 causes a failure to occur when connecting to the Passport Advantage repository. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 


WORKAROUND:
To work around this issue in command-line mode, replace the -connectPassportAdvantage option with this option: 

-repositories https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled 

Examples of the listAvailablePackages command using the -repositories option: 

 * imcl listAvailablePackages -repositories https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled [ -secureStorageFile storage_file -masterPasswordFile master_password_file | -keyring keyring_file [ -password password ] ] 
 * pucl listAvailablePackages -repositories https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled [ -secureStorageFile storage_file -masterPasswordFile master_password_file | -keyring keyring_file [ -password password ] ] 
 * pucl listAvailablePackages -repositories https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled -prompt 


Another workaround is to use Installation Manager or Packaging Utility in wizard mode, GUI, or console mode to connect to Passport Advantage. 
Note: Starting in version 1.6.2, the -keyring and -password options that are used to store credentials to a key ring file are deprecated. Use the -secureStorageFile and -masterPasswordFile options to store credentials to a credential file. For more information, see Migrate from key ring files to storage files [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/m_credentials.html]. For versions 1.6.1 and earlier, you must use the -keyring option. For more information, see Storing credentials in a key ring file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.commandline.doc/topics/t_imcl_store_credentials.html#t_keyring].
