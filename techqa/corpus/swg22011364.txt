VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2018-1323 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1323]
Description: Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of HTTP request paths in jk_isapi_plugin.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the reverse proxy to expose application resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140213 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140213] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2018-1305 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305]
Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraints that are defined by annotations of Servlets in certain cases. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2018-1304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304]
Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraint definitions that contain a URL pattern of "" (the empty string) that exactly maps to the context root. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-15706 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15706]
Description: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the incorrect documentation of the CGI search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The error resulted in the failure of some scripts to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVEID: CVE-2017-12617 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12617]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to an error when running on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload a JSP file and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
