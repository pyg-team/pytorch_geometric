PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My current scan status shows that a scan is running even though I am not currently running a scan. How do I reset my scan status? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This most likely occurred because a DLP scan was abruptly aborted in the middle of scanning. Use Task 24: Update Scan Status to reset your scan status.
