ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:  APM
   APM version:  8.1.3
   Severity: 2
   Problem Description: After applying v8.1.3 server patch IF05,
   any applications that include synthetic transactions and using a
    space or plus sign in the application name cannot display the
   Application Status Overview in the APM UI. The frame looks
   blank. Only applications that include Synthetic transactions are
    affected.  Any other applications with space or plus in the
   application name that do not include synthetic transactions will
    display properly.  Some fixes to encoding and decoding of
   messages between two internal UI components (ITportal and APMUI)
    were not delivered with server patch IF05.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure: Create a synthetic application
   with space or plus sign in the application name prior to
   applying IF05.  After applying IF05, the applications will not
   display any widgets or data in the Application's Status Overview
   tab in the APM UI.

   synthetic transactions.
