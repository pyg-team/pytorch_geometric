APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users use 'Search Sitemap portlet' to export sitemap.xml for
   their Portal. The sitemap.xml is exported successfully, but the
   sitemap.xml file does not contain any URLs.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users use 'Search Sitemap portlet' to export sitemap.xml for
   their Portal. The sitemap.xml is exported successfully, but the
   sitemap.xml file does not contain any URLs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code changes are in CF13, but the customer must run the
   action-deploy-portlets-wp.ap.sitemap task to deploy the
   changes to profile.
   In addition, the task will automatically run in CF14.
   So if the customer applies CF14 there are no manual tasks.
