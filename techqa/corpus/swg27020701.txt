Title: IBM Using a CCDT file to connect to WebSphere MQ multi-instance queue managers from WebSphere Application Server - United States

Text:
 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this technical document is to describe in detail how to exploit from the WebSphere Application Server the connection to Multi-Instance Queue Managers in MQ, by using an MQ "Client Channel Definition Table" (CCDT). 

The MQ 7.0.1 JMS client introduced also the feature "automatic client reconnection", which is used on JMS standalone applications, but it is not used when running a JMS application within an application server. Instead, the automatic retry mechanisms for Listener Ports and Activation Specifications are used.

One way to configure the WebSphere Application Server to work with multi-instance queue managers is by using an MQ "Client Channel Definition Table" (CCDT).

Note: XA is not supported during automatic client reconnect 

CONTENT
The chapters of this document are:


Chapter 1: Prerequisites (Sample MDB, userid with proper authority, CCDT file)
Chapter 2: Creating a Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT)
Chapter 3: Defining a Connection Factory that uses the CCDT
Chapter 4: Switchover testing of the Sample MDB - Listener Port 

 *  Test 1: Messages are passed to the MDB, from host-1 "veracruz" 
 *  Test 2: Doing a switchover of the Queue Manager from host-1 "veracruz" to host-2 "cbeech" 
 *  Test 3: MDB gets message that is put into the other instance of the queue manager (host-2 "cbeech")

Chapter 5: Switchover testing of the Sample MDB - Activation Specification  *  Similar steps as in Chapter 4

Chapter 6: Troubleshooting
