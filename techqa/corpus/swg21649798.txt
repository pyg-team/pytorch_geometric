 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a way to Export the Scan Results (Detailed Security Issues) into XML format in IBM Security AppScan Enterprise? 

ANSWER
The answer to the question is 'no'. 
In AppScan Enterprise Console, there are functions, Export to XML and Export detailed Security issues to PDF, but there is no function Export detailed Security issues to XML. 

We strongly suggest to submit an enhancement request (RFE) for the AppScan Enterprise products as described in How to submit enhancement requests for IBM Security products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682719]. The requests there are submitted directly to the AppScan management team.
