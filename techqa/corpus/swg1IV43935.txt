APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using TWS 8.6.0.02 and DWC 8.6.0.02 when using an Alternate
   Plan, if you select Job -> More Options -> Properties the
   following error is returned:
   .
     AWSUI0833E The operation could not be completed. There has
     been a communication failure.
     The internal message is: AWSJSY101E The Symphony plan
     operation "readFromScribner" could not be completed because
     the requested Symphony plan object was not found.
     The internal error message is: "AWSBIO027E The object
     "TWD90016" could not be found.".
   .
   Also, from conman:
   .
     $ conman "set 1 & sj mdm00_da00#0AAAAAAAAAAAABBS;schedid;props
     "
   .
   Fails with:
   .
     AWSJCL017W No objects have been found that match the criteria
     in the command
   .
   Problem seen on both 64bit Linux and64bit Windows platforms.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  During comunication between conman and MDM, and TDWC and MDM,
   the plan name is always sent as "null".
   This means that the joblog is alway searched in the current
   plan.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The APAR will be fixed in:
   TWS + TDWC 86 FP3 (note: to have the TDWC scenario fixed, the
   FP3 on both components must be applied)
   TWS+ TDWC 9.1 FP1 (note: to have the TDWC scenario fixed, the
   FP1 on both components must be applied)
