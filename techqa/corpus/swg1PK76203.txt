ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When launching an Application Client configuration from  Rationa
   l Application Developer or Rational Software Architect for WebSp
   here 7 or 7.5, targeting WebSphere Application Server v. 6.1 or
   7, you may get a NullPointerException in an OSGI BundleLoader me
   thod, even if the same Application Client can be launched succes
   fully using the launchClient.bat batch file provided by WebSpher
   e Application Server. This only occurs when the Application Clie
   nt launches a multithreaded application, and typically happens i
   f you are invoking a framework such as JUnit or Swing.
    You see errors like the following in the Console:
   
   WSCL0014I: Invoking the Application Client class com.ibm.support
   .Main

   Workarounds:
   
   A. Make the main thread wait for termination of all other user t
   hreads.
   B. Launch the Application Client using launchClient.bat, provide
   d that you have already upgraded WebSphere Application Server v6
   .1 to version 6.1.0.9 or higher.
   C. Use the VM Argument-Dosgi.noShutdown=true in the Application
   Client launch configuration, Arguments tab and make sure that yo
   ur application invokes System.exit.
