ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   
   When a document is opened using Requisite Pro 2003.06.13,
   multiple users are unable to access the same document, although
   it should be possible for many users to have the document open
   in read-only mode, regardless of how the document is initially
   opened.
   
   Scenario:
   Requisite Pro users should be able to open the same project, and
   the same document with one user having Open to edit access and
   others having Read Only access.
   
   After applying SR3 one user can successfully open a project and
   a document, either read only or with full ability to edit the
   document.  When a second user accesses the same project, then
   the same document, a combination of messages is displayed. One
   is that document is open and would the user like to open it
   read-only (regardless of whether the user who initially opens
   the document is editing or in read-only).  This can be followed
   by a second message that says ? Problem: Document file <full
   path to the document> is not available for read/write access,
   and will not be opened?.  The user is given an OK to select, and
   upon selecting, the message goes away and Word closes.  In
   another variation of the testing only the second message is
   displayed before Word closes.
   
   Information:
   
   User is using Requisite Pro 2003.06.13, Word 2002, Windows 2000,
   and Sql Server 2000 or MS Access backend.  This has been tested
   with a basic Access project, created from a Composite Template,
   with Project security on and off, with no change in behavior.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   Scenario 1 ? First user opens document to edit
   
   1. Open Requisite Pro 2003.06.13.
   2. Create a new Access project (testing was with the Composite
   Template).
   3. Once Project opens, Open the Requirements Management Plan
   document for editing.
   4. Leave project and document open.
   
   There should be no messaging at this point as all works.
   
   5. On another workstation using Requisite Pro 2003.06.13, open
   Requisite Pro.
   6. Open the Project from above on this second workstation.
   Project should open correctly.
   7. Open the Requirements Management Plan document by right
   clicking on the document within the ReqPro explorer window, and
   selecting Open Read Only.
   
   
   8. Word will start to open. User will receive a message ?
   Problem: Document file <full path to the document> is not
   available for read/write access, and will not be opened?.
   
   
   9. Select OK from the message, message closes, and then Word
   closes.
   10. Open the Requirements Management Plan document by right
   clicking on the document with the ReqPro explorer window, and
   selecting Open.
   
   
   11. Word will start to open.  User will receive a message that
   ?The document<full path to the document> is opened by Microsoft
   Word user : <user name>. Do you want it opened Read only??
   Options are Yes or No.
   
   
   12. Select Yes. User will receive a message ? Problem: Document
   file <full path to the document> is not available for read/write
   access, and will not be opened?.
   
   
   13.   Select OK from the message, message closes, and then Word
   closes.
   14. If No selected instead, message is cleared and Word closes.
   
   End result is that only one user can have the document open
   whether read only or open to edit.
   
   Scenario 2 ? First User opens document Read Only
   
   1. Open Requisite Pro 2003.06.13.
   2. Open the Access project created above.
   3. Once Project opens, Open the Requirements Management Plan
   document Read Only.
   4. Leave project and document open.
   
   There should be no messaging at this point as all works.
   
   5. On another workstation using Requisite Pro 2003.06.13, open
   Requisite Pro.
   6. Open the Project from above on this second workstation.
   Project should open correctly.
   7. Open the Requirements Management Plan document by right
   clicking on the document within the ReqPro explorer window, and
   selecting Open Read Only.
   8. Word will start to open. User will receive a message ?
   Problem: Document file <full path to the document> is not
   available for read/write access, and will not be opened?.
   9. Select OK from the message, message closes, and then Word
   closes.
   10. Open the Requirements Management Plan document by right
   clicking on the document with the ReqPro explorer window, and
   selecting Open.
   11. Word will start to open.  User will receive a message that
   ?The document<full path to the document> is opened by Microsoft
   Word user : <user name>. Do you want it opened Read only?.?
   Options are Yes or No.
   12. Select Yes. User will receive a message ? Problem: Document
   file <full path to the document> is not available for read/write
   access, and will not be opened?.
   13.   Select OK from the message, message closes, and then Word
   closes.
   14. Select No, message is cleared and Word closes.
