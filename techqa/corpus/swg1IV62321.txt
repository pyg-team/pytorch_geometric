APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Views cannot be created with orthogonal topoloy. Rather they
   must be created with the default topology and then amended
   afterward, by visualising the view (with the incorrect
   topology), changing the topology, and saving the view.
   
   Replicated locally: yes
   
   List the replication steps:
   
   1) Create a filtered test view and stipulate
   "Orthogonal" for the layout.
   
   2) When opening the view notice that the layout does
   not appear to be Orthogonal, but more of an
   Orthogonal/Symmetrical hybrid.
   
   3) Change the layout from within the toolbar of the
   new view to another layout (I used Symmetric). Then,
   change the toolbar view back to Orthogonal and the
   now appears as it should.
   
   4) Click the "Save" icon to save the layout
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workaround suggested in steps 3 and 4 get reverted when a
   new discovery completes.  At that point steps 3 and 4 are
   required again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * ITNM 3.9 and 4.x end users with Oracle JRE 1.7.x installed   *
   * will see varying issues                                      *
   * with saving views.                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * With Oracle JRE 1.7.x installed varying issues have been     *
   * noted as follows:                                            *
   * (1) Network Views cannot be created with the Orthogonal      *
   * layout (topology).                                           *
   * OR                                                           *
   * (2) Network Views can be created with an Orthogonal layout   *
   * but when changes are made to the view (e.g. after            *
   * rediscovery) the layout is lost/scrambled, and the           *
   * Orthogonal layout must be selected and the view saved to     *
   * return it to the correct layout.                             *
   * OR                                                           *
   * (3) Network Views created in another topology cannot be them *
   * changed to Orthogonal layout (layout change to orthogonal is *
   * processed and displayed, but the "save" fails to make these  *
   * changes permanent.                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * We recommend that 3.9 and 4.x customers upgrade their        *
   * end-user Oracle JRE to latest version as per Additional      *
   * Problem Summary Comments.                                    *
   * The Oracle and Tom Sawyer components whose interaction is    *
   * the source of the problem will be replaced in ITNM 4.2.      *
   ****************************************************************
   This is a 3rd party issue caused by the interaction of the third
   party Tom Sawyer product (used by ITNM to visualise network
   views) and the Oracle JRE 1.7.x (running on the end-users
   workstation).
   
   It is unlikely that a fix will be delivered by either vendor for
   this issue.
   
   We note that the behavior is worse for Oracle JRE 1.7.x where
   the minor release is .45 or previous. With later versions of the
   Oracle JRE (.51 and later) the orthogonal view can typically be
   created, switched to, and saved, and the nodes remain in the
   correct topology after  rediscovery. However the links between
   the nodes change from straight lines to curved ones.
   Re-selecting the orthogonal layout and saving circumvents the
   issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in ITNM 4.2
