Text:
RN1.5.1; RN1.5.2 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive the following error when installing IBM Packaging Utility on z/OS:

"ERROR: The location specified /u/imadmin cannot be used for shared resources because the location contains files. Select a new directory or delete all files in the current directory." 

CAUSE
This issue occurs when you install Packaging Utility in group mode on z/OS and the shared resources directory for Installation Manager is not set. The default value for the shared resources directory is set incorrectly to $HOME.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, perform one of the following options: 

 * Install Packaging Utility without using group mode.

 * Install Installation Manager in group mode. Then install Packaging Utility by using the instance of Installation Manager that is running in group mode. If Packaging Utility is the first package installed, use the -sharedResourcesDirectory option when installing Packaging Utility.
