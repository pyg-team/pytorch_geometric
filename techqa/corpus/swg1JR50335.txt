ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a failed process instance is resumed, its tasks show up
   in the Process Portal Work list but are missing from the Team
   Tasks list in the Team Performance dashboard.
   .
   The scenario is described as below.
   
   0. Manager A1 is from Manager Team A, and user B1 is from User
   Team B.
   1. Initialize a process instance and assign it to user Team B.
   2. User B1 claims the task
   3. A1 logins to BPM portal and checks the Team Performance
   dashboard. In the tab Team Task, task is listed and belongs to
   B1.
   4. B1 works on his task, but some error occurs that make the
   process failed
   5. A1 also finds the task has disappeared from the team task
   list.
   6. Administrator C fixes the error and resumes the failed
   instance.
   7. B1 continues working on his task, but does not finish it (not
   moving it to next stage).
   8. A1 still can't find the task in the team task list.
   9.a B1 finishes the task and moves to the next stage. Then A1
   can find the task in the team task list.
   9.b B1 reassigns the task to the someone else. Then A1 can find
   the task in the team task list.
   
   The issue is that the task is still missing in the team task
   list, even though it has been resumed and someone has worked on
   it.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   Performance dashboard because an instance event is not fired
   when the instance is  resumed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 is available that fixes the missing
   task issue in the Team Performance dashboard by correctly firing
    a monitor event for a resumed instance.
