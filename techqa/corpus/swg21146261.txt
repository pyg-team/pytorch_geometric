GLOSSARY: 

Definition of features not included in ClearCase LT. 

 * Dynamic Views: The MVFS is not included with ClearCase LT; hence all related features associated with the MVFS are not included. 
 * Detailed build auditing: No configuration records are created in ClearCase LT. 
 * Binary Sharing: Only snapshot views are used, thus view sharing is not possible with ClearCase LT. 
 * Build dependency automation: All related libraries that integrate with the MVFS to create derived objects are removed along with all associated cleartool subcommands and GUIs. 
 * Distributed Builds (UNIX, z/OS): Clearmake build tool not included in ClearCase LT. 
 * Distributed servers: Only one ClearCase LT server is used to host VOBs and Views for its clients. All processes run on the server - no distributed load. Unable to use Pool Mappings (host VOB storage pools on different servers). 
 * Repository/database replication and synchronization: MultiSite add-on can not be integrated with ClearCase LT.


Additional differences: 

 * Limited platform choices for ClearCase LT. 
 * Only CCFS can be used as the interop solution between Windows® and UNIX®. 
 * Only a single ClearCase region may be implemented for Windows and UNIX. 
 * ClearCase LT only supports having one UCM Project VOB.


Guidelines for CCLT and ClearCase interoperation: 

 * ClearCase and ClearCase LT cannot be installed on the same host.
   
 * ClearCase cannot be installed over ClearCase LT. You must uninstall ClearCase LT completely and then install ClearCase; however, ClearCase LT can be upgraded to ClearCase following the upgrade instructions in the Installation Guide.
   
 * A ClearCase LT client cannot access a ClearCase server
   
   Note: A ClearCase LT client can access an upgraded ClearCase LT server (to ClearCase) as long as it can acquire a ClearCase license from that server. If the ClearCase server was not upgraded from CCLT, the CCLT client cannot access the server. Please note that the CCLT client cannot take advantage of full ClearCase features until the client has been upgraded.
   
 * A ClearCase client cannot access a ClearCase LT server
