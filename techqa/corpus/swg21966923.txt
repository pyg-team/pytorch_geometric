ABSTRACT
 IBM ODM on Cloud is compatible with on-premises versions of IBM Operational Decision Manager. 

CONTENT
You can work with decision services outside ODM on Cloud, and still take advantage of the cloud environment.

Decision service artifacts (hybrid cloud) 
You deploy a decision service from ODM on Cloud to an on-premises instance of Operational Decision Manager. This approach works with the following ODM on Cloud releases and on-premises ODM versions: 

ODM on Cloud release On-premises ODM version 2017.10 8.9.1 2017.06 8.9.1 Note: There is no earlier release of ODM on Cloud currently in use. 

For information on using a hybrid cloud environment, see IBM ODM on Cloud in a hybrid cloud environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7J8H/com.ibm.odm.cloud.overview/topics/con_hybrid_cloud.html]. 

Decision service projects 
You import or export a decision service project from ODM on Cloud. This approach works with the following on-premises versions of Operational Decision Manager:  * 8.9.1 
 * 8.9.0 
 * 8.8.1 
 * 8.8.0 
 * 8.7.1


Limitations 
The following limitations apply to using ODM on Cloud and on-premises ODM together:  * The projects must go through the cloud version of Rule Designer. For example, you must import an on-premises project into the cloud Rule Designer to publish the project to the cloud environment. 
 * The cloud environment only supports the decision engine. If you have an on-premises project that is based on the classic rule engine, you must switch the project to the decision engine before you publish the project to the cloud environment.
