Title: IBM Unable to define Modeler Server definition or add a Modeler Stream - United States

Text:
can't cannot add jobstep mod serv definition TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installation of C&DS 6.0 and Modeler Adapters 16.0, end-user is unable to add a Modeler Stream (job-step) to a C&DS job. End-user is also unable to define a Modeler Server in the Content Repository > Server Definition list. 

SYMPTOM
When using Deployment Manager 6.0 (thick client) and a C&DS job is currently open, right-clicking on a Modeler Stream stored in the repository does not allow the end-user to select 'Add to job'.

When clicking and dragging the Modeler Stream to the open C&DS job, it does not paste the stream job-step.

In the Resource Definitions > Servers section of C&DS, creating a new Server Definition does not allow the end-user to select 'Modeler Server' as an option.



CAUSE
Root cause for this problem is that the Modeler Adapters were installed into the wrong C&DS package location. Environment had the following C&DS packages installed on the same server:
* IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services;
* IBM SPSS Remote Process Server;
* IBM SPSS Scoring Server

The IBM SPSS Modeler Adapter package was installed under 'IBM SPSS Scoring Server' instead of 'IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services'.


ENVIRONMENT
This can occur on all platform where IBM SPSS C&DS is supported on.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
* Checked 'engine.log' from the <C&DS_Install>\6.0\Server\log folder. Found no entries of 'Modeler';
* Checked the PEM Updates page from http://<host>:<port>/pem/update. Found no entries for 'com.spss.mgmt.modeler.feature';

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using IBM Installation Manager, uninstalled the Modeler Adapter packages from IBM SPSS Scoring Server and re-installed into IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services.
Restarting the C&DS service and updating Deployment Manager (thick client), end-user is now able to add Modeler Streams to C&DS jobs and define Modeler Server definitions.
