PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Liberty - ORB and JNDI               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Transmitting strings containing null    *
   *                      characters over IIOP fails with         *
   *                      org.omg.CORBA.portable.UnknownException *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Yoko ORB used in Liberty explicitly checks for and disallows
   null characters in CORBA wstrings when using GIOP 1.2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The check for a null character is a strict interpretation of the
   specification and is not necessary. The problem is resolved by
   the removal of this check.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in fix pack 17.0.0.3.  Please
   refer to the Recommended Updates page for delivery information:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  A possible workaround is to avoid using the null character in
   strings.
