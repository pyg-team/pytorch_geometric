"DefaultParentNotFoundException: CWWIM0516E The default parent for 'PersonAccount' entity type cannot be determined. Verify that the configuration for the 'TIPRealm' realm is correct." 

SYMPTOM

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This error will be output to STDOUT on install failure:




GYMVC0001E: Error occurred: 
com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingException:com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingEx
ception: com.ibm.websphere.wim. 
exception.DefaultParentNotFoundException: com.ibm.websphere.wim. 
exception.DefaultParentNotFoundException: CWWIM0516E The default parent 
for 'Group' entity type cannot be determined. Verify that the 
configuration for the 'TIPRealm' realm is correct. 

To check WebSphere Global Security: 

Login to TIP console using admin account (typically tipadmin or equivalent). 
1. Launch "Websphere Administration Console" by clicking on Settings->Websphere Administration Console. 
2. In new page (or tab) click on "Global Security" in the left pan. 
3. In the right pan click on Configure (next to "Available realm definitions" drop down box). 
4. In "Repositories in the realm" table, note down the Base Entry for InternalFileRepository (by default its typically "o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm"). 
5. Click on "Supported entity types" link at the bottom of the page. 
6. In the Supported Entities page check if "Base Entry for the Default Parent" column is same as Base Entry for all entity types found in step 5. If not then follow steps in below section. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the "Base Entry for the Default Parent" column is not same as Base Entry (noted in step 6 above) then click on Entity Type: Group, OrgContainer , and PersonAccount and change "Base Entry for the default parent" to Base Entry noted in step 6 ( o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm )
