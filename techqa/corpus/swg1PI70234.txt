PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Liberty - Web Services (JAX-WS) that *
   *                  add custom SOAP Headers with a Handler      *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   All SOAP Headers are removed by Apache CXF when using a Handler
   to add user defined (custom) SOAP Headers to outbound requests.
   This was fix in the newer versions of Apache CXF, but not in the
   version that ships with Liberty. This APAR resolves this
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Apache CXF code was modified, and the problem resolved.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 17.0.0.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
