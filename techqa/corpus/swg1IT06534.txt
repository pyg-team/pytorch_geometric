APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying the GPFS server using a browser set for a Unicode
   encoding the server fails to deploy with this error on
   createPrimaryNodesFileSystem : 'ascii' codec can't decode byte
   0xe3 in position 1258: ordinal not in range(128).
   
   This happens when the GPFS pattern is trying to map LUN ids with
   device names and when trying to check if the file system was
   created. In both cases the returned string contains Unicode (
   is in UTF-8 format ) and the string match fails because python
   has by default encoding set to ASCII.
   
   This fix is to encode the strings to ASCII and ignore Unicode
   characters
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use ASCII encoding in the browser when deploying a GPFS
   client or server instance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This error occurred because by default python scripts use ASCII
   encoding and the browsers were sending Unicode characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided to parse parameters into ASCII
   values in the GPFS Pattern Type version 1.2.0.2 released with
   PureApplication System version 2.0.0.1 interim fix 2 and the
   GPFS Pattern Type version 1.2.1.0 released with PureApplication
   System version 2.1.0.0.
