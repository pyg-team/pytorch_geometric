Text:
PUBSUB; MQ; WMB; DNIM5050E; 2551; content-based filtering TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When WBIFN 3.11 runs with Message Broker V7 or Message Broker V8 commands which result in an MQ subscription, like e.g. registrations in the DNI_MONITOR service, may end with MQRC 2551.


SYMPTOM
The following message will be displayed in the WBIFN event log: 

DNIM5050E 3/10/14 11:06:01 AM SYSOU DNI_MONITOR Internal error while processing request message; reason code '2551'. 


CAUSE
content-based filtering is not enabled


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

As WBIFN uses content based filtering, please check, whether content-based filtering is enabled for exactly one execution group in the broker. 
To check, whether content-based filtering is enabled, run the mqsireportproperties command (Job BIPRPPR for z/OS).



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

If you find, that content based filtering is not enabled, run mqsichangeproperties (Job BIPCHPR) to enable it for exactly one execution group of the Message broker (no matter, which).
For a detailed description how to enable content-based filtering, please refer to WBIFN 'Planning, Installation and Customization Guide', Section 'Enable content-based filtering'.
