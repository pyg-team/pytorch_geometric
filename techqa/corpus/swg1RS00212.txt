ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The default Decision Warehouse needs a db datasource. Often for
   customer using RES with file persistence, it is not obvious for
   them to know that they need to setup a separate db datasource
   for DW. Therefore, when db is not available, if customer click
   on the Decision Warehouse from RES console, it throws the
   following exception from the Console:
   
   description The server encountered an internal error () that
   prevented it from fulfilling this request.
   
   exception
   
   javax.servlet.ServletException:
   javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: Cannot get value for
   expression '#{bam.timeZoneStr}'
    javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet.service(FacesServlet.java:154)
    ilog.rules.res.console.jsf.RequestFilter.doFilter(RequestFilter
   .java:243)
   
   
   root cause
   
   javax.faces.FacesException: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException:
   Cannot get value for expression '#{bam.timeZoneStr}'
    org.apache.myfaces.context.servlet.ServletExternalContextImpl.d
   ispatch(ServletExternalContextImpl.java:425)
