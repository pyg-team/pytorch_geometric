PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Instructions for capturing RFC tracing in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB)?

RFC traces are used to track the remote calls of an application to a SAP System. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Launch the Adapter Connection Wizard in WMB/IIB Toolkit 
 2. Go to the 'Service Generation and Deployment Configuration' window. 
 3. In the SAP RFC trace configuration section:
    a. Set the RFCTraceOn property to 'true' 
    b. Set the RFC Trace Level property to '8'. This outputs verbose debug messages, full execution path, info messages, errors and warnings.
    c. Set the Folder for RFC trace files property to the directory location where the RFC Traces will be created.
