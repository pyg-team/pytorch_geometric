APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Execution Group can hang during Garbage Collection from
   within the Java Just In Time (JIT) Compiler.
   
   A thread stack dump of the EG process will show a hang stack of:
     walkJITFrameSlots()
     jitWalkFrame()
     jitWalkStackFrames()
     walkStackFrames()
   You will also see the library 'libj9jit24.so'.
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   IV58762 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV58762]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem can be avoided if the JIT-compiled method owning
   the stack frame can be identified. The method can be excluded
   from compilation with -Xjit:exclude={*method_name*}, to prevent
   the GC from hanging.
