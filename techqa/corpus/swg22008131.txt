 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the known issues, limitations and work-arounds for using IBM z/OS Debugger with COBOL v6.2? 

ANSWER
The following table lists the issues, limitations and available work-arounds for IBM z/OS Debugger with COBOL v6.2: 

Area Mode Type Description Work-Around Compile option All Limitation IBM z/OS Debugger does not support TEST(NOSOURCE) None. Debug command Debug Tool compatibility

Full-screen Issue When explicit debug mode is active and a user enters the LoadDebugData (LDD) command for the load module and compile unit, IBM z/OS Debugger does not find the side file for that compile unit. None. Breakpoints Debug Tool compatibility Issue When compiling with TEST(SEP), breakpoints set using AT STATEMENT may fail to restore. Reset the breakpoint after the debug sessions initiates??? Debug info All Limitation When compiling with TEST(SEPARATE|NOSEPARATE) and using EQADEBUG to specify the location for debug information, a user cannot specify a z/OS UNIX directory. None. 
Only a *.dbg file can be specified in z/OS UNIX. Debug Tool Compatibility

Full-screen Limitation For a COBOL V6.2 program compiled with TEST (SEPARATE), a user must specify the side file location. This is because the COBOL V6.2 compiler does not store the original location of the side file in the generated load module. Users can do this by specifying the EQADEBUG DD card, the SET DEFAULT LISTING command, the EQAUEDAT user exit, the SET SOURCE command or the EQA_DBG_SYSDEBUG environment variable. None.
This is a requirement for finding side files for a COBOL V6.2 program compiled with TEST(SEPARATE). Debug Tool Compatibility

Full-screen Limitation If the compile unit name does not match the member name for the side file, users must use the SET SOURCE command to specify the location of the side file. None.
This is a requirement for finding side files for a COBOL V6.2 program when the member name does not match. Stepping Debug Tool compatibility

Full-screen Issue After compiling with TEST(SEPARATE), an application may run to completion when performing a Step Over for CU at initialization. Use Step Into instead of Step Over. Listing Standard Issue When specifying EQASRCE or EQA_DBG_SRCE to specify alternate location for source, the source will be found but the name of the file in the debug editor shows the path to the location where the source was originally found. Ignore the name of the source in the debug editor. Visual Debug Standard Limitation Visual Debug does not work when the source view is used. None. 
Note:  * Debug Tool compatibility and standard modes are used during remote debugging. For more information on modes and remote debugging, see: Remote debug mode [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQ2R2_14.1.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/ugdita/cremote.html] 
 * For more information on full-screen mode see: Starting a full-screen debug session [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQ2R2_14.1.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/ugdita/tgststa.html]
