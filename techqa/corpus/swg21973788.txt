Text:
puredata password TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 At times the replacespu script will fail when the default password has been changed and not exported to root.

[root@nztest ~]# /nz/kit/bin/adm/tools/replacespu -id 1597
Logging to file /nz/var/log/replacespu/replacespu20141217174424.log

Logfile: /nz/var/log/replacespu/replacespu20141217174424.log.gz
ERROR: Unable to read spu information from nzhw
error connecting to database system
Password authentication failed for user 'ADMIN'


Check the password in bashrc as nz user:

vi ~/.bashrc


# -*-shell-script-*-
# Standard NPS .bashrc for linux
#

# Source global definitions
[ 1 -eq "$SHLVL" -a -f /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc

# For NPS
export NZ_USER=admin # Default NZ username
export NZ_PASSWORD=XxXxXxXx # Default NZ password
export NZ_DATABASE=system # Default NZ database


Copy the user and password lines to clipboard and issue as root user:

export NZ_USER=admin 
export NZ_PASSWORD=XxXxXxXx

The replace spu should run after this has been done.
