PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM InfoSphere Information Governance Catalog changed the way in which database stored procedures and design stored procedures are identified. As a result, in extension mapping documents, mappings that reference these assets as a source or as a target are ignored during import. Other mappings are imported correctly. 

SYMPTOM
No message is displayed to indicate that the stored procedure assets were not mapped.


CAUSE
The identity of stored procedures was changed in InfoSphere Metadata Workbench, version 9.1. 

Before version 9.1, the identity of stored procedure assets washost.database. 

In version 9.1, the identity of stored procedure assets became host.database.schema. 

Example

In version 9.1, the mapping row for a stored procedure in the CSV mapping document might be:



Name Source Columns Target Columns [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676444&amp;aid=1] SP.DB.SCMA.MySP SP.DB.SCMA.MySP 
Where: 

SP.DB.SCMA is the name of the host, the database, and the schema that form the identity of the stored procedure. 

MySP is the name of the stored procedure. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit the CSV mapping document and include the schema in the identity of every stored procedure.
