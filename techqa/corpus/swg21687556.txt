REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix Rational Change 5.2 None Upgrade to Rational Change Interim Fix 6 for 5.2.0.8 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038559] and see workaround for mitigation steps. Rational Change 5.3 None See workaround Rational Change 5.3.1 None See workaround WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Mitigation is to disable SSLv3 protocol following steps below. 


Change 5.2:
Once https is configured, add additional argument <Set name="SSLProtocol">TLS</Set> just after the line <Set name="KeyPassword"></Set> in jetty\etc\change.xml file.


Change 5.3:
Once https is configured, add additional argument <Set name="SSLProtocol">TLS</Set> just after the line <Set name="KeyPassword"></Set> in jetty\etc\jetty.xml file. 


Change 5.3.1:
Once https is configured, add additional argument <Set name="protocol">TLS</Set> just after the line <Set name="TrustStorePassword"></Set> in jetty\etc\jetty.xml file.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3.
