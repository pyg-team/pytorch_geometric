Title: IBM Rational Functional Tester unable to recognize object against VT100 emulation - United States

RFT FTE VT Object Recognition TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you do object recognition on VT100 terminal emulation in IBM Rational Functional Tester? 

ANSWER
Using VT sessions: 

 

With VT when you select a Verification Point, you get the entire screen and everything that you have entered at the time you select the point. Instead of using Drag Hand Selection from the Verification Point and Action wizard, select Test Object Browser. 

 

Then you get Test Objects listed. 

 

Because the VT screen is considered to exist as one single plane, it only has one Field (the entire screen). 

 

This entire field is the test object. 

 

The character is a property of the field (test object). 

There are characters on that screen and they have been identified with 

 

Character-level verification points 

Character-level verification points are supported through the Test Object Browser, but not the through the Object Finder. To get to the character level, bring up the Verification Point and Action wizard, select the Test Object Browser from the drop-down menu, and expand the objects as follows: 

 

From the Select Test Object pane, expand Frame, then SplitPane, then Terminal, then Screen. This displays a list of all the fields defined for the screen. Expand the field that contains the character you want to test. Fields are named Field_x_y, where x is the row containing the field, and y is the column. 

 

On VT100 (UNIX(R)) systems, there is only one field, Field_1_1, which contains each character on the screen. After expanding the field, select the character you want to test. Characters are named Char_x_y_z, where x and y are the same as the corresponding Field, and z is the character position within the field. The recognition properties of this character are shown in the Object Recognition Properties pane. The value of the char property is the character as it appears on the screen. 

 

Note: There is a flag in ivory.properties used by Functional Tester where the flag can be set to get the character based VP: 

# This below flag is basically used by FTE VT sessions to distinguish 
# whether they need Row based VPs or Character based VPs 
rational.test.ft.fte.playback.vt_row_vp=false
