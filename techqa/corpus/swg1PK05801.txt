APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deploying an EAR file via adminconsole, client is getting an
   ADMA8019E error. The application is verified successfully in
   WSAD or using a different tool and application is working fine.
   But adminconsole verification logic throws an error.
   
   ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope. Resources are within the
   deployment target scope if they are defined at the cell, node,
   server, or application level when the deployment target is a
   server, or at the cell, cluster, or application level when the
   deployment target is a cluster. Assign resources that are within
   the deployment target scope of the application or confirm that
   these resources assignments are correct as specified.
   Step 3 - Map resource references to resources resulted in the
   following resource warnings. If Application Resource Validation
   is set to fail, you will not be able to continue past.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  APAR is required to fix the code.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Websphere Application Server users who try   *
   *                 to map JDBC resources as part of application *
   *                 installation and configuration               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Even though the jdbc resources have     *
   *                      been configured correctly the warning   *
   *                      message ADMA8019E is shown.             *
   *                                                              *
   *                      ADMA8019E: The resources that are       *
   *                      assigned to the application are beyond  *
   *                      the deployment target scope.            *
   *                      Resources are within the deployment     *
   *                      target scope if they are defined at     *
   *                      the cell, node, server, or application  *
   *                      level when the deployment target is a   *
   *                      server, or at the cell, cluster,        *
   *                      or application level when the           *
   *                      deployment target is a cluster.         *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The validation logic checking the resource type was checking
   against the wrong resource type.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The validation logic has been changed to check the correct
   resource type.
