LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Added System.getProperty in constructor call of
   org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.OutputStream
      The exorbitant call is causing this performance degradation.
   WebSphere tests has found degradation of throughput by 9%.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.1 SR6
   .
   Call this property initially  and based on it set
   a private static final boolean variable.
   Use a check of that boolean variable on the constructor.
   There are performance changes which is causing current ( fixed)
   626SR6 orb performing better than 626SR5 ORB.
