   Level 3 Support has determined:
   
   The 1503 that we are receiving is a GOODBYE alert and we are
   not handling it correctly.  We only are checking for 150300
   (SSL v3) or 150301 (TLS v1.0) but in Sally's case they are
   sending us a 150303 (which is TLS v1.2).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TLS READ/WRITE errors after connection was disconnected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Buffer contained 1503xx alert that was not being properly
   checked for TLS v1.1 and v1.2.
