QUESTION
 Why are there duplicate tabs in the Service Requests application? 

ANSWER
For the affected user, please check the security groups that they belong to.
1. Go To -> Security -> Security Groups
2. Filter each of the security groups that the user belongs to and open the record.
3. In Application tab, filter for 'Service Request' application.
4. At the option section, filter for 'show desk'
5. You will see :-
(a) Show Desk Agent Expert View - This should be checked
(b) Show Desk Agent Simplified View - This should be unchecked.

You should only have 'Show Desk Agent Expert View' checked. By default, only security group SDADESKAGENT has 'Show Desk Agent Simplified View' checked.
