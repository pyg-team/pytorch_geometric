RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Framework Manager Installation


Download and Install Framework Manager the traditional way, but before you configure it for the first time you will need to replace the security policy jar files in the <FM Install path>\jre\lib\security folder or in the \jre\lib\security of your specified JAVA_HOME location with the unrestricted versions of them. These can be downloaded from the following locations:

Step 5: 

Save the configuration. Note that you will see a warning message about certificates: Click [Yes] to accept the trust. Note that the save will take some time to complete.

1. Download the ssl certificates and extract. 

2. Open a command window as Administrator. 

3. If you have not already set the JAVA_HOME variable you must do so now. To do so, execute the following command:

 * 


4. Change to the <Framework manager install>\bin directory 5. Execute the below commands 

 * 
 * 
 * o ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -i -T -r <path to certificate>\DigiCert-RootCA.cer -p NoPassWordSet 


6. Open Cognos Configuration, and save. You can now launch Framework Manager.
