APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An SDA Agent connected to either a HUB TEMS or a Remote TEMS
   (i.e. IP
   xx.xx.xx.03) that is a higher version than the
   agent currently SDA installing (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.00) at either
   the HUB
   or this local Remote TEMS, can be mistakenly rejected
   as not being needed for SDA install.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TEMS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SELF DESCRIBING AGENT (SDA)             *
   *                      INSTALLATION REJECTED.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   If a Self Describing Agent (SDA) connected to a monitoring
   server is a higher version (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.03) than
   another Self Describing Agent (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.00)
   currently being installed on the monitoring server, then
   Self Describing Agent currently being installed can be
   mistakenly rejected as not being needed because it is
   backlevel. Multiple versions of a Self Describing Agent are
   allowed to be installed on the same system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to properly install all unique
   versions.
