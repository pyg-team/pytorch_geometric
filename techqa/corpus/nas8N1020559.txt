 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects Power Hardware Management Console. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]

DESCRIPTION:The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6040 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6040]
DESCRIPTION: The GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper validation of input by the iconv() function when converting IBM933, IBM935, IBM937, IBM939 or IBM1364 encoded data to UTF-8. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95616 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95616] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7817 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7817]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error in the wordexp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
