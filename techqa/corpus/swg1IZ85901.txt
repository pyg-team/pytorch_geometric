LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the WPS installation was migrated from a version previous to
   6.1.2 to a version post 6.1.2 and there were business
   process instances running during migration then the activity
   details view of the BPC Explorer does not work
   correctly for activities contained in these migrated instances.
   In some cases assertion violation could be
   observed in the trace files. However only the BPC Explorer was
   affected these activities could be processed and
   completed normally.
