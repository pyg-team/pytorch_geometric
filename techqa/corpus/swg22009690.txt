QUESTION
 Why does an IBM DataStage data masking job fail to read an ODPP license key?

Error: Failed to open ODPP license key file for reading. Make sure that ODPP license files exist in the directory which is specified to ODPPLL environment variable. Or check read access for license key file. (CC_DMODPPV9Library::frameworkInit, file CC_DMODPPV9Library.cpp, line 183) 

CAUSE
The configuration of Optim Data Privacy Providers for IBM InfoSphere DataStage data masking, requires the generation of the license files and usually they are defaulted to the location (~/OptimHome/bin). Changing the location of the files could abrupt read access to the file.

ANSWER
Instead of defining a new license directory keep them in ~/ODPP/bin directory where you initially generated the files and then change the ODPPLL location to the bin directory.
