PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing IBM Stewardship Center on BPM 8.5.5 or 8.5.6, using install scripts, the values for the Exposed Process Variables (EPVs) are not set. 

CAUSE
This issue is due to the delay in restarting the BPM environment due to resource constraints in the environment. During the installation of the Stewardship center, the WebSphere Application Server on which BPM runs, is restarted. Occasionally, the restart takes a longer amount of time because the install script that sets the EPV values fail.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.5.5/8.5.6

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the EPV values for Stewardship center applications are not set, follow these steps.


1. Re-run the following targets 

 * run_set_epv_values_party_maintenance 
 * run_set_epv_values_physical_entity_resolution 
 * run_set_epv_values_virtual_entity_resoultion 
 * run_set_epv_values_hybrid_data_quality


2. The targets can be run using the following command  * Windows: InstallGovernanceApplication.bat <TargetName>
   e.g., InstallGovernanceApplication.bat run_set_epv_values_party_maintenance 
 * Linux/AIX: InstallGovernanceApplication.sh <TargetName>
   e.g., InstallGovernanceApplication.sh run_set_epv_values_party_maintenance
