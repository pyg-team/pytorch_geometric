C. Updating IBM Dynamic System Analysis 


Uninstalling the IBM Systems Director LSI plug-in 

There is an incompatibility between the newer releases of IBM Dynamic System Analysis and IBM Systems Director LSI plug-in because both products use the same LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Because the LSI plug-in is no longer supported on IBM Systems Director version 6.3.2 or later, the product can be removed from the system. 


1. Determine if the LSI plug-in is installed on the node by running the following command:  * 
 * rpm -qa | grep lsi_mr_hhr
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * lsi_mr_hhr-00.32.0503-sles...
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * lsi_mr_hhr-00.32.0503-sles
 * 
 * Updating Dynamic System Analysis
 * 



2. Run the following command to remove the LSI plug-in from the node:  * 
 * rpm -e lsi_mr_hhr



3. Verify that the LSI plug-in was removed from the node by running the command:  * 
 * rpm -qa | grep lsi_mr_hhr



4. Remove all LSI Pegasus environment variables from /etc/environment with the command: 
 * sed -i '/pegasus/d' /etc/environment



5. Clear the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable by running the following command:  * 
 * export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""



Updating Dynamic System Analysis 

1. Download the IBM Dynamic System Analysis update using the link provided in the Download Link column of the security bulletin. 


2. On each node, create a temporary directory using the following command:  * 
 * mkdir -p /opt/ibm/toolscenter/dsa



3. Copy the ibm_utl_dsa_<version>.bin file into the /opt/ibm/toolscenter/dsa temporary directory. 


4. Change the file permission so that the update is executable using the command:  * 
 * chmod +x /opt/ibm/toolscenter/dsa/ibm_utl_dsa_dsyte1d-9.61_portable_sles11_x86-64.bin



5. Run a test to collect data from the node:  * 
 * /opt/ibm/toolscenter/dsa/ibm_utl_dsa_dsyte1d-9.61_portable_sles11_x86-64.bin -b -text -x -c -d /tmp/DSA/
