LOCAL FIX
 *  Verify the snapshot name in Process Center or Process Admin
   Console.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you enter an incorrect snapshot name as a parameter of the
   BPMGetSnapshotAcronym command, you receive a
   NullPointerException because the snapshot cannot be found.
   However, the message you receive doesn't indicate what the
   problem is and what causes it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that shows you a message indicating that you must use the
   correct snapshot name is planned for inclusion in IBM BPM V8.5.7
    cumulative fix 2017.03.
