Title: IBM Daeja ViewONE 4.1 installer generates configuration (license) files of zero size - United States

Text:
0kb license file; lic.v1; lic-server.v1; lic-virtual.v1; Daeja ViewONE installer TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Daeja viewer installer package runs to completion but if an existing installation is updated with the new installation, it will fail with licensing errors. The exact nature of the error depends on the ECM system in which the viewer is embedded, but will refer to the viewers license file either being missing or invalid.


SYMPTOM
The configuration file(s) generated (named "lic.v1", "lic-server,v1", "lic-virtual.v1" depending on what has been installed) will be of 0kb and errors are seen in the installer log file:

Summary 

-------

Installation: Successful with errors.

191 Successes
0 Warnings
2 NonFatalErrors
0 FatalErrors

Then in the detail:

Custom Action: com.ibm.viewone.customcodeaction.GetBundleDescriptions
Status: ERROR
Additional Notes: ERROR - class com.ibm.viewone.customcodeaction.GetBundleDescriptions unavailable.

and:

Custom Action: com.ibm.viewone.customcodeaction.ViewOneConfiguratorProfessional
Status: ERROR
Additional Notes: ERROR - class com.ibm.viewone.customcodeaction.ViewOneConfiguratorProfessional unavailable. 

Although the errors are listed under "NonFatalErrors" in the installation summary, they are in fact critical as the viewer cannot be loaded with a zero kb configuration file.



CAUSE
This problem occurs when the installer is run on an unsupported platform; typically where an older unsupported 32-bit JVM is used on a non-Windows platform (e.g. AIX server).


ENVIRONMENT
Any unsupported environment



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the system details of the server where the installer is being run. Ensure that the JVM being used is listed as supported under the system requirements of the system to be installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two possible solutions to the issue:


 * Install a supported JVM on the server where you wish to run the installer and re-run the installer.
   
 * If changing the JVM on the server is not viable (for example, because there are other dependancies on the current JVM), use another server or client workstation with a supported JVM installed, run the installer, and then the files generated by the installer can be copied to the correct location on the server.
