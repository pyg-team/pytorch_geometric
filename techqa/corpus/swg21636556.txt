 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I work with IBM SPSS Statistics and would like to know how I can easily hide certain columns from a pivot table, for example I want to hide the two columns 'Percent' and 'Cumulative Percent' from a Frequency table. 

ANSWER
The easiest way to do this is to first install IBM SPSS Statistics - Essentials for Python and then use the following dialog: Utilities - Modify Table Appearance.
If you would like to create the command for the frequencies table you need the table subtype name. If you do not know the name, you can find it by right click on the outline title for the object on the viewer and then select 'copy OMS table subtype' or use the menu Utilities - OMS Identifiers to search the table subtype names.

- The frequency table sub type name is Frequencies. 
- On Dimensions drop down select 'Columns'
- On selected Columns or Rows: enter 'Cumulative Percent' 'Percent'

This will hide two columns: Cumulative percent and Percent column from frequency table

Please note: it is necessary to enter the exact column title within quotes. The text within the quotes is the column title depending on the output language you selected. If you want to hide this column for another language use the language label on this dialog).

- Remove -1 from 'Level for Text Matching'
- Select 'All output' on Process tables from option (This means on all frequency tables created before the two columns will be hide on output viewer)
- Select 'Data cells' on 'Apply Styles' to

- Next click on Actions button and check: 'Hide selected rows or columns', click Continue and run the command or paste the syntax.

SET OLANG = English.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=gender
/ORDER=ANALYSIS.

SPSSINC MODIFY TABLES subtype="Frequencies"
SELECT='Cumulative Percent' 'Percent' 
DIMENSION= COLUMNS
PROCESS = ALL HIDE=TRUE

SPSSINC MODIFY TABLES subtype="Frequencies"
SELECT='Kumulierte Prozente' 'Prozent' 
DIMENSION= COLUMNS
PROCESS = ALL HIDE=TRUE
/STYLES APPLYTO=DATACELLS.

The resulting frequency table is displayed now with Frequency and Valid Percent column only:
