Title: IBM Launching my SPSS product via a Remote Connection produces a licensing error.  Launching the same product locally will launch without error. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed a Single or Site license client install on a server class machine. When I launch my client install locally on the server, my product will launch. If I attempt to launch the same client via a Remote connection (e.g. RDP/Terminal Services/Citrix) I receive one of the following errors:


SPSS/Statistics:
Error # 7001
There is no license for SPSS for Windows.
This command not executed.
Specific symptom number: 18

Or

Error # 2072 
There was an unanticipated problem with the license for this product. 
This command not executed. 
Specific symptom number: 88 

Amos:
No valid license for Amos was found. (1, 18)

Or

No valid license for Amos was found. (11,88)

Clementine / Modeler:
No license key found: Sub-code 18

Or

License error: miscellaneous key-related error. Error sub-code: 88 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In general when accessing SPSS Modeler or SPSS Statistics software via a remote desktop or terminal services session a network license is required. In some configurations where the Windows host limits the number of active sessions to 1 a local license may still operate, but we cannot assist with attempts to achieve such a configuration. 

Please see the documentation for your version of SPSS Modeler or SPSS Statistics for details on how to setup and use a network/concurrent license. You will most likely also need to contact your local IBM Sales office to purchase a network license (they are not interchangeable with site licenses and may be priced differently).
