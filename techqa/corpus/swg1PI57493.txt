   Escalation Questions:
   
   Business Impact
   
   The crash slows down work. This model has been rolled out to
   customers, and it's important it's fixed soon.
   
   
   Environment
   
   Windows 7
   Rhapsody 8.1.3 64-bit
   
   Problem Statement aka Comment line, work item summary...
   
   The customer is using Rhapsody 8.1.3 64-bit. They have a large,
   integrated model (with a lot of referenced model content). When
   they try and do a search of the model, Rhapsody crashes. It does
   not happen every time, but it is highly repeatable with the
   model.
   
   Attached is a screenshot, the RER, and the version info.
   
   Customer cannot send the model.
   
   How do we get the crashing to stop happening in 64-bit?

   Cannot reproduce the bug.
   But, I can see issues with performance when the search on huge
   model resulting a very long list of elements.
   Please open a defect for that.

   From Raz:
   
   "We can not get that model.
   
   I asked for some statistics:
   They say it is about 6 M model-elements, with about 30% of it
   Tags.
   
   Discussing with Zvika, Zvika observed some less-then-optimal
   behavior
   in that scenario, will make some code changes and we'll let GM
   test to see if we are on the issue causing the crash."
   
   6. Zvika Verzberger Feb 8, 2016 3:59 AM
   I guess that this is specific for the specific model.
   Please attach the model and add the exact scenario (what was
   searched, what was selected etc.).

   @aratzloff@us.ibm.com @andreas.themis@uk.ibm.com  please avoid
   assigning me as L3 owner, it is not very productive...
   regarding the issue at hand:
   Indeed, we saw the crash on-site at GM, running 8.1.4 against
   some of their larger models.
   When I tried on my own machine, I did not get it to crash.
   
   The scenario they ran is simple:
   Run search on large model, and once results are shown, click the
   name column and then some other column to get it sorted twice.
   
   I'll discuss with further with Zvika.

   Raz onsite working with customer to find root cause
   Crash verified

   Alex: customer is testing on 814
   
   will update
   
   2. Zvika Verzberger Dec 28, 2015 6:01 AM
   I cannot reproduce that.
   If the customer has a consistent scenario, please attach the
   original model and give the exact scenario.
