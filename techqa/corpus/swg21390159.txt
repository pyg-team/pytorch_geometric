PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During startup of the TEMA, it gives library errors in the TEMA logs as follows:

exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program /opt/IBM/ITM/aix513/yn/bin/kynagent 
because of the following errors: 
0509-150 Dependent module libkbb.a could not be loaded. 
0509-022 Cannot load module libkbb.a. 
0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does not exist. 

SYMPTOM
The TEMA agent does not start.


CAUSE
Usually caused by incorrect bit-level on the OS.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do a "bootinfo -K" on the OS and verify that the system is using 32-bit or 64-bit.


Then reinstall and reconfigure the agent to match the OS bit-level that's being used. 

During install of the TEMA "yn" agent, it usually matches up to the OS level. 

Continue to reinstall and reconfigure the agent and this should resolve the problem.
