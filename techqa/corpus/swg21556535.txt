RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Error message says that you had used wrong user id / password in JCO connection definition. JCO Destination has tried for too many times with the wrong credentials ( may be more than three times, depends on back-end settings). Due to this the SAP back end user id is locked. You have to get it un-locked before you try with correct user id and password.
