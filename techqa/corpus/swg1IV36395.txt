APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is constantly growing "Handle Count" on Windows platform
   where the
   ITCAM Extended Agent 6.3.1 IF0002 is running. When the Agent is
   restarted, krzclient.ext is using about hundreds of file
   handles. There
   is growing of file handles to thousands.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Configure Agent with ORACLE_HOME and set below variable as
   TRUE
   KRZ_USE_ORACLE_TNSPING=TRUE
   KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET=TRUE
   2. Enable Listener/Net Service Monitoring by setting below
   variable
   with non-zero integer values.
   KRZ_TNS_PING_INTERVAL=60
   KRZ_LISTENER_PING_INTERVAL=60
   3. Start Agent and monitor the HANDLE number from Windows Task
   Manager for process krzclient.exe
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workaround is to download Oracle Instant Client and
   reconfigure Agent from using Oracle Home to using Oracle Instant
   Client.

   Or If  there is not need to monitor the Listener/Net
   Service, then it can be disabled as below, this will also stop
   the HANDLE leak.
   
   KRZ_TNS_PING_INTERVAL=0
