additional poller in failover TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When registering additional pollers in a failover setup - does the domain name on the failover need to be against Primary domain or Backup domain? 

ANSWER
Let's say the naming convention of failover setup is as follows: 

Primary domain= 'NCOMSP' 

Backup domain = 'NCOMSB' 

Virtual domain = 'NCOMSV' 

There are two scenarios to consider: 

1) ITNM Failover with Shared NCIM(i.e. Both Primary & Backup domains are connecting to same NCIM database) 

In this case, you only need to register once the additional Poller either from Primary or Backup but not on both. 

e.g. ncp_poller -domain <PRIMARYDOMAINNAME> -name poller_name -register 

i.e. #ncp_poller -domain NCOMSP -name PINGPoller -register 

In above example, the Poller name being 'PINGPoller' and one must register additional poller against primary domain name and never on failover domain name. 

2) ITNM Failover with NCIM replication (i.e. Primary and Backup domains have their own instances of NCIM database) 

In this case, one need to register additional Poller from both Primary and Failover servers but against primary domain name. i.e. you would run below command on both servers: 

#ncp_poller -domain NCOMSP -name PINGPoller -register 

Make sure you have a DbLogins.NCOMSB.cfg and DbLogins.NCOMSP.cfg on failover server pointing to the Backup NCIM db prior to running the command above. 

Once poller is registered, one should continue rest of the steps listed @ https://ibm.biz/BdDRic [https://ibm.biz/BdDRic]
