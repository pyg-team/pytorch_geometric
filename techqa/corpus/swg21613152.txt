Title: IBM "Network Adapters Rates" attributes calculation - United States

QUESTION
 How does the VIOS Premium agent calculates attribute values for the "Network Adapters Rates" attribute group? 

CAUSE
This attribute group obtains data through the script aixDataProvider.pl (located in $CANDLEHOME/aix523/va/bin).
You can manually launch this script:
aixDataProvider.pl Network_Adapters_Rates

It will get its data from the "entstat -d <device>" command.

ANSWER
Here's how the script calculates Network Adapter Rates:
1° it first runs a "entstat -d <device>", to get a first set of device metrics
2° sleep for 10 seconds
3° runs again a "entstat -d <device>", to get a second set of device metrics
4° it will subtract the first set of metrics from the second set of metrics, to determine how many packets got dropped and how many packet sent errors occurred in this interval of 10 seconds

5° it divides the result of 4° by 10, to get the number of packets and errors per second
