ABSTRACT
 Starting from version 8.0.3, Rational Sofware Architect products can be installed as 64-bit applications on supported 64-bit operating systems. This document provides information in relation to benefits, requirements, known limitations, and links to known problems related to working with these products running in 64-bit mode.

Benefits of 64-bit installation  * Extends heap size 
 * Ability to manage larger models


32-bit vs. 64-bit Comparisons (RSA = Rational Software Architect) 

Ability to create and work with larger models

Rational Rose model import: Able to successfully import 100MB, 450MB, 670MB test models in non-incremental mode using the 64-bit offering while the 32-bit offering could only load the 100MB model.* 

*NOTE, all models can be opened in RSA 32-bit mode using incremental load. 




Requirements  

Action Requirement(s) Installation  * IBM Installation Manager 1.4.4 required 
 * Installation on supported Windows or Linux 64-bit Operating Systems 
 * Full Installation required (upgrade from previous 32-bit installation is not supported) 
 * To use Installation Manager to install 64-bit application on RHEL 6.0 x86_64 (64-bit) [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21459143] 
 * When using Eclipse or P2 updater to install new plug-ins, in a shared "write-protected" installation, the owner of the installation (i.e. Administrator) vs. user must perform this action [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21502991&wv=1] 
 * Using the "64-bit" Architecture Selection option in the Install Packages view during installation


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665&amp;aid=1]
By default: Architecture Selection is "32-bit"

Note:  * 64-bit installation on Solaris (Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition) not supported [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21503018&wv=1] 
 * Separate 32-bit/64-bit installations (on the same machine) are supported

Recommended hardware 
configuration Minimum 8 GB RAM with minimum 4 GB Heap

Note: -Xcompressedrefs (IBM VM) or -XX:+UseCompressedOops (Sun) flag, may optimize memory usage for 64-bit machines with less than 32GB 
Limitations 

 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665&amp;aid=2] Limitation(s) Operating system 64-bit Installation not supported on Solaris [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21503018&wv=1] Product features not supported in 64-bit install  * DoDAF 1.0 Reporting - Ability to generate an Microsoft Word document (reporting) is not supported.

Known issues  * Shared 'read-only' 64-bit Installations Only: User installed plug-ins may not load correctly [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21502991&wv=1] 
 * 64-bit Architecture Selection installation option is shown as available for Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition v8.0.3 on Solaris SPARC, but is not supported [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21503018&wv=1] 
 * Cannot install Rational Team Concert Client into existing 64 Bit package group [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21502535&wv=1] 
 *  [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1502701&wv=1]Internet Explorer v9 or higher is required if the product was installed using 64-bit Bit Mode option on a 64-bit system [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21502701&wv=1] 
 * List of related support documents about additional known issues for installing or running these products as a 64-bit applications, including any applicable work-arounds [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?q=RAD64bit]





Co-installing vs shell-sharing 

Co-install means two or more products are installed on the same machine, but into different package groups (each product functions independently). 

Shell-share means two or more products are installed on the same machine in the same package groups. When starting one of the products, the functionality in other products will also be available.
