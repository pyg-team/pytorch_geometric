PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides troubleshooting information for common errors and problems reported when attempting to import an ERwin model into IBM® Rational® Data Architect. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 The following are common issues encountered when importing an ERwin model into RDA. 

 1. The Next button in the Import Wizard is disabled.
    To resolve this, confirm that you have the MetaIntegration path to your environment path variable.
    For more information and instructions on how to enable the path, please see the release notes or technote 1251152.
    
    
 2. An error is reported by the Import Wizard.
    
    
 3. Make sure that:
    a. You have ERwin installed on the workstation where you are performing the import.
    b. Be sure that the import notation selected is not IDEF1X, since at this time RDA does not support this format. There is an enhancement request, RATLC00501015, for this functionality.
    
    
 4. A syntax or notation error is reported during the ERwin model import:
    This can typically be corrected by validating the ERwin model to correct any errors.
    
    
 5. Confirm the version of ERwin model that is being imported. Try importing as a 3.x, 4.x or 7.x instead.
    Note: In some cases, a 3.x import will be successful over 4.x.Export the model file from ERwin to an .xml and import the xml format into RDA.
    
    
 6. Export the model file from ERwin to an .xml and import the xml format into RDA.
