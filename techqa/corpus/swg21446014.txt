QUESTION
 How do I disable the JMS log and JMS trace file from being generated automatically in WebSphere Application Server Community Edition? 

CAUSE
The JMS client applications when configured with WebSphere MQ server and running in WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (hereafter Community Edition) generates the JMS log file (mqjms.log), and JMS trace file (mqjms_<pid>.trc) automatically in the <WASCE_INSTALL_ROOT> directory. The .trc file always gets created, and the mqjms.log file is only created if a MQ server error occurs.

ANSWER
WebSphere MQ client logging can be disabled by doing the following:


 1. Disable Resource Adapter trace, by setting the traceEnabled flag to false in the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter deployment descriptor. By default this is set to false.
    
    <config-property-setting name="traceEnabled ">false</config-property-setting> 
    
 2. Setting the JVM property to disable logging:
    
    -Dcom.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.status=OFF 
    In the case of Community Edition server scripts, the JAVA_OPTS environment variable can be used to set JVM options, for example: 
    JAVA_OPTS=-Dcom.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.status=OFF 
    Note: WebSphere MQ client logging data always helps in debugging issues.
