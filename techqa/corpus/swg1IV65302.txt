APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Approver Initials:     Venkata
   
   Reported Release:      720
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Virtual Environment: VMware VI Agent
   7.2.
   
   VMware VI agents shows incorrect snapshot count for the virtual
   machine.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Inconsistency observed for the snapshot count given between
   agent and the vCenter/ESX Server. Agent does not reflect the
   changes in the snapshot count if all snapshots from the
   particular VM has been removed.
   Workaround to resolve such conflicts is to recycle the agent.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS: Take 1 or 2  snapshot of a particular
   Virtual machine, wait till agent reflects the updated snapshot
   count; now remove all the snapshots, agent still shows the same
   snapshot count as it was before removing all the snapshots.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Recycle the agent
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Inconsistency observed for the snapshot count given between
   agent and the vCenter/ESX Server. Agent does not reflect the
   changes in the snapshot count if all snapshots from the
   particular VM has been removed. Workaround to resolve such
   conflicts is to recycle the agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We will fix this APAR in a upcoming release.
   
   Data provider cache was not refreshing that's the reason
   consistency were observed between the vcenter and data provider
   for the snap shot count.
