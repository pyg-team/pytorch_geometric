Title: IBM Installing WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 for z/OS from web-based repositories - United States

Text:
 NEWS

ABSTRACT
 Customers who are licensed for WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 for z/OS can now install all product components from the web-based product repository instead of an SMP/E-installed repository. This option requires less time and a smaller footprint for your installation. 

CONTENT
You can use the web-based repository to install all components of the product: full profile, Liberty profile, secure proxy server, IBM HTTP Server, and web server plugins. 

This installation requires IBM Installation Manager and an IBM ID that is associated with an IBM customer number with current product entitlement.

Before you begin:

1. You must have an IBM user ID and password. See the following page for more information: http://www.ibm.com/account/profile [http://www.ibm.com/account/profile]

2. Associate your user ID with an IBM Customer ID (ICN) that is licensed for WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Version 8.5:

1. Go to www.ibm.com

2. Select "Support & downloads".

3. Select "Support registrations". You might need to log in with your IBM user ID and password.

4. Enter your IBM customer ID and a justification for access (such as "Allow product installs with IBM Installation Manager") and click "Request additional access."

After your request is approved by the administrator for the customer ID, you will be able to access repositories for entitled products directly.

3. Set up IBM Installation Manager. The following examples assume that the Installation Manager binaries are at /InstallationManager/bin. For more information, see the Installation Manager Information Center: http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/rational/ibm_installation_manager?productContext=864296863 [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/rational/ibm_installation_manager?productContext=864296863]

Install WebSphere Application Server

1. Choose an installation path for the installed product that is not currently used by your Installation Manager for an installed product.

2. Create and mount a filesystem at this path with at least 35,000 tracks (3390) or 1800 megabytes of free space. Make sure it is writeable by the Installation Manager user ID and, if it is a group mode Installation Manager, by the Installation Manager group. 

3. Create a keyring containing your IBM user ID and password. 


 * For Installation Manager Version 1.6.3 and previous:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85/repository.config

 * For Installation Manager Version 1.7.0 and later:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85/repository.config


4. Install WebSphere Application Server for z/OS from the repository: 

imcl install com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85 
-installationDirectory <where to install the product> 
-repositories http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85 [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85] 
-secureStorageFile <filespec for secure storage file> 
-acceptLicense 

If you are using a keyring, specify -keyring instead of -secureStorageFile. 

You can also specify -sharedResourcesDirectory, -preferences, and other parameters. 

Installing a specific product level 

By default, the latest publicly available level of the product will be installed. To install a different level, 
first use the imcl listAvailablePackages command to see what levels are available: 

imcl listAvailablePackages 
-repositories http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85 [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85] 
-secureStorageFile <filespec for secure storage file> 

Next, specify the exact version on the install command: 

imcl install com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85_8.5.1.20121017_1748 
-installationDirectory <where to install the product> 
-repositories http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85 [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.zOS.v85] 
-secureStorageFile <filespec for secure storage file> 
-acceptLicense 

Installing service updates along with the product 

When the product is installed from the web-based service repository: 
 * If you do not specify a product level, then the latest product level is installed, along with ALL published corrective service (iFixes). 
 * If you specify a product level, then corrective service is not automatically installed; only the specific product is installed.


You can add one of the following options to the imcl install command to change this behavior: 

-installFixes recommend (install the recommended iFixes) 
-installFixes all (install all iFixes) 
-installFixes none (do not install iFixes) 

Installing the standalone Liberty profile (Version 8.5.5 and above) 

To install the stand-alone Liberty profile, follow the instructions above, but use the following offering ID: 

com.ibm.websphere.liberty.zOS.v85 

The corresponding repository is: 

http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.zOS.v85 [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.zOS.v85] 

See the WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 Information Center for space requirements. 

You can use the same keyring or secure storage file that you created for the base WebSphere Application Server installation. 

Installing other product components (NDDMZ, IHS, Plugins) 

Follow the instructions above. Specify the appropriate offering ID and repository URL for each component. 

Offering ID for the NDDMZ Secure Proxy server: 

com.ibm.websphere.NDDMZ.zOS.v85 

Offering ID for the IBM HTTP Server: 

com.ibm.websphere.IHS.zOS.v85 

Offering ID for the web server plugins: 

com.ibm.websphere.PLG.zOS.v85 

In each case, the repository URL is: 

http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/]<offering ID> 

See the WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 Information Center for space requirements. 

You can use the same keyring or secure storage file that you created for the base WebSphere Application Server install. 

Determining which products you are entitled to install 

The special repository: 

http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/entitled] 

accesses all Installation Manager-installable products for which your IBM user ID is entitled. 

Be aware that listing these products (with imcl listAvailablePackages) or installing them (with imcl install) might require additional time while entitlement information is gathered.
