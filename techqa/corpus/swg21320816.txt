QUESTION
 Why am I unable to login to the console of IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances after configuring RBM with LDAP (Active Directory)? 

CAUSE
Configuration with Active Directory (AD) is slightly different compared with other LDAP when using DataPower

ANSWER
While using Active Directory (AD), check the following: 

 * AD, by default, doesn't allow only anonymous binding. Make sure you have anonymous binding enabled on AD. 
 * Check for distinguishedName (DN) if need to be constructed to authenticate the user, instead SAMAccountName (SAM-Account-Name) 
 * Check RBMPolicy to see if you have the Output credential as */*/*?Access=rwadx in stead of */*/*?Access=r+w+a+d+x. Although the latter works, you should use without the "+" sign. 
 * Verify correct DN is being formed if user is a member of multiple group and group search is enabled. Try with user as member of only one group. 
 * In the logs, if Authorization is failing, check to see if you have a case sensitivity issue.
