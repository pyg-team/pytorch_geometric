ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server
   11.4.0, when a new module is added to the left navigation pane
   through the pull down, it appears at the very bottom instead of
   right below the earlier module. Customer noticed that any new
   module that is chosen from the pull down on the Left
   Navigational Pane is being added to the very bottom of the left
   navigation pane while the entire space above it remains blank.
   A vertical scroll bar gets added.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
    -  let only one catalog be available on the left navigation
   pane (close off the rest to reproduce for this test)
   
    -  change the width of the left navigation pane
   
    -  add a new catalog or hierarchy to the left navigation pane
   
    -  the new module will be added to the very bottom of the left
   navigation pane while the entire space above it remains blank.
    A vertical scroll bar gets added.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not change the width of the left navigation pane
