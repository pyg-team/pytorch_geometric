Title: IBM Process Designer for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.0 Fix Pack 1 crashes after launch - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to start IBM Process Designer, it crashes immediately with the following Java virtual machine (JVM) exception "Java was started but returned exit code=2" 

SYMPTOM
You can configure the Process Designer to capture additional logging information. However, it crashes before any entries are written to the ae.log file.

You see the same result regardless of whether you used installProcessDesigner_admin.bat, installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat, or userinst.exe to install. 

The following screen shot show what you might see:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674031&amp;aid=1]

The Javadump file shows that the JVM was triggered to stop:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674031&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674031&aid=2]

The IBM Process Designer workspace.log file shows the following exception:

CAUSE
The issue is related to the following links: 

 * Bug 300577 - Eclipse workbench will not start if "user.home" contains invalid characters [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=300577] 
 * JDK-6519127 : Vista: user.home property not set correctly [http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6519127]


The user.home JVM property might not be set correctly by the system on the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Add the -Duser.home=C:/temp JVM property to the Process Designer eclipse.ini file.
    
    
 2. Restart IBM Process Designer.
