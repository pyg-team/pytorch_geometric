PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Root installation of OMNIbus failed with error:

This Application has Unexpectedly Quit: Invocation of this Java Application has caused an InvocationTargetException. This application will now exit. (LAX) 

CAUSE
There was an earlier installation attempt which failed.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check for missing directories. Both of these directories should exist: 

/usr/ibm/common/acsi 
/var/ibm/common/acsi


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Uninstall the DE using the de_cleanup.sh script (if the script still exists) or manually uninstall as follows: 


For Global or root installations:
* Remove the /var/ibm/common directory.
* Remove the /usr/ibm/common directory.
* Clean up the /tmp directory, by removing the acu_de.log file , if it is there.
* Remove the /tmp/<username> directory, where <username> is the ID of the user that installed DE (e.g. "root").
* Remove all DE references from the /etc/inittab system file. The DE entries should be delimited by "#Begin AC Solution Install block" and "#End AC Solution Install block". Remove all of the text between those delimiters, and the delimiting text, as well. 

* Remove all DE references from the /etc/services system file.

Then, attempt the installation again.
