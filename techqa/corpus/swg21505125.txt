Yes, the adapter supports SFS read/write with the help of integration objects. 

In business service interface, the adapter is able to read and write the metadata from a file through defining a customized integration object. Details can be found here:

Once the integration object is being defined, business services can be used to access the metadata.

Example:
BC: Account Attachment.

It contains a few metadata such as "srcFile" which refers to a path in the Siebel File System. The adapter can modify the metadata of the file, but is not able to edit or save the content of a file.
