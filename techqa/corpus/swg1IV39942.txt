ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: N/A
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   I was using iKeyman 8.0.344 today and I noticed something odd
   about the digital
   signature algorithm names in the panels for creating new
   certificates and
   certificate requests:
   
   The SHA2WithRSA algorithm doesn't specify which SHA-2 algorithm
   is used (e.g.
   SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512). Also SHA-3 has only just been
   approved so it seems
   highly unlikely that has been used and to my knowledge there is
   no SHA-5 at
   all.
   These names are potentially misleading to end users. I wonder if
   the names are
   truncated such that SHA2WithRSA is SHA-256, SHA3WithRSA is
   SHA-384 and
   SHA5WithRSA is SHA-512.
   I was wondering if these names are correct and, if so, what each
   algorithm
   actually is. With SHA-3 in the news, I can imagine that
   "SHA3WithRSA" has the
   potential to confuse customers.
