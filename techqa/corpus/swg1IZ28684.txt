APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is in the process of delivering a multi-domain ITNM
   solution, in
   which they expect to build 8+ ITNM domains each with up to
   200,000
   entities.
   
   They are using a virtualized system based on IBM System P 560Q
   LPARs with
   AIX5.3. They have separate core systems and GUI systems, and an
   NCIM
   database on Oracle 10g, and ITNM v3.7 FP4.
   
   This issue has been identified as a result of trying to delete
   the
   dynamic view created when ITNM is initially started, but it is
   possible
   that views with multiple sub-views will exist in the
   environment.
   
   The issue appears to be caused by a query from the GUI that
   includes an
   list with more than 1000 entries. This generates an Oracle
   error:
   ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of Topoviz that store their views in   *
   *                 Oracle databases and have views with over    *
   *                 1000 children or sub-views.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If a user attempts to delete a network  *
   *                      view with over 1000 children, then the  *
   *                      query will fail and the view will not   *
   *                      be successfully deleted.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If a user attempts to delete a network view with over 1000
   children, then the query will fail with the Oracle error
   ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000.
   appearing in the ncp_topoviz log file.  The view will not
   successfully be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If a user attempts to delete a network view with over 1000
   children, then the query will fail with the Oracle error
   ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000.
   appearing in the ncp_topoviz log file.  The view will not
   successfully be deleted. The way in which views are deleted has
   been changed, so that lists are no longer used.  Instead, the
   view and its children are deleted using a prepared statement.
