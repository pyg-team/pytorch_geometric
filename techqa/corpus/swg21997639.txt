Title: IBM Re-using a Text Analytics model scoring 'nugget' misses some relevant concepts - United States

Text Analytics scoring node nugget TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have created a Text Analytics scoring "nugget" in Modeler Premium. I am now using this node in a new stream with new data and I'm finding the 'nugget' is missing relevant terms. So I recreated the scoring node using my original Text Mining node and settings but with new data. After doing this, I find that my scoring node is now missing terms it had previously been capturing. 

CAUSE
You are not re-using the same nugget, you have created a new nugget based upon different training data. 

ANSWER
The Text Mining Scoring Model node (the nugget) does no text extraction of its own. It merely does text matching based on the underlying codeframe and the actual concepts extracted in the Interactive Workbench prior to creating the nugget. 

The best way to handle this scenario is to tune your underlying resources, making maximum use of the Synonym and Type dictionaries to cast a wide net of terms and consolidate into a narrower collection of concepts to be incorporated into your category code-frame.

Alternatively/Additionally, you should tune your training data such that you are extracting all of the terms of interest. When you find new terms of interest, add their records to your original training data and regenerate the Text Analytics scoring node (nugget) from that data rather than from an entirely new corpus.
