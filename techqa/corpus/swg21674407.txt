WebSphere MQ Advanced V7.5 is also available (except on IBM i), but its end of support date is 30 April 2018 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS916-117]. The Advanced license allows use of the Managed File Transfer and Advanced Message Security components which are now built into MQ and replace the former File Transfer Edition and Advanced Message Security products.
 * Replacements for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition for z/OS V7.0.1 and V7.0.0 include IBM MQ Advanced for z/OS V9.0 and V8.0.0.

HOW DO I CHECK WHICH VERSION I AM CURRENTLY RUNNING?

 * Follow these general instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621707] or the IBM MQ Knowledge Center instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q083280_.htm] to display your IBM MQ or WebSphere MQ version on all platforms except for z/OS with the command: dspmqver
 * On z/OS, look for message CSQY000I [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.doc/csq_y.htm] in the MSTR joblog to determine your version.
 * Follow the IBM MQ Knowledge Center instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.wmqfte.doc/display_ver_cmd.htm] to display your Managed File Transfer or WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition version with the command: fteDisplayVersion
 * WebSphere MQ Telemetry V7.0.1 only runs on WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 (fix pack 7.0.1.3 and later) on Linux (x86-64) and Windows (x86). Although there is no command to display the WebSphere MQ Telemetry version, if your WebSphere MQ version is V7.0.1 and you have a WebSphere MQ Telemetry service and channels [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.tt.doc/tt_intro.htm] configured, then you are running WebSphere MQ Telemetry V7.0.1.

IS ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HELP ME UPGRADE TO A LATER VERSION?

 * The IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ Migration Guide [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/aimsupport/entry/websphere_mq_ibm_mq_migration_guide] is available to view online or download:
 *  IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ Migration Guide [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/aimsupport/resource/MQ_migration/WMQ_Migration.pdf] 
 * 
 * The IBM Knowledge Center also includes information to assist you in migrating to a supported version of IBM MQ or WebSphere MQ:
 *  Migrating and upgrading to IBM MQ V9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.mig.doc/q006180_.htm] Migrating and upgrading to IBM MQ V8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.mig.doc/q006180_.htm] Migrating and upgrading to WebSphere MQ V7.5 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.mig.doc/q006180_.htm]

HOW DO I PURCHASE A SUPPORT EXTENSION FOR MY CURRENT VERSION?

 * Support extensions are available for an additional fee. To purchase extended support for WebSphere MQ or any of the other products, please contact your local IBM sales representative.
 * US Customers should contact Customer Support Operations at 1-877-426-6006, option #2. If you provide your IBM customer number, they can quickly find your sales representative.
 * Customers in other geographies should refer to the IBM directory of worldwide support contacts to find sales contact numbers in your region:

WHEN AN WEBSPHERE MQ SERVER PRODUCT GOES OUT OF SUPPORT, DOES THE CLIENT AND FILE TRANSFER AGENT ALSO GO OUT OF SUPPORT?

 * Yes. WebSphere MQ V7.0 clients and WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition V7.0.1 and V7.0.0 agents go out of support at the same time as the server.
 *

 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674407&amp;aid=3] 




ARE THESE PRODUCTS STILL SUPPORTED WHEN THEY ARE BUNDLED WITH ANOTHER IBM PRODUCT?

 * Yes, support is available for all bundled components until the IBM product that includes them is withdrawn from support. However, they are only supported when used by the bundling IBM product. Unrelated usage is not supported.

IS THE WEBSPHERE MQ V7.0 RESOURCE ADAPTER SUPPORTED IN WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER?

 * Yes, the WebSphere MQ V7.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.0 and V7.0 is supported through 30 April 2018 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS916-143], when both of those versions of WebSphere Application Server end support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * Similarly, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0] shipped with WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x is supported as long as that version of WebSphere Application Server remains in support, or longer if you purchase a WebSphere Application Server support extension.
   
 * However, if you manually install your own copy of the WebSphere MQ V7.x Resource Adapter in WebSphere Application Server or any third-party Java EE server, it will go out of support with the corresponding WebSphere MQ server version.
   
 * The IBM MQ V8.0 and V9.0 Resource Adapters cannot be installed in WebSphere Application Server V8.5.x, V8.0 and V7.0 because those versions support JMS 1.1 while the IBM MQ Resource Adapters implement JMS 2.0. WebSphere Application Server V9.0 ships with the IBM MQ V9.0 Resource Adapter [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089#7dotx_0_0_0] and includes full support for JMS 2.0. The version of MQ Resource Adapter you use must be supported by your Java EE server but does not need to match the version of the queue managers to which you wish to connect.

IS DOCUMENTATION STILL AVAILABLE FOR THESE PRODUCTS?

 * Yes. Online documentation is available in the IBM Knowledge Center, while downloadable Information Center installations and PDF versions of the manuals are available from the MQ Library page.

HOW DO I OBTAIN INSTALLATION IMAGES FOR THESE PRODUCTS IF I STILL NEED THEM?
