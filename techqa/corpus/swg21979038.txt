PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Content Collector (ICC) email archiving task route fails with "The list of available property mappings does not contain a definition for the class ICCDocument" 

SYMPTOM
All email documents failed with the following error: 

The list of available property mappings does not contain a definition for the class ICCDocument.


CAUSE
There is a mismatch of document class in the P8 Find Duplicate Email task and the P8 Archive Email task.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector email archiving with IBM FileNet P8 repository



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the email archiving task route and note the document class being used in the following places in ICC Configuration Manager: 

 * P8 Find Duplicate Email > Options > Document Class 
 * P8 Archive Email > Common Settings > Property Mappings > Document Class


The document class in the above two settings should match. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Determine the correct document class that should be used. For example, ICCMail3 document class is created by ICC and can be used for email archiving. 
 * Configure the same document class in both places.
