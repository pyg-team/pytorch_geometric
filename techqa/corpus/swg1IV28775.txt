ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description?
   A Message Service Client (XMS) .NET v2.0  or above application
   loses connection to a WebSphere MQ (WMQ) v6 queue manager due
   to a network problem, and receives the expected
   MQRC_CONNECTION_BROKEN (2009) errors.After
   re-establishing the connection,there's a
   message delivery hang observed while all the connections and
   asynchronous consumers are Active.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Applications using XMS.NET 2.0 or Above and Connecting to a WMQ
   v6 Queue Manager only
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A XMS .NET v2.0 or above application connecting to a WMQ v6.0+
   Queuemanager upon reconnecting followed by a connect failure,
   observes that intermittently one or many of the Asynchronous
   message consumers hang/stop receiving messages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It has been observed that after application successfuly
   reconnected to the queue manager, the asynchrnous message
   listener thread was going out of scope as its original
   parent(Session) instance has been re-instantited. We have fixed
   the code for Async listener thread reference updates.
