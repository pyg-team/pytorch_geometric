QUESTION
 Collecting data for problems with IBM Rule Execution Server. Collecting this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

ANSWER
You can use Rule Execution Server Console to monitor execution traces from Decision Warehouse, test ruleset execution in Diagnostics, manage ruleapps, rulesets, and transparent decision services, and retrieve server information.
If you already contacted support, continue on to the Collecting Rule Execution Server specific information. Otherwise, click Collecting Data: Read first for all IBM Operational Decision Management Components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653691].


Otherwise collect the following ILOG Rule Execution Server data:




COLLECTING RULE EXECUTION SERVER SPECIFIC INFORMATION

 1. Version and Patch information for  1. The Rule Execution Server console (About menu in the console). 
     2. The eXecution Unit / XU (in console Diagnostic or Server info tab). 
     3. The Rule Execution Server libraries of the client application(s) involved  *  Your application ("Implementation-Version" in the MANIFEST.MF of packaged ODM JARs). Decision Validation Services SSP (http://<hostname>:<port>/testing). Hosted Transparent Decision Service / HTDS (http://<hostname>:<port>/DecisionService).
           For more details, see Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738]. 
        
        
     4. The Application Server or Web Server Rule Execution Server is installed on. 
     5. The JDK used. 
     6. The browser used. 
     7. The database driver used for the datasource.
        
    
    
 2. Topology of Rule Execution Server  1. The server(s) on which Rule Execution Server Console is deployed. 
     2. The server(s) on which XUs are deployed. 
     3. The server(s) on which the application invoking rules is deployed. 
     4. The use of cluster, multiple nodes topology of cells or domains. 
     5. The type of rule session used.
        
    
    
 3. The settings used by the XU  1. Pool settings from the Application Server . 
     2. ra.xml file if edited.
        
    
    
 4. Log files  1. Rule Execution Server console log, if the problem is related to deployment or RuleApp management.  * For WAS, the log is by default found at <WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\res-console.log.
        
        
     2. XU logs if the problem is related to the rule execution.  * For WAS, those are included by default in the server logs (see below). 
         * See section Setting the Java logging level [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.troubleshooting/shared_config_websphere_topics/tsk_was_log_for_exec_stack.html] in the product documentation.
        
        
     3. All Application Server or Web Server log files.  * For WAS, those are the SystemOut.log, SystemErr.log and trace.log found under<WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\<your server>. 
         * Send the full content of the log folder to make sure so we see trace of the error as well as the last server start. 
         * Also include the full content of the corresponding FFDC folder, <WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\ffdc.
        
        
     4. Hosted Transparent Decision Service / HTDS logs, if the issue occurs when executing rules with HTDS.
    
    

 * 
 *   * For WAS, the log is by default found at <WAS_HOME>\profiles\<your profile>\logs\res-decisionservice.log. 
    * See Change the log level of HTDS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497154] to increase the log level.
   
   
 * 
 *   * The log is managed by your application server directly. 
    * to change the log level read the sectionTuning the Rule Execution Server logging level
      
   
   
 * 
 * . Follow instructions to
 * send diagnostic data to IBM support

Collecting and providing all the information relevant to the problem will significantly improve the support team's response time. 


COLLECTING DATA AUTOMATICALLY
STARTING THE DATA COLLECTOR


If you are using WebSphere Application Server you can use the following tool to collect information automatically. 

The IBM Support Assistant Data Collector ( ISADC) tool is bundled with the product. As a result, you can run the ISADC tool directly from the install/shared/isadc/directory. For more details, see Collecting data using the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.wodm.family.troubleshooting/topics/con_support_isa.html]. 

You can also access the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector tool online:  1. Go to the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector site for IBM Operational Decision Manager [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/isa/isadc/2.0/isacoreweb/2.0.1/isadc/lang/en/index.html?taxonomy=DecisionServer]. 
 2. Start the ISA Data Collector: 

 * To run online, select the option to collect from this system using the current browser and click Start Collection. 
 * To run locally, select the option to collect from this or another system using a downloadable utility. Download and extract the zip file to your ODM_HOME/shared/isadc directory. From a command line, run isadc.[sh|bat] to run the tool in console mode or launch index.html to use the web interface.


COLLECTING THE DATA

 1. Select the data collector from the Rule Execution Server section 
 2. Select Collect XU traces if the problem can be reproduced or 
 3. Click Start. 
 4. During the collection provide the information as requested. 
 5. Follow the prompts to automatically submit the collected data to IBM Support.



WHAT TO DO NEXT

Once you have collected the preceding information, you can simply submit the diagnostic data to IBM support.
