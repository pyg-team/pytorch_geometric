 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities were discovered in GSKit. IBM WebSphere MQ uses GSKit and addressed the applicable CVE. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7421 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7421]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The internal ICC PRNG pool state is duplicated during a fork() system call operation which results in a period of time where child processes may generate identical PRNG output to the parent. This may allow possible attacks related to predicable state which an attacker could exploit.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
