ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.1
   Integrated debugger on zOS 2.1 may cause ABENDS0C4 in CEEHDSP
   when debugging a C program.
   
   You may experience this abend0c4 when you step through to the
   end of a C program.
   
   You can find the message below in the JCL that you submit.
   
   CEE3204S The system detected a protection exception
   (System Completion Code=0C4).

   01.z/OS 2.1 no longer allows bypassing BPX.SERVER with UID 0.
      So RDz (Rational Developer for System z) no longer supports
      the UID 0 scenario.
   02.Synchronize Rational Developer for System z's LE user exit
      used by Integrated Debugger with updates done for IBM Debug
      Tool 13.1 APAR PI24559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI24559].
   03.The Integrated Debugger was unnecessarily placing errors and
      informational message in the DBM log and the system log that
      were either being handled, or are only required when tracing
      is needed.
   04.Rational Developer for System z (RDz) In the case of C/C++
      programs, the Integrated Debugger failed to determine the end
      of the program and stepping at the end of the program would
      cause the job being debugged to terminate with ABEND S0C4 in
      CEEHDSP.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.RDz no longer supports using UID 0 to bypass the BPX.SERVER
      permit requirement.
   02.Synchronize Rational Developer for System z's LE user exit
      used by Integrated Debugger with updates done for IBM Debug
      Tool 13.1 APAR PI24559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI24559].
   03.The Integrated Debugger will no longer log messages for
      handled errors, or informational messages when tracing is
      not enabled.
   04.The Integrated Debugger was not correctly determining the end
      of a program, and has now been modified in order to prevent
      ABEND S0C4 when stepping at the end of a program.
