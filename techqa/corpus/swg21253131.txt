Title: IBM Plug-in installation fails due to a partial installation image - United States

Text:
install; plugin; prereq.jdk; remote TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are installing the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server V6.0, V6.1 or V7.0 plug-in product from a copied WebSphere Application Server installation image. During the installation you do not experience any errors in the installation log, but discover that various plug-in installation tasks were not completed. 

CAUSE
In some cases, in order to save space and time, users might install the WebSphere Application Server plug-in by copying just the plug-in directory from the rest of the installation image and then running the installer. However, the GSKit and SDK directories from a complete WebSphere Application Server V6.0, V6.1 or V7.0 install image must be present with the plug-in binaries to provide a complete and valid plug-in installation.

If a complete install image is not present on the server during the plug-in installation, a message such as the following might be seen in the log.txt file:

(Jan 18, 2006 12:12:24 PM), Plugin.Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPComponentizedFile
RepositoryDeployAction, err, Component not found: prereq.jdk 
(Jan 18, 2006 12:12:24 PM), Plugin.Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPComponentizedFile
RepositoryDeployAction, err, ComponentNotFoundException.message 

The install log will even indicate a false positive regarding the completion of the plug-in install process. The log.txt file will show the following:

(Jan 18, 2006 4:05:41 PM), Plugin.Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPLogFileAction, msg1, INSTCONF_COMPLETE : Installation is complete.

Although the plug-in appears to install with no exceptions in the log, the installation is not really successful. It does not modify the Web server configuration file with the necessary plug-in lines, create the configurewebserver1 script, or update the plugin-cfg.xml file. The plug-in installation has failed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The "plugin", "JDK", and "GSKit" directories must all be named correctly and present in the root directory of the install image for any plug-in installation to be successful. Do not change the names of the directories after untarring or unzipping the image.
