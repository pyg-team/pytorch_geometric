ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the maximum value is specified for the measures axis in a
   non-legacy chart report and the body of the chart contains a
   value greater than the maximum specified, the value is ignored
   and the measures axis range is overridden.??When running the
   same report using the legacy charting engine, the maximum axis
   value is applied to the chart and an icon appears to show that
   values in the body of the chart are above the maximum value.

COMMENTS
 *  This is by design for the default charts. All data points are di
   splayed even if the max value specified is less than one or more
    data values. Max value is not considered if it would result in
   missing data points.
