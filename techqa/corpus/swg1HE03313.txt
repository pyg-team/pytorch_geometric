LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Content Collector could not connect to Lotus Domino if the
   OU (Organization Unit) field of the Lotus Domino user name
   contained characters of the CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean)
   language group. In the Lotus Runtime Configuration, the Lotus
   Notes ID could not be validated, and the Notes API returned the
   error "The prompt for password was aborted by user". This was
   due to an incorrect conversion of characters
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix pack, the user validation works if the OU
   contains CJK characters.
