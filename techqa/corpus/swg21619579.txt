tcr; ifix TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.0 does not support using any Mozilla Firefox ESR or Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 browsers unless Tivoli Common Reporting 2.1.1.0 interim fix 6 has been applied. 

SYMPTOM
Firefox ESR 

When Cognos Report Studio is opened, the menu bar is frozen and Report Studio cannot be used. 

Internet Explorer 9 

No errors were encountered, but the underlying components did not have official support for it.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You have three separate options to resolve the browser support issues with Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.0. Choose the one that works best for you. 

 

 1. Apply Tivoli Common Reporting 2.1.1.0 interim fix 6 to your Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.0 environment. See steps listed below. 
 2. Use another certified browser, such as Internet Explorer 8 or Firefox 3.6. Older versions of the Firefox browser are available on the Mozilla web site [http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-older-version-of-firefox]. 
 3. Upgrade to Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.1, when available.
