APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The JVM heap fills up after processing a number of reliable,
   persistent messages, resulting in an OutOfMemory error.
   
   For example:
   A 512MB heap fills up after running about 700 reliable,
   persistent messages for about 20 minutes.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An OutOfMemory exception may occur when a network connection
   to a messaging engine is used for a large number of separate
   XA transactions.
   
   The problem was that a piece of state was being associated
   with the connection for each XA transaction, and was not
   cleared up until the connection was closed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The XA transaction references are removed once the transaction
   is committed or rolled-back so that there is no build-up of
   these objects. This fix ensures that this OutOfMemory exception
   can no longer occur.
   
   APAR PK55043 is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
   Level (Fix Pack) 6.1.0.15 of WebSphere Application Server V6.1
   for z/OS.
