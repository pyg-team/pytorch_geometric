ABSTRACT
 This Support Technical Exchange clarifies the meaning of the most important CICS performance class monitoring fields. It shows how to access these fields in a dump, and how to use them to identify the source of performance problems. This presentation was created at the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) 3.2 level, but most of the information still applies; however things like offsets might have changed. New tools are also available, like CICS Performance Analyzer for z/OS, that can assist in analyzing performance.
