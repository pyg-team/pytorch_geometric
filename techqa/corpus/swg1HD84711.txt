PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 20 GA LEVEL.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED
   ON V5R19SP05
   It is a normal behavior to not display the material
   (even the first time)
   Explanations:
   With HD2 configuration, RT1 licence is available.
   With this licence, it is not allowed to display and
   modify some kinds of materials, like the 3D
   Materials (they are identified in material library by
   a little axis in thumbnail). These materials are for
   photostudio and for 3D rendering. They can only be
   created with PSO licence, and can only be
   visualized and modified with RTR or PHS licence. A
   correction was done in Material Library window to
   avoid displaying such materials in 3D and in
   properties panel.
