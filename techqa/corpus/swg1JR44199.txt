ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When entering a snapshot within a track, the new snapshot name
   is a combination of the parent track plus new snapshot. Users
   can enter snapshot names up to 64 characters in this field.
   however, at this point of making a snapshot, the saved snapshot
   name is track + snapshot, and the maxium length is still 64
   characters. Text box needs to have a built in (64-track) lenth
   which will vary with process app to proess app.
   
   Servicability
   
   1. create process app
   2. create snapshot in authoring environment on the process
   center
   console side, not in the application it self. by pasting in a
   string
   which is longer than 64 characters
   eg:
   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogThe quick brown fox
   jumps
   over the lazy dog
   
   3. text box truncates name to 64 characters
   4. create track from this snapshot with a string greater than 64
   characters. Name is truncated to 64 characters, and created
   5. open the named track.
   6. create a snapshot within this track
   7. from this snapshot create a new worksapce which is exatly 64
   characters. This will error out with an error such as the
   following
   
   com.lombardisoftware.gwtcommon.client.RepositoryException:
   com.lombardisoftware.client.delegate.BusinessDelegateException:
