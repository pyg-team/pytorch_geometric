   INVALID GL ACCOUNT WHEN TRYING TO RECORD ACTUALS AGAINST AN
   ASSET THAT HAS NO LOCATION OR GL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem could not be reproduced. It works in the same way
   for both asset with no glaccount as well as location with no gl
   account associated with a workorder and creating labor actuals
   for this workorder. When the GL validation is turned on, the gl
   debit and credit accounts are required and should not be
   partial.
