 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 PowerKVM is affected by several vulnerabilities in GNU glibc. These vulnerabilities are now fixed. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nss_dns backend for the getaddrinfo() function when performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110662] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 
CVEID: CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the writing of DNS queries to random file descriptors under high load by the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1472 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1472]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by stdio-common/vfscanf.c. By sending an overly long string, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1473 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1473]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in stdio-common/vfscanf.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a failed alloca and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100636 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100636] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the gethostbyname_r() and other related functions. By sending a specially-crafted argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system elevated privileges or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-5229 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5229]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the return of memory areas containing non-zero bytes by the calloc implementation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash or hang.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110711 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/110711] [https://psirt.raleigh.ibm.com/teamworks/fauxRedirect.lsw?applicationInstanceId=null&zWorkflowState=2&zTaskId=t16322897&applicationId=1&coachDebugTrace=none&zComponentName=CoachNG&zComponentId=3028.3afd0162-546e-4771-a009-189cbc153d2a&zDbg=0]for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-5277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5277]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system, caused by a heap corruption error in the nss_files backend for the Name Service Switch. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
