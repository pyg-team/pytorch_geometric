Title: IBM Conflict between WebSphere Portal Express and WebSphere Portal Remote Search installers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The IBM Installation Manager repositories for WebSphere Portal Express V8.5 and WebSphere Portal Remote Search V8.5 both contain a file named wp.im.config_8.5.0.201404242150.zip. The file name is the same for both releases, but the file content is different between the two. If both of these repositories are active in Installation Manager at the same time and one of the two products is selected for installation, the wrong version of the conflicting file may get loaded, which will cause the product installation to fail.

SYMPTOM
An error such as the following may appear in the console and/or in the Installation Manager log. (The example shown is from IBM i; paths may be different on your system.) 

A problem occurred during the execution of the /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalRemoteSearch/imfiles/config/wp.im_prs_cfg.xml file. 
java.io.FileNotFoundException: /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalRemoteSearch/imfiles/config/wp.im_prs_cfg.xml (A file or directory in the path name does not exist.) [null:0] 


CAUSE
The file wp.im.config_8.5.0.201404242150.zip exists in two product images, but the two files are not identical. If the wrong file happens to be loaded during product installation, the installation will fail.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look in the Installation Manager Shared Data location to determine which copy of the wp.im.config_8.5.0.201404242150.zip file was loaded. 

This path varies by user, but typical locations are: 

Windows: C:\IBM\IMShared\native/
Unix: /opr/IBM/IMShared/native/
IBM i: /QIBM/UserData/InstallationManager/IMShared/native/

The size of the file will indicate which product it was loaded from:
* WebSphere Portal Express: wp.im.config_8.5.0.201404242150.zip = 29536 bytes
* Portal Remote Search: wp.im.config_8.5.0.201404242150.zip = 1289 bytes

If the file in your IMShared directory is not from the product you are currently installing, then you have hit this problem.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem: 

1. Cancel the failed installation and clean up any leftover files (including any Portal profiles that may have been created during the failed installation). This typically may include directories such as:
- For Portal Remote Search:
- WebSphere/PortalRemoteSearch
- WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/prs_profile 

- For Portal Express:
- WebSphere/PortalServer
- WebSphere/wp_profile 

2. Launch Installation Manager and ensure that only one of the two conflicting repositories is active. If you are trying to install Portal Remote Search, then disable the Portal Express repository; if you are trying to install Portal Express, then disable the Portal Remote Search repository. 

3. Install the desired product again using the normal process. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Note: In order to install both Portal Express and Portal Remote Search server on the same machine, you must use two different copies of Installation Manager. It is possible to install two separate versions of Installation Manager on the same system if you do so with different login users. Then you can use one copy of IM to install Portal Express and the other to install Remote Search. 

Note that Portal Express is the only offering that conflicts. All other offerings (Portal Server, Portal Enable, Portal Extend, and Web Content Management) can be installed on the same machine as Portal Remote Search server, but you must install the Remote Search server first.
