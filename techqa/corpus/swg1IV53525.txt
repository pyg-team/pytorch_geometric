ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   When I try to create a PO from the RFQ Application, I m getting
   error
   BMXAA4190E   (my DVL Value) is not in the Value List.
   I m using the old PSDI/MRO crossover fields PR2 > PO2 and PR2 >
   RFQ2
   for  my TAC# field, I have a Domain Value List assigned to
   these fields
   and I also have Conditional Domain between the PR.SHIPVIA,
   PO.SHIPVIA
   AND RFQ.SHIPVIA and PR2/PO2/RFQ2.
   My intention is first pass the data from the PR2 field to
   either the PO.
   PO2 or RFQ.RFQ2  when creating a PO from either the PR
   application or
   the RFQ Application  and based on the shipvia  selected give
   the user
   the proper TAC# for that particular Ship Via.
   The conditional Domain work fine  on all applications PR/PO/RFQ
   and the
   PO creation works fine from the PR application but when I try
   to create
   the PO from the RFQ application I get the error. (On the Domain
   Condition for the TAC# if  do not use any object).If I use an
   Object
   like the PR Table then the conditional Domain works only on the
   PR
   application. The PO creation works fine on both applications PR
   and
   RFQ. (I don t get any errors).
   I want to be able to use the Conditional domain on the PR and PO
   Application and create the PO from the PR and RFQ Application.
   Could
   you please let me know what I m missing. Attached are some
   screen shots.
   
   
   
   ACTION TAKEN:
   
   Replicated the issue.
   
   
   STEPS TO REPLICATE:
   
   1. Go to Conditional Expression Manager
   Create a new condition:
   
   :shipvia = 'Air'
   
   
   2. Go to Domains application
   
   Create a new ALN Domain X_TAG (Length 10)
   
   Values:
   - JVPP
   - N/A
   - T371 (Add the condition to this value)
   
   
   3. Bring up the SHIPVIA Domain.
   Add a new ALN value:
   
   - Air
   
   
   4. Go to Database Configuration
   
   Add the X_TAG domain to the following attributes:
   
   - Object RFQ, Attribute RFQ2
   - Object PR, Attribute PR2
   - Object PO, Attribute PO2
   
   Apply the configuration Changes
   
   
   5. Add the fields to the applications
   
   - Add the RFQ2 field to the RFQ application
   - Add the PR2 field to the PR application
   - Add the PO2 field to the PO application
   
   
   TEST 1
   
   Go Request for Quotations app
   Create a new record and fill the attributes as follow:
   
   Ship Via -> Air
   RFQ2 -> T371
   
   Add the RFQ Line, Vendor and do the Quotation.
   
   In the Quotations tab, change the status to "SENT".
   
   In the 'Quotations for Vendor' section, clcik "Select RFQ
   Lines"
   Select the line and add a value to the Unit Cost field. Eg: 1.
   Check the 'Awarded?' checkbox.
   Save the record.
   
   In the Vendors section, click the 'Create PO' button.
   
   When you try to create the PO you get the following error
   message:
   
   BMXAA4190E - Po2 T371 is not in the value list.
   
   
   
   TEST 2
   
   Go to Purchase Request app
   Create a new record and fill the attributes as follow:
   
   Ship Via -> Air
   RFQ2 -> T371
   
   Add a new PRLINE, approve the PR.
   Click Select Action -> Create PO.
   
   The PO is created fine.
   
   If you go to the created PO record the Ship Via will be Air and
   the Po2
   will be T371 as expected.
