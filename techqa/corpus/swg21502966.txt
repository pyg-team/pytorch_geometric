when no DB2 instance is created.

Please note install will be completed successfully even though the above error is reported, 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Please verify the install log and check if the registration failed, as seen in the above sample log. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is currently a limitation in the installer in the scenario where an instance is not created during a silent install. db2olfen.dll must be manually registered after the installation is complete. 

Please make sure <InstallPath>\bin is included in the %PATH% Windows environment variable prior to running the register command.


 *  To verify if the PATH environment variable contains the <InstallPath>\bin directory, please run the following command 
   
   echo %PATH%
   
   This will be used to output the current directories included in the PATH environment variable.
   
   If the <InstallPath>\bin is not listed in the PATH environment variable then please add it. 
   
   This can be either added temporarily to the PATH variable in your command window session by running a command like:
   set PATH=%PATH%;<InstallPath>\bin prior to registering OLE. 
 * 
 * 
 *  Right-click on My Computer -> Properties Click on the Advanced tab then select the Environment Variables option Check the <InstallPath>\bin directory is listed in the PATH variable if not then please add it.
