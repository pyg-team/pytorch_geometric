APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM InfoSphere MDM Server for PIM provides "Search Templates" to
   create predefined searches which can be executed by users.
   Further, it is possible to create a default Search Template
   which will be display/selected when the Search Template list is
   opened in the left navigation pane.
   
   If such a default Search Template has been defined and is
   displayed in the left navigation pane it can overwrite the
   search conditions of other non-default Search Templates. If a
   user is selecting another non-default Search Template from the
   drop down list the search conditions will be correctly displayed
   in the left navigation pane. But when modifying (click on
   "Modify") the search conditions of the default Search Template
   will be displayed and used for the search in the main pane which
   can cause wrong search results.
   
   
   Steps for reproduction:
   1.) Have a catalog with a spec containing a few attributes
   (indexed)
   2.) Create a Search Template that is using an attribute (let's
   say "a1") for the search.
   3.) Save this Search Template as default.
   4.) Create another Search Template that is using another
   attribute (let's say "a2") for the search.
   5.) Save this Search Template (non-default).
   6.) Refresh the drop down box of Search Template in the left
   navigation bar.
   7.) Select the default Search Template and click "Modify" to
   open the Search Template in the main pane. All search conditions
   are displayed as originally defined.
   8.) Select the non-default Search Template from the drop down
   list in the left navigation pane and click "Modify". In the main
   pain, there will be not displayed the search conditions as
   defined but the search conditions of the default Search Template
   (attribute "a1" will appear).
