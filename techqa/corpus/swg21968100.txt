QUESTION
 How do you configure the QRadar Network Security (XGS) sensor to detect credit card information? 

ANSWER
The XGS scans for credit card traffic using the Content_Analyzer_Credit_Card_Num signature. This signature is part of the Default IPS inspection object and has the following default states depending on the X-Force Protection Level settings in use:


X-Force Protection Level Content_Analyzer_Credit_Card_Num status None Disabled Moderate Disabled Aggressive Enabled Paranoid Enabled 
If you have have this setting configured to None or Moderate, you can still use the signature. To do so, you must to edit the Default IPS object in your Intrusion Prevention Policy and enable the signature manually. 

Once you have manually enabled the signature or verified that your IPS object has it enabled by default, you will need to add an additional tuning parameter to the sensor to enable content analysis. Follow the instructions listed below to add this parameter: 
 1. Open the Advanced Tuning Parameters policy.  * If the sensor is registered to SiteProtector, right click the agent from the Agent view and select Manage Policy. 
     * If the sensor is not registered with SiteProtector, access the Local Management Interface (LMI) and navigate to Manage System Settings > Advanced Tuning Parameters.
       
    
    
 2. Add the following parameter and ensure that its value is set to true:
    
    Name: pam.ca.enabled
    Value: true
    
 3. Save and deploy the policy.
