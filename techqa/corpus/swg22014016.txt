Title: IBM Why are the certificate Subject and Issuer fields sometimes blank for Connect:Direct for z/OS statistics? - United States

Text:
CDZ TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS is the SNODE, statistics do not display the certificate Subject and Issuer. 

CAUSE
Connect:Direct for z/OS statistics show the Subject and issuer for a certificate.

In this case, the PNODE shows the following:

TLS V1.2 Enabled => Yes Encrypt.Data=Y 
TLS Ciphersuite => TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
Subject => (SN=57:8d:58:a1:00:04:5f:1a/C=US/O=IBM/CN=cd52b/)
Issuer => (C=US/O=IBM/CN=cd52b/) 

On the SNODE those fields are blank:

TLS V1.2 Enabled => Yes Encrypt.Data=Y 
TLS Ciphersuite => TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
Subject => () 
Issuer => () 


ANSWER
The certificate information on the SNODE is not displayed. This is working as designed. 

Note that if you are performing optional Client Authentication, in which the Client's certificate is also exchanged, you will see the Client's (PNODE) certificate information when you are the SNODE.
