APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   
   Plain text messages come over fine from Maximo emails but html
   messages from Maximo communications do not.
   
   PROBLEM:
   
   If you recently upgraded the mail servers from Exchange 2008 to
   Exchange 2013 CU10 you may experience some issue as below.
   
   It is related to formatting of communications that are sent
   from Maximo.
   
   Plain text messages come over fine but html messages
   do not.  The html messages are coming over as plain text with
   the
   header below.
   
   This is happening with communications that include long
   descriptions
   that are formatted as html.  This is also happening with the
   email
   listener error notifications that include the email message
   where the
   email message is formatted as html. This was not happening
   before the
   Exchange upgrade.
   
   You may wonder if there is a way to have both plain text and
   rich text communications to be formatted correctly?
   The only plain text communication they currently have coming
   from
   Maximo is the PMWoGen email. The convertToPlainText property
   seems to be the problem.
   
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:  No
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   Steps to replicate :
   Log into Maximo as maxadmin
   Go to System Properties and adjust the properties as per
   scenarios below
   Go to Preventive Maintenance app and search for any active PM
   which is not due yet
   Go to Select Actions > Generate Work Orders and generate PM
   workorders ignoring the Frequency Criteria
   Enter a valid email address in the dialog box.
   Then go to Work Order Tracking app and search for any record
   Go to Select Action > Create > Communication
   Choose any valid communication template and send an email to a
   valid email address (Rich Text Format)
   
   Test is according to the scenarios below :
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Scenario 1 - From the Maximo side, if you use the following
   settings
   in System Properties app :
   mxe.email.charset = UTF-8
   mxe.email.content.type = text/html; charset=UTF-8
   mxe.email.convertToPlainText = 0
   
   Results :
   For these settings, the rich text communications look fine on
   outgoing
   communication templates. The plain text communications do not.
   They are now formatted without carriage returns.
   The plain text communication they currently have is from Maximo
   is the
   PMWoGen email.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Scenario 2 - From the Maximo side, if they use the following
   settings
   in System Properties app :
   mxe.email.charset = UTF-8
   mxe.email.content.type = text/plain; charset=UTF-8
   mxe.email.convertToPlainText = 1
   
   Results :
   For these settings, the rich text communications are messed up.
   The plain text communications look fine.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT: Extra spaces come in the email
   communication.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:  Email without extra spaces between lines
   
   ENVIRONMENT (SYSTEM INFO):  Maximo 7.5.0.6
