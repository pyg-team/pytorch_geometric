QUESTION
 ObjectServer Serial maximum value for 32-bit Object Servers 

CAUSE
32-bit limitations

ANSWER
The Serial field is defined using the INCR data type. 

For Netcool/OMNIbus v7.3;
INCR is a 32-bit unsigned auto-incrementing INTEGER that can only be updated by the system
INTEGER: is a 32-bit signed integer

The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits are 0 through to 4294967295 or -2,147,483,648 through 2147483647 using two's complement encoding. 

Therefore:-
1 day = 60*60*24 = 86,400 seconds
The maximum number of days is therefore, given one event a second;
4294967295 / 86,400 seconds = 49,710 days => 49,710 / 365 = 136 years

However INCR has a maximum value of 2147483647, which implies the following for a system with an event rate of one event a second;
2147483647 / 86,400 seconds = 24,855 days
24,855 / 365 = 68 years

The conclusion is that for the ObjectServer Serial to wrap in a year the event rate needs to be 68 events a second.

The impact of the ObjectServer Serial wrapping does not affect the ObjectServer itself, provided events are cleared within the period before the ObjectServer Serial wraps. In large multi-tiered systems, the risk of this occurring increases, since the event rate increases, the more events are handled at the Aggregation layer.

The other impact is on gates and historical databases, which use the Serial, or more precisely the ServerSerial to store data. Therefore it is important to understand the transient real-time nature of the ObjectServer data, and to archive and manage the historical and ObjectServer data accordingly.

A 64-bit Object Server will last 4 billion times longer than a 32-bit Object Server, before Serial wraps.
