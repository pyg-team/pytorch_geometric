ANSWER
After 

 *  
   The user enters a URL to Maximo 
 * The JEE server is configured for JEE server security 
 * The requested resource is protected 
 * The JEE server requests security authentication 
 * The browser displays the authentication dialog 
 * The LDAP server authenticates the user 
 * The JEE Server checks user for membership in authorized group 
 * The JEE server passes the username to Maximo


Once the user has been authenticated, the JEE server passes the username to Maximo. Maximo uses the passed username to match a username in the LOGINID column of the MAXUSER table. Note that the username passed is case sensitive. If the username passed is in upper or mixed case but the value in the MAXUSER.LOGINID column is lower, the match will fail and a Maximo error page will be displayed. 

 

The screen shot below shows the LOGINID column of the MAXUSER table containing the LOGINID of wilson. When the username passed from the JEE server to Maximo matches, the login process continues.
