Text:
7002eGA PRODUCT README

ABSTRACT
 IBM has tested various WebDAV clients with Portal 7.0.0.2, Portal 8.0 and Portal 8.5 and recommends some of those clients and notes limitation of other clients. 

CONTENT
IBM has grouped various WebDAV clients into 2 tiers. 

Tier 1 clients are fully supported. Client "quirks" (e.g. spec-inconsistent behavior on client side) may be called out as limitations or a documented work around may be required. 

Tier 2 clients are supported on a "best effort" basis. Issue or limitations that are found to be specific to a particular client may be documented. 

Client that are not listed in either tier 1 or tier 2 are not supported. These clients may or may not work with WebSphere Portal.
