Title: IBM Importing an  IBM Case Manager solution ZIP file results in a java.io.FileNotFoundException - United States

Text:
Solution Import; Import Failure TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using the IBM Case Manager administration client to import an IBM Case Manager (ICM) solution ZIP file, it fails with an error: java.io.FileNotFoundException: (source path).zip (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.)


SYMPTOM
This error is thrown only when using the Internet Explorer browser; Firefox and Chrome do not have the issue.
For example, here is a full error stack:
[11/18/14 12:38:21:831 CST] 00000140 SystemOut O CIWEB.ICMAdminClientPlugin Error: [servername @ fe80:0:0:0:c810:4400:c000:0c00%00] [REQUEST 18] com.ibm.ecm.icm.accm.services.UploadContentService.execute() ACCM service is throwing exception java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\IBM\CaseManagement\configure\properties\importstaging\C:\Import\TestSol_ICM5.2.1.zip (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.)


CAUSE
Internet Explorer has a configuration setting that provides an entire path statement to web servers. This parameter appears to be unique to all versions of IE; it has not been found in Firefox or Chrome.

ENVIRONMENT
Any version of Internet Explorer

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1) Using any supported version if Internet Explorer, go into the ICM Solution import function in the Case Manager admin client (IBM Content Navigator desktop .../?desktop=icmadmin)
2) Browse to the Solution ZIP file
3) Click "Next"
4) The error is immediately thrown and the import has to be cancelled

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In IE, there is a configuration parameter that appears to be unique to IE alone, "'Include local directory path when uploading files to a server" - By default that parameter may be set to Enable - it must be changed to Disable for ICM solution importing. 




NOTE: When IE is set to Medium security level, it automatically changes that setting to Enabled. When IE is at Medium-High security level the parameter is disabled.

Steps: 

 1. In Internet Explorer, go to Internet Options > Security > Custom level > 
 2. In the Miscellaneous section locate the "'Include local directory path when uploading files to a server" parameter. 
 3. If it is set to "Enable" - change it to "Disable" 
 4. Attempt the import again


NOTE: With this parameter at Enable, the IE browser will be capable of providing any remote web server an absolute path on your local hard drive, which could be considered a security risk.
