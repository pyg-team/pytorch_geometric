APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 23 plus FicxPack 2 on a
   Macintosh OSX 10.10.5. On this Macintosh you use English and
   Hebrew languages and the location of the computer is set to
   Israel.
   However, if you launch the application it crashes the backend
   engine.
   You get a generic Mac OS X application crash error on screen
   with some text referrring to a file name: libplatdep.dylib
   ------------------------------
   Application Specific Information:
   /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents
   /MacOS/../lib/libplatdep.dylib
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue is caused as the Macintosh setting for currency symbol
   was set to US Dollar.
   When you use the default settings for region Israel with
   currency symbol New Israel Sheqel you will not get a crash upon
   the launch of SPSS 23 for Macintosh. Use this as workaround for
   now.
   This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
