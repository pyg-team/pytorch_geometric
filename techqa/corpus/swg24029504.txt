PREREQUISITES


Supporting Documentation Document Description Release Information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021249] A description of the new features, known restrictions and links to other important information. Detailed System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021241] A detailed list of the supported hardware, operating systems and information related to IBM and third party software requirements. Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/chghelp/v5m3/index.jsp] Browse or search on-line information related to the deployment, configuration and usage of the product. 

Required products The following must be installed and operational before installing Rational Change 5.3:  * Rational License Key Server 8.1.1 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rational/v0r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.license.doc/topics/c_managing_lic.html]
 * Rational Directory Server 5.1.1 (Apache) [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028757] with iFix02 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24029864] or Rational Directory Server 5.2 (Tivoli) [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028147]
 * Rational Synergy 7.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24029577]
 * A supported application server (or use the bundled one) on the server machine
 * A supported browser on each of the client machines

See the Detailed System Requirements for more information. 
Central server compatibility A 5.3 central server can interoperate with the following versions of remote servers in a central server cluster:  * 5.3
 * 5.2
 * 5.1 with patch 06 (and Synergy at the latest patch level)
 * 5.0 with patch 04 (and Synergy at the latest patch level)

Always upgrade the central server first, as its release level must be greater than or equal to that of its remote servers. See Updgrade guidelines [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/chghelp/v5m3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.change.install.doc/topics/ch_r_ig_upgrade_guideln.html] for details and caveats. 
Central server migration Migrating the CRs of a development database into the central server database is not presently supported, but will be in a forthcoming fix. This means that once you have upgraded to version 5.3, you will not be able to switch to central server mode from stand-alone mode or continue migration of unmigrated databases. The workaround is to perform this migration prior to upgrading to release 5.3 (for example, though release 5.2). New central server deployments (which do not have CRs to migrate) are unaffected. 
Project security and the Rational Directory Server The new project security feature is not presently working with RDS 5.2 (Tivoli), but will be in a forthcoming fix. If you intend to start using project security soon, use RDS 5.1.1 (Apache) instead.

HELPFUL HINTS FOR OBTAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:
Before you contact IBM Rational Software Support, gather the background information that you need to describe the problem. When you describe a problem to an IBM software support specialist, be as specific as possible and include all relevant background information so that the specialist can help you solve the problem efficiently. To save time, know the answers to these questions: 

 * What software versions were you running when the problem occurred? 
 * Do you have logs, traces, or messages that are related to the problem? 
 * Can you reproduce the problem? If so, what steps do you take to reproduce it? 
 * Is there a workaround for the problem? If so, be prepared to describe the workaround. 

If you have helpful information to diagnose or identify the problem on your system, you can provide this data by following the instructions to exchange information with IBM Technical Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html].
