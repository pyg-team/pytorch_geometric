APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  FTP JES 'GET JOBxxxx' may result in a FTP Reply Code
   of '550 index x is greater than number of spool files.
   The x-1 actual files will be transmitted successfully,
   however a 550 reply code will cause SUF or batch jobs
   to report an error.
   VERIFICATION STEPS:
   1)  Obtain FTP trace with DEBUG=(CMD,FSC,JES) and DUMP=(JES)
   2)  Near the end of the trace, the following sequence will
       appear:
        JS0605 makeSSOBcall: SSOBCALL: SSOBRETN=4
        JM2739 jesDone: entered...
        JM2756 jesDone: complete
        SR1430 reply: --> 550 Index 5 is greater than number of
                          spool files for JOBxxxx
   KEYWORDS:
   FTP JES index jesgetallname
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1)  Ignore the 550 message if possible, the spool files that
       are present were actually transmitted before the 550
       message incorrectly reports an error.
