APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The issue applies to the new generation coaches. The issue
   occurs when a business object contains a property of type ANY,
   that property has been started with some values, the business
   object or one of its properties has been bound to a coach or
   coach view. During run time, when that data is returned to the
   server it does not contain the expected set values. For example,
   an empty object might be returned. The issue can occur for
   properties of type ANY, MAP, and XML.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use other supported types for all properties of business objects
   that are used in a coach NG (new generation).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The values of the properties of the business object with
   property types of ANY, MAP, or XML cannot pass through from
   coach NG. Therefore, the coach or coach view loses the data for
   those properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.2 that solves the data
   loss issue by ensuring that the values of property types of ANY,
   MAP, XML of the business object are maintained and can pass
   through the coach NG if the values are not changed inside the
   coach.
