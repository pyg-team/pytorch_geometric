Title: IBM Running macros on Release 18 on Mac produces unrecoverable errors - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm attempting to run some macros to do particular statistical analyses from http://www.afhayes.com/spss-sas-and-mplus-macros-and-code.html [http://www.afhayes.com/spss-sas-and-mplus-macros-and-code.html] . These ran fine on earlier releases of SPSS/PASW Statistics, but on Release 18 I get unrecoverable errors whenever I run them. Why is this happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem may occur when running Releases 18.0.0 or 18.0.1 under 64-bit operating systems. It has been fixed for Release 18.0.2. If you are running an affected release on a Mac OS, the following workaround is available:

Take the following steps to switch to 32-bit mode:

1. Open a Terminal window: 

Double click on the file /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app


2. Change to the Statistics install directory (assuming the default installation directory):

At the $ prompt, type the following and press enter/return:

cd /Applications/SPSSInc/PASWStatistics18/PASWStatistics18.0.app/Contents/MacOS


3. Run the following shell script:

At the $ prompt, type the following and press enter/return:

./statistics_mode 32


You should now be able to run thees macros without problems.


To switch back to 64-bit mode, re-run the statistics_mode shell script with 64 for a parameter:

./statistics_mode 64


On other operating systems, you must uninstall the 64-bit version of Statistics 18 and install the 32-bit version in order to work around this issue. We apologize for any resulting inconvenience
