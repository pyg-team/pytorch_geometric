Title: IBM How to implement Active Directory against multiple domains in Collaboration & Deployment Services - United States

PEM PES C&DS CADS AD Active Directory multiple domain security provider TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can Active Directory against multiple domains in Collaboration & Deployment Services? 

CAUSE
In earlier versions of PES, the Security Provider Information was stored in files within the installation directory (such as ..\components\security\authConfig). 
Starting with C&DS 4.0, this information is stored in the C&DS repository in the SPSSSEC_PROVIDERS table.
When setup is first run, the default configuration is pushed to the database and there will be a setup of .preUpdate and .reference files in the ..\components\security\authConfig directory. Every time the configuration is changed, a new set of files is created. The set on the file system is a reflection of what is currently stored within the repository. 
During server startup the security configuration is read (stored as BLOBs) from the database and not from the file system.
Use the providerExchanage command found in the setup directory to upload new security providers.


ANSWER
Steps to implement Active Directory against multiple domains: 

1) Navigate to C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Collaboration and Deployment Services\4.2.1\Server\components\security\authConfig 

2) Update the existing authActiveDirectoryLDAP.xml.preUpdate file to contain a unique displayName and id. Change the displayName, id and providerDescription to something meaningful. For example: 

displayName = PaulsActiveDirectory 

id = ADPRH 

ProviderDescription = PaulsActiveDirectory 

3) The first part of the XML, now looks like the following: 

<provider displayName="PaulsActiveDirectory" id="ADPRH" 

 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 

xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../dtd/authLdap.xsd"> 

 <providerManager 

 providerClass="com.spss.security.provider.ldap.LDAPProvider" 

providerDescription="PaulsActiveDirectory"/> 

4) Rename this file to something meaningful and save it into the setup directory. 

 For example: authActiveDirectoryPaul.xml 

5) Open a command prompt and change into the setup directory. For example: 

C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Collaboration and Deployment Services\4.2.1\Server\setup 

6) Run the following command: 

providerExchange.bat upload authActiveDirectoryPaul.xml 

7) This new Security Provider will to show up within the Server Administration under Configuration => Security Providers. 

8) You will then be able to modify the values for the provider and enable it.
