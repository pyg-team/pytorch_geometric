   testcase :
   Extract the zip file attached
   myjar.jar contain the class WTXException.class & WTXFacade.class
   need to run the class Test.class
   edit test.java and change the path to the one on your system
   
   in command line
   
   @set CLASSPATH=.;C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender
   8.2\dtxpi.jar;C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender
   8.2\m4java.jar;C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender
   8.2\java\core.jar;c:\yourpath\myfile.jar
   
   javac Test.java
   
   Start the RMI server
   
   java Test
   You should get this result

      End of Execution messages.
   
   This map execute well in the designer and in command server
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTX00031098
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   Certain map runs from the Windows RMI Server fail.  The map
   failures occur whenever using cards that include XML based type
   trees.  These same map executions run fine when run from the
   command server.
   
   Users Affected:
   RMI users that are running on Windows.  The only change needed
   is for the double quotes to be removed from the
   startRMIServer.bat and startDebugServer.bat files, which are
   located in the WTX installation directory.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WTX RMI server starts up properly on Windows platforms.
   Before this fix, the PATH was not properly set to include the
   WTX installation directory.  This prevented proper execution of
   maps that made use of XML based type trees.
   
   Delivered in:
   8.1.0.6, 8.2.0.5, 8.3.0.0
