ABSTRACT
 Microsoft announced on August 7, 2014 that, beginning on January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer that is available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates. Microsoftâ€™s updated support policy affects IBM Intelligent Operations Center customers who use Internet Explorer. 

CONTENT
Microsoft will not issue any patches or updates for an Internet Explorer version that has reached its end of support date on a supported operating system. Although IBM will continue to support customers who are using unsupported versions of Internet Explorer with earlier versions of IBM Intelligent Operations Center, any issues that require support from Microsoft cannot be supported.
For information about the current version of Internet Explorer that is supported by Microsoft for a particular operating system, go to the following link:

In addition, for optimum performance and security, IBM is encouraging all Internet Explorer users to upgrade to Internet Explorer version 11, where possible. IBM will focus resources on developing and testing IBM Intelligent Operations Center with Internet Explorer version 11 and later versions.

For information about the Internet Explorer versions that are supported for each version of IBM Intelligent Operations Center, see the Detailed system requirements for IBM Intelligent Operations Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27035952].
