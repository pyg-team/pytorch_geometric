Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Ant task that builds the WAR file for a web service or a monitored transparent decision service (MTDS) fails with a "JAXB can't handle interfaces" error message. 

SYMPTOM
The following errors might show in a stack when you run the Ant task provided to build a web service or a monitored transparent decision service in debug mode:

<an XOM interface> is an interface, and JAXB can't handle interfaces.
this problem is related to the following location:
... 

<an XOM interface> does not have a no-arg default constructor.
this problem is related to the following location: 

...


CAUSE
In Rule Studio, the MTDS client for Rule Execution Server wizard uses the JAXB API to generate a web service component. 


The "<class> is an interface, and JAXB can't handle interfaces" error message indicates a limitation of that API.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around those errors, you can add the following annotation to the XOM interfaces listed in the error message: 

 * 
 * @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(AnyTypeAdapter.class)


Refer to the JAXB documentation [http://jaxb.java.net/guide/Mapping_interfaces.html] for details.
