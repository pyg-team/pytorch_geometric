APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Documentation to be corrected:
   
   Enterprise Console -> Rule Developer's Guide ->
   Writing rules for the state correlation engine ->
   state correlation rules -> Attributes common to all rules
   
   Under the "id: section as follows:
   
   ****
   
   The following are attributes common to all rules:
   
   id
   Specifies the identifier for each rule. It must be
   unique within the correlation engine where it is
   registered. Periods are treated as directories.
   For example, if you have a rule with the identifier
   test.threshold, you cannot have another rule with
   the identifier test.threshold.1.
   ****
   
   Add text something like the following for additonal clarity:
   
   The following set of XML duplicate rule "headings" will fail to
   work as
   expected because of the way the rule-id is constructed:
   
   <rule id="duplicate.rule.efflevel">
   <rule id="duplicate.rule.efflevel.cleared">
   
   Instead, use the following rule_id values in the duplicate rules
   :
   <rule id="duplicate.rule.efflevel.a">
   <eventType>TPF_EfficiencyLevel4</eventType>
   <duplicate timeInterval="600000">
   ......
   
   <rule id="duplicate.rule.efflevel.b">
   <eventType>TPF_EfficiencyLevel4Cleared</eventType>
   <duplicate timeInterval="600000">
