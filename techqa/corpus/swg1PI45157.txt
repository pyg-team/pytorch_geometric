APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When MQ z/OS is upgraded to v800 from v701, JMS getter
   application running on WebSphere Application Server failed to
   get messages even though they were in the queue.
   
   It is because that xcsConvertStringToByteString has converted
   the JMSCorrelationID property to ccsid the queue-manager's
   ccsid,e.g. 5026. It has then tried to find the number of hex
   digits in the property. However, it is using the wrong
   ccsid when checking for a hex digit (using the input ccsid,
   e.g. 1208, rather than the current ccsid, e.g. 5026), hence the
   problem here occurs.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Message selection using JMSMessageID,   *
   *                      JMSCorrelationID or JMSGroupID fails to *
   *                      return a matching message if the        *
   *                      selector contains lower case characters *
   *                      and the qmgr is running in CCSID 5026.  *
   *                                                              *

   *                      calling MQINQMP on a qmgr running in    *
   *                      CCSID 5026.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When message properties or selection strings are converted from
   a String to other data types e.g. Boolean, Float, the qmgr ccsid
   is used. In some CCSIDs, such as 5026, the lower case characters
   are found at a different codepoint to most other EBCDIC CCSIDs.
   The conversion process accounts for this, however logic errors
   in this handling result in the reported symptoms if the value
   being converted involves lowercase characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CMQXCNVA is changed to correctly handle converting to/from a
   CCSID where the lowercase characters are at a different
   codepoint to the compiler's CCSID.
