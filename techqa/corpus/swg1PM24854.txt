   Managing Server: ITCAM for WebSphere v6.1.0.5
   Data Collector: ITCAM for J2EE DC v6.1.0.5
   WRM/T5: ITCAM for Web Response Time v07.20.01.00
   TU/TO: ITCAM for Transactions Tracking v7.1 Fixpack 2
   ITM: 06.22.02
   
   Environment Details:
   
    OS Information: SunOS 5.10
    AppServer: SJSAS Enterprise Edition 8.1.2 (patch level 39)
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
      Step 1: Install SJSAS Enterprise Edition 8.1.2 (patch 10) and
   apply patch 119166-39b
      Step 2: Create a cluster and add two node agents on admin
   console.
      Step 3: Install FP4 release DC,then upgrade to FP5 DC.
      Step 4: Stop node agent
      Step 5: Replace patch 39 level lib with patch 10 level lib
      Step 6: Start node agent
      Step 7: Create symbolic link to let configurator access
   startup script for the managed server instance.
      Step 8: Configure DC to a managed server instance
      Step 9: Replace patch 10 level lib with patch 39 level lib
      Step 10: Modify cluster level AM Profiler configuration,
   replace instance level nodeagent and server instance names with
   SJSAS variables:
   
   -agentlib:am_sun_15=/opt/IBM/itcam/J2EE/D/runtime/sjsas8.domain1
   .${agent.client.host}.${com.sun.aas.instanceName}/dc.env.propert
   ies
      Step 11: modify server instance specific files under

      Step 14: Copy loadbalancer.xml to SunOneWebServer's config
   directory
      Step 15: Restart webserver
      Step 16: Install and configure T5 and TU
      Step 17: Use WSWS to generate request
      Step 18: Login TEP and navigate to Transaction Reporter ->
   Component -> Component Topology workspace
      Step 19: Nodes generated by T5 and nodes generated by DC are
   not stitched together.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * Users who want to track web transactions from web servers to
   * application servers through WRM/T5 agent and ITCAM for J2EE
   * Data collector by Transaction tracking products.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * Transactions from ITCAM for J2EE Data collector do not stitch
   * with those from WRM/T5 agent.  This is due to incompatibility
   * in the data for IPSourcePort and IPDestinationAddress.  The
   * IPDestinationAddress was resolved by using the IP address
   * instead of the fully qualified host name.  The IPSourcePort
   * attribute has now been removed from kto_stiching.xml file.
