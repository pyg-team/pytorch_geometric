Title: IBM Unable to deploy SSL in Predictive Enterprise Services/Collaboration and Deployment Services. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After activating SSL, Clementine/Modeler job steps are failing to run. Additionally, it would appear that Clementine/Modeler streams and BIRT reports are not recognized properly as a generic icon is displayed for them and they cannot be added to jobs. However, this works fine through non SSL. 

When attempting to edit an existing job containing a Clementine/Modeler stream job step, the customer is seeing the following error:

Problem Occurred
Error opening the editor
Reason:
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key 0a7005340ac018e700000124fc564ee48072 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The most common causes for PES/C&DS to show problems showing stream icons or to complain of missing resource bundles has been shown to be an improperly set URL Prefix or an improperly created SSL certificate.

The key factor for SSL certificates is to ensure your CN (Common Name) property properly matches the full name (domain included) of the server your application server will be running on.

The URL Prefix can be set within Predictive Enterprise Administrator (PES) or Deployment Manager (web portion of C&DS)
