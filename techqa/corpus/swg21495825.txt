Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Explains the error message "service /res/j_security_check does not exist" when connecting to Rule Execution Server from Rule Studio/Rule Designer, or Rule Team Server/Decision Center. 

SYMPTOM
When you deploy a RuleApp from Rule Studio/Rule Designer, or Rule Team Server/Decision Center to Rule Execution Server, the connection from Studio to Rule Execution Server fails with the following error: 

Unexpected error: ilog.rules.res.util.http.IlrConnectionException: The host and port appear to be responsive but the service "/res/repositoryService" does not exist.


CAUSE
This error is generated when the connection is made to a server that is running, but does not have the Rule Execution Server Management EAR deployed and started.

Note: If the server is not started, or if the hostname and/or port are incorrect, the error message will be:

ilog.rules.res.util.http.IlrConnectionException: 
The host appears to be running but port "9080" does not respond.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the Rule Execution Server Management EAR is properly deployed and started on the server and that the URL used in Studio points to the correct host name and port number. 

If you are using a proxy, ensure that it properly redirects the requests to the server hosting Rule Execution Server. 

To deploy the Rule Execution Server Management EAR, refer to WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1: Java EE add-ons > Installing on <your application server> > Installing Rule Execution Server > Installing Rule Execution Server on <your application server> > Deploying the Rule Execution Server Management EAR, in the JRules 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC.html].
