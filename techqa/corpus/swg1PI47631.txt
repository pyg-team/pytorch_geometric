APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When viewing the Analytics Dashboard using Internet Explorer 11
   or Microsoft Edge, bar charts may not be rendered correctly
   (missing bars in chart) when processing a very large amount of
   data (1 million or more records)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, the Analytics Dashboard may be viewed using
   another supported browser (other than Internet Explorer 11 or
   Microsoft Edge).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of the MobileFirst Operational Analytics Console that  *
   * use Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge to access the user   *
   * interface                                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers do not fully   *
   * comply with the latest SVG rendering standards that are used *
   * in rendering the bar chart. When a large amount of data is   *
   * summarized in a bar chart (for instance, millions of         *
   * sessions per day in the 'Total Sessions' chart), the number  *
   * of sessions becomes too high when we use a unit-less         *
   * measurement, and the bars in the bar chart will not render   *
   * in these browsers                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The solution used is to no longer use a unit-less value for the
   bars. Instead, we moved to calculating pixels for the size of
   each bar. This follows an older standard for SVG images that
   Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers can render.
