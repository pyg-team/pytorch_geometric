APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During CSS server creation using FileNet Enterprise Manager
   (FEM), if the admin user enters an incorrect CSS authentication
   token, a generic error will be returned as "The Content Engine
   server cannot connect to the IBM Content Search Services server
   at located on host <hostname>".  This error doesn't help the
   admin user to determine the root cause.  It gets confusing when
   the admin person could ping the server and and check the CSS
   server to be up and running.  On the CSS server, a clear error
   message is being logged.
