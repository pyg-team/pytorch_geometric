APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When configuring a SFTP log target to a remote server, the
   Configure Log Target password field requires a value even though
   authentication can be by key and the password is not used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The user was observing a connection error while configuring an
   SFTP log target that used SSH public key authentication. This
   behavior was caused by the fact that a password, valid or
   invalid, must also be provided even though it is not required,
   nor used during authentication to the SFTP server. This issue
   was caused by an error in the connection protocol configuration.
   
   Fix will be available in the next major release.
