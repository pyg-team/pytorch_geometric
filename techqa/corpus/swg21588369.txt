EditLive!; Ephox; RTE; IE8 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using Ephox EditLive! over SSL in IE8 causes mixed content message to pop up. 

CAUSE
When EditLive! is placed onto a page, part of the HTML that is inserted includes a download URL for the Java Runtime Environment. This link is used so that the browser can offer to install the JRE if it is not available on that machine. Unfortunately, this URL uses HTTP, which Internet Explorer 8 reports as mixed content. There is no HTTPS URL for downloading the JRE. 

This should only happen with IE8.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can work around the issue by downloading the JRE and serving it up locally using a HTTPS URL: 


1. Update the Java level on the web server of your application to the current level.

2. Backup the file: 
WebSphere\wp_profile\installedApps\wps61\EphoxEditLive.ear\EphoxEditLive.war\jsp\html\EditLiveJavaEditor.jsp 

In EditLiveJavaEditor.jsp, add the following lines after this line: eljInstance.setUseLiveConnect(true); 

eljInstance.setLocalDeployment(true); 
eljInstance.setJREDownloadURL('https://(server base url)/jinstall-6u29-windows-i586.cab'); 

The revised EditLiveJavaEditor.jsp will look like: 

eljInstance.setUseLiveConnect(true); 
eljInstance.setLocalDeployment(true); 
eljInstance.setJREDownloadURL('https://(server base url)/jinstall-6u29-windows-i586.cab'); 


3. Save the updated file 
4. In the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, restart the enterprise application EphoxEditLive. 5. Clear out the browser and JRE cache 
6. Test

Note: If you run the update-wcm task the changes to your EditLiveJavaEditor.jsp will be overwritten. So you will need to make these changes again.
