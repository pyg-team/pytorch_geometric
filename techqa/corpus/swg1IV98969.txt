APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is happening because of the following sequence of events.
   The Summary field of the ScopeIDParent event is periodically
   updated to reflect the underlying children.  When all the
   children are cleared, of course, the Summary will also be
   updated to reflect that too - and some of the text that was
   there when "live" events were present, is now gone.  Because
   the historic event Gateway is forwarding updates to the
   event archive, the Summary of the parent event is updated
   there, too.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users who have deployed the event grouping extension in      *
   * Netcool/OMNbus from version 8.1 fixpack 14 or earlier.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * In the Event Scoping solution of OMNIbus the parent event's  *
   * Summary is derived from the Summary of the child event with  *
   * the highest priority. When the child event is cleared the    *
   * parent's Summary is again updated until the final child      *
   * event is cleared. When the final child event is cleared, the *
   * parent's Summary will become blank and would mean that when  *
   * it is archived for historical reporting, its Summary will be *
   * empty.                                                       *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Apply the maintenance vehicles listed in the Problem         *
   * Conclusion.                                                  *
   * For an existing deployment, the fix will require running the *
   * update SQL script provided as well as updates to any gateway *
   * mapping file(s).                                             *
