APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and IBM WebSphere Lombardi
   Edition use a redirect-login mechanism that allows a user to
   automatically (non-interactively) log in based on previously
   submitted credentials. You use this capability, for example,
   when you launch coaches from within Process Inspector. However,
   this redirect-login mechanism is vulnerable to
   cross-site-scripting attacks, potentially enabling attackers to
   run code in a user's browser.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The redirect-login mechanism sends a login page to a user's
   browser. This page is then automatically submitted by the
   browser back to the server, without the user interacting with
   it. The vulnerability allows an attacker to construct a
   malicious URL that injects code into this login page and that
   code runs in the user's browser.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that removes the vulnerability.
