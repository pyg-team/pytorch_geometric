Title: IBM In order to use the Database Wizard, at least one ODBC data source must be defined. No data sources have been defined ODBC Error - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have PASW Statistics Client version 18.0.2 connecting to a remote Statistics server version 18.0.2 on AIX. When I select a particular Data Source in the Database Wizard (in this case DB2), it requests my login and password, but then sits for a long period of time, and returns the following error:

In order to use the Database Wizard, at least one ODBC data source must be defined. No data sources have been defined.
The Database Wizard will close.

I click the OK button and after a similar wait, am returned to the Database Wizard, but the list of available Data Sources is now empty.

I know that the Data Source I'm trying to use is configured properly because others have been able to use it when connecting to the Statistics Server from different clients.
