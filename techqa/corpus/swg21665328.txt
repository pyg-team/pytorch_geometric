 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The thumbnail preview area does not display in the Document Information pane of IBM Content Navigator (ICN) search results 

SYMPTOM
The Document Information displays only the properties of the document, but the thumbnail area above the properties section that is supposed to display the thumbnail image of the document content, does not display.


CAUSE
Document Thumbnails are not enabled for the desktop

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit the target desktop's configuration and enable Document Thumbnails in the Appearance tab of the desktop configuration, towards the bottom. Save the changes and close the desktop configuration. Re-login to the desktop and the thumbnail area should now be displayed. 

If the thumbnail area now displays but the document content is not seen in it, that would require further troubleshooting. Please use the troubleshooting technote provided below in the Related URLs section.
