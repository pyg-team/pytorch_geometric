APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are using the Sentinel License Manager to administer
   "Network" or "Concurrent Use" licenses for IBM SPSS products and
   have configured your licenses for commuter use.
   
   Your client users of IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0, Modeler 14.1, and
   Text Analytics for Surveys 4.0, for example, however, have
   noticed a problem when attempting to check out a commuter
   license -- the Commuter License Utility launches, but doesn't
   display any licenses -- and again, you know that you have
   configured the License Manager properly for commuter use.
   
   You notice that you have at least one "legacy" license for SPSS
   16.0 or earlier present in the License Manager -- a license with
   a product/feature code of "0", which was the older feature code
   for SPSS 16.0 and earlier.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There was a problem that caused the Commuter License Utility to
   no longer be able to properly resolve feature code "0" licenses.
   This caused all license display to fail.
   
   The immediate workaround would be to edit the lservrc file in
   the License Manager to remove or comment out all licenses
   involving feature code "0" (use a leading '#' symbol to comment
   out a line in the file), and then restart the License Manager
   service.  In theory this should not greatly impact your
   organzation since any products with feature code "0" have been
   dropped from support for a few years now.
   
   The problem has been corrected in present releases of IBM SPSS
   products -- Statistics 20.0 for example.
   
   If you are experiencing the problem with Statistics 19.0.x, and
   have applied 19.0 FixPack 2, please open a service request with
   IBM SPSS Support for further assistance.
