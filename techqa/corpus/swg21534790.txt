QUESTION
 How To Configure AS2 Daemon On A Different Box In A DMZ (SCI71589) 

ANSWER


1) First make sure AS2 is working on the local system where Connect:Enterprise is installed. It makes no sense to try to install AS2 on the DMZ until it is working correctly on the local machine.

2) Copy the following directories all under ${CMUHOME.EN} and files to the DMZ location:

as2 

cpd 

etc 

javalib 

proc 

spd 

<architecture> (may be 'sun', 'linux', 'aix', 'hpux')

3) Edit and adjust the profile file under ${CMUHOME.EN}/etc on the DMZ machine. Usually, only the path needs to be updated.

4) Edit the ceustartup & ceustartup.trace files in the ${CMUHOME.EN}/etc on the DMZ machine. Usually, only the path needs to be updated; remove/comment out all daemon startup code except 'cmuhttpd'.

5) Comment out the startup for 'cmuhttpd' on the local machine where C:E is installed.

6) Shutdown & restart C:E UNIX. After the startup is complete on the local machine startup all the DMZ daemons.



Notes:

 * Remember that anytime you make changes to any properties for AS2 using the admin tool, you have to copy the AS2-Configuration.xml from the local machine to the DMZ machine. 

* When you define a port for AS2, you have to copy the corresponding CPD file from the local machine to the DMZ machine and restart the AS2 daemon.

* Do a 'cmufresh -e' if any schedules are created/changed. Hint: you should just make this ('cmurefresh -e') a standard procedure after any changes.
