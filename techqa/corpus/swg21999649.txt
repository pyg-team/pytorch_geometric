VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 

CVEID: CVE-2000-1254 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2000-1254]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of C bitwise-shift operations that exceed the size of an expression by crypto/rsa/rsa_gen.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms and decrypt data.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113136 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113136] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2180 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-3036 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3036]
DESCRIPTION: IBM Cognos TM1 is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing packets. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114612 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114612] for the current score
