APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you select "help" on the addNodetoDeploymentEnvDef
   command, the following parameters are listed:
   nodeRuntime - Comma separated runtimes for the Deployment
   environment, supported values are WPS, WESB, WBM or WBSF
   *topologyRole - Deployment Environment (Topological) role name
   *nodeName - Node Name for the runtime node.
   serverCount - Number of server that this node will have in the
   Deployment Environment
   topologyName - Deployment Environment Name
   initialPortAssignment - WBITOPOLOGY_PROPFILE
   
   However, you will not see usage information for
   "initialPortAssignment" in the Information Center or in other
   IBM BPM documentation. This is because the parameter is not
   actually used in the addNodetoDeploymentEnvDef command.
