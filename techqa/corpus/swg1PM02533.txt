   ****************************************************************
   Rational Application Developer supports multiple
   version-levels of WebSphere Application Server.  The
   version-level of WebSphere Application Server in the EJB
   deploy command-line documentation is not defined.  This
   generates confusion on what database versions are supported
   with which version of the WebSphere Application Server for
   the documentation under the -dbvendor parameter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following improvements in the Rational Application
   Development 7.5.5.3 documentation is added:
   
   In "The ejbdeploy command" topic
   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/radhelp/v7r5/topic
   /com.ibm.etools.ejbdeploy.doc/topics/regenc.html) added the
   following text:
   
   Important: This reference topic describes what is the
   syntax, expected behavior, and descriptions of each of the
   parameters for running the ejbdeploy command for WebSphere
   Application Server v7.0 from a command line. The syntax and
   parameters for the ejbdeploy command depends on which
   version-level of WebSphere Application Server you are
   running. If you are running the ejbdeploy command on an
   earlier version of WebSphere Application Server, refer to
   the following links available in the Information Center for
   WebSphere Application Server:
   -For WebSphere Application Server v6.1, see this version of
   The ejbdeploy command topic

   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/radhelp/v7r5/topic

   this topic is applicable to running the ejbdeploy command
   for WebSphere Application Server v7.0. If you are running

   -For WebSphere Application Server v6.1, see this version of
   EJB query to SQL syntax topic
   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/topic
