APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Process Designer obtains the address of a connected IBM Process
   Server from IBM Process Center. In some cases, Process Center
   can reach the address but IBM Process Designer cannot reach the
   address. This issue occurs when, for example, a firewall is
   between Process Designer and Process Server that is not between
   Process Center and Process Server.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that allows you to
   define a new configuration scenario key named AE_TO_PS on the
   process server that specifies an alternative address to use for
   Process Designer to Process Server communications.
   Ask the administrator to define this scenario key if the default
   address provided by the process server to Process Center, which
   is used for deployment from Process Center to the process
   server, is insufficient for Process Designer to Process Server
   communications. For more information about how to define
   configuration scenario keys, see ?Configuring IBM BPM endpoints
   to match your topology?
