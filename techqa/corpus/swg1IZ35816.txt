APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR addresses a DB2 serviceability improvement request.
   Sometimes it is hard to diagnose which ulimit settings had been
   active at the point a DB2 instance was started. Note: the
   user process ressource limits (ulimit) can be changed at any
   time later.
   
   This request should include two changes:
   
   We should dump out the current ulimit settings in db2diag.log at
   DIAGLEVEL 3 when a DB2 instance is started. Additionally we
   should dump out the ulimit for nofiles (RLIMIT_NOFILE) in DB2
   trap files under the <ResourceLimits> tag.
