APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the MSCS (Microsoft CLustering Service) with DB2 DPF
   environment, when the DB2 v8 (clustered) instance is migrated
   from v8 to v9 using db2imigr.exe on one machine in the
   cluster, only the nodes currently on that machine were
   migrated. The nodes on other machines in the same cluster were
   not migrated.
   The reason for this problem is that other machines in the
   cluster were removed from the "DB2CLUSTERLIST", which is
   under HKLM\Cluster\IBM\DB2\Profiles\[instanceName]. Thus, the
   failover of a node to another machine will faile because the
   service on the other machine is not migrated, so it still
   points to the old (v8) DB2 executables.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One fix the user can try is: To add those machines back to the D
   B2CLUSTERLIST after the instance migration, using the "db2iclus.
   exe ADD ..." command line.

   Install DB2 V91 FP6 or higher, and then migrate the V8 DB2
   instance.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem is fixed in DB2 V9.1 FP6
