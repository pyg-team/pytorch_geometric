PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to define a new IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) runtime using IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) fail because no server type is available in the "New Server" wizard. 

SYMPTOM
When you create a new server in the RAD Server view, you notice that your WAS type is missing:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21658051&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21658051&aid=1]


CAUSE
The Server Tools option was not selected when installing the product via Installation Manager, as shown in the following screenshot:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21658051&amp;aid=2]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SOLUTION 

Install the relevant Server Tools runtime version for the product, optionally including the stub, with Installation Manager. This will then appear in the New Server wizard for selection, as in the following screenshot: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21658051&amp;aid=3] 

 

Alternatively, you may install a stand-alone version of WAS which can be targeted from the New Server wizard to serve as a test environment or runtime. When creating a new server you will then be prompted for the installation location of your stand-alone WAS.
