 How to replace the JCE policy zip file (in an existing SI 5.0 installation) 

ANSWER


PREREQUISITES:
The instructions below assume all of the following prerequisites have been met:
-SterlingIntegrator has viable database & file system backups
-The OS user account that the SterlingIntegrator application runs with is the account performing the below instructions

NOTE: It is recommended that these instructions are tested prior to performing them on an environment that processes production data.


INSTRUCTIONS:

NOTE: In the directions that follow, "POLICYZIP" indicates the JCE policy file required by your installation
which will be either of the following (The platform & JCE vendor compatibility chart is detailed in the official
Sterling Documentation at the Sterling Integrator 5.0 System Requirements page):

jce_policy-1_5_0.zip(SUN Microsystems)
unrestrict142.zip(IBM)


1) Download the POLICYZIP from the JCE vendor

2) Stop Sterling Integrator; verify Sterling Integrator is NOT running before proceeding

3) Perform a copy/backup of the following directory:
<your_SI_install_dir>/jdk/jre/lib/security (for UNIX/Linux)
<your_SI_install_dir>\jdk\jre\lib\security (for Windows)


4a) To edit the sandbox.cfg file, navigate to the following directory:
<your_SI_install_dir>/properties(for UNIX/Linux)
<your_SI_install_dir>\properties(for Windows)

4b) Create a BACKUP COPY of your existing sandbox.cfg file named sandbox.cfg.DYYYYMMDD.THHMMSS
(replacing YYYYMMDD & HHMMSS with corresponding date & time stamp values)

4c) Edit sandbox.cfg and update the JCE_DIST_FILE parameter values to the correct location of the JCE policy zip file.
(NOTE: maintain existing "//" or "\\" in the directory naming structure for proper pathing)


5) Unzip the POLICYZIP file. Place the contents contained WITHIN the JCE folder (but not the folder itself)
in the /security directory from step#3, overwriting the files already there.

6a) Via the commandline, navigate to the following directory:
<your_SI_install_dir>/install/bin

6b) From /bin, run the following Sterling Integrator script:
./updateJavaSecurity.sh <your_SI_install_dir>/install/jdk(for UNIX/Linux)
updateJavaSecurity.cmd <your_SI_install_dir>\install\jdk(for Windows)


7) Once the SI script completes, start Sterling Integrator
