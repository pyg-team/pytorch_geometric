3. A small window called Language Preference appears. Click on Add button to add a new language.

4. In the Add Language window, select your preferred language and click Ok. Here, we would like to select Japanese (ja) as our example.

5. The language that is displayed when you access the portal is always the first language in your browser's language settings. Therefore, move the Japanese (ja) language above current first language using Move Up button (in this example below, English is the first language). In case your preferred language is already available in Language Preference window/settings, just Move Up your selected language to make it default.

6. Once finished, click OK all the way to exit Language Preference and Internet Options window.

7. Now, open or refresh any TIP portal/URL and the page will be displayed in your preferred language. Here, we are using Japanese (ja) as our example - see below.

Take note, changing Language settings in Internet Explorer does not alter your language settings in your operating system (OS).
