APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   When a request is deactivated that status does not cascade down
   to the people who are in scope for that request (their status
   remains at 'In Progress'). This means that to get a true view
   of everyone that is in scope for a matter you have to combine
   the request status & the status of the individual
   e.g. WHERE pscp_scope_target_status = 'In Progress and
   req_status = 'In Progress'.
   If this is the case page 334 of the
   managing_data_with_IBM_Atlas_Policy_Suite.pdf should be updated
   to say that you also need to consider the request status to
   truly understand if someone is in scope of an active request.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   update the doc to say that you also need to consider the
   request status to truly understand if someone is in scope of an
   active request
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  fixed in 6032 documentation (
   managing_data_with_IBM_Atlas_Policy_Suite.pdf )
