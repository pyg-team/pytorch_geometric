APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following abend occurred:
   CSQ1,ABN=5C6-00E20028,U=SYSOPR,C=R3600.701.CMC -
   CSQMCPRH,M=CSQGFRCV,LOC=CSQSLD1.CSQSTACK+00000146
   .
   Reason 00E20008 has to do with detection of an invalid SKB
   (stack control block).  Reg7 does not point to an SKB.
   .
   CSQSTACK was called by CSQMCPRH during a QRPL_ENDCTX request.
   CSQMCPRH calls CSQSTACK if myQRPL.hObject is non-zero.  In this
   case, myQRPL.hObject contains an address which points to a
   CtxAce and not an SKB. This leads to abend 00E20028.
   .
   A follow-on symptom in WebSphere Application Server (WSAS) was:
     BBOO0033W Processing for signal 'SIGABND' (18) with abend=
     005C6000 rsncode=00E20028 si_code='ABND_REAL'(170) si_errno=0
     si_addr=00000000

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ Version 7 Release  *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MQ Java application (normally WebSphere *
   *                      Application Server) has several active  *
   *                      threads connected to a V701 queue       *
   *                      manager, in bindings mode, using the    *
   *                      same RRS context when one of the        *
   *                      threads decides to end the RRS context  *
   *                      while there are active threads          *
   *                      executing MQ API calls causing abend    *
   *                      5C6-00E20028.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   CSQMCTXE has been invoked by CSQMCPRH for end-context processing
   and it returns 'thread busy' condition. CSQMCPRH has assumed
   that it can now free the stack (SKB) and it invokes CSQSTACK
   with an invalid stack address. This causes the 5C6 00E20028
   abend in CSQSSTACK when it detects that the address of the stack
   (SKB) is invalid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQMCPRH has a fix to avoid calling CSQSTACK when
   reason MQRA_THREAD_BUSY is returned from CSQMCTXE.
