ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading a WebSphere MQ client from V6 to V7.0.1.9, an
   application using the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS fails to
   receive messages from the MQ queue  manager due to the
   following error:
   
   com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedJMSException: JMSCMQ1046: The
   character set 'ccsid:937' is not supported. An attempt
   was made to send or receive a map message, stream message
   or text message whose body is encoded using a character
   set not supported by the JVM. In the case of text
   messages, this exception might be thrown when the body
   of the message is first queried, rather than at receive
   time. Only encode a message using a character set known to
   be available to the receiving application.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for Java.
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS.
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter.
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 OSGi bundles.
   - The WebSphere Application Server V6.1 WebSphere MQ messaging
   provider who have configured the WebSphere variable
   MQ_INSTALL_ROOT to point to a WebSphere MQ V7.0.1
   installation.
   
   who have applications running on Solaris or HP-UX, which
   receive messages that contain String data encoded using coded
   character set identifier (CCSID) 937.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   WebSphere MQ is built against a JDK 1.4.2 level. For platforms
   built using an Oracle JDK (Solaris and HP-UX), coded character
   set identifier (CCSID) 937 is not part of the base encoding set
   included with the JVM, and so are not added to the WebSphere MQ
   classes.
   
   The result of this is that when the WebSphere MQ classes for
   Java or the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS encountered a message
   which used a CCSID value of 937, an exception was thrown and
   the message was not processed, even when using a later version
   of the JVM which has support for these CCSID values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for Java and WebSphere MQ classes for
   JMS have now been modified such that, on Solaris and HP-UX,
   CCSID 937 is now recognised as a supported codepage.
   
   In order to use this codepage, applications using the
   WebSphere MQ V7 classes for Java or classes for JMS on these
   platforms need to be using Java 5 (or later).
