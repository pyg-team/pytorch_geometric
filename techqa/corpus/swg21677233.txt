Title: IBM Modified date of local files is changed after a firmware upgrade - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is the modified date of local files changed after a firmware upgrade? 

CAUSE
The firmware upgrade process creates a boot switch image. Local files are copied to this new boot image.

ANSWER
The creation of the boot switch image during a firmware upgrade process involves copying of all local files like configuration, WSDLs, XSDs, logs etc. to the new firmware boot image. This triggers the update of the modified date of all these files to the timestamp of that upgrade. 

(The boot switch image allows to return to previous configuration, firmware and user files after an upgrade.)
