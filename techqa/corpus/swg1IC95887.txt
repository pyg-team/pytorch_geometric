APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a transaction fails, DataPower populates
   var://service/error-code and var://service/suberror-code.
   
   ITCAM for SOA uses the WSM Agent on DataPower to poll for
   monitored services metric data.
   
   The WSM Agent does not record the suberror-code and this
   data is not displayed in ITCAM's TEP (TIVOLI Enterprise Portal).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The user observes that the sub error code was not shown in
    ITCAM's TIVOLI Enterprise Portal when a transaction failed.
   However, the
   var://service/suberror-code was populated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.11 and 6.0.0.3.
