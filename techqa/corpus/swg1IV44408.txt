APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   Approver Initials:    EA
   Severity:             3
   Reported Release:     622
   Compid:               5724C04EP Tivoli Enterprise Portal
   
   ABSTRACT:             Launch fails KFWITM069E with java 1.6.0.45
   and above.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   ====================
   The Tivoli Enterprise Portal displays error KFWITM069E if the
   Launch feature is used to launch programs paths with embedded
   blanks. For example:
   
   Target field, "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"
    -> "error: Executable name has embedded quote, split the
   arguments"
   
   Target field, C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe
    -> "error Cannot run program "C:\Program": CreateProcess
   error=2. The system cannot find the file specified"
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   ======================
   1-Install Oracle Java 1.6.0 update 45 or higher. (I used IBM
   Java 7.0)
   
   2-Start TEP in JWS mode (browser mode may fail as well)
   
   3-Configure a Tivoli Enterprise Portal Launch definition to
   launch Internet Explorer with a path specification having
   embedded blanks. For Example:
   
     "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"
   
   4-Apply the changes and Launch the command. Error popup will
   display.
   
   The error happens regardless of whether or not the command is
   enclosed in quotes although the message text is different.
   
   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
   =======================
   This issue is most likely related to changes made in Oracle
   Java, described at:
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u45-relnotes-1932
   876.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u45-relnotes-1932876.html]
   as follows:
   Changes to Runtime.exec
   On Windows platform, the decoding of command strings specified
   to Runtime.exec(String),Runtime.exec(String,String[]) and
   Runtime.exec(String,String[],File) methods, has been improved
   to follow the specification more closely. This may cause
   problems for applications that are using one or more of these
   methods with commands that contain spaces in the program name,
   or are invoking these methods with commands that are not
   quoted correctly.
   
   For example, Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\My Programs\\foo.exe
   bar") is an attempt to launch the program "C:\\My" with the
   arguments "Programs\\foo.exe" and "bar". This command is likely
   to fail with an exception to indicate "C:\My" cannot be found.
   The example Runtime.getRuntime().exec("\"C:\\My
   Programs\\foo.exe\"bar") is an attempt to launch the program
   "\"C:\\My". This command will fail with an exception to
   indicate the program has an embedded quote.
   Applications that need to launch programs with spaces in the
   program name should consider using the variants of Runtime.exec
   that allow the command and arguments to be specified in an
   array.
   Alternatively, the preferred way to create operating systems
   processes
   since JDK 5.0 is using java.lang.ProcessBuilder. The
   ProcessBuilder class has a much more complete API for setting
   the environment, working directory and redirecting streams for
   the process.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure the desired program is accessible via the Windows PATH
   statement and specify the target without any path information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When trying to launch an external application from the portal
   client application launch dialog, the command will fail if the
   directory of the target location contains spaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  As of Oracle Java 1.6.0_45 or higher the handling of the
   Runtime.exec method has changed behavior. The following link
   describes the change.

   876.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u45-relnotes-1932876.html]
   
   A change was made in the portal client to properly escape back
   slashes in file system directory paths that contain spaces.
