PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message DFHME0107 for module CJDMCT1x (where x is a NATLANG value from the SIT). This occurs when you start your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region for the first time. 

SYMPTOM
DFHME0107 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/DFHME/DFHME0107.html] applid Module CJDMCT1E cannot be found in the library.


CAUSE
Missing the SEYUAUTH dataset from the CICS TS region STEPLIB DD statement.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add SEYUAUTH to the STEPLIB DD. The SEYUAUTH data set is required in your CICS TS 4.2 (and higher) region if you are using CICSPlex SM or CICS Explorer. This is described in the CICS TS documentation in the topic Setting up the MVS environment for CICS in the section Authorizing the CICS and CICSPlex速 SM libraries [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/dfha1l2.html] in item 4 where it states the following:

When you prepare your startup job stream, provide a STEPLIB DD statement for the SDFHAUTH and SEYUAUTH libraries. The SEYUAUTH library loads the message files, therefore it is required for both basic CICS速 functions and if you are using any CICSPlex速 SM or CICS Explorer速 functions. When you define your STEPLIB DD statement, remember that all other libraries concatenated with the SDFHAUTH and SEYUAUTH libraries must also be APF-authorized. If any of the libraries in a STEPLIB concatenation are not authorized, MVS regards all of them as unauthorized.
