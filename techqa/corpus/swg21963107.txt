PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WRT agent has been configured to integrate with Transaction Tracking, but in TEP transaction reporter workspaces show no data for this agent 

SYMPTOM
TEP WRT agent workspaces show data and expected monitored transactions, but not in TEP Transaction Reporter agent workspaces


CAUSE
Possible cause is a mis-configuration of transaction tracking integration in WRT agent settings

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for Transactions with WRT (t5), Tx Collector (tu), Tx Reporter (to), WebSphere Application Server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the content of WRT (t5) agent RAS1 log file (<host>_t5_xxxx.log) and verify if contains, regarding TT integration :
KT5ENABLETRACKING = YES
KT5TRANSACTIONCOLLECTOR = tcp:<ip>:<port>

Possibly search in the above file on the string : TTAPI initialization

and verify if you found this error :




 TTAPI Initialization completed with error code [21]

This above error is documented in ITCAM4TX knowledge center web link at :

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Quite often, WRT and its transaction tracking integration is mis-configured, and in WRT configuration under "Data Analysis" tab, the 'Transaction Collector connection string' was not actually configured with a string; Sometimes the tcp: part is missing or removed, it must be set to something like :

tcp:<ip@>:<port number> 

example 

tcp:10.2.1.1:5455 

 

if the 'Transaction Collector connection string' is incorrect, reconfigure it while reconfiguring the WRT agent, restart the WRT agent and check next results seen in TEP. 

 

Windows example with default value : 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963107&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963107&aid=1] 

 

On Unix WRT agent, with default value as well : 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963107&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963107&aid=2]
