QUESTION
 How can I setup and configure RWP to use SSL and self-signed certificates when using IBM® Rational® ClearCase® ? 

ANSWER
 

The following steps can be used to configure your RWP server to use SSL with Self-signed certificates. 

This configuration assumes that ClearCase is installed with the Web component and that ClearCase is installed in the default location.

Before proceeding you should review the ClearCase Administrators Guide on the topic of Configuring the IBM Rational Web Platform [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_admin.doc/topics/rwp/c_configuring_rwp.htm]for further details regarding all the steps provided below. 

The steps below have been streamlined (from those provided in the ClearCase Administrators Guide) to utilize Self-signed Certificates.


 1. Uncomment the following statement "Include conf/ssl.conf" in httpd.conf 
    This file can be found in the following location" 
    "C:\Program Files\Rational\Common\rwp\IHS\conf"
    
 2. Stop the IBM HTTP server: 
    Start > programs > IBM HTTP server 6.xx > Stop HTTP Server
    
 3. Open ikeyman: 
    Start > programs > IBM HTTP server 6.xx > Start Key Management Utility
    
    Select : "Key Database file" from the menu at the top > New > Change the key database type to "CMS"
    
    Here you need to set password 
    set expiration time "365 days"
    Check "Stash the password to a file"
    Select "OK"
    This creates both "key.kbd" and "key.sth" files in the following location: 
    C:\Program Files\Rational\Common\rwp\IHS. You do not need to store the files here it is just the default.
    
 4. Restart the IBM HTTP server.
    Start > programs > IBM HTTP server 6.xx > Start HTTP Server
    
    For this next step you should already have the key.db file opened from creating it. If not, follow step 5 
    
 5. Open the key.db file we just created. 
    
    Key Database File > Open > Select Key database type CMS > browse to key.db >
    enter password
    
 6. From the menu at the top > Create > New Self-signed cert
    

We have to fill out the following information: 
label, <any name you give> 
common Name, the fully qualified server name: example:whatsthis.domain1.ibm.com 
Version field, select X509 V3. 
Key Size field, select 1024. 
Organization. 

Select "OK"
