2.5 APARs and defects included from superseded fixes
---------------------------------------------------------------

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0003
---------------------------------
APAR: IV60709
Abstract: NO CPU DATA WHEN HMC TIME ZONE IS SET TO BST
Additional information: If the Hardware Management Console (HMC)
time zone is set to BST, data might not be collected.
The data provider might use the incorrect time zone
because BST can represent more than one time zone, for
example, British Summer Time and Bangladesh Standard
Time. When the data provider sends the commands to the
HMC to collect the CPU data, the start and stop times of
the commands might not be correct and might not receive
any data. Also, data might be collected, but for the
wrong time frame. 

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0002
---------------------------------
Feature: 208626
Abstract: LPAR Memory Attributes
Additional information: The following new attributes are added in
the Server LPARs attribute group:

Current_Memory - The current amount of memory, in megabytes,
configured for the LPAR.
Warehouse name: CM0
Running_Memory - The amount of memory, in megabytes, varied on-line
by the LPAR.
Warehouse name: RM

In order to display these new attributes in the Tivoli Enterprise
Portal, use the Query Editor and select Server LPARs_V9 under
KPH SERVER LPARS.

6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0001
---------------------------------

APAR: IV47101
Abstract: NO CPU DATA DUE TO TIME OUTS ON HMC SSH CALLS
Additional information: In large environments, where there are more
than 150 LPARs on a server, the CPU Units used and CPU
Used Pct might display "Not Collected." The
kph_data_provider_<instance>_0.log displays the
following message: 
--
SEVERE: SSHCommandExecutor.call: Timed out while waiting
for `lslparutil -m "<server>" -r "lpar" -s s -F
'lpar_id|time|time_cycles |
entitled_cycles|capped_cycles|uncapped_cycles| idle_cycles'
--

APAR: IV50134
Abstract: NO CPU DATA WHEN HMC TIME SET TO GMT FORMAT
Additional information: If the HMC time zone is set to a GMT format,
for example, GMT-08:00, CPU data might not be collected
because the data provider does not recognize the GMT
format and will default to using the local time zone. 
When the data provider sends the commands to the HMC to
collect the CPU data, the start and stop times of the
commands might not be correct and might not receive any
data. It is also possible that data will be collected,
but for the wrong time frame.

APAR: IV50135
Abstract: NO DATA IN MEMORY AND PAGING SPACE VIEW
Additional information: The System workspace might not display any
data in the Memory and Paging Space views. This can
happen when the HMC commands:
---
monhmc -r swap -n 0
monhmc -r mem -n 0
---
return data in M bytes instead of k bytes:
---
Swap: 1992M total, 0M used, 1992M free, 2853M cached 
Mem: 24336M total, 4534M used, 19801M free, 480M buffers
---

APAR: IV50686
Abstract: NO CPU DATA IN NON-ENGLISH LOCALE
Additional information: When the agent runs in a non-English locale,
attributes "CPU Units Used" and "CPU Used Pct" might
display as "Not Collected" due to a Java problem. The
kph_data_provider_0.log will have a message similar to
this: 
---
WARNING: 
ManagementConsoleInventoryItemBuilder$BasicDataCommand.
processResult: An error occurred while parsing the N2 date
field "Fri Sep 27 11:35:31 JST 2013". Continuing. 
---

2.2 Defects
---------------
Defect: 207939
Abstract: Java CPCI - deadlock due to bad lock usage in some versions
of Java runtime
Additional information: Classloading and resource loading might get
locks in the wrong order, due to Java APAR IZ96933, 
causing the data provider to stop collecting data. This
fix prevents the problem no matter what version of Java is
running.

Defect: 208541
Abstract: Add log messages to show data sent to kphagent
Additional information: At log level of FINEST, show the contents of
the rows of data sent from the data provider to the 
kphagent process.

5.0 Installation instructions 
==================
This fix can only be installed over an existing installation. Use
the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix 
------------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the 
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment 
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation 
directory.

For example: 
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM 
> export CANDLEHOME

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
--------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the system that contains the agent code to be
updated. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>
represents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On
Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or 
an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for the operating
system for that agent. For more information on the "itmpatch"
command, see section 6.2. 

On UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to 
<TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004, the install command is:

> itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004/kph_aix526_tema_if0004.tar

5.3 Remote agent update
----------------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary
directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.
For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the
fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,
this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or 
an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the
"tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems
or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more information
on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004

On Windows systems, 
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t ph
-n <Managed system name>
-v 062203004

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t PH 
-n <Managed system name> 
-v 062203004

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is
specified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the managed
system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------------

This fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the agent
support files which need to be installed. Use the following steps to
update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli
Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,
or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (kph_tems_teps_tepd_if0004.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server,
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an extract
utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory
structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the
necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent
installation method to install the application support files.

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer,
6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0003 at

http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]

for download and installation instructions.

-- OR --

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to
a Java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below.

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the
component directory. The installer can install updates for
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, use one of the following
commands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is
located.

Note: Using the silent installation option for Linux and zLinux
operating systems requires the following files contained in
interim fix 6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001:
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin
Follow the installation instructions contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001.README".

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Optional. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and modified
for your environment. Do not update "response.txt".

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the "bin"
directory where Java(R) is installed. The
location of Java on your system might vary.

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer asks
for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components you want
to add application support to. For this fix, check or clear the
check boxes as follows:

checked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)
checked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
checked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the HMC Base
06.22.03.04 support to complete the installation.

6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Browser was running when the update was installed, it must be
restarted.


6.0 Additional installation information
========================

For additional troubleshooting installation information, see the
itmpatch.log in the patchlogs directory in <CANDLEHOME>.

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
-----------------------------------------------------
This fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the
agent baroc files that must be installed. Refer to IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide under "Installing monitoring
agent baroc files on the event server" in "Installing the IBM Tivoli
Enterprise Console Event Synchronization" section for more
information.

6.2 Additional information on using "itmpatch" command
--------------------------------------------------------------
The "itmpatch" command has the following syntax:

Usage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

where:
-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch


For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where:
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where
the fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive
letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
----------------------------

1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
installation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. 

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t PH

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'. 

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t PH 

Note: The component (-t) for the "tacmd listSystems" command is
specified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
06.22.03.04.

2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use the
"kincinfo" command on Windows systems or the "cinfo" command on
Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions
of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise
Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems
after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The displayed date of the build might not be accurate. This
is a known problem.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
-------------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo -i
