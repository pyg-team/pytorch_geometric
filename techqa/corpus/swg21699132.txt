Title: IBM Untranslated strings appearing in localised ICN and XT - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running IBM Content Navigator (ICN) or IBM FileNet P8 Workplace XT (XT) under a non-US base lanaguage displays a number of strings in English. 

SYMPTOM
If a user with a non-US locale accesses the Versions tab of a document's properties window in ICN or XT, everything is localised except the Version Status (Etat de la version) values. The Version Status is a system property for the IBM FileNet P8 Content Platform Engine (CPE) object store.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

CPE uses an internal lookup table to localize the values of the Version Status system property. Getting the Version Status text localized to multiple languages by either CPE or ICN is not currently possible. 

The only way to localize the Version Status property values is to update the strings list within CPE using either IBM FileNet P8 Enterprise Manager (FEM) or IBM FileNet P8 Adminstrator Console for Content Engine (ACCE).

There currently can only be one lookup list of strings, and therefore these values can only be displayed by ICN or IBM WorkplaceXT (XT) in one language. The procedure below replaces the English Version Status display strings to localised Version Satus display strings. After performing this update, the strings will *only* display the localised values, no matter what the locale is in your browser.

Procedure to change Version Status property text from English to localised language

FEM:


 * Use the FEM Query Builder to return and edit the Version Status Lookup Object - New Search 
   Select From Table = StringLookup 
 * Critera: AssociatedProperty Equal To {36321A70-7F6E-44CD-9B49-738615072081}
   Returns the Version Status Lookup Object > rtclk, Properties > Properties tab
   Select drop-down list for LookupList [List of Strings] > select Edit List...
   
 * Edit the Version Status Lookup Object:
   Click on Released - click Edit Item
   Click on In Process - click Edit Item
   Click on Reservation - click Edit Item
   Click on Superseded - click Edit Item
   Type in localised string for all of the above and click Update Item 
 * Click Apply Changes 
 * Click Apply, click OK
   
 * Restart the CPE server(s) 
 * Validate that the correct localized terms are used for each Version Status value.



ACCE: 

 * Log into ACCE. 
 * Object Store > Search 
 * New Object Store Search 
 * Class = StringLookUp
   Critera: AssociatedProperty Equal To {36321A70-7F6E-44CD-9B49-738615072081} 
 * Run 
 * Click on the returned Version Status Lookup Object > Properties tab
   Scroll to the bottom of the property list 
 * Click on the down-arrow in the column to the right of the drop-down list for LookupList [List of Strings] > Display or Edit Value
   (The following step must be done as one action - remove all and then replace each value)
   Without selecting any of the values, click Remove All, click OK on the acknowledgement. 
 * Add the values back in this order:
   Localised Released string
   Localised In Process string
   Localised Reservation string
   Localised Superseded string 
 * Click OK 
 * Click Save
   
 * Restart the CPE server(s) 
 * Validate that the correct Localized terms are used for each Version Status value.
   
   Changing the text back to English is the same procedure, except that the text values are
   Released
   In Process
   Reservation
   Superseded
