ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the process application or toolkits contains the
   sub-processes, and opened the process application or toolkit
   into Integration Designer(IID), the IID tools will generate the
   .cmt2 files and .wsdl files for those sub-process. This caused
   duplicated error occurs when user tries to publish the changes
   from IID back to process center.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Generated Interfaces for the subprocesses were not able to be
   deleted in Integration Developer.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Process Designer and Integration Developer Users
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   A guard to prevent the generation of WSDLs for subprocesses was
   not in place to prevent the generation of newly created
   subprocesses in Process Apps and Toolkits, that were already
   associated with advanced content.  Upon trying to delete these
   resources, code was present to prevent deletion of WSDLs
   belonging to BPDs on the IID side.
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   To benefit from this fix, it is necessary to perform additional
   procedures after installation.
   
   (Important: JR44923 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR44923] is an additional recommended fix. Perform
   these steps, if you have not applied JR44923 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR44923]. If you have
   applied JR44923 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR44923], please follow the steps provided for that fix,
   only)
   
   1) In IID, go to the default library and run action
   "Disassociate from the Process Center".
   2) Back up the library (in case there are changes the customer
   has in that library). You could rename it for example.
   3) Now delete the ProcessApp (or Toolkit) from the workspace,
   and choose to remove the project contents (Note, the contents
   for the projects other than the disassicated default library are
   still on the ProcessCenter).
   4) Now open the ProcessApp in the workspace again. The default
   library will be regenerated again.
   5) Compare the new default library and the one you backed up and
   copy anything back to the new default from the old.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed the issue by placing a guard and allowing the deletion of
   the wsdl
