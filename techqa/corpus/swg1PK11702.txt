APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WebSphere Caching Proxy does not correctly read the outbound
   request time out value.  The proxy will time-out the outbound
   read if it takes longer than 60 seconds even if the proxy's
   outbound time-out value is configured greater than 60 seconds.
   In addition, the proxy will erroneously re-transmit
   non-idempotent methods such as POSTs when an outbound
   time-out occurs.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Caching Proxy doesn't correctly read    *
   *                      the outbound timeout value and          *
   *                      erroneously retries on POST requests.   *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Caching Proxy doesn't correclty read the outbound timeout value
   and erroneously retries on POST requests.  This means outbound
   requests to target servers will always be timed out after 60
   seconds of inactivity.  Subsequently, the timeout triggers a
   request retry and for a POST, this is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Caching Proxy code now reads the outbound request time
   out value correctly and supresses retries on POST requests as
   per RFC 2616 section 8.1.4
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.0.2.3.
