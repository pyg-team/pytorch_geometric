APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When configuring or upgrading a Tivoli Storage Manager server
   using the dsmicfgx or dsmupgdx, ssh connections are used to
   perform actions. It is documented that the default ssh port (22)
   has to be enabled but the documentation does not state that sshd
   must also be allowed connections via localhost. The following
   error can been seen if localhost connections are not allowed:
   
   Unable to establish a connection
   All attempts to establish a connection as the instance user ID
   have failed. This could be due to an invalid user ID or
   password, or an inability to connect to the local machine
   through the SSH, RSH, REXEC, or Windows SMB protocols.
   Ensure that you have specified a valid user ID and password and
   that either SSH, RSH, REXEC, or Windows SMB is enabled.
   
   The /etc/sshd/sshd_config file should be reviewed to make sure
   there is no 'ListenAddress' specified, as that could prevent
   localhost connections from being established on the ssh port.
   The manuals should be updated to include this information.
   
   Initial Impact: Low
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected: V6 Servers
   Additional Keywords: sshd_config sshd loopback ListenAddress
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure no 'ListenAddress' is specified in /etc/sshd/sshd_config

   Proposed Closing Text
   
   Users Affected:
   All Tivoli Storage Manager server users.
   
   Problem Description:
   See error description.
   
   Problem Summary:
   *
   
   Problem Conclusion:
   
   In the Tivoli Storage Manager Upgrade and Migration Guide
   for V5 Servers, in sections  "Starting the upgrade wizard"
   and "Upgrading the server by using the upgrade wizard,"
   the requirements for starting the upgrade wizard were updated.
   
   The original text said that, if the Secure shell (SSH)
   protocol is used, the port must be set to the default value,
   22. The following requirement was added:
   "Also ensure that the SSH daemon service has access rights
   for connecting to the system by using localhost."
   
   In the Tivoli Storage Manager installation guides,
   in sections "Configuring Tivoli Storage Manager using
   the configuration wizard," "Configuring Tivoli Storage
   Manager using the Administration Center," and
   "Upgrading from Tivoli Storage Manager Version 6.1,"
   the requirements for using the upgrade and
   configuration wizards were updated.
   
   The original text said that, if the Secure shell (SSH)
   protocol is used, the port must be set to the default value,
   22. The following requirement was added:
   "Also ensure that the SSH daemon service has access rights
   for connecting to the system by using localhost."
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows.
