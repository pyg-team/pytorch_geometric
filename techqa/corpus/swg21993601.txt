Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop (CVE-2016-2177, CVE-2016-6306, CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 22 and 26, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop. IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6306 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6306]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing message length checks when parsing certificates. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for HP NonStop 3.6.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The recommended solution is to apply the fix as soon as practical. Please see below for information about the available fixes. 



VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix 3.6.0 IT08228 Apply Fix Pack 3.6.0.2, available on Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Other%2Bsoftware&product=ibm/Other+software/Sterling+Connect%3ADirect+for+HP+NonStop&release=3.6.0.1&platform=All&function=all] 
You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
CVE-2016-2183: In versions of C:D for HP NonStop older than 3.6.0.2, deselect the Triple-DES (3DES) cipher suite if it is specified in the Secure+ configuration. To avoid production outages when switching to another cipher, coordinate the configuration change to an agreed cipher with the security administrator of each remote node with which you use Secure+. The recommended cipher suite is AES128-SHA or AES256-SHA.
