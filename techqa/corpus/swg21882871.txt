QUESTION
 How to change the version of the Oracle ojdbc6 driver being used within an IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SBI) install to a different version of the ojdbc6.jar 

CAUSE
Need to update the driver version of the ojdbc6.jar to a more current version of the ojdbc6.jar

ANSWER
The process will differ slightly depending upon whether SBI is installed on a Windows or Unix/Linux Operating System 

Windows: 

1) run <si_install>\bin>dump_info.cmd > dump.txt command to verify your current version of the ojdbc6.jar. The dump.txt will contain the following section:
<DatabaseMetaData>
Product Name: Oracle
Product Version: Oracle Database 11g Enterprise Edition Release 11.2.0.1.0 - 64bit Production
With the Partitioning, OLAP, Data Mining and Real Application Testing options
Default Trans: 2
Driver Name: Oracle JDBC driver
Driver Version: 11.2.0.2.0
Driver Major Version: 11
Driver Minor Version: 2
</DatabaseMetaData>

2) Download the new driver from Oracle [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html] and replace the current driver jar in the following directories
<si_install>\dbjar\jdbc\Oracle
and
<SI_Install>\jdk\jre\lib\ext

3) Run <si_install>\bin>dump_info.cmd > dump.txt again and verify the ojdbc6 driver version has been updated:
<DatabaseMetaData>

Driver Major Version: 11
Driver Minor Version: 2
</DatabaseMetaData>
