Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using a derive node with the following function:

date_days_difference(to_date(HIREDATE), to_date(@TODAY))

and I use an Oracle data source.

When I run the stream, the derive node turns purple, but then I get the error:

S1000[1830] [DataDirect][ODBC Oracle Wire Protocol driver][Oracle]ORA-01830: date format picture ends before converting entire input string. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been fixed in Modeler 13.0.5
