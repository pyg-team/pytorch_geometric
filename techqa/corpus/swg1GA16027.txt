APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   Guardium STAP is causing AIX server hang due to a stack overflow
   when STAP receives packets from the Guardium appliance where
   the  data length is greater than 61k.
   .
   This was noted with the following
   Appliance is v9 p613, STAP is r81265, DB is Oracle 11g, OS is
   AIX 6.1
   .
   The issue is caused because STAP does not check if the data
   received from the network exceeds the predefined maximum data
   length (61k). So if data received from the Guardium appliance
   doesreach the maximum, the memroy will be out of bounds.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue has been fixed in
   v9 STAP revision r89990 and later
   v10 STAP revision r53234 and later.
