Text:
SMO; Infosphere CDC; Change Data Capture TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving an SMO error when attempting to start replication. 

SYMPTOM
Replication fails with: 

IBM InfoSphere Change Data Capture cannot run as a target due to the following configuration error:. Failed to initialize SMO.
Error: Failed to connect to server [servername] 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are a few scenario's where this type of message will be presented.
First, SMO matching your DB level is required on the CDC target server. If this is not present, please install and retry.
Second, the same will be presented if the login to the server in question fails. Once you have filled in all the instance info, try the browse option beside schema to confirm the login info is correct.
Finally, if you are using hostname, try specifying the ip address in the database hostname section. It could be an issue resolving a fully qualified name etc.
