 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I can see that IBM has released patches for the IBM Security Access Manager for Web and Mobile appliances, but I currently have multiple versions of Tivoli Access Manager for e-business and/or IBM Security Access Manager deployed in my enterprise. 

Which versions of IBM Security Access Manager are vulnerable to GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) and which versions are not? 

CAUSE

In January 2015, IBM was notified of a buffer overflow vulnerability found within the GNU C Library (glibc) function "gethostbyname". The following statement is the official Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) description for this vulnerability:- 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]

DESCRIPTION: The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.6

This IBM technote has been put together to provide clarification in regards to which versions of IBM Security Access Manager/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business are vulnerable and which versions are not. 


ANSWER
It is important to note that only IBM Security Access Manager appliances are exposed to this vulnerability. This is due to the fact that customers are unable to upgrade the underlying operating system provided with these appliances. The IBM Security Access Manager development/support teams have provided fixes to overcome this exposure on our appliances. 


The following security bulletins provide more information about these fixes: 

IBM Security Access Manager for Web

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695774 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695774]

IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695695 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695695]

The following software versions of IBM Security Access Manager are not vulnerable to this vulnerability:

IBM Security Access Manager for Web version 7.0.0 (software-based)
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1.1
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.0

This is due to the fact that these software releases do not package any part of the GNU C Library. 

It is however important to note that the underlying Operating System, which hosts these software versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Web/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business, might be vulnerable.

Therefore, IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.
