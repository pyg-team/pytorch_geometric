APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are reading DATE11  (e.g. 24-June-2011) data from text.
   However, your actual data values do not match this format
   exactly (e.g. 24 June 2011).  Statistics 24.0 is dropping these
   values and storing the system missing value ($sysmis) instead.
   
   To workaround this problem, read the field as a string, then
   restructure it to include hyphens, then change its type from
   string (A11) to a date (DATE11).
   
   * For Example.
   LOOP #i = 1 to LENGTH(DateVar).
   IF (SUBSTR(dateVar,#i,1)=' ') SUBSTR(DateVar,#i,1)='-'.
   END LOOP.
   EXECUTE.
   ALTER TYPE DateVar (DATE11).
