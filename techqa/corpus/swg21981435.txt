QUESTION
 Adding a (Content Platform Engine) CPE component to IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (ECM SM) 5.2, is there a procedure to add a CPE Client? 

ANSWER
This the link to the Installation Guide.
This is the same manual that is on the ECM SM Server.
https://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/c2749072.pdf [https://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/c2749072.pdf] 

Use this manual starting on page 332.
The Products Tab
In the Products tab the configuration for the IBM FileNet P8
applications / products is made. Every product
or component has its own tab, just as Content Engine, Application
Engine, Process Engine, Component
Manager and Process Analyzer.
NOTE Even though the PE and CE have been merged in CPE 5.2, ECM SM
still monitors
these components independently. For this reason, the PE and CE
components
of CPE 5.2 must be configured on different product tabs..
