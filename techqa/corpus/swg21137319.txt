Title: IBM How additional message flow instances scale for performance - United States

Text:
MQIINFO TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Additional IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) message flow instances can be scaled to improve performance. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Each message flow in IIB/WMB can be configured for a number of instances defined by the number of concurrent threads assigned to the message flow. These message flows can be run in a single broker on a number of different execution groups. The number of execution groups, which may vary depending on the number of processors in the physical machine where the broker is running, is also a factor in the scaling of the solution. 

Additionally multiple brokers can be defined in a WebSphere MQ clustering environment to further provide scaling. 
When you design your broker environment, it would be a good idea to review the following documents as part of your performance planning:
