APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Change CICS VT to process unsigned packed decimal VSAM data
   automatically and thus remove the need for an exit ( shipped
   as PACKC2F ). The change is implemented via a new field type
   in CICS VT mapping, which is 'U'. Automapper has also been
   modified to detect unsigned packed decimal fields in COBOL
   copybooks and implement this field type automatically.
