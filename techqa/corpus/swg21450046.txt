QUESTION
 How do you integrate IBM Rational DOORS with Rational Quality Manager? 

ANSWER
To integrate IBM Rational DOORS with Rational Quality Manager (RQM), you will need to install and configure DOORS with its Rational Quality Manager Interface (RQMI) components, as described below. 

These instructions assume that you have an existing IBM Rational Quality Manager server that is already set up and working correctly. You will need the Installing and using RQM Interface for Rational DOORS manual for your version of Rational DOORS. In the instructions below, RQM Interface for Rational DOORS manual will be referred to as the install guide. Please refer to the readme for your version of DOORS to see which versions of RQM are compatible with your version of DOORS. For further details about the DOORS installation itself, please refer to the DOORS Installation Guide. The DOORS documentation can be found in the Telelogic information center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rsdp/v1r0m0/index.jsp]. 

In this example, DOORS 9.2.0.5 and RQM 2.0.1 are used. There are three systems: 

 * RQM server: This system has RQM 2.0.1 installed. There is no DOORS software on this system. 
 * DOORS/RQMI server: This system has DOORS 9.2.0.5 installed, including the RQMI Server and Client components. 
 * Client workstation: This system has the DOORS 9.2.0.5 client installed, including the RQMI client component.


On the RQM server: 

 1. If needed, start RQM. 
 2. Create an RQM user account for the RQMI user as described in the install guide, and make this user a member of each project area.
    Note: The "Create an RQM User Account" section in the "Installation prerequisites" section of the install guide explains in detail the requirements for the RQM user account. If all requirements are not met before the RQMI installation, you may have problems using RQMI. 
 3. Verify that you can successfully log in as the RQMI user.


On the DOORS server: 

 1.  If needed:  1. Set up your licenses and License Server. 
      2. Install DOORS (first client, then server) -- do NOT include the RQMI Server and Client components at this time.
     
     
 2.  Start the DOORS client and create the RQMI DOORS user account as described in the install guide. 
 3.  Exit DOORS. 
 4.  Log in as the RQMI DOORS user to set its password. Exit DOORS.
     Note: You will have problems with RQMI if you forget this step, as new DOORS users start with expired passwords, and must immediately update the password before they can log in to the DOORS database. 
 5.  Stop the DOORS server. 
 6.  Uninstall the DOORS client, then reinstall it. During this installation, be sure to include the RQMI Server and Client components. Do a full reinstall for best results -- simply modifying the installation may result in RQMI problems. You will need information about your RQM and DOORS servers to install the RQMI components:
     - RQM server host name and port
     - Credentials for the RQMI user that was created on RQM server
     - Credentials for the RQMI DOORS user that was created on DOORS server 
 7.  Start the DOORS server. 
 8.  Start the RQMI server software as described in the install guide. 
 9.  Start the DOORS client. 
 10. Create a new module (or open an existing module). 
 11. In the module's RQM menu, choose Export to RQM. 
 12. If you do not have a custom view, you will be asked if you want to export the Standard view. 
 13. Then you will be prompted to select the project area and test plan you want to export to. You can create a new test plan, if you wish. 
 14. Click Export to proceed -- you will get an acknowledgement message after the Export finishes.
     You can use RQM > View Export Status to check the status of your export. 
 15. At this point, troubleshoot any issues found while:
     - Starting the RQMI server
     - Exporting to RQM from the DOORS client
     Refer to the Troubleshooting section below for the solutions to some common issues. 
 16. Once all issues are resolved and you can successfully export to RQM, you are ready to set up RQMI on the DOORS client workstation.


On the client workstation: 

 1. Install the DOORS client. Use the custom option to include the RQMI Client component. If the DOORS client is already installed -- i.e., a Typical installation was done previously -- please uninstall it first. 
 2. Start the DOORS client. You should be able to export to RQM as described above.


Integrating DOORS 9.3 with RQM 2.0.x: 

It is possible to integrate DOORS 9.3 with RQM 2.0.x using the procedure above. However, you will also need to do the extra step documented in Tech Note #1450503 before the integration will work. In a nutshell, you will need to replace all instances of /qm/ with /jazz/ in the server.properties file of your RQMI server. 

Please note that if you upgrade from DOORS 9.2 to 9.3, you still need to follow the process from Tech Note #1450503 if you are using RQM 2.0.x. The reason is that when you upgrade DOORS, it uninstalls the old version before installing the new version. As a result, the RQMI settings will be the ones that come from DOORS 9.3, which support RQM 3.x out of the box. 

 

Troubleshooting: 

If you get errors while starting the RQMI server, you may be running into a common issue with an easy resolution. 

Some common problems: 

 * You get this error in the RQMI server startup sequence:
   SEVERE: ERROR: DriverManager.getConnection(jdbc:derby:../../rqmdrsDB;create=false;user=admin;password=<encrypted>) Database '../../rqmdrsDB' not found.
   This error indicates that the database was not installed. To resolve this, stop RQMI and DOORS, then reinstall the DOORS client -- see Tech Note #1427768 for details. 
 * If you are getting access errors (for example, RQM RETURN STATUS: 403 in the exportIntegration.log file), verify that the RQM user account for RQMI meets all the requirements documented in the "Installation prerequisites" section of the install guide. If it does not, please fix the RQM user account. If that does not resolve the access issues, please reinstall RQMI. 
 * You get this error in the RQMI server startup sequence:
   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
   This indicates a that the RQM user's password is incorrect. You can resolve this by stopping RQMI and running the command to set the correct password:  1. On the RQMI server machine, open a DOS command window. 
    2. Go to the $DOORSHOME\RQMInterface\Server\IM\bin directory. 
    3. Run this command:
       admin -p <correct_RQM_user_password>
       See Tech Note #1413474 for details.
