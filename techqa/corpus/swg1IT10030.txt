APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user was editing an existing pattern using the Pattern
   Builder to remove an "On Demand Router" (ODR) component and
   replace with a custom node. They removed the component using the
   "Order View". After replacing the component they deployed the
   pattern.
   
   The deployment failed with a message that there were no "On
   Demand Routers" in the pattern.
   
   After reviewing the source of the pattern they found a script
   package contained a "startaAfter" dependency on the ODR
   component, even though the ODR component had been removed.
