 Attempts to install IBM Rational Asset Analyzer (RAA) Plug-in (RAAi) for IBM Rational Developer for System z (RDz) results in the error CRIMA1071E. 

SYMPTOM
You may receive a message similar to the following when installing RAAi in a RDz V9.0 environment:

The required components might be supplied by the following installation packages:
Package: Rational® Developer for System z 7.6


CAUSE
The RAAi installation program does not yet support RDz 9.0.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install RAAi 6.1 into RDz 9.0 by manually copying the plug-in jar files to the Eclipsedropinsfolder. 


Follow the steps below to install RAAi:


 1. Find the jar files by opening the RAAiInstallRepository.zip file and looking in thepluginsfolder for these two files:  * com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar 
     * com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar
       
       
    
    
 2. Find thedropinssubdirectory.  1. Right click on the properties to find the shortcut used to start RDz. 
     2. Look at theTargetproperty to see where eclipse.exe resides
        For example: C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP
        
        
    
    
 3. Create a dropinssubdirectory if one does not exist. 
    
    
 4. Copy the two jar files above to thedropinssubdirectory. 
    
    
 5. Restart RDz (Run as administrator)
    
    
 6. Verify you have an Asset Analyzerentry in the left pane after RDz restarts by clicking on Window > Preferencesfrom the menu.


If you later wish to delete this copy of RAAi 6.1, simply remove the two plug-in jar files that you previously copied into the dropins subdirectory.
