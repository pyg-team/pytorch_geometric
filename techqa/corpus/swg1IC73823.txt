 *  When WebSphere Message Broker is configured to use the WebSphere
   MQ Publish/Subscribe engine and there is a subscription for
   Broker statistics using the following commands:
   
   1.Subscribe to broker statistics:
   mqsichangeproperties BrokerName -e EGName -o
   DynamicSubscriptionEngine -n statsInterval -v 1000
   
   2. Create Subscription for the topic:
   $SYS/Broker/BrokerName/ExecutionGroup/EGName/Statistics
   
   3. Enable WMQ Pub/Sub print "alt qmgr psmode(enabled)" | runmqsc
   QMgrName
   
   4. Disable WMB Pub/Sub mqsichangeproperties BrokerName -c
   PublishSubscribe -o Interface -n psmode -v disabled
   
   There is a slow and gradual increase in memory at regular
   intervals of time irrespective of message processing by any of
   the message flows deployed to the broker.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users using WebSphere MQ v7 Publish/Subscribe engine in
   WebSphere Message Broker v6.1
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The objects associated with publish/subscribe processing should
   get cleared when the publish/subscribe engine is enabled.  This
   is true for both WebSphere MQ publish/subscribe and WebSphere
   Message Broker publish/subscribe engines.
   
   In the case where WebSphere MQ publish/subscribe engine was
   enabled the objects were not getting cleared.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the
   objects associated with WebSphere MQ publish/subscribe are
   cleared upon processing.
