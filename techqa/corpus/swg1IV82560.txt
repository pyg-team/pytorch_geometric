   PROBLEM:
   
   Result set not loading and inconsistent behaviour of Start
   Center Refresh.
   This behaviour is completely inconsistent. Some times it gets
   refreshed
   and loads and sometime not. The reported issue is on the
   loading of the result set portlet.
   
   When the start center loads for the first time, doesn't load
   the portlet.
   However, on pressing the reload button on individual portlet
   loads the data which seems to be an issue and our
   clients are getting impacted by this scenario. It resembles
   data not
   present in the portlet but on reload data comes up.
   
   On click of the Start Center refresh, the refresh completes and
   loads all three portlets present in the Start Center.
   On again refreshing the Start Center, only 2 of the 3 portlets
   gets refreshed.
   However, on the manual refresh of the individual portlet that
   did not load, brings up the data in the portlet.
   Again refresh the Start Center, and again only 2 out of 3
   portlets are loaded.
   
   Practically, everything should come up on the first load itself
   which
   is not happening.
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:  No
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   0. Open Maximo logged as maxadmin and see your Start Center
   portlets
   1. On the first load, one of the result set portlet doesn't
   load up.
   2. As suggested, clicked on "you can just hit the little "home"
   button
   in the upper left of the browser. "
   3. Still the portlet didn't load up with any data.
   4. Tried to reload the portlet individually and the reload
   button also
   doesn't work.
   5. Updated the Start Centre using the "Update Start Center"
   button on
   the top right corner and again the result set port let didn't
   load.
   6. Again tried to reload the individual portlet and this time
   the port
   let reloaded with data. This shows that this port let has data
   which
   not being displayed and taking a lot of hard work to see the
   data out
   of one port let.
   7. Again repeated Step 2, the port let vanishes again.
   
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   
   ResultSets not refreshed
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   
   ResultSets refreshed
