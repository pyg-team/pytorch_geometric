APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a RuleApp is deployed to RES, it includes the XOM URIs
   that it requires.
   But it seems that the order in which the XOM URIs are published
   is not taken into account once on RES.
   In other words, it seems that even if I specify a specific
   order for the XOMs to be used (to avoid class conflicts when
   the same class might show up more than once for example) it is
   ignored by the deployment process and the order on RES may be
   different than the one configured in RD.
   This is currently causing issues in the customer's projects.
   After each deployment, They must manually check the order of
   the RES URIs in order to make sure the order is the right one
   on RES in order to avoid issues.
   The issue can be reproduced with the project attached. We want
   the xom4 entry to be first. and although configured as such it
   does not deploy as such on RES.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually check (and correct) the order of the RES URIs in order
   to make sure the order is the right one on RES in order to
   avoid issues.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There is a need to preserve ordering of XOM entries in deployed
   rulesets.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
