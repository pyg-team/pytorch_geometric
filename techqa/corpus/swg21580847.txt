QUESTION
 What is the session timeout policy for the Atlas application? 

ANSWER
By default the application server session timeout is configured to be 60 minutes. For customers using the NTLM or Siteminder single sign-on type of authentication, there is usually an additional authentication session timeout that comes into play before the application server timeout is ever reached. This timeout is often shorter than 60 minutes, which can cause some confusion with users of the application. The authentication session timeout is under the control of customers' corporate IT groups, so it's not something that is configured as part of the application. If a user is inactive for a period of time that exceeds the authentication session timeout, that user will be forced to authenticate again when getting back to the application. If the user stopped accessing the application on a screen where data needs to be saved and a timeout occurs, that person will lose the data on the screen. We recommend for customers using NTLM or Siteminder single sign-on authentication to find out the authentication session timeout values in their corporate IT environment and make sure the users of Atlas are made aware of the duration to prevent work from being lost. If the LDAP authentication or database authentication is used, the application server session timeout can be configured to match a customer's needs if the 60 minute default is not enough. For WebSphere this can easily be configured through the administration console.
