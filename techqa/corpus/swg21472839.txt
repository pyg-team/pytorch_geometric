QUESTION
 A message warned that the "__gskit_id_cert_n" or "__gskit_val_cert_n" certificate is about to expire but there is no certificate found by this name. How do I locate the expiring certificate on the WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance? 

ANSWER
The unrecognizable certificate names refer to Identification Credential and Validation Credential objects which DataPower generates internally from a key database for MQ/SSL connections. The warning message referring to "__gskit_id_cert_n" or"__gskit_val_cert_n" certificate names may have come from the DataPower certificate monitor service. The log category of these messages are typically SSL, which means those certificates are used in SSL connections.
To locate the expiring certificate, check your key database (the kdb file) for any certificate nearing expiration. The certificate may be replaced with a new one or deleted if not needed any longer.

Refer to Configuring DataPower MQ client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155] for more details about SSL configuration and key generation. 

For any other expiring certificates, navigate to the DataPower WebGUI Control Panel > Keys and Certificates Management.
