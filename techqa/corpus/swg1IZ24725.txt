APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TEP 6.2 Parser cannot process #"tbl".col constructs.
   In particular this occurs when trying to use Custom SQL queries
   containing table names inside "" (double quotes) in the SQL
   statement. Thresholds do not work in this case, e.g. Show
   Formula panel remains empty.
   
   
   This can be reflected in the TEP logs as the following error
   messages
   
   (484fc109.1debe980-(null)AWT-EventQueue-2:Expression,0,"Expressi
   on.setEx
   pression(String)")
    #"System_DV".CPU GT 90.0
   (484fc109.1debe980-(null)AWT-EventQueue-2:TEPParseEvaluator,0,"T
   EPParseE
   valuator.ParseFilterExpression(String)")
    Expression to Parse: #"System_DV".CPU GT 90.0;
   Exception occurred during event dispatching:
   candle.fw.util.parsers.filterparser.TokenMgrError: Lexical error
   at line
   1,
   column 2.  Encountered: "\"" (34), after : "#"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use "" (double quotes) around tables names in Custom SQL
   queries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Filters and thresholds cannot be set for views using custom SQL
   queries referencing quoted table names like those of data
   warehouse tables.
   
   ODBC standards require table names containing special characters
   to be enclosed in double quotes and the quotes are permitted
   even when not required.  The Tivoli Data Warehouse tables are
   typically named in this way.  The TEP Query Editor can be used
   to create Custom SQL queries against these tables and these
   queries can then be used to obtain data for display in TEP
   workspace views.  If the Properties dialog for such a view is
   used to set a Filter or a Threshold, various failures will
   occur.  In some cases, the setting will appear to be accepted
   but will not produce the expected results and will not show up
   if the Properties dialog is reopened.  In other cases, the OK
   button will not close the dialog.  The TEP log will include
   exception messages containing the phrase "Lexical error at
   line".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The TEP parsing logic was changed to accept quoted table and
   column names in Custom SQL.
