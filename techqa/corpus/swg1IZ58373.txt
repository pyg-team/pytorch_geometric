   Environment:
     All ITM Windows OS agent versions 6.x
   
   Problem Description:
   The product provided NT_Registry workspace query does not

   customer using this query is left wondering why it does not
   populated data in the workspace.
   
   Other product provided queries affected are File Change, File
   Trend, etc. Generally attribute groups which can potentially
   respond with huge amount of rows can overwhelm monitoring and
   tax system resource.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
   Create a tabular report view and assign product provide
   NT_Registry query. Note, no data is populated in the view unless
   a situation is defined for the Registry Attribute group. For

   Root Key Name == HKEY LOCAL MACHINE AND String Value ==
   '7.0.3.18')
