Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM XIV is affected by a vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

 1. XIV Gen3 V11.4 - 11.4.1a: Management and CIMOM TCP ports 
 2. XIV Gen3 V11.3.0, V11.3.0.a, V11.3.1: CIMOM TCP port only

REMEDIATION/FIXES
New microcode releases, 11.3.1.b and 11.4.1.b, are available to address the issue. 
After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160:
1. The digital SSL Certificates provided by IBM need to be replaced, and will be replaced by IBM as part of the upgrade procedure.
2. If you installed your own digital certificates, you need to revoke those and replace them with new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (i.e., using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR).
3. The 'admin' password needs to be changed, as well as any additional users defined internally (if you're using LDAP authentication, then only the 'admin' password needs to be changed). Make sure to do this after upgrading and replacing the digital certificates.

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Restrict access to the management network to which XIV is connected to approved personnel and monitor the network traffic in accordance with best network security industry practice.
