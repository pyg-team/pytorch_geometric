Title: IBM BND240E Module construction error (no CSECTs) running DB2 Bind Manager for z/OS with COBOL 5 - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does DB2 Bind Manager for z/OS running with DBRM created by COBOL 5 fail with the message BND240E Module construction error (no CSECTs)? 

ANSWER
DB2 Bind Manager for z/OS expects object format is generated from the compiler.
COBOL v5.x changed the object file format.

There is no option to produce the same object format as COBOL v4.x.
This is documented in the following "Changes in compiling with Enterprise COBOL Version 5" available online at: http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/igy5mg20.pdf [http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/igy5mg20.pdf]

The compiler output is in GOFF format. This format
allows the compiler to create more efficient generated
code and also to put out the NOLOAD debug information
(DWARF) segments.

DB2 Bind Manager can not run with COBOL 5.x.

DB2 Bind Manager was removed from marketing April 13, 2015 per the "Product Lifecycle for DB2 and IMS Tools" available online at: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008621 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008621]

No replacement product has been identified.

IBM has no plans to enhance Bind Manager any further.
