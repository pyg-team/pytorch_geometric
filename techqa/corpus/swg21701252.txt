Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server may affect Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
TNSQM SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0 that is used by Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities may affect Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager 4.1.4

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
By default, the WebSphere Application Server SSL configuration in Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager is set to use the "STRONG" or "HIGH" secure cipher list which does not use RSA Export ciphers, so you would not be affected if you have not changed your ciphers.

If you have overridden the default configuration to use the "MEDIUM" secure cipher list then it will contain the RSA Export Ciphers. You should change this configuration to use "STRONG" or "HIGH".

If you have configured to use "CUSTOM" list of ciphers that includes an RSA Export cipher, then you should remove those RSA Export ciphers from the Application Server configuration.
