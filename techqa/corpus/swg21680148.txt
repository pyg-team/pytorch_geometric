 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having problem while running a Business Process Definition (BPD) with IBM Business Process Manager. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Business Process Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support, it will expedite the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

Use the following general trace string if you do not know where or what is causing the issue:
*=info:WLE.*=all


For Business Process Definition issues involving certain components, use the appropriate following trace: 

 * For database connectors or data source issues, use the following trace string:
   *=info:WAS.clientinfopluslogging=all:com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.*=all:com.ibm.bpm.rest.*=all 
   
   
 * For an undercover agent issue, see the Collect troubleshooting data for undercover agent (UCA) problems in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660915] document.
   
   
 * For issues that occur when calling an IBM Business Process Manager REST API from within an application, see the Collect troubleshooting data for BPM REST API problems in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666278] document.
   
   
 * For an Enterprise Content Management issue connecting to an external system or using the provided document storage with IBM Business Process Manager, use the applicable following trace:  * V7.5.x:
      *=info:WLE.*=all
      
      
    * V8.0.x
      *=info:com.ibm.bpm.integration.*=all
      
      
    * V8.5.x
      *=info:com.ibm.bpm.integration.*=all:com.ibm.embeddedecm.*=all
   
   



Note: Enabling trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction time-outs and errors. Disable trace after collecting the requested information. 


To set the tracing and generate a new set of logs and traces, complete the following steps for the servers or clusters that show the issue:  1. In the Integrated Solutions Console, under ​Troubleshooting​ ​>​ ​Log and Trace​, select the server for which you want to change the settings. ​
    
    
 2. Click Change Log Detail Levels​.
    
    
 3. Select the ​configuration tab to set the tracing. This change takes effect after the next server restart and a completely new set of log files can be collected. Optionally, select the runtime​ tab to dynamically set the tracing.
    
    
 4. Enter the trace string and click OK.
    
    
 5. If you selected the configuration tab, stop the server.
    
    
 6. Archive and delete the current logs, traces, and ffdc from the <profile_root>/​​logs​​directory.
    
    
 7. Start the server and check the trace.log file to make sure that the correct tracing is set.
    
    
 8. Reproduce the problem and note down the timestamp. Check the trace.log file to ensure that the time of the issue is covered in the file and gather the complete server log files and ffdc directory.
    
    
 9. Delete the trace string from the Log Detail Level for your server.
    
    

Note: Ensure that you have set the maximum trace file size (recommendation: 20MB) and the number of historical trace files (recommendation: 10) to an appropriate value. You can find those values at Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service. 


Provide a .twx file test case and detailed procedures on how to reproduce the issue.
