QUESTION
 How to collect the logs and config info on the Managing Server for ITCAM for AD 7.1 on a Linux/Unix system. 

ANSWER
The location of the logs has changed in ITCAM for Application Diagnostics v7.1 on the Managing Server. There are three kinds of logs that are available and can be collected: Database logs, WAS server logs and the Managing Server logs. This technote is specifically for Linux/Unix systems. Here is the Windows [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439230] equivalent of this technote.

(Note: In this technote, default directories are used. If you are using a non-Linux platform (like AIX, or HP-UX or Solaris), simply replace the 'opt' in the path with 'usr' or if you are using non-default directories, then collect the logs using the non-default directories.) 

 

* Collecting Database logs: The database can be either DB2 or Oracle. In this example, DB2 v9.1 is used. This is where the DB2 diagnostic log is located. (Note that there's a db2diag.log for each DB2 instance being used. In this case, the DB2 instance is db2inst1. Also note that the DB2 parameters DIAGPATH and DIAGLEVEL control the path and amount of logging that gets written into this log.)

* Collecting the WAS server logs: The default WAS server logs for the profile AppSrv01 server server1 are located in this directory. (See first screenshot below.) To collect these WAS Server logs you can use the standard tar command or use the ITCAM-providedMS_Gather_Data.sh script to collect both the WAS server logs and the WAS server config info. (Note: You need to use your pmr # so get a pmr # in case you don't have one open. In the second screenshot shown here, the pmr # used is 12345.678.000.) The log file created is 12345.678.000.gz in the $MS_HOME dir. Send this file to your friendly IBM Support engineer for analysis.

* Collecting the Managing Server logs: Simply use the MS_Gather_Data.sh script again, this time with just your pmr #. If you have already used the script as shown above to collect the WAS server logs, then both the WAS server logs + MS logs are already collected for you. If you want to collect only the MS logs and MS config info, then just use the script as shown here and send the output file to your friendly IBM Support engineer for analysis.[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439034&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439034&aid=4]
