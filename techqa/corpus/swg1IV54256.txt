APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When connecting to devices via TEM RC, users must click through
   numerous Java prompts just to connect.
   
   Following Oracle's recent release of Java 7 Update 45, users now
   get a message that states:
   "The certificate used to identify this application has
   expired... This application will be blocked in a future Java
   security update because the JAR file manifest does not contain
   the Permissions attribute.  Please contact the Publisher for
   more information."
   
   When we look into the details of the error message, the logs
   indicate that "TRCConsole.jar" is the jar file in question.
   
   Users can still connect successfully if they choose to "accept
   the risk" of running the application, but this is the first
   release that states the jar file will be blocked.

   Problem Description
   
   New version of the Java 7 Runtime Environment from Oracle Java
   version 7u45 or IBM Java version 7 SR5 display a message to warn
   that the application will be automatically blocked by Java in
   future Java updates.
   Problem Summary
   
   The root cause of this problem is that a new attribute in the
   manifest in the Controller's Jar file is not present.
   
   To prevent this message from appearing, the attribute has been
   added in the Controller's Jar file, so that it satisfies the new
   Java security requirements.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will be included in 5.1.2-TIV-TRC512-IF0016
