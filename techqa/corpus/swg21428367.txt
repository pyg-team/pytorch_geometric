CAUSE
The floating evaluation license key has been imported without editing hostname EVAL_HOST_XXXXXX to the correct hostname for the actual license server machine.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to edit hostname EVAL_HOST_XXXXXX on the evaluation license key to the correct hostname for the actual license server machine.

 * 
 * Notes: 
 *  You may need to change port values for former Telelogic products as RLKC (Rational License key center) generates evaluation keys using default port number 27000. You should leave host id as ANY. 
 * 
 * 
 * Additional Scenarios:
 *  When there is no SERVER line on a temporary floating license key when generated from LKC:
   1. Add the SERVER line manually from the *UPD file by opening the file in a text editor, the same way as explained as above.
   
   
   2. Edit appropriately and save the file and then import it. 
 * 
 *  In case you imported the evaluation key without editing and encountered the errors:
   
   If you use the latest License Server version 8.1.1: 
 *  You need to delete rational_server_temp.dat from common folder in the license server installed path. (such as. C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalRLKS\common)
   
   Open License Key Administrator and press F5 to refresh and confirm the license be removed.
   
   Edit the license file correctly and re-import it. (Yes to restart License Server)
   
   Perform Status Enquiry and confirm the file be imported successfully.
   
 * 
 * If you use License Server 
 * other than
 *  the latest version (as of 8.1.1):
 * 
 *  You need to delete rational_server_temp.dat from common folder in the license server installed path. (such as. C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalRLKS\common)
   
   Open License Key Administrator and press F5 to refresh and confirm the license be removed.
   
   Edit the license file correctly and re-import it. (Yes to restart License Server)
   
   Open rational_server_temp.dat file from common folder in the license server installed path with text editor and remove or comment out duplicated server line.
   
   Open License Key Administrator and press F5 to refresh to confirm the license appears as valid.
   
   Open LM tools, Stop Server and then Start Server.
   
   Perform Status Enquiry and confirm the file be imported successfully.
