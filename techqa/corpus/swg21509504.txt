PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to configure Tomcat server with TCsite TC Configurator server installed. 

CAUSE
This may be caused due to another Tomcat server installed on your system.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, check and see if you have another Tomcat server installed. This will most likely be in the C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation folder on your system if using Windows. (see screenshot here.) 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509504&amp;aid=1] 

If you are running TCsite the Tacton TC Configurator server, then this already comes with its own bundled version of Tomcat. 

You can't use both TCsite server software and its own Tomcat server and another stand-alone Tomcat server on the same system. You have to remove the stand-alone Tomcat server to get the other TCsite-bundled-Tomcat server successfully configured. 

(Note; Its not enough to just stop the stand-alone Tomcat service in the Services window. You must remove the stand-alone Tomcat server completely if you want to configure the other TCsite-bundled-Tomcat server.) 

So uninstall the stand-alone Tomcat server and then re-run the configuration script to configure the TCsite-bundled-Tomcat server.
