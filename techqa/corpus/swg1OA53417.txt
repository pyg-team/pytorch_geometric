APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using HOD 12.0.1 on z/OS 2.2 with Tivoli Directory Server on
   z/OS and RACF authentication. I am able to login as admin until
   I get a password error on another ID (RACF Defined). From that
   point on I get a password failed for any ID and I see RACF
   errors for the ID that received the initial password failure.
   Once  this happens I am unable to login to
   the HOMSRV task until I recycle it. I am using Java 1.8.0_64 on
   z/OS.
