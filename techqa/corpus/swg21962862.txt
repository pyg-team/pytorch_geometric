Title: IBM Verify an IEM server upgrade is still in progress - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I tell if the IBM Endpoint Manager (BigFix) server database upgrade is progressing? 

CAUSE
When upgrading a BigFix server, most of the time is usually spent upgrading the database. The installer launches the BESAdmin utility to complete this part of the upgrade, but does not provide detailed progress during this phase. For some long running upgrades, it may appear that the upgrade is hung or not progressing: 

On Windows, the BESAdmin UI will indicate "Not Responding" if clicked on at this point. 

On Linux, the message "Info: Configuring the database for the server component, please wait ... " is reported.


ANSWER
It is important to allow the upgrade to complete when in this state, and not attempt to cancel or kill the upgrade process. To verify the upgrade is still active, check that the following process is still running: 

Windows: BESAdmin.exe 

Linux: BESAdmin 

CPU usage of BESAdmin may be minimal during times when the database is doing most of the work, so just the existence of the process is good confirmation. For additional confirmation, the BFEnterprise or BFENT database can be monitored for activity using SQL Server Profiler or the DB2 'CREATE EVENT MONITOR' statement to track SQL statement events.
