QUESTION
 How do I install Rational Team Concert v2.x into my workbench (sometimes referred to as "shell-share") of a version 8.0 product of the Rational Software Delivery Platform? 

ANSWER
The information in this document applies to the following Rational Software Delivery Platform products: 

 * Rational Software Architect, Version 8.0 
 * Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software, Version 8.0 
 * Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, Version 8.0 
 * Rational Application Developer Standard Edition for WebSphere Software, Version 8.0 
 * Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition, Version 8.0 


The information in this topic is also available in each product's information center under Installing and upgrading > Installing and upgrading <product> > Installing Rational Team Concert Client into the workbench. 

Note: Users who want to shellshare Rational Team Concert 2.x with version 8.0 of Rational Software Architect for WebSphere or Rational Software Architect products must select one of the following installation options to ensure that the dependencies are met. This is a workaround to an existing packaging issue in RTC 2.x. 
 * Solution Architecture and Model-Driven Development > Java Standard Edition and Jva Persistence API (JPA) graphical editing and transformations 
 * Solution Architecture and Model-Driven Development > Microsoft .NET architecture, development automation, and visualization 
 * Solution Architecture and Model-Driven Development > XSD graphical editing and transformations 
 * Extensibility and patterns-based engineering > Eclipse technology extensibility 
 * Life cycle and architecture tool integrations > Rational RequisitePro integration 
 * Life cycle and architecture tool integrations > Rational Requirements Composer integration 
 * Life cycle and architecture tool integrations > WebSphere Business Modeler integration


Users with the Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software or Rational Application Developer Standard Edition products must select the default installation options to ensure that all dependencies are met. 

Procedure  1.  From the Rational Team Concert download page (https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/ [https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/]), select the latest available version of Rational Team Concert v2.x and, under the Standard edition column, click Other Download Options. Download the "Client for Eclipse 3.5.x (P2 install)" compressed file that is compatible with Rational Software 8.0 product. For example, download Rational Team Concert v2.0.0.2 Interim Fix 4. 
 2.  Extract the content of the compressed file that you downloaded. For example, extract the contents to C:\RTC. Ensure that you preserve the directories of the extracted content. 
 3.  Start Rational Software product version 8.0. 
 4.  Click Help > Install New Software. 
 5.  Under Available Software, click Add. The Add Repository dialog-box opens. 
 6.  Beside the Name field, click Local and then go to the rtc-p2-repository subdirectory of the directory where you previously extracted the compressed file. For example, C:\RTC\rtc-p2-repository. Click OK. 
 7.  On the Available Software page:  1. In the Name section, select Rational Team Concert and, optionally, one or both NLS categories to install language packs. 
      2. In the details section, ensure Group items by category and Contact all update sites are selected.
     
     
 8.  Click Next. 
 9.  On the Install Details page, click Next. 
 10. On the Review Licenses page, read the text of the license agreements. If you agree to the terms of all of the license agreements, select I accept the terms of the license agreements and then click Finish. 
 11. During the installation, a security warning dialog-box might open because the Rational Team Concert client bundles and features are not signed. If this happens, click OK to complete the installation. 
 12. When you are prompted to restart at the end of the installation, click Yes. 
 13. When the workbench restarts, the Rational Team Concert Welcome page opens.


Note: Not all Rational Team Concert capabilities are enabled by default in this shell-sharing scenario. To enable the capabilities from the workbench, click Window > Preferences > General > Capabilities and select the Team > Jazz Source Control check box.
