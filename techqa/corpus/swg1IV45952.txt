ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT:
   
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring NetApp Storage Agent v7.1.0
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   The agent contains a knu_resources.jar file whose jar signing
   certificate expires June 9th, 2013.  After installing the
   application support files,  this may be seen in a number of
   ways.
   For example, on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, the labels or
   headings are still displayed in English after the  language pack
   is
   installed or after the expiration date, the Java Web Start
   client does not launch, or using the desktop client, the
   internal identifiers (for example:KNU:KNU1000) are displayed
   in the navigator tree, instead of the text labels or headings.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   To verify the  expiration date of the agent jar signing
   certificate,
   run this command on the portal server:
   
   jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs knu_resources.jar
    . . .
   [certificate will expire on 6/9/13 7:59 PM]
