Step 2:
Stop the CccServer, CccQueue and CccAgent Microsoft Windows services.

Step 3:

Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.8.0.0 directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.8.0.0.orig

Step 4:
Unpack the content of the ibm-java-jre-80-win-i386.zip file to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.8.0.0

Step 5:
Start the CccAgent, CccQueue and CccServer Microsoft Windows services.

Step 6:
Validate the installation by testing the connectivity to the agent using the CCC Client.


Upgrade instructions after applying this fix.

For all IBM Cognos Command Center installations with the above fix applied:

Before upgrading your installation to a newer version please revert to the original \java\ directory by following this procedure.


Step A:
Stop the CccServer, CccQueue and CccAgent Windows services.

Step B:
Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.cve

Step c:
Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.orig directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java

Step D:
Proceed to upgrade your Cognos Command Center installation to a newer version.

Step E:
After the upgrade to the newer version is done, please reapply this fix starting from Step 1.
