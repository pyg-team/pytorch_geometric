APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In earlier versions of Atlas, when a paralegal releases a
   custodian and closes a matter, that matter would be listed on
   the "Cross Check" tab of Map > Person record when "Show All" is
   selected. However, after upgrading to 6.0.3.2 this matter does
   not show up so there is no way of knowing that the custodian
   used to be on a hold and why.
