   The 5.2 TSM Admin Guides (all unixes
   and Windows) state in error that
   "Libraries with multiple drive device
   types can be used with NDMP
   operations." It should state that
   these libraries "... canNOT be used
   with NDMP operations." The text needs
   to be corrected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The text has been updated to state that "Libraries with
   multiple drive device types cannot be used with NDMP
   operations."
