ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you process the datetime value and the input string does
   not contain a million seconds section, you might see the
   following error:
   
   com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException: Unparseable
   date:  "2013-11-20T11:19:15-05:"
   
   The date format string must be adjusted with the input
   datetime string.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.1.2       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Usually the input string in XML or      *
   *                      SOAP message for the datetime value     *
   *                      is in the following time zone format:   *
   *                      YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.fff. For example,   *
   *                      a datetime value could be               *
   *                      2013-11-20T11:19:15.012-05:00.          *
   *                      However, in some case, as in the        *
   *                      following example, the input string     *
   *                      might not contain a million seconds     *
   *                      section:                                *
   *                      2013-11-20T11:19:15-05:00               *
   *                      If the input string does not have a     *
   *                      million seconds section and but         *
   *                      contains the time zone information in   *
   *                      the +/-hh:mm format, for example        *
   *                      2013-11-20T11:19:15-05:00, you          *
   *                      receive the following error:            *
   *                      com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksExce *
   *                      ption: Unparseable date:                *
   *                      "2013-11-20T11:19:15-05:"               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   This error occurs when the input
   string does not have a million
   seconds section but contains the time
   zone information in the +/-hh:mm
   format. When parsing the datetime
   value, the wrong algorithm is used to
   check whether the million seconds
   section is in the string. If the
   million seconds section is not in the
   string, you receive an error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that updates related code so that the
   parser recognizes whether the million seconds section has been
   included when parsing the datetime value and parses the value
   with correct date format, even without million seconds.
