 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Do IBM WebSphere Application Server versions prior to V6.1 work with Microsoft SQL Server 2005? 

ANSWER
WebSphere Application Server versions prior to V6.1 were written to be compatible with the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 database. However, Microsoft SQL Server 2005 is not fully forward compatible from Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and therefore WebSphere Application Server versions prior to V6.1 are not fully compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2005.
