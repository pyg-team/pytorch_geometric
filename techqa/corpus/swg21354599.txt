Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I need to disable and enable cubes in PowerPlay Enterprise Server using a batch file for updating purposes. What is correct syntax for the command lines and are they the same as with version 6.x? Also, where can I find a complete list of commands for the ppadmtool.exe program? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You will find the list of commands for this program on page 81 of the Enterprise Server Guide.

The command line has changed slightly from version 6.x, specifically when connecting to the server. you must add the port number to the command line.

The following is the correct syntax to use in a batch file. This includes the quotes

"c:\Program Files\Cognos\cer2\bin\ppadmtool.exe" connect wottmurphys3:8010 user administrator password admin disable "Great Outdoors"

**NOTE: Any cubes that contain spaces in their name, must be enclosed in double quotes.**
This varies from version 6.61 In version 7.0 you must specify the port number of the server.
