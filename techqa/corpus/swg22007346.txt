Title: IBM Security Bulletin: XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability affects IBM Business Process Manager (CVE-2017-1527) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) can process XML messages, including messages from untrusted sources. Because of insufficient restriction of an XML parser, XML External Entity injection allows an authenticated remote attacker to send specially crafted XML messages and thus cause a denial of service by exhausting system resources or exfiltrate sensitive information.
