QUESTION
 Can the background color of a widget be changed in DASH (Dashboard Application Services Hub)? 

CAUSE
Customers would like to customize the background color in the DASH widgets.

ANSWER
Currently, the background color of the widgets in DASH cannot be customized by the customer. 

However, in DASH we do change the background color of the widgets based on the DASH console theme you select. If you select the "dark" theme, the background is changed to a grey to better match the rest of the page. In the other themes, the background is white. 

If changing the background color is important to you, please submit an Enhancement Request.
