DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM



To quickly diagnose the issue, comment out the notes.ini parameters for Symantec:

Example:

REM EXTMGR_ADDINS=NLNVP 

Or 

Disable the "Notes Auto- Protect" feature in Symantec

Advanced Troubleshooting:

While Lotus Notes is hanging, run NSD manually. Starting in Lotus Notes 8.5.2, NSD is available under OS Start Menu --> Lotus Applications (or IBM Applications) --> Support --> Run Lotus Notes diagnostics and exit Notes.

Once NSD completes, the resulting Javacore (stored in the .\data\workspace folder) will show the following errors for NLNVP.dll:
