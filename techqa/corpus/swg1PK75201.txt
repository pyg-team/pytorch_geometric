APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running a GUI script in TM, their test seems to fail consis
   tently until they add delays several lines above the
   failure then the problem is resolved. It appears that Robot cont
   inues running the script before some function was completed; may
    or may not be the case, but the delays appear to be indicating
   that Robot was not completing certain steps before going to the
   next command on the next
   line. In the log, they get a RTGap.dll error '[22.24.6.2]: rtgap
   .dll function GAPTaskExecute failed.'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem: Robot-User statesRtgap.dll appears in logs in TM.
   
   Environment: TM 7.0.1.1, iFix02 Robot 7.0.1.2, Windows XP
   SP2, IE7
   
   What, when, where. When running a GUI script in TM, their
   test seems to fail consistently until they add delays
   several lines above the
   failure then the problem is resolved. It appears that Robot
   continues running the script before some function was
   completed; may or may not be the case, but the delays appear
   to be indicating that Robot was not completing certain steps
   before going to the next command on the next
   line. In the log, they get a RTGap.dll error "[22.24.6.2]:
   rtgap.dll function GAPTaskExecute failed". This occurs on
   multiple scripts that they try to record, but it did not
   happen when using IE6, but started happening using IE7. The
   customer stated that it occurs about "40-50 time in one
   regression shell test." Only 4 users are getting this error
   message. I sent the customer a technote for this issue which
   was:
   
   " Title * When running GUI script in TestManager,
   "[22.24.6.2]: rtgap.dl
   function GAPTaskExecute failed" error message received in
   log file.
   Problem(Abstract) * This field is displayed on the search
   results
   webpage seen by customers, and effects search ranking and
   relevance. When running a GUI script with a function call
   which uses
   custom DLL(s) declared in a header file (SBH file) from
   Rational?
   TestManager, the test passes with an information message of:
   Rational
   TestManager: [22.24.6.2]: rtgap.dll function GAPTaskExecute
   failed
   These DLL(s) are put in the dll folder of the project's
   datastore, and
   the project location is specified with the UNC path. When
   running the
   same script from Rational? Robot, there is no error message.
   When
   running a script without a function call from Rational
   TestManager,
   there is no error message.
   Symptom *
   
   Cause When running a GUI script with a function call which
   uses custom
   DLL(s) in a SBH file from Rational TestManager, you need to
   specify the
   complete path to the DLL(s).
   
   
   Environment
   Diagnosing the problem
   Resolving the problem * To resolve the issue, the user can
   do either of
   the following; 1. Declare with the complete path name of the
   DLL(s) 2.
   Declare "dll\xxx.dll" in the SBH file when the custom DLL(s)
   files are
   put in the dll folder of the project's TestDatastore If the
   comments
   are in another language, translate using the following
   URL:http://www.google.com/translate."
   
   But they said that if this issue is at the shell level it
   will break their application that relies on the .dll files
   used. I've attached a screenshots of the error and the
   script used to this new note.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Recived the mail form Derrek Meade as follows.
   After looking through PMR, the customer's PMR was closed and
   archived. They did not provide us with a sample application
   at the time when the PMR was active. The customer only sent
   in screenshots for this issue, but they have been deleted by
   the FTP server already. The customer stated that they were
   new to to Robot at the time and wanted to know more about
   the technote(# 1175747 ) given to them since they were not
   sure about what to do. After explaining the technote to the
   customer, they brought the instructions to their testers who
   stated that since the technote deals with fixing things at
   the shell level, they could do this for their application as
   it would break .dll files they recieved from IBM already
   that fixed other issue(was not sure on what issues were
   fixed by certain .dll files) they encountered with Robot.
   
   Since the PMR is closed and customer is not willing proivde
   sample Application, This APAR can be closed
