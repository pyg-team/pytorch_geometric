APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AIX 5.3 ML4
   ITAM for e-business 5.1.0.22
   IE version - 6.0.2800.1106
   Users are not presented with the Internet Explorer Client
   Authentication dialog for selecting an appropriate certificate
   to proceed to the smartcard login page.
   
   We have determined that the cause of this issue lies with the
   persistent-con-timeout entry in the webseald-<instance>.conf
   file. If
   persistent-con-timeout is set to 0 (zero) then the problem does
   not exist.
   If persistent-con-timeout is set to 5 seconds for instance, then
   waiting for 5 seconds after the website is loaded before
   clicking the smartcard login link also works.
   Thus, this problem seems to occur if a user clicks the smartcard
   login link before the persistent-con-timeout has expired
   This problem does not exist when using Firefox.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Waiting for the persistent-con-timeout.
