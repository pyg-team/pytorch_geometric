APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITM 6.3 introduces a new level of GSkit.  ITM 6.3 TEMA uses the
   new GSkit.  Once the TEMA is updated to 6.3, the GSkit is also
   updated and pre-6.3 agents
   cannot start because they are not compatible with the updated
   GSkit.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In a pre 6.3 ITM environment with 32-bit and 64-bit agents,
   installation of an ITM 6.3 OS agent will break 32-bit agents.
   GSKit 8 introduced in ITM 6.3 release is not backward compatible
    with pre ITM 6.3 monitoring agent libraries.  At the beginning
   of installation, both GSKit 32-bit and 64-bit are always
   installed. As a result, in a mixed environment with pre 6.3 ITM
   32-bit and 64-bit agents, after installing the 64-bit 6.3 os
   agent, both GSKit libraries will be upgraded to version 8.
   However, only 64-bit monitoring agent will be upgraded to 6.3,
   while 32-bit monitoring agent stays on pre 6.3.  The pre 6.3
   32-bit monitoring agent is not compatible with installed 32-bit
   GSkit 8.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The order of GSKit installation was changed to occur after the
   user selects the components to install. After the user selects
   the components to install, the installer checks what gskit
   version is required and installs or upgrades only the required
   version. Also, the tf component installation is updated to
   install gskit (including .dsc update). The installation of
   component prereqs was also moved to occur after gskit
   installation. There is no question if user wants to install
   prereqs components, installer will always install them. At the
   beginning of CandleInstall, gskit .ver files are unpacked from
   installation media to tmp directory. The Eclipse Help Server is
   excluded from gskit processing as it doesn't require gskit.  The
    runGSKit script was modified and always returns 0.  A new
   script installgs.sh was created based on runGSKit script and it
   performs the GSkit installation.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  All TEMA libraries should be upgraded to version 6.3 or later
   using the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent Framework Update
   (tf) component
