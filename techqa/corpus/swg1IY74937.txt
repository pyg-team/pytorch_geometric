ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  **********************************************
   Title: In SAP agent, givenname should not be mandatory because
   it isn't mandatory in SAP.
   
   Problem Description:
   
   The customer sets empty to "givenname" attribute on SAP agent as
   SAP
   allows givenname being set to empty. However, the following
   error
   occurs on SAP agent.
   
   BSE:05/08/04 13:56:31 Thread:007696 The following attributes
   won't be
   sent to the agent:
   BSE:05/08/04 13:56:31 Thread:007696         Attribute:givenname
      Reason:invalidAttributeValue

   name="givenname"
   errorMessage="Attribute has no value">
   
   Can Customer Recreate: Yes
   
   Agent Version - SAP agent V4.6.0 on AIX
   
   Desired Behavior:
   SAP agent should allow no value being set to givenname attribute
   as the
   same as SAP.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   Set blank to givenname attribute, then try to modify SAP
   account.
