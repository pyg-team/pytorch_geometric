ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Job Plan tasks with numbers greater than 999 cause errors when
   you Forecast PM's from Maximo to MS Project with the Project
   Adapter.
   
   I tried the same Job Plan on a Work Order and, while I didn't
   get errors on screen, I also did not get any Work Orders showing
   up in MS Project.   I did see errors in the core Maximo log.
   
   In the core Maximo Log we see this:
   
   17 Nov 2009 17:16:06:874 [ERROR] Failed SQL query in
   MboSet.getNextRecordData():
    select * from jobtask  where jpnum = 'JP12300' and jptask =
   1,100
   java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended
   
   And then a long java.exception.
   
   I will attach screen shots and logs to the Issue when it is
   created.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a Job Plan with one Task numbered 1100.
   2. Save and change its Status to Active
   3. Create a PM that uses this Job Plan.
   4. Save and change the PM's Status to Active.
   5. In the PM application create a query to call up this new PM.
   6. Start MS Project.
   7. Select Load PM's from the floating menu.
   8. Click on the query made in Step 5.
   9. Click OK on the Select PM dialog box.
   10. The PM will start to load and then error out.
