ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Composite Design Licence not available
   A client is waiting for a v5r19 version of my
   product TapeLay.
   Interactively the product works fine (AL3 and SL3
   licences checked)
   But all the ODT are KO because the Composite
   WorkBench is not available.
   since v5r18 we put
   export ODT_REQUESTED_PRODUCT="AL3.slt"
   in all the odt shell. But on v5r19 composite design
   is no more in the AL3 license.
   We tried :
   export
   ODT_REQUESTED_PRODUCT="_SL3.slt",  "SL3.slt",
   "sl3.slt"....
   but it is not working.
   There is no documentation on the subjet;
   can you tell us what we need to put in the
   ODT_REQUESTED_PRODUCT variable?
   .
