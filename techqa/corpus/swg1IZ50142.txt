   lRequire
   mentsv51SilentChecklist.doc#_Silent_install_requirement_ 1.2s
   
   The specific requirments identified by customer were:
   
   1.2s Requirement Provide silent install and uninstall
   capabilities
   1.3s Requirement Provide a sample silent install and uninstall
   response
   file that users can modify and use
   1.4s Requirement Provide all options in silent install that are
   present
   for interactive installs
   
   ----------------------------------------
   
   ESR:
   
   The customer team needs to install the AD Adapter and Password
   sync on
   1000 DC's. The current released version fails but logging
   indicates
   successful. The pfconfig.exe is
   executed but can not complete as it is a GUI driven application,
   therefore hangs in the background.  This needs to be changed in
   order to
   comply with the IBM Software
   Install requirements.
   
   STEPS TO DUPLICATE
   
   1.  Download ADAgent zip file. - unzip
   2.  Execute the install with the -r param
   
       C:\tivoli\PW-Sync-x86-x64-5.0.1004\WinHTTP>SetupPwdSynch.exe
   -r
   rsp3.txt
   
       I get three panels:
    Choose Install Folder
    Software License Agreement
    Select a CA Certificate File.
       Then
    PreInstall summary. >>  Click on Install
   
        It seems like that information is being recorded.  Then I
   get a
   second set of panels
    Microsoft Visual C++ license agreement
    Then the 2nd panel   (which is pfconfig.exe)
   
   
   3.  The response file is created and contains:
   
   # Wed Apr 08 16:33:37 EDT 2009
   # Replay feature output
   # ---------------------
   # This file was built by the Replay feature of InstallAnywhere.
   # It contains variables that were set by Panels or Consoles.
   
   
   
   #Choose Install Folder
   #---------------------
   USER_INSTALL_DIR=C:\\Tivoli\\PasswordSynch
   
   #Select CA Certificate file.
   #---------------------------
   USER_CERT_FILE=oliveCert.cer
   PATH_OF_CERT_FILE=C:\\tivoli\\
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   -----
   
   4.  Execute on new DC
   
   SetupPwdSynch.exe -i silent -r c:\tivoli\rsp2.txt
   
   
   At this point, the pfconfig hangs in the background, the install
   finishes with a successful message in the log. But has not
   installed the
   package.
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Silent Install works without manual steps
