APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An ITIM fixpack installation will overwrite the
   db2jcc.jar and the db2jcc_license_cu.jar file.
   
   In the initial release of ITIM 5.1 and following fixpacks the
   db2 jar
   files included:
   
   
   09/30/2010  02:43 PM         2,833,724 db2jcc.jar
   09/30/2010  02:43 PM         1,015 db2jcc_license_cu.jar
   
   When I issue the command to verify the version, I find this
   version a
   version that was compatable with  DB2 Version 9.5
   
   java -cp db2jcc.jar com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Jcc -version
     >> IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver Architecture 3.50.152
     >> v9.5 FP0 (GA) s071001 3.50.152 2833724 4.0.100 2939868
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   
   BUT, am using DB2 9.7 and had copied the db2jcc.jar file from
   9.7 to the
   lib directory.
   
   java -cp db2jcc.jar com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Jcc -version
      >> IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver Architecture 3.58.82
      >> v9.7 FP2 s100514 3.59.81 3295950 4.9.78 3472296
   
   
   After I installed fixpack 4, the files in the <itim_home>\lib
   were
   replaced with the OLD drivers.
   
   The fixpack should not over write the file(s).
   
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate:  Install ITIM 5.1 and supported middleware
   Get the latest driver for db2 9.7 and copy to the lib directory
   run the java command and verify.
   
   For additional info, see the DB2 tech note.

   Desired Behavior:  New files should not be over written.
   When the jar files are inconsistent with the middleware version,
   this
   message is displayed in the WAS SystemOut.log
   
   7/7/10 15:38:08:009 PDT] 0000002e WSRdbDataSour W   DSRA9542W:

   Driver that is configured with the data source for the
   Application
   
   Server does not support the extending data source properties
   feature.
   The Application Server will not honor the extended data source

   Environment:     ITIM 5.1 with DB2 9.7
