ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Content list widget is placed on a step processor page,
   custom
   context menu events are not always available.  Specifically, the
   event
   exits for the first time the step processor is opened, but
   subsequent
   viewings show that the custom event is not published.  the entry
   in the
   context menu still exists, but the associated event does not,
   and thus
   no wiring can take place, and no widget can listen for the
   custom
   context menu entry being clicked.
   
   
   To recreate you need two business space pages.  One for finding
   work and
   another for doing work (the step processor).  In the find work
   page, add
   an inbasket widget that contains a work item that is configured
   to us
   the do work page as the step processor.  on the do work page,
   add the
   step completion widget and the content list widget.  For the
   content
   list widget configured it to do a search that always gives some
   results
   (the results don't matter, and it doesn't matter if you wire
   anything to
   the content list widget).  Add a custom menu item (the name and
   label
   don't matter).  Now do the following things:
   
   1. Go to the find work page and double click a work item to open
   the
   step processor for the first time
   
   2. in the step processor page use page edit to observe that
   event is
   there by attempting to wire it.
   
   3. Cancel out of edit mode
   
   4. Click close on the step completion widget to return to the
   find work
   page
   
   5. Double click a work item again (need not be the same, just
   must go to
   same step processor page)
   
   6. Use page edit to verify the event no longer exists by
   attempting to
   wire it.

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * 4.5.2 or 4.5.2.1                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The event that is associated with a custom action on the     *
   * Content List widget menu is available only the first time    *
   * you access the page that contains the widget. When you       *
   * access the page again, the action is still present, but the  *
   * event is not. Therefore, nothing occurs if you select the    *
   * custom action.                                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * upgrade to 4.5.2.2                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In IBM ECM Widgets V4.5.2.2, the event that is associated with a
   custom action on the Content List widget remains available after
   the first time the page that contains the widget is accessed.
