ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  StoredIQ stores usernames in the lowercase, which forces users
   to login with the lowercase versions of their Usernames which,
   in LDAP, are created in full uppercase. This can be confusing
   to users and feels unecessary from the user  perspective
   
   StoredIQ is "destroying" case information by lower-casing login
   information. StoredIQ for Legal in contrast does not uppercase
   the login: It preserves the case such that login can work in
   both setting a customer could configure in their LDAP: case
   sensitive login (as Integro seems to encounter) and case
   insentive LDAP configuration (which some customers may
   configure for their LDAP as well).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fixed in release v7.6.0.11.  You will need to remove the
   existing LDAP users from StoredIQ and import them from the LDAP
   server again.
