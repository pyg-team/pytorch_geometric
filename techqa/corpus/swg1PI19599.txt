APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using XFactory/XCI API's for xsl transformations, there is
   a possibility of seeing java contention when running with
   concurrent requests.
   
   The contention occurs on MasterCursorFactory, due to the
   handling of synchronization with classloader operations as
   designed.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  XSL transformations using XFactory/XCI API's may cause
   contention under high loads in MasterCursorFactory leading to
   a degradation in performance. The cause, is in the
   synchronization of the classloader but the outcome was expected
   because that was how the class was initially designed. There
   was obvious improvements in the design in order to improve
   performance.
   
   The issue was fixed by improving and simplifying how we handled
   synchronization with the classloader in the MasterCursorFactory
   class so that we avoid any unnecessary contention.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.5.5.4.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
