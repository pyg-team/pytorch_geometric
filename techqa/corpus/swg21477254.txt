Title: IBM Unable to check out a network license of SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to check out a network license of SPSS for Windows on my laptop. Spsscommute.exe displays the modules, but renders no commutable licenses (0 out of 0 left). I can launch SPSS for Windows and obtain a license. What is the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Commuter licensing must be enabled on the machine where the SPSS Sentinel License Manager resides. 

1. Right-click My Computer and choose Properties.

2. Click the Advanced tab and select Environment Variables.

3. Locate the LSERVOPTS system variable and edit it. Find the "-com 0" parameter and either remove it to make all network licenses commutable or change the value to the percentage of licenses you want to be commutable. A valid value is between 0 and 100.

4. Restart the computer
