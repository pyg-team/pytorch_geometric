Description
This release provides the following updates to Network Protection Firmware Version 5.3.1: 


Serviceability and support enhancements
 * To manage the IBM Security Network Protection appliance in a NAT environment, a new tuning parameter is provided to override the sensor IP address with NAT public IP address in event details reported to the SiteProtector System. For more information, see technote 1884020 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21884020]. 
   

Fixes for the following Outbound SSL inspection issues 
 * Defect 70652: Update bundled trusted CA for outbound SSL inspection to verify server certification with modern and well-known trusted CAs. 
 * Defect 71270:Server certificate validation can cause Windows Update to fail when Outbound SSL inspection is enabled. 
 * Defect 69409: Firefox 37.01 does not open HTTPS pages when Outbound SSL inspection is enabled. 
 * Defect 68202:Outbound SSL traffic to Yahoo is not inspected due to unsupported TLS handshake behaviors and unsupported TLS extensions ALPN and NPN. 
 * Defect 71418: The management DCA update traffic that is sent from the protection interface IP can cause the appliance to crash.
   
   Notes:
