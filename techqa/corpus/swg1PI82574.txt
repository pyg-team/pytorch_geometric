APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using File Manager with a copybook and COBOL Version 6.1 is
   used File Manager fails.
   File Manager will not process copybooks correctly if the STGOPT
   compiler option is in effect.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To resolve the problem simply provide FM with an IGYCDOPT COBOL
   options with NOSTGOPT coded. This can also be coded for
   individual users via the COBOL settings.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of File Manager COBOL copybooks.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When creating templates from COBOL      *
   *                      copybooks and Enterprise COBOL 5.1 and  *
   *                      above is being used,                    *
   *                      incorrect Start positions are           *
   *                      displayed on the resulting template.    *
   *                      The customer has specified STGOPT       *
   *                      compiler option.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   When compiler option STGOPT is used by the compiler to create FM
   templates , incorrect ADATA is created and passed to FM
   resulting in an invalid template.
   File Manager does not support the STGOPT compiler option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  File Manager has been changed to override the compiler option
   STGOPT with NOSTGOPT for the duration of the copybook compile.
