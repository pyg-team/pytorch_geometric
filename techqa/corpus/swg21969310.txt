QUESTION
 How can I disable the Compatibility mode in Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser? Or, how do I force the web browser to display in Edge mode?

Compatibility mode supports web pages that are displayed in legacy versions of Windows Internet Explorer. You can force the browser to display contents in Edge mode, rather than in the default Compatibility mode.
