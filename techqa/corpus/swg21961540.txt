PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to run the Update the Content Platform Engine Client Connector Files step on ICM, ICN, CPE Deployment and Configuration Tool against a WAS server that uses a secure SSL connection, the deployment may fail to complete, showing an error. 

SYMPTOM
ICN, CPE and CM deployment consoles will display: 


Update the FileNet P8 Client Connector Files" task of the Content Navigator Configuration Manager fails with a Remote host closed connection during handshake" error.


WAS Application server logs will show the following exception: 


Unable to initialize SSL
connection. Unauthorized access was denied or security settings have expired. Exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol SSLv3 not enabled or not supported


CAUSE

The issue is caused by the deployment tool for ICN, ICM and CPE attempting to connect to the WAS using the SSLv3 protocol. 
This protocol has been disabled on WAS versions 8.0.0.0-WS-WASJavaSDK-WinX64-IFPI27100 or later, following the POODLE attacks that show its vulnerable to exploitation. 

More information can be found about the POODLE Vulnerability in SSLv3 at the following technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173].


ENVIRONMENT
WAS with 8.0.0.0-WS-WASJavaSDK-WinX64-IFPI27100 or later on the following products: 

Case Manager 5.2.0.2 or earlier. 

Case Manager 5.2.1.1 or earlier. 

Content Navigator 2.0.2.6 or earlier 

Content Navigator 2.0.3.2 or earlier 

Content Platform Engine 5.2.0.3 or earlier


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Where applicable, upgrade your systems to the following fix pack level: 

ICM 5.2.0.3 
ICM 5.2.1.2
ICN 2.0.2.7
ICN 2.0.3.3
CPE 5.2.0.3 IF01 

Modify the connection protocol in WAS as follows: 

 1. Open WAS Admin console. 
 2. Go to Security -> SSL certificate and key management > SSL configurations > NodeDefaultSSLSettings > Quality of protection (QoP) settings. 
 3. Under the Protocol dropdown, select SSL_TLS. 
 4. Click Apply, and Save directly to the master configuration.


Restarting WAS is not required when changing the Protocol.
