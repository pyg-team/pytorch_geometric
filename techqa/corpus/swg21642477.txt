Title: IBM Frameable Content : Potential Clickjacking - United States

Text:
Clickjacking TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The web server does not appear to prevent the hosted application being loaded by a 3rd party site within an iframe. As such, the web applications hosted on the server are open to clickjacking style attacks. 

CAUSE
displaying the TSAM UI in a frame within another application is working as designed. 

Why? 

TSAM UI originally had methods to prevent it from being displayed within a frame. However, many clients wanted to integrate the ootb UI with their own 
custom UI and complained about that. Therefore, the behavior was changed 
again for the sake of better integration capabilities.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the client decides that they do not want to integrate the UI and run 

it stand-alone, they can configure their IHS so that the UI may not be displayed in a frame. 
How? 
In httpd.conf add the line 

Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY 

to the configuration of your host or vhost. 
For this to work you need to load the headers module, which is not loaded by default. 
To load it, uncomment the line 

#LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so 

And restart the webserver. 

The IHS is basically a modified Apache server so most of the Apache 
commands and help on the web can be applied to IHS as well.
