APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Host On-Demand V9
   ___________________
   Host On-Demand macros used with Web Express Logon cache the
   stored userid and password.  Instead the macro should pull
   from the html the userid and password from the parameter each
   time it is loaded.
   In this scenario, the HOD portlet using the Web Express Logon
   for single signon causes the wrong userid to be loaded and
   authenticated unless the browser is closed and restarted.
   If the java process is killed and restarted then the name
   credentials are reloaded and all works appropriately.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Host On-Demand macro did not        *
   *                      pick up the changes in the Portal       *

   *                      vault, which were made after the HOD    *
   *                      macro was initiated.                    *
   *                      The Web Express Logon                   *
   *                      macro is affected.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Host On-Demand macro code's internal cache never updated the
   credentials when the macro ran.  This update needed to be
   dynamic, not a caching model.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Host On-Demand code was modified for the Portal Web Express
   Logon.
