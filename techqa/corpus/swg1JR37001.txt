APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During event processing, a monitor model may receive CWMRT0093E
   messages caused by a DB2 SQL error if a different DB2 JDBC
   Driver level is used instead of the level which is provided with
   the installed version of WebSphere Business Monitor.  The SQL
   error may look similar to:
   
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.b.SqlException: DB2 SQL error: SQLCODE: -104,
   SQLSTATE: 42601, SQLERRMC: final;select  from ;FROM
