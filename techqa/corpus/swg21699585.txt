Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM SPSS Modeler (CVE-2015-0159, CVE-2015-0138, CVE-2014-6221) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM SPSS Modeler. The GSKit that is shipped with IBM SPSS Modeler contains multiple security vulnerabilities including the â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. IBM SPSS Modeler has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6221 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6221]
DESCRIPTION: Random Data Generation using GSKit MSCAPI/MSCNG Interface Code does not generate cryptographically random data. An attacker could use this weakness to gain complete confidentially and/or integrity compromise.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 
This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2015-0159 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0159]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in GSKit usage of OpenSSL crypto function related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact in some ECC operations.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100835 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100835] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
