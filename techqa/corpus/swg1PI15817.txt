ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Library Selection section is opened (Configure, Edit
   Shared Settings or Personalize from within the Authoring
   portlet), multiple libraries are selected when the mouse is
   hovered over a library item once the scroll bar for either the
   Available Libraries or Selected Libraries is used.
   
   Example:
   1. Use Internet Explorer
   2. Log into the WCM Authoring portlet using an admin user
   3. Click on Edit Shared Settings
   4. Expand the Library Selection section
   5. Click on the 1st library within the Available Libraries box
   6. Then click on the scroll bar for the Available Libraries
   7. Then hover the mouse over the a different library in the
   Available Libraries box
   8. All the libraries between the selected library from Step 5
   and the current position of the mouse hover is selected
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Click on one of the libraries again to clear out all the
   currently highlighted libraries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the Library Selection section is opened (Configure, Edit
   Shared Settings or Personalize from within the Authoring
   portlet), multiple libraries are selected when the mouse is
   hovered over a library item once the scroll bar for either the
   Available Libraries or Selected Libraries is used.
   
   Example:
   1. Use Internet Explorer
   2. Log into the WCM Authoring portlet using an admin user
   3. Click on Edit Shared Settings
   4. Expand the Library Selection section
   5. Click on the 1st library within the Available Libraries box
   6. Then click on the scroll bar for the Available Libraries
   7. Then hover the mouse over the a different library in the
   Available Libraries box
   8. All the libraries between the selected library from Step 5
   and the current position of the mouse hover is selected
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was updated to prevent the mouse-hover selection issue
   from occurring when Internet Explorer is used.
