Title: IBM IR33008: IF USING ALTERNATE HASHING ALGORITHM FOR EALITEMR, ALSO DEFINE ALTERNATIVE HASHING ALGORITHM FOR PENDING AND BACKUP ITEM FILES - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using an alternate hashing algorithm for ealitemr, you
   should also create a logical name for the backup (EALITMBK)
   and pending (EALITMNX) item record files.  This is not
   documented.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  GSA 4690 569654600 offers a new option to rebuild
   the item record file, Ealitemr.Dat under application
   personalization.  The default size is 50 bytes, but
   record lengths of 63 and 71 bytes are allowable.
   See Chapter 15 in 4680/4690 GSA Planning & Installation
   Guide GC30-3630.  Customers who use this options must
   take the size of the item record file into consideration
   for optimum performance.  OS 4690 Programming Guide
   beginning on page 6-10 under Hashing Algorithms, discusses
   setting hashing to a value other than default for files over
   40K.  EALITEMRH, EALITMNXH, and EALITMBKH are to be added
   via Controller Configuration under "User Logical Names".
   Setting the hashing algorithim for the logical name equal
   to 1 or 2 is needed as discussed in more detail on page
   6-10 - 6-12 of the OS Programming Guide. Activate & IPL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Files larger than 40K in size will achieve optimum
   performance by setting the hashing algorithm to
   1 or 2.  A review of the 4690 OS Programming Guide
   topic for hashing algorithims for keyed files will
   give more details.  All 3 files for the item record
   referenced in the problem summary should be set up
   with the alternate algorithm 1 or 2 (preferrably 2
   if very large file) if customers use the REBUILD
   ITEM RECORD FILE option in GSA personalization.
