   The StartConfigManagerProxyExerciser script does not give
   enough details of the environment settings required to run the
   ConfigManagerProxy Exerciser on z/OS and connect to the Queue
   Manager in bindings mode.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the
   StartConfigManagerProxyExerciser script gives details of the
   environment settings required to run the ConfigManagerProxy
   Exerciser on z/OS and connect to the Queue Manager in bindings
   mode.
   
   The following instructions have been added to the
   StartConfigManagerProxyExerciser script:
   # To run the CMP API Exerciser on z/OS and connect to the
   # broker Queue Manager in MQ bindings mode the MQ
   # libraries must be in the LIBPATH and STEPLIB.
   # eg:
   # export LIBPATH=<WebSphere MQ install location>/lib:$LIBPATH
   # STEPLIB=<WebSphere MQ high-level-qualifier>.SCSQANLE:$STEPLIB
   # STEPLIB=<WebSphere MQ high-level-qualifier>.SCSQAUTH:$STEPLIB
   # export STEPLIB
