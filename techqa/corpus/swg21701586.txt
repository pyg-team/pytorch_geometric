Security Alert
Revocation information for the security certificate for this site is not available. Do you want to proceed?
[Yes] [No] [View Certificate]


ENVIRONMENT
Both of the following are true: 

 * Report server configured to use HTTPS (SSL) 
 * Customer using a self-signed (non-commercial) SSL certificate


Example: 

In one real-life example, the customer's Certificate Authority was running on one of their Active Directory servers. 

 * This issued an SSL certificate for the Controller application server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Workaround: 

Untick the box "Check for server certificate revocation". 

 

 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Launch Internet Explorer 
 * 2. Click "Tools - Options" 
 * 3. Click the "Advanced" tab 
 * 4. Scroll down to the "Security" section
   5. Untick the box "Check for server certificate revocation"

   6. Click OK.

Fix: 

The best solution will vary, depending on your scenario. 

 

Example: 

In one real-life customer example, the solution was to logon to the Controller application server using a valid Active Directory Windows username. 

 * In other words, do not logon using a 'local' (non-domain) account. 


This ensures that the end user has sufficient rights to query the Active Directory, to reach the Certificate Authority server, and retrieve the full details for the SSL certificate.
