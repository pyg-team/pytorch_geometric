Title: IBM Format of XML-type ruleset parameters in SOAP messages with MTDS - United States

Text:
XSD; schema; SOAP; web service TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to format the value of an XML-type ruleset parameter in the SOAP request to a Monitored Transparent Decision Service (MTDS) ? 

CAUSE
As mentioned in the documentation for MTDS, XML parameters are represented by a String in the WSDL file.

ANSWER
The value of the parameter is the XML data corresponding to your input parameter XSD, either passed in a CDATA section or by escaping the XML special characters (replacing <, >, ", ' and & with &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &apos; and &amp;).
