PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You upgrade a Rational Team product. During the upgrade, you receive a message to stop running processes or services. The message lists which processes and services to stop. After stopping the processes or services, the upgrade restarts, then fails. This failure can occur with rollbacks and uninstalls.


SYMPTOM
Note: This issue has been corrected in 7.1.2 version of the Rational Team Products. 

Starting in Rational Team product versions 7.1.0.2 and 7.0.2.1, a message displays that indicates you must stop processes and services that are running. See Technote #1385993 Stop processes and services for Rational products on Windows before updating [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21385993] for more information. The message lists which processes or services to stop. In some cases, not all of the running processes or services are listed in the message. Stopping all running processes and services is required for a successful uninstall, update, or rollback of a Rational Team product.

For example, you uninstall IBM Rational ClearCase while IBM Rational ClearCase Doctor is running. The uninstall process displays a message directing you to stop the Rational ClearCase processes. The message does not list Rational ClearCase Doctor as a process that must be stopped. The uninstall fails because the Rational ClearCase Doctor process is running. 

Another example is that an upgrade, rollback, or uninstall fails because Installation Manager could not delete a file. 


CAUSE
This issue occurs when the installation directory specified by the user does not match the canonical path used by the computer.

For example, you specify the installation directory: C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC. This directory uses an upper case "IBM". The operating system uses the case-sensitive path: C:\Program Files\ibm\RationalSDLC. This directory uses a lower case "ibm".


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before you install a Rational Team product, verify that the specified installation directory matches the canonical path used by the operating system. 

For example, you plan to use the installation directory: C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC. The directory C:\Program Files\ibm already exists on the operating system. This directory uses a lower case "ibm". Change the installation directory to use the lower case "ibm": C:\Program Files\ibm\RationalSDLC. 

 

If the Rational Team product is already installed, follow these instructions: 

 1. Reboot the machine. The reboot stops all product specific processes. 
 2. Follow the preventive steps in Technote #1412312 How to prevent file deletion errors when installing, upgrading, rolling back, or uninstalling an Rational Team product [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21412312] to verify that no other sessions or processes are spawned during your upgrade, rollback, or uninstall. 
 3. Launch Installation Manager. Start the upgrade, rollback, or uninstall. 
 4. If your action fails again with a file deletion error, follow the workaround steps in Technote #1412312 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21412312]to determine what process is using the file and how to unlock it. Repeat step 3 once you have stopped the process that is locking the file.
