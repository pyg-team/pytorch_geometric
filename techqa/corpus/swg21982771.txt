UPDATING WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER
 If you are running WebSphere Application Server 8, 8.5, or 8.5.5, internal changes that were made to ClearQuest Web in this release will require changes to your WAS installation. To update your WAS installation, take one of the following measures:

 *  Install the WAS iFix for PI50993, or WAS fixpack 8.5.5.9 or 8.0.0.12 (refer to http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969251 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969251]). 
 *  Configure the classpath order for the ClearQuest Web application within TeamEAR to search for parent last. In the left panel of the WAS web console (for example, http(s)://hostname:12443/ibm/console) , navigate to Applications, Application Types, WebSphere enterprise applications. On the list, click TeamEAR > Manage Modules > cqweb.war, then change the class load order to "Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)". Click OK and save, then restart the CQWeb WAS profile.

Note: If WAS 7.x is deployed, no changes are necessary.
