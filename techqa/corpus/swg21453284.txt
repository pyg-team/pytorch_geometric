QUESTION
 How to check whether a particular port is being blocked by the firewall for either Management IP address or Data IP address or for an Endpoint? 

ANSWER
To check whether a particular port is been blocked or not, perform the following steps:

1. From the command line, issue the command:
telnet <ipaddress> <portnumber>

Result: If the port is blocked then it will show "Connection refused" error message. If it shows a cursor blinking and waiting for input, it means the port is open.

2. Login into the appliance and perform the following:
netspect connect host <ipaddress> tcp portnumber <portnumber>
> This command will let you know whether a particular port is filtered/closed or open.
