Title: IBM ISAM reauthentication prompt before WebSEAL timeout reached (SMS involved) - United States

Text:
SMS DSess TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users are unexpectedly asked to login again to WebSEAL (in Session Management Server setup) 

SYMPTOM
The WebSEAL session time out is set to 1 hour ([session] timeout= 7200, but users are asked to authenticate again before this timeout is reached. 


CAUSE
The Session Management Server also has a setting that controls how long user sessions remain active. When WebSEAL contacts SMS, which no longer has a reference to the user session, WebSEAL will ask the user to reauthenticate

ENVIRONMENT
WebSEAL connected to a Session Management Server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
WebSEAL traces (server task <webseal> trace set pdweb.dsess.client 9 file path=dsesstrace.txt) are reporting following messages: "DPWDS0318I The session does not exist."





For example: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * http://sms1.be.ibm.com:9081/Dsess/services/DSess 
 * 
   getSession failed: int ID DjddkTFD44nqnskdCQSDFdklqutgDQckfjlc/gkdiuctQCtldds=, result DPWDS0318I The session does not exist. (0x38a0a13e) 
 * ------------------



On the SMS side, within the WebSphere SystemOut.log and/or trace.log (with trace specification *=info: com.tivoli.am.sms.*=all) stack traces like contain entries like: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ------------------
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that SMS instance property "Maximum session lifetime" is configured to a larger value than the webseal timeout setting (In WebSEAL config file [session] timeout= xxx). Re-run the SMS configuration (either using ISC or smscfg -action config) to increase this value. During the smscfg -action config configuration you can give this value when the following prompt appears: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Maximum session lifetime (seconds): 8000
