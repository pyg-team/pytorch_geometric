Text:
queue jobs TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to run jobs using IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services results in queued jobs. 

SYMPTOM
In Deployment Manger Client, view Job History, shows jobs in queued status. 





ENVIRONMENT
C&DS 5.0 FP3 
Suse Linux 11 
Websphere 7.0.0.29 
Non-clutered environment 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The systemout.log does reference threads that may be hung but do eventually resolve. 

[5/8/14 13:21:47:955 GMT] 0000001c ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread
"SIBJMSRAThreadPool : 2" (00000026) has been active for 695287
milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s) in total in the
server that may be hung.
at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:167)
at
com.spss.process.internal.execution.RemoteProcessWork.execute(RemoteProc
essWork.java:73)
at
com.spss.process.internal.execution.WorkEvent.execute(WorkEvent.java:167
)
at com.spss.process.internal.execution.Event.run(Event.java:249)

but then later, we see the following:

[5/8/14 14:13:33:003 GMT] 00000026 ThreadMonitor W WSVR0606W: Thread
"SIBJMSRAThreadPool : 2" (00000026) was previously reported to be hung
but has completed. It was active for approximately 3800335
milliseconds. There is/are 0 thread(s) in total in the server that
still may be hung.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the following settings in the WebSphere Admin Console


Expand on Resources
Expand on JMS
Click on Activation specifications
Click on CDSProcessEventActivationSpec
Increase Maximum batch size - the default is 1
Increase Maximum concurrent MDB invocations per endpoint - the default is 5

For more information on these settings please work with your WebSphere administrator or contact WebSphere support.
