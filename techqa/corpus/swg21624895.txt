QUESTION
 I have been told to run a 'support execute' command by Guardium Technical Support. How can I view or monitor the progress of this command? 

ANSWER
The progress of the command can be viewed/tracked in the following file : 

/var/log/guard/execute_<date>_<time>.out

You can access this file by running the 'fileserver' command in another cli session and
accessing the sqlguard logs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499434]
