ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cus reported that after upgrading notes client from 8.0.2 to
   8.5, customized
   archive criteria disappeared from archive setting. This issue
   doesn't happen
   when upgrading notes from 7.0.3 to 8.0.2.
   
   Env: Domino 7.0.3 FP1 + Notes 8.5 standard on Win32.
   
   The reproduce steps are:
   1. Create a archive policy in domino directory on 7.0.3
   server.
   2. In the archive policy,Add a new archive criteria named
   "customized archive
   criteria" and prohibit private archiving criteria is enabled ( I
   am using local
   archiving).
   3. Assign this archive policy to one or more users as explicit
   policy.
   4. Open Notes client 8.0.2 and access server, make sure the
   policy has been
   rolled out to the speicified user. Open archive setting of the
   user's mail
   file, and found that "customized archive criteria" appeared in
   criteria with a
   lock.
   5. Shut down the notes client and upgrade notes to 8.5
   standard.
   6. After upgrading to 8.5 successfully, open the notes client
   again, and found
   "customized archive criteria" disappeared in archive settings.
   Instead, two
   default archive criteria appears.
   
   Cus tried to drop the user's session and restart the notes
   client. The
   "customized archive criteria" will reappear, but after about 20
   mins, it
   disappeared again.
   
   This issue can be reproduced in my test env, and just like
   customer said that
   the criteria will re-disappear.
   Try to drop user's session and restart notes client again is no
   help to the
   problem. But when I edit the policy document and save it again,
   then restart
   the notes client, the criteria can be displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None know at this time.  Will try editing the policy and
   resave.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is associated with SPR# JYJG7NY8DK.
   Per development: I was unable to recreate the problem. I
    started with an R703FP1 server and a R703FP1 client. I created
    the policy, settings document, and archive criteria. All were
    applied correctly. I then upgrade the client to R802 and made
    sure that the new effective policy came down and was stored
    (as it appropriate for R8.02). I then upgraded to R8.5 Gold
    and did the same. At no time did the criteria archive settings
    go away. The text in the SPR made mention that at one point
    the only the 2 default settings were present. This would
    indicate that the settings in the $Policy view had been wiped
    out and no setting were present. I suspect that attaching to
    the home server and having dynconfig run as a consequence
    would have fixed the issue by bringing down the effective
    policy. In any event, as a workaround, in the client one can
    open the local nab, go to the hidden $Policies view, delete
    the entries, and have the policies come down again via
    dynconfig. Also, it is normally standard procedure to upgrade
    the server before upgrading the clients. So while I have not
    seen a problem with the client upgrades as specified, running
    an 8.5 client against a R7.0X server is not standard. Unless I
    can be given a reproducible scenario, and the scenario
    specified in the SPR was detailed, I am closing this SPR at
    present. I suspect that a misunderstanding of how policy
    settings come down may be the reason for this SPR being
    created.
