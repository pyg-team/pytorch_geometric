 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 
A 9235/XH40 appliance may restart or in rare cases the boot up may not complete due to Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) communications loss. 

CONTENT
 If a failure to restart occurs, the appliance needs to be manually power cycled by powering off the appliances then removing and then replacing the power cords for at least 60 seconds. 

IBM has created APAR LI76717 to investigate this problem. This technote will be updated when the results of the investigation are completed.
