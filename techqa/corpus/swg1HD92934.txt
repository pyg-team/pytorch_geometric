ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario :
   Background:
   Environment:
   AIX 6.1 TL2
   C++ runtime 10.1.0.0
   Fortran runtime 12.1.0.0
   Scenario:
   1. Unable to create parts or drawings in CATIA V5R19 SP4
   (32-bit) on AIX 6.1 (64-bit kernel). CATIA seems to start OK
   - the GUI appears, the Product Structure workbench is loaded,
   2. Initial Product1.CATProduct appears. If user then attempts
   to create a new Part or Drawing, a "Licensing problem"
   message window appears with the message "No license available
   for this application". I am running with an AL3 license.
   If CATIA started from command line:
   > install_dir/B19/aix_a/code/command/catstart -run CNEXT
   The following messages appear as CATIA starts:
   Starting CATIA V5 program. Please wait...
   Cannot open library libCATDrafting2DLProvider.a
   Cannot open library libCATRmaView.a
   Cannot open library libCATPenConfiguration.a
   Cannot open library libCATRdgWorkbench.a
   .
   While attempting a new part, the following message is added:
   Cannot open library libCATMechanicalModelerUI.a
   .
   When I attempt to create a new drawing, the following message
   is added:
   Cannot open library libCATDuiWkbDrw.a
   .
   No error files are created. All error messages appear on the
   screen,
   not in a log file. No Abendtrace is created.
   .
   Check Prerequisites runs OK.Integrity Check Level 1, Level 2
   and Level 3 all run OK.
   .
   Default CATSettings were used.
   This same system also has ENOVIA V6R2010 Server code
   installed, which runs successfully.
   .
   Possible defect area:
   When compared lslpp ?L output of L2 machine with users
   machine, it was found that following file sets were missing
   at users end.
   xlsmp.aix53.rte                  SMP Runtime Libraries for
   AIX 5.3
   xlsmp.rte                              SMP Runtime Library
   
   xlsmp.msg.en_US.rte     SMP Runtime Messages - U.S. English
   
   .
   User explained that he installed what is mentioned in R19
   Pdir (and 3ds.com site) but not got above file sets installed
   on his machine.
   .
   Expected results:
   1. According to V5R19 PDir, followings are the Prerequisites
   for CATIA:
   .
   AIX 6.1 Technology Level 02 GA with following components:
   XL C/C++ V10.1.0.0 Run-time Environment (part of AIX 6.1
   TL02)
   XL Fortran V12.1.0.0 Run-Time Environment (part of AIX 6.1
   TL02)
   Java 1.5.0 32 bit Service Refresh 7
   JAVA 1.5.0 IBM AIX build pap32dev-20080315 (SR7)
   Fileset: Java5.sdk 5.0.0.175
   .
   Is above prerequisites list is sufficient to get above xlsmp
   file sets ? If not:
   2. Which other application user needs to install.
   .
