APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When we run our monthly PLUSTMPBILL to generate Transportation
   Billing records the cron stops before it completes processing
   all records
   
   There are 350 records that need
   to generate billing records but only generate 310 and no more
   generating. When we change the cron task run time to later, it
   creates
   another 30 records but stops generating again. I changed the
   cron task
   time again but no record generated. There may be a record having
   a
   problem but the cron task should go on not stop.
   These
   records are short term leases (MOTORPOOL).
   .
   The problem only related to the MOTORPOOL type of dispatches.
   
   Steps to replicate:
   To have Maximo create billing transactions on a long term motor
   pool
   assignment, do the following;
   
   Go to the Organization (TR) application and enter a billing
   schedule in
   the Transportation > Motor Pool Options action.
   Set the Schedule for the first of every month
   
   Create an asset in the Asset (TR) application and enter the
   following:
   Type = FLEET,
   Enter a location,
   In the Motor Pool tab, select the Long Term Assignment check
   box,
   Change the asset's status to OPERATING.
   
   In the Cron Task Setup application, enter a Schedule (the first
   of every
   month) for the PLUSTMPBILLING cron task to create and select
   the Active
   check box.
   
   Go to the Rate Schedule (Tr) application and insert a new
   record as
   follows:
   Select the Long Term Assignment check box,
   Enter FLEET for the Asset Type
   Insert a new row on the Time Rates tab. Enter 1 as the Ranking,
   MONTHS
   as the Time Units, and a Unit Price.
   Change the Status to Active.
   
   
   Go to the Vehicle Requests (Tr) application and insert a new
   record as
   follows:
   Enter Needham as the assignment and Dispatch locations.
   Assignment Type as LONGTERM
   Asset Type as FLEET
   Change the Reported Date to 02/01/2010
   Estimated Start Date as 02/01/2010 (February 1, 2010)
   Estimated end Date as 12/31/2010 (December 31, 2010)
   
   
   Go to the Vehicle Scheduling (Tr) application
   Select the dispatch created above and select the Show Best
   Matches
   button
   Select the asset created above
   Select the Schedule Dispatch , insure the Rate Schedule above is
   selected, and select OK
   Select the dispatch again and select the Start Dispatch action
   and
   insure the start date is 02/01/2010 and select OK
   
   After the billing cron task runs, there should be a transaction
   for all
   the months past.
