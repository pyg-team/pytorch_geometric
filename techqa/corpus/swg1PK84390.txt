APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When compiling some COBOL programs, the user gets the following
   errors:
   IGYDS5125-U The compilation was terminated due to a compiler
               error in phase id: "IGYCDSCN".
   IGYDS5201-U Internal compiler error code "IGYSADAT", stack
               empty, node type= 000101" occurred.
   The error relates to the ADATA compiler option.
   The user is also compiling with the TEST(ALL,SYM,SEP) option
   and using the SEP suboption also seems to be involved.
   Some of the following may also be factors:
   - The Region size and the SIZE(MAX) compiler option.
   - The SYSLIB has more than 25 datasets concatenated and
     copybooks are retrieved from several of them.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One or more of the following may circumvent the problem.
   1)  Compile with NOTEST or TEST(..,..,NOSEP)
   2)  Compile without specifying ADATA
   3)  Try a larger region, at least more than 112M
   4)  Instead of SIZE(MAX), limit with SIZE(4000K) or greater.
   5)  Embed all copybooks by creating a SYSMDECK or put
       the used members in the first SYSLIB referenced.
