 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM HTTP Server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0226 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0226]
Description: The IBM HTTP server is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by a race condition in the mod_status module when handling the scoreboard. By sending a specially-crafted request, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.5 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94678 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94678] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 
Work around or Mitigations: This can be mitigated by limiting mod_status access to trusted IPs. 

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0231 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0231]
Description: The IBM HTTP Server is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the mod_cgid module. By sending specially-crafted requests, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause child process to hang. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94674 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94674] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 
Work around or Mitigation: This does not affect Windows platform or if you do not have CGI enabled. 

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0118 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0118]
Description: The IBM HTTP Server is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the mod_deflate module. By sending specially-crafted requests, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available CPU and memory resources. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94675] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) 
Work around or Mitigation: This can be mitigated by not loading the optional mod_deflate module or by disabling the DEFLATE input filter. 

CVE ID: CVE-2013-5704 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5704] 
Description: The IBM HTTP Server is vulnerable to HTTP trailers being used to replace HTTP headers late during request processing, potentially confusing modules that examined or modified request headers earlier. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92235 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92235] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 
Workaround or Mitigation: none
