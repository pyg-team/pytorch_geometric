QUESTION
 When applying certain DB2 Administration Tool PTFs, I see warning messages such as the following:

GIM43401W MODULE ADBCCM IN SYSMOD UI48283 WAS NOT INSTALLED IN ANY
TARGET LIBRARIES
GIM43401W MODULE ADBCCM IN SYSMOD UI48022 WAS NOT INSTALLED IN ANY
TARGET LIBRARIES
GIM43401W MODULE ADB2REX IN SYSMOD UI48022 WAS NOT INSTALLED IN ANY
TARGET LIBRARIES

Why am I getting these messages? Can I ignore them? 

ANSWER
The GIM43401W message for module ADBCCM occurs whenever a PTF updates this module, which is required for the DB2 Administration Tool Change Management feature. This message will always appear when applying such maintenance, even when Change Management is enabled, for the following reason. Module ADBCCM is installed in the DB2 Administration Tool AADBNCAL distribution library (after the product is SMP/E ACCEPTed), but is never installed in the SADBLLIB target library. Rather, its counterpart, module GOCCCM, is installed in the DB2 Object Comparison Tool target library SGOCLLIB (DB2 Object Comparison Tool being required for Change Management), and any updates to ADBCCM are actually made to GOCCCM. So the GIM43401W message, which states simply that ADBCCM was not installed in a target library, is accurate, but, at the same time, can be safely ignored. 

Module ADB2REX was included in the build for 12.1 PTF UI48022 in error, and so the message GIM43401W for this module can also be safely ignored. 

Please also note the following statement in the Program Directory:

You may receive the following message codes which do not affect the product installation:
GIM23903W, GIM23904W, GIM43401W, IEW2455W.
