   WHEN USING THE ACTIVATE() CONTROL GETS RETURN IF A IF STATEMENT
   
   The Netcool/Impact 3.1 Policy Reference Guide contains an
   incorrect syntax description and example for the Activate
   function.
   
   The Activate function transfers control to another policy. When
   you call Activate, you pass a data item of type Policy or the
   name of the policy as an input variable. If you want to
   activate a policy using a data item, you must first retrieve it
   from the Policy data type using GetByFilter, GetByKey, or
   GetByLinks. If you pass both a data item and a policy name to
   this function, Activate uses only the policy name. When you
   call Activate, the policy inherits all of the variables,
   including EventContainer, set in the first policy. When the
   policy finishes running, control is passed back to the first.
   
   Syntax
   
   The syntax for the Activate function is as follows:
   
   Activate(DataItem, PolicyName)
   
   where DataItem is a Data item of type Policy that represents
   the policy you want to activate or PolicyName is the name of
   the policy.
   
   Examples
   
   The following example shows how to activate a policy using a
   data item.
   
   DataType = Policy; Filter = Name = MY_POLICY; CountOnly =
   False;
   
   MyPolicy = GetByFilter(DataType, Filter, CountOnly);
   
   Activate(MyPolicy, NULL);
   
   The following example shows how to activate a policy using the
   policy name.
   
   Activate(NULL, MY_POLICY);
