ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Consider a global function. Its return type is a pointer to a cl
   ass. If
   I add the function to another class' source artifacts I would ex
   pect a
   forward generation to the returned class within the header file
   and an
   #include within the .cpp file.
   
   But Rhapsody (7.5.0.1 and 7.5.1 as well) generates both the forw
   ard and
   the #include to the .cpp file, and nothing to the .h file, so th
   at the
   code would not compile.
   
   To repair this I modeled a ??Usage?? dependency from A to B. But
   :
   Setting this dependency to 'Specification' leads to an #include
   'B.h'
   in both the .cpp and .h. Setting it to 'Implementation' or 'Exis
   tence'
   leads to an #include 'B.h' in the .cpp and a forward of B in bot
   h the .
   cpp and .h. This compiles but is not nice.
