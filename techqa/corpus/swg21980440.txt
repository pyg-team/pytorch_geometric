PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Jazz for Service Management/Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) installation fails with:

"CTGWA0135E Fail to deploy samples to isc.ear. [D:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\install\tip\tipWrapperInstall.xml:48]" 

CAUSE
An exclamation point in the primary admin user password causes an execution of the WAS serverStatus command to fail. Defect APAR IV83287

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Locate the ant log that is referenced just after the occurrence of the "[D:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM\install\tip\tipWrapperInstall.xml:48]" error in the top level IM log. In the ant log search for the string serverStatus to find the execution of the serverStatus command. The result of the serverStatus execution is:
"ERROR: Invalid username or password."

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use a simplified password that uses only letters and numbers. After the JazzSM installation is complete the password can be changed to include special character as long as those characters conform to those supported by Websphere Application Server.
