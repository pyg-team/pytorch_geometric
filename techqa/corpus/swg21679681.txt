Title: IBM NoSuchMethodError: org/codehaus/jackson/map/ObjectMapper.setDateFormat when accessing Rule Execution Server console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When access the Rule Execution Server (RES) console, I see the following error:
Error 500: javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
org/codehaus/jackson/map/ObjectMapper.setDateFormat (Ljava/text/DateFormat;) 

CAUSE
This error usually indicates the Class Loading order of the RES console module has not been correctly set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the Class loader order property is set to Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last), for the ILOG Rule Execution Server Console module of the Rule Execution Server EAR. See Step 17 of the documentation at 

Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Configuring > Configuring Operational Decision Manager on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring Rule Execution Server on WebSphere Application Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.distrib.config.was%2Fconfig_ds_res_was8%2Ftsk_was_deploy_mgmt_ear.html]

After setting the Class loader order property, save the changes and restart the server.

If this does not help, explore the configurations again for your installation, and other environmental factors (e.g.: JDK/JVM version, application server), Also explore the server logs for diagnosis. Contact IBM support if problem is still not resolved.
