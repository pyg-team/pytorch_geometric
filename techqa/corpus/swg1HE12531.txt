ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Atlas,  Hold notice next auto reminder date is not getting
   updated as per the interval configured in the Rule page. As a
   result, Send Reminder Notice Task sends  additional reminders
   until next auto reminder date is in sync with last auto
   reminder sent date and auto reminder interval. one additional
   reminder is  getting sent wherever it is not in sync. The issue
   is not happening with new hold notices.  Rather old hold
   notices wherever next auto reminder date is not in sync are
   affected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually identify notices and update
   HOLD_NOTICE_PROC/AUTO_NEXT_DATE column as the auto reminder
   interval
