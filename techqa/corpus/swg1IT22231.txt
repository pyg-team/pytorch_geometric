ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM MQ and MQ Appliance version 903, A user may not be able
   to
   authenticate to a queue manager when the MCAUSER attribute is
   being used. The user's credentials are
   not properly mapped to that of the MCAUSER resulting in a
   failed connection. The following error messages are seen in the
   queue manager's error log:
   
   AMQ9557: Queue Manager User ID initialization failed for
   <MCAUSER>.
   AMQ9790: The failed authentication check was caused by a
   CHLAUTH record with CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED).
