APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Oracle Connector allows only for values "10g" and "11g" to be
   specified in the "Oracle client version" property. Similarly,
   DRS Connector allows only for values "10" and "11" to be
   specified for the "Oracle" property under "Variant" property
   when "Database type" property is set to value "Oracle". The two
   supported values in the two connectors suggest that
   theconnectors assume the Oracle Client installation on the
   Information Server engine tier to be one of 10gR2 or 11g(R1/R2).
    The two connectors should allow for values "12c" and "12",
   respectively, and should in that case assume Oracle Client
   installation 12c.
   
   Limitations in Oracle Connector and DRS Connector exist in
   respect to processing VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values with
   extended sizes up to 32767 bytes when connecting to Oracle
   Database 12c with extended maximum size enabled for these column
   types. For example, when unbounded VarChar columns is present on
   the input link to the Oracle Connector stage or DRS Connector
   stage, and a value larger than 4000 bytes is provided for that
   column, the connector will fail to insert it to the database.
   Similarly in this scenario, if the connector is configured to
   automatically create target table, it will create a table with
   the length of 4000 instead of 32767.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To connect to Oracle Database 12c with Oracle Connector and DRS
   Connector, the value "11g" and "11" can be specified,
   respectively. The installed Oracle Client version in this case
   should be 11gR1 or 11gR2. It is also possible to use Oracle
   Client version 12c in this case, but since the two connectors
   will explicitly try to dynamically link to the Oracle Client
   library from version 11gR1 or 11gR2, then depending on the
   platform and the Oracle Client distribution type in place (Full,
    Instant Basic, Instant Basic Lite), it may be necessary to
   manually create a symbolic link for the Oracle Client 11g client
    library to point to the Oracle Client 12c library, for example:
   ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so.11.1
   When such a symbolic link is present, the Oracle Connector and
   DRS Connector will dynamically link to Oracle Client 12c client
   library by the means of the provided symbolic link.
   
   To work around the limitations in respect to processing
   VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values with extended sizes up to
   32767 bytes when connecting to Oracle Database 12c with extended
   maximum size enabled for these column types, the environment
   variables CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_STRING_LENGTH and
   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_BINARY_LENGTH cab be set. By setting these
   environment variables to value 32767, the connector will assume
   the maximum size in bytes of 32767 for VarChar/NVarChar and
   VarBinary link column value, respectively, instead of assuming
   the maximum size of 4000. When automatically creating tables
   based on unbounded VarChar, NVarChar and VarBinary input link
   columns, the connector will create tables with the VARCHAR2,
   NVARCHAR2 and RAW table columns of size 32767, instead of the
   size 4000, 4000 and 2000, respectively. For this workaround to
   apply it is necessary to use Oracle Client 12c installation,
   because Oracle Client 11gR2 installations and earlier will not
   allow for processing atomic VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values
   larger than 4000 bytes even if the
   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_STRING_LENGTH and
   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_BINARY_LENGTH variables are set to accomodate
   such larger values. The Oracle error codes that will be returned
   in this case include ORA-01461 or ORA-24920.

COMMENTS
 *  The Oracle 12c support for Oracle Connector is now available in
   Information Server version 11.5.  The DRS Connector support will
   be added later.
