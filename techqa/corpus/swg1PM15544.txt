APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently, the entries in the 'Action on entry' and 'Action on e
   xit' for a substate doesn't actually impact the code generation.
    This may be the designed behaviour because the substate on a to
   p level really corresponds to the state itself.
   If this is the scenario then this field should be non-editable.
   
   Moreover, there are no warnings generated to say the least or no
   t really documented anywhere on this behaviour.

   ****************************************************************
   For the "Action on entry" and "Action on exit" fields for a
   substate, no code is generated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is the expected behavior. As of version 7.5.3, these
   fields are disabled. This change was described in the
   migration guide for 7.5.3:
   
   Features window for top-level state in sub-statechart
   
   In version 7.5.2 of Rational Rhapsody, the user interface
   allowed you to define entry and exit actions in the features
   window for the top-level state in a sub-statechart. This
   behavior has been changed in version 7.5.3. Now, these
   fields are disabled in the features window for the top-level
   state in a sub-statechart.
   
   In version 7.5.3, if you generate code for an existing model
   where entry or exit actions have been defined for the
   top-level state in a sub-statechart, these actions are not
   reflected in the generated code. However, they will still be
   displayed in the relevant fields in the features window. If
   you want to remove these actions, open the model in version
   7.5.2 and manually remove the defined actions, and then
   reopen the model in 7.5.3.
