QUESTION
 How do I discover which Fix Pack I have installed for version MDM 11.x? 

ANSWER
If you do not know which Fix Packs you have installed, please go to your WebSphere Console -> Applications -> Application Types -> Assets -> com.ibm.mdm.hub.server.app-*.eba -> Update bundle versions in this application. 
You will need to check the Deployed Version for all of the bundles. When you are looking at the versions, they will be in this format:

11.x.0.FPyyyIFzzz_<builddate>

The 11.x refers to the major version of MDM in use, for example 11.4.

The FPyyy indicates the Fix Pack for that bundle. You are looking for the highest number for the Fix Pack for all of your bundles. For example you may see a lot of your bundles have FP000 but find some that are also FP002. This would mean you have Fix Pack 2.

Not every bundle is updated when a Fix Pack is released, which explains the potential mixture of bundle FP versions.

The IFzzz indicates the iFix (interim fix) version. iFixes are "standalone" fixes distributed outside of the schedule of a full Fix Pack, typically when critical issues are discovered that require an accelerated fix release.
