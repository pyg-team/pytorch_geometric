LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a stored procedure is running from either project
   explorer or database explorer, DB2 Developer Workbench
   (DWB)  V9.1 or Rational Application Developer (RAD) V7
   attempt to set current SQLID to an unauthorized SQLID for
   target DB2 for Z/OS. As a result, DB2 for Z/OS issued an
   authorization error.  The problem is DWB V9.1 and RAD V7
   incorrectly use the SET CURRENT SQLID statement  to set the
   target schema for the stored procedures when running a
   stored procedure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DB2 Developer Workbench (DWB) V9.1 and Rational
   Application Developer (RAD)V7  have been changed to
   correctly  set schema for the running stored procedure. The
   SET CURRENT SQLID statement to identify the running stored
   procedure has been removed.
   Delivered in Rational Application Developer V7004.
