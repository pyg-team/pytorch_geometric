APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title:  Unable to install Sybase Agent on ITIM server
   
   Problem Description:  I am unable to install on w2k3 - the
   installer
   gets to the part where it
   reports the size to be installed and says 0MB.  I click finish,
   nothing,
   no service at all
   On XP I can install, but the service doesn't start.
   
   when I try to run SybaseAgent.exe from the command line I get
   
   Application popup: SybaseAgent.exe - Unable To Locate Component
   : This
   application has failed to start because icuuc26.dll was not
   found.
   Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
   
   Customer Recreate:
   
   Desired Behavior:
   
   Business Justification (enh):
   
   Steps to Duplicate:  I've done some testing with the Sybase
   install.
   And here is what I
   found:
   
   XP - same results as yours.  I'm missing some .dll files and it
   recommends me to reinstall.  Since the release notes don't
   mention
   Windows XP as a supported platform, I'm guessing it's not going
   to work
   on this.
   
   Win2k3 - same results as yours.  Attempting to install both in
   console
   mode and in InstallShield mode.  In both cases, I see 0 KB
   
   ------------
   
   I am going to check with Development to confirm this, and then
   submit a
   bug for this, as we can reproduce the issue as well.
   
   Environment: Platform/operating system: w2k3/ITIM 4.5.1
   FP28/Sybase ASE
   12.5/Tivoli
   Sybase Agent 4.5.1004
