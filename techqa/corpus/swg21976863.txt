Title: IBM "You are using an outdated browser" message when viewing event details in SiteProtector - United States

Text:
browser; update; event; details; security events TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When viewing the event details in SiteProtector's Analysis view, you might receive a message that says "You are using an outdated browser." 

SYMPTOM
When viewing event detail information in SiteProtector, you see the following message:


You are using an outdated browser. Upgrade your browser to improve your experience.

However, you are running a supported Internet Explorer (IE) version.


CAUSE
This is caused by an incorrect setting in the Windows Registry. The browser emulation is set to an older version of IE, causing SiteProtector to trigger this unsupported information. This registry entry might have been changed by a third-party application to emulate an earlier version of IE for its own rendering purposes.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, follow the instructions below:


Important: This article contains information about modifying and deleting registry keys. Before making any changes, it is best to make a backup of the registry so it can be restored if needed.


 1. Close the SiteProtector Console and confirm that the SPCon.exe process is not present in Windows Task Manager. If it is, end the process so that it is no longer running.
    
 2. Open the Windows Registry by going to Start and searching for regedit.
    
 3. If you are running a 32-bit Operating System, go to:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BEHAVIORS
    For 64-bit Operating Systems, go to:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BEHAVIORS
    
 4. Find the Java.exe key and delete it.
    
 5. Reopen the SiteProtector Console. Then, refresh the registry location that is referenced in Step 3 by pressing F5 and confirm if the Java.exe key was regenerated.
    
 6. If it was regenerated, confirm that the regenerated value matches your installed IE version below.
    Note: These are the default values at the base version. If you are running 10000 or higher (base IE 10), it should be fine. For more information about these values or Quirks support, see Internet Feature Controls [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx] on Microsoft's website.
    Value Description 11000 (0x2AF8) Default IE 11 value 10000 (0x02710) Default IE 10 value 9000 (0x2328) Default IE 9 value 8000 (0x1F40) Default IE 8 value 
 7. If the value was readded and it corresponds to the version of your Internet Explorer, open the event detail in SiteProtector again and check if the warning is still present. If you see that it is still pointing to an older version of IE than you are running, you might need to manually specify the version by using the values that are referenced above.
