Title: IBM TDWC AWSUI0778E authentication failure - United States

Text:
AWSWUI0778E; AWSUI0778E; AWSJCO028E; invalid; credentials; Security TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The AWSUI0778E error occurs when the user specified does not have logon access to the master CPU and is attempting to connect to a Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) engine defined in the Tivoli Dynamic Workload Console (TDWC)/ISC Console. 

SYMPTOM
Login to TDWC / ISC is successful, but login to the TWS engine from TDWC / ISC results in the above error. Also, look in the TWS WebSphere log: 


TWS v8.3 and v8.4:
<TWSHome>/appserver/profiles/twsprofile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log

TWS v8.5 and v8.5.1:
<TWAHome>/eWAS/profiles/twaprofile/logs/twaserver<#>/SystemOut.log

TWS v8.6: 

<InstallHome>/eWAS/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1/SystemOut.log

....for entries such as:

"AWSJCO028E The object cannot be accessed because the user "f842" is not defined in the Security file. f842 staff,staff"


CAUSE
TDWC / ISC to TWS Security requirements


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Adding the master's CPU name to the stanzas for all users that need to login to TWS through the TDWC / ISC interface will resolve this issue. 

Perform the following steps:

1. Use the dumpsec command on the TWS MDM to create a text version of the TWS Security file. 

 dumpsec > twsSec.orig 

 cp twsSec.orig twsSec.new 

 

2. Modify the twsSec.new file so that a user stanza such as this has the master's CPU included. The CPU name can be specified or the wildcard character can be used. 

 USER MAESTRO2
CPU=F842+LOGON=f842
BEGIN
.....

3. Where F842 is a Fault Tolerant Agent (FTA) workstation name and f842 is a valid user on the MDM host and the master's workstation name is MDM83 change the stanza from above to look like this:

USER MAESTRO2
CPU=MDM83,F842+LOGON=f842
BEGIN
...

- or -

USER MAESTRO2
CPU=MDM@,F842+LOGON=f842
BEGIN
...

- or -

USER MAESTRO2
CPU=@+LOGON=f842
BEGIN
...

NOTE: The point is to allow LOGON for the user in question on the Master.

4. Save the changes in the file twsSec.new and load the changes using makesec:

makesec twsSec.new

5. Perform a test connection from TDWC / ISC to the TWS engine specifying the user credentials in question.
