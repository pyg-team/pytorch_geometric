ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR applies only to Breeze users running Chrome version 45
   or higher. It does not apply to users running Breeze in
   Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or any other browser that
   supports Java.
   
   As of 1 September 2015, Chrome version 45 no longer supports
   NPAPI plugins like Java. As such, Breeze will no longer execute
   in a Chrome browser without the additional step of installing a
   Chrome extension, which does provide for Java support.
   Therefore, users accessing Breeze via Chrome are now required to
   install the Chrome extension ?IE Tab? to run Breeze in the
   Chrome browser.
   
   Here are the steps required to install the ?IE Tab? extension in
   the Chrome browser.
   
   Step 1: Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore and do a search
   on ?IE Tab?.
   
   Step 2: Click on the radio button ?Extensions?. The ?IE Tab?
   extension will be displayed at the top of the list.
   
   Step 3: Click on ?+ ADD TO CHROME?. The ?IE Tab? extension will
   be installed. Once installed, the ?IE Tab? icon will appear as
   an icon to the right of the Chrome address bar.
   
   To run Breeze, click on the ?IE Tab? icon to the right of the
   Chrome address bar, and then enter the Breeze server URL in the
   ?IE Tab? address bar, which appears just below the Chrome
   address bar.
   
   Note:
   
   This APAR applies only to Chrome users. If your site does not
   wish to install the aforementioned ?IE Tab? extension or a
   different extension that supports Java, then Breeze will need to
   accessed from an alternative browser that does provide for Java
   support, such as Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari. Review
