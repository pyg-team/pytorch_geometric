QUESTION
 What is the correct procedure to upgrade ITCAM for J2EE components from 6.x to 7.1.1.0? 

CAUSE
Previous versions of ITCAM Agent for J2EE had 2 components:
- ITCAM Agent for J2EE Monitoring Agent (ITM infrastructure, as known as J2EE TEMA Agent)
- ITCAM Agent for J2EE Data Collector (Non-ITM infrastructure)

On the other hand ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 bundles TEMA and DC together.


ANSWER
This is the correct sequence of actions to upgrade ITCAM Agent for J2EE Monitoring Agent 6.x to 7.1.1.0.0: 


1- Install ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 support files in TEMS/TEPS/TEP environment
This step is needed because ITCAM Agent for J2EE does not support automatic seeding (SDA)
ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 support files are also available in a separate support file package

2- Unconfigure the 6.1.x ITCAM Agent for J2EE Data Collector for the monitored Application Server.
You must use the unconfiguration tool in 6.1.x J2EE Data Collector to perform this task.
Restart the application server after DC unconfiguration.

3- Run ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 installer in 6.x TEMA agent environment, and let the installation complete.
The agent configurator will be automatically launched at the end of the installation, but you can also launch it at any later time from MTEMS or from command line.

4- Configure ITCAM Agent for J2EE Agent 7.1.1.0.0 TEMA

5- Configure ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 Data Collector.
Restart the Application Server after DC configuration.
