PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Server Feature Pack    *
   *                 for Web Services security users who have     *
   *                 LTPA token as the caller, with no basic      *
   *                 authentication userid and password           *
   *                 specified in the custom bindings for the     *
   *                 LTPA token generator.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When no userid / password are           *
   *                      specified for the LTPA token            *
   *                      generator in the custom bindings, the   *
   *                      login fails on the client.              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The current code only handles the scenario where userid /
   password are specified for LTPA Token. If no userid is
   specified, it does not attempt to get the LTPA Token. This
   results in the following exception:
   CWWSS6521E: The Login failed because of an exception:
   javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Login Failure: all
   modules ignored
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the caller is LTPA Token, the code has been modified to
   behave as follows:
   
   (a) if userid / password are specified, then it uses the
   userid / password to login and get the LTPA Token
   (b) if userid / password are not specified, it uses the LTPA
   Token from the RunAs Subject
   The fix for this APAR is targetted for the 6.1.0.13 fix pack.
