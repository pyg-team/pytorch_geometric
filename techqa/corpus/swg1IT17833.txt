APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If DataPower is managing connections over SSH and using
   persistent connections in the same respect, if a timeout occurs
   around the reuse it may cause an unexpected reload.  This is
   more likely to happen with a SFTP Poller FSH having a delay
   between polls equal to the persistent connection idle timeout.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable persistent connections in the SSH Client Profile object
   attached to the SFTP Front Side Poller.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the use of the SFTP Poller Front Side Handler and
   the SSH Client Profile.
   
   Prior to the fix in certain timing situations, DataPower might
   restart.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.17, 7.1.0.14, 7.2.0.11, 7.5.0.5,
   7.5.1.4 and 7.5.2.2
