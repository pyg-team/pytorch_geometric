- Administration
- Security
- Server hangs/crashes
- Performance
- HTTP sessions
- Database connectivity issues
- Web services 

CONTENT
Open Mic sessions are conducted in a question and answer format. The table below provides a time index (minutes:seconds) to the recording and describes the questions or topics discussed. You can fast forward to any question using the time index, a table containing the panel of experts is also included.

Open Mic session 
3 June 2009 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 02:30 Technical introduction 04:52 What tools are available to help troubleshoot WebSphere problems and what types of problems can be analyzed with these tools? 08:06 How do I troubleshoot an application server startup issue? 12:21 What best practices should I follow to avoid problems with database connection pooling, and how should I troubleshoot connection pool problems when they do occur? 18:05 How do we debug a node synchronization issue? 23:09 What tools are available to troubleshoot a Outofmemory (OOM) error in our environment? 25:15 I'm interested in application server hangs - what causes it and how to mitigate it? 29:19 With regard to node synchronization, if I understand correctly, node synchronization only synchronize configuration files under the config folder - what happens if my application code is out of sync and needs to be refreshed? How do I initiate synchronization from the Deployment Manager to the node? 34:51 I notice that if I have a database connection error, normally I see a hung thread. Once I fix the database, will the hung thread go away, or do I have to restart the app server to recover from that? 37:36 My application server crashes because of an application using a large amount of memory space (heap size). Is there any way we can reduce that space? 40:50 Is there a command we can run from command line to find out what is the heap memory usage? 42:10 What is the difference between the aged time-out that can be set in a data source connection pool, and the WebSphere Transaction time-out? 45:57 I have a few commands from my WebSphere Application Server that is taking a long time to execute. How do I enable tracing to see what is going on within my application server and where the bottleneck is? 50:47 What is the overhead for creating multiple core groups? 55:05 We installed WAS Binary basically on file system, and we noticed a pretty big degradation when going from SAN to NAS, even when we are just performing a basic wsadmin command. Is that normal? If not, what steps should I take to start collecting data that can lead to the resolution of the problem? 58:15 Does WebSphere Application Server care about what underlying storage system it is on, be it LAN, SAN, local disks? 60:54 Closing remarks 61:28 End of Call
