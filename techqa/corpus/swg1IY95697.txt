ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.0
   Microsoft Windows XP based Mobility Client
   
   Scenario:
   
   On the Connection Manager create a Connection Profile for a
   Mobile Network Connection (MNC) which is configured for No
   Client Validation which means that no userid or password is
   desired for this MNC.  Also set up the Connection Profile to use
   Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
   
   On the Mobility Client configure a
   connection which will:
   
   1)  Start when Windows Starts
   2)  Use Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
   
   When the Mobility Client is started at Windows login time the
   Connection attempt fails as the Connection Manager is unable to
   find the account specified.  If a userid/password is saved prior
   to first autostarting a connection the service will work
   OK.  However, it is the intent of the connection to NOT
   have to specify a user account or password to log in to the
   Connection Manager.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Specify a userid / password and save these prior to using the
   'Start When Windows Starts' feature of the Mobility Client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Mobility Clients configured with "Start      *
   *                 When WIndows Starts" and configured with     *
   *                 authentication which does not require        *
   *                 userid or password.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Windows Mobility Client requires    *
   *                      that the user have a userid and         *
   *                      password saved before selecting Start   *
   *                      When Windows Starts feature, even if    *
   *                      the userid and password are not         *
   *                      required for authentication with the    *
   *                      Connection Manager.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Since the Mobility Client cannot know for sure whether the
   userid and password are required to connect with the
   Connection Manager until the connect attempt, the logic will
   now be based on the 'Prompt for userid and password' setting
   in the connection properties.  If this is checked, the user
   will have to have a userid and password saved before selecting
   'Start When Windows Starts'.  If this is not checked, the user
   will not have to have a userid and password saved.  The
   'Prompt for user and password' corresponds to the
   OneButtonConnect setting in the artour.ini configuration file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix available in WebSphere Everyplace Connection Manager 5.1.1.4
   
   and Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.1
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  This fix changes the behavior of the "Start when windows
   starts" function.
   Previously, you could not select this option without first
   connectiong and
   saving your userid and password. This was an erroneous
   requirement in cases
   where the user's authentication did not require a userid or
   password.  Since the
   authentication method is configured on the Connection Manager,
   the check during
   configuration on the client will be based on the "Prompt for
   userid and password"
   setting in the Connection properties.  If this value is
   checked, the user must
   first have connected and saved their userid and password
   before selecting the
   "Start when windows starts" option.  If not checked, the user
   can select the
   "Start when windows starts" option without a saved userid and
   password.  Note that
   the Connection Manager may send an error back during
   authentication if the userid
   and password is actually required.
   
   The fix is available from IBM support:
