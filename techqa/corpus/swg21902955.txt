71AMCE-GEN; 71GEN-ITM; 71GEN-TEPWV TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Using ITCAM for Tx, after starting AMCE from TEP, when clicking on the 'Help' button, I get error : 

Application Management Configuration Editor Assistance : 
Failed to connect

The connection was refused when attempting to contact <host>:9999. 

CAUSE
Possible cause is that the "Eclipse Help Server" is not running.

ANSWER
As documented here, tcp port "9999" is the ITM default port used by the Eclipse Help Server :

For reference on how to start/stop Eclipse Help server :

This Eclipse Help server (component 'kf') is installed and running on same server as the TEPS component. 

Make sure "Eclipse Help Server" is running, then try again to access : 

 TEP -> AMCE -> Help 

or 

TEP -> Help -> Content and Index (http://<teps>:9999/help/index.jsp)
