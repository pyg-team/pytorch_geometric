PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data Studio Web Console fails to launch within Data Studio because the Flash plugin is not installed. 

SYMPTOM
Data Studio/Eclipse has a built-in web browser that would handle a Web Console request but could fail to open with a message indicating that Adobe Flash is required. Even after installing the Adobe Flash plugin the error can continue. 

For example via the Data Studio Administer Databases perspective: 

 *  In the Administration Explorer drill down to a DB2 database and establish a connection 
 *  Right-click on that database and choose Monitor->Health Summary 
 *  Data Studio Web Console will try to establish a connection and then launch the Health Summary in the browser window. This can fail with a message indicating Adobe Flash is required even though it was already installed.


CAUSE
The Eclipse built-in browser may not be compatible with Internet Explorer v11 and workarounds will need to be implemented to make it work. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A workaround could be to launch an external web browser when Data Studio Web Console opens instead of using the built-in Eclipse browser. 

To accomplish this you can do the following: 

 1. In Data Studio go to Window->Preferences->General->Web Browser. 
    
 2. Click "Use External Browser" and select the browser that you want (the default will be the default browser you configured for Windows).
    
 3. In Data Studio again, go to Window->Preferences->Data Management->Data Studio Web Console.
    
 4. Click "Open the web console in an external browser".
    




If you prefer to use the built-in browser and are using Internet Explorer v11 do the following: 
 1. Go to your Data Studio installation directory (eg, C:\Program Files\IBM\DS4.1.0) and open eclipse.ini file in notepad. 
    
 2. Add the following two lines to the bottom of that file:
    -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=ie
    -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.IEVersion=9999
    
 3. Open the Windows registry editor (via regedit).
    
 4. Go to the following registry key: 
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeaturControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION
    
 5. Change the value for javaw.exe from 8000 to 9999. 
    
 6. Close Data Studio, and reopen it and check to see if Data Studio Web Console is launched in the built-in browser properly without error.
