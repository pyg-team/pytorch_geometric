PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While working as an administrator on the Dashboard portal the transition between tabs becomes extremely slow once the "Common Reporting" tab is closed. Customer should have both DASH and TCR services installed from the JazzSM package. 

CAUSE
This is because of a known defect RTC: 61543

ENVIRONMENT
This issue is platform independent and also happens for any version of JazzSM services.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Not able to create new dash page after opening TCR dispatcher -> run sample report -> close 

Steps :
1. Login to DASH
2. Access TCR and launch out of box sample report and close the report.
3. Now try to create a new DASH Page( used "+" or create page).

Results :
The New Dash page takes long time to load


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Currently there is no resolution for this issue. We have an internal defect 61543 open for this issue, which will be addressed in future release of the product. 

 

As a work around, LOGOUT and LOGIN (again) to DASH portal to resolve the issue.
