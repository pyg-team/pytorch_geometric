APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When doing a cable pull/route delete on the primary of an Impact
   cluster, two problems have been noted in the failover process.
   Both involve the old primary reconnecting as the 'new
   secondary'.
   
   1. The old primary reports "Error converting role to secondary"
   and fails to correctly initialise as a secondary cluster
   member and resync from the new primary.
   2. In cases where the old primary does manage to start as the
   new secondary and resync, the event reader is continuing to run
   on the new secondary.  It should be disabled as part of the
   initialisation process.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It is necessary to restart both servers in order to stabilise
   the cluster.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Failover is not working in cable pull or route add/delete
   scenario. The secondary cluster member does not register itself
   with primary and Event Reader is running on both secondary and
   primary cluster members
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue is fixed in IBM Netcool/Impact 5.1.0.1 Interim Fix
