QUESTION
 How can you improve the performance of an Oracle based IBM Rational RequisitePro (ReqPro) projects? 

CAUSE
You would like to improve the performance when you work with ReqPro projects on an Oracle database.

ANSWER
ANSWER 

The following are some suggestions for enhancing performance of Oracle based ReqPro databases: 

 * Truncate the temporary tables in the RequisitePro schema. Refer to Creating an SQL job that truncates RequisitePro temp tables [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21174400] for information on how to truncate the temporary tables. 
 * Drop and Recreate the Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server views in the RequisitePro schema. Refer to Dropping and recreating user views in the RequisitePro database that contain data [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21166046] for instructions on how to drop and recreate the Oracle or SQL Server views in the ReqPro schema. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21123214] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21166046] 
 * Increase performance by analyzing tables and rebuilding indexes. The technote How to improve Oracle database performance by analyzing the RequisitePro tables and indexes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21131361] contains instructions on how to analyze the tables and rebuild indexes. 
 * Determine which optimization mode the database is running. The technote Different optimization modes set in an Oracle database can affect the performance of RequisitePro [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21152355] provides information on how to determine the optimization mode the database is running. 
 * If the database uses cost-based optimization, analyze the RequisitePro tables and indexes according to the technote How to improve Oracle database performance by analyzing the RequisitePro tables and indexes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21131361].
