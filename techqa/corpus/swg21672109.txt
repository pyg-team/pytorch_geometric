 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I downloaded SPSS Statistics 22 to my laptop with Windows 8 and I could not get it to open, it kept wanting to install. I tried to download the trial software off of your website and had the same challenge. 

CAUSE
The issue here is that after a successful install of IBM SPSS Statistics, a lot of customers don't know how to launch SPSS Statistics 22 in Windows OS, especially Windows 8.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Launch SPSS Statistics 22 from Windows Start menu. 
Start-> All Program->IBM SPSS Statistics->IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

If you do not know where the Start menu is, please refer to the Microsoft web site for guidance:
