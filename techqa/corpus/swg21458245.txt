Title: IBM XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Rule Execution Server is used in a clustered environment with multiple cells, the XU notification of ruleset update managed by Rule Execution Server Console is limited to the scope of XUs in the same cell of the Rule Execution Server Console. 

SYMPTOM
A common scenario is: 

The cluster contains servers from cell A and cell B, each cell contains servers with XUs deployed and one Rule Execution Server console. 

Both Rule Execution Server Console are referencing the same Rule Execution Server database. 

 

When Cell A has a new ruleset deployed, Cell A RES notify the XUs within Cell A, but the XUs in Cell B are not to be notified. 

The servers in Cell B will pick up the new ruleset after a restart. 

This means there is a chance the rule execution in Cell B and Cell A will not use the same version of the ruleset consistently.


CAUSE
The scope of Rule Execution Server console is limited to the cell level: instance in Cell A will not be aware of the XUs in Cell B.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Each Rule Execution Server Console must use a dedicated database. 

A hot deployment process to deploy a new RuleApp to each Rule Execution Server Console needs to be designed. 

Then Rule Execution Server console in each cell will take care of the notification for each XU within the same cell.
