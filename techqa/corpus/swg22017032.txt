 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM WebSphere Cast Iron Solution has addressed the following vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-5664 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5664]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper handling of specific HTTP request methods for static error pages by the Default Servlet error page mechanism. By sending a specially crafted GET request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass HTTP method restrictions and cause the deletion or replacement of the target error page.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126962 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126962] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2017-5647 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the processing of pipelined requests in send file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the wrong response.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2018-1305 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraints that are defined by annotations of Servlets in certain cases. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2018-1304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraint definitions that contain a URL pattern of "" (the empty string) that exactly maps to the context root. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139476 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139476] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-15706 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15706]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the incorrect documentation of the CGI search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The error resulted in the failure of some scripts to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138486 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138486] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2017-15698 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15698]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat Native Connector could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper handling of fields longer than 127 bytes when parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate. The parsing error resulted in the OCSP check being omitted and made it possible for client certificates that should have been rejected to be accepted.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138491 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138491] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-12616 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12616]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when using VirtualDirContext. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints and view the source code of JSPs for resources.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132276 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132276] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-7674 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7674]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the response varies depending on Origin by the CORS Filter. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct client and server side cache poisoning.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/130248] for the current score
