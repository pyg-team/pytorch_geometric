Title: IBM Support of VMWare VI agent for TLS 1.2 - United States

Text:
tls ssl sslv3 vcenter 6.0 supported security TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does the VMWare VI agent support TLS 1.2 in case SSL v3 cannot be used? 

CAUSE
SSLv3 is enabled by default on vCenter server before version 6.0.
In vCenter server version 6.0, SSLv3 is disabled by default.

ANSWER
VMware VI agent 7.2 FP1 does not support TLS 1.2.
To support TLS 1.2, you need to have at least VMware VI agent 7.2 FP2 IF3.
VMware VI agent 7.2 FP2 IF3 is the minimum version to support vCenter 6.0. 

If your vCenter is only using TLS 1.2, and no other protocols, then you need to take a look at this APAR:
