PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to set DB2 JCC driver properties in Oracle Weblogic Applicaton Server 9.x? 

ENVIRONMENT
Oracle Weblogic Application Server 9.x/10 and DB2 V9 database

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Customer is trying to configure a datasource in Weblogic 9.2 to connect to DB2 

LUW 9.5. They had configured a base datasource but now want to add the 
following attributes: 

driverType=4;fullyMaterializeLobData=true;fullyMaterializeInputStreams=t 
rue; progressiveStreaming=2; 

Solution : 

You can use Properties attribute to pass additional values as part of JDBC connection. Please refer to following URL.

Enabling JDBC Driver-Level Features:

WebLogic JDBC data sources support the javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource interface implemented by JDBC drivers. You can enable driver-level features adding the property and its value to the Properties attribute in a JDBC data source. Driver-level properties in the Properties attribute are set on the driver's ConnectionPoolDataSource object.
