APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After successful deployment of an ISD SOAP service,
   accessing the WSDL file shows an error that the WSLD
   file cannot be found.
   The issue in only encountered when using WAS Liberty
   with the following installations:
   IS 11.5.0.0
   IS 11.5.0.1
   IS 11.5.0.2, but only when upgraded from IS 11.5.0.x
   
   System works correctly when using a WAS ND installation,
   or in IS 11.3.x., or after a Suite Installation of
   IS 11.5.0.2
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If using WebSphere Liberty 8.5.5.5 (as installed by IS 11.5.x),
   you have 2 options to fix the issue:
   
   OPTION 1.: Install ISF Patch JR56320:
       this patches the installation of WebSphere Liberty version
       8.5.5.5 under <IS_HOME>/wlp, in IS 11.5.0.0, IS 11.5.0.1,
       and IS 11.5.0.2 (migrated from IS 11.5.x) with the
       installation of the missing WAS Liberty file
       wlp-extended-8.5.5.5.jar
   
   OPTION 2.: Upgrade the WebSphere Liberty to version 8.5.5.8
   or later version.
   
   
   After the patch installation or the upgrade of WAS Liberty,
   you can try accessing your initial WSDL file from the already
   deployed ISD Service (if it was already deployed) or you can
   deploy again the ISD service.
