ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem : data restriction with condition is not working
   correctly.
   
   Env : Maximo BS 7114
   
   Steps to replicate
   1. I created  new security group   ( TG01   )
   2. I created two GL Component ( Cost Center) Values  ( 7777 for
   HR , 8888 for Project )
      Also, create two COAs ( 7777-200-200  , 8888-200-200 )
   3. I created a conditional expression
      Condition: XTG01
      Type : EXPRESSION
      Expression : COMPVALUE <> '7777'
      Alwasys Evaluate : Checked
   4. I set the object restrictions for the group (TG01)
      -Go to security - Open TG01 group
      -Go to Data Restriction / Object Restrictions - New
      -Object : GLCOMPONENTS
       TYPE : QUALIFIED
       Condition : XTG01
   
   5. I created the user ( TU01 ) who belongs to TG01 group .
   
   6.  Log on to Maximo as TU01 user .
       - Go to Purchasing Requisition Application
       - Create a  PR
   
       I tried to select a GL Debit Account  .
       TU01 user cannot see 7777 GL Component Value .
       That means TU01 shouldnot be able to enter 7777 GL component
   and to enter any COA with 7777 Component.
   
       Until now , there is no problem
   
   7.  If entering '7777-200-200' manually into GLAccount field ,
   data is entered .
       The expected result is that user cannot enter that value .
       Because, user cannot use 7777 GL component by
   security-object restriction.
       It should affect to COA validation even if it's not
   security-object restriction for CHARTOFACCOUNTS object.
       It causes data-integrity problem.
   
       Also, client doesn't want to add the attribute restrisction
   for all GL Account fields .

   Qualified data restriction on GLCOMPONENTS object reportedly
   not working
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The restriction is working in 7.1.1.6.  Here's how I tested
   this using maxdemo database.
   
   
   
   
   
   1) Create a condition:
   
   compvalue not like '61%'
   
   2) Create a security group that has all sites, all GL, and
   access to PO app.
   
   3) Create a user who belongs to that security group and whose
   default site is BEDFORD.
   
   4) Log in as the new user, go to PO app, find a WAPPR PO, go to
   POLine tab.
   
   Click New Row, enter item = 560-00, and open the GL Navigator.
   
   Take note of the values displayed.
   
   5) Log out as the new user and log in as Wilson again.
   
   6) For the new security group, create Qualified object
   restriction on GLCOMPONENTS object
   
   using the condition created above.
   
   7) Log out as Wilson and log back in as the new user.
   
   8) Same as step 4.  Note, you no longer see values that start
   with 61.
   
   
   
   
   
   This demonstrates that the data restriction on GLCOMPONENTS is
   working.
