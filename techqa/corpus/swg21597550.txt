Title: IBM Error message when reconciling services following an Oracle upgrade from Version 9.x to 10.x. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Problems might arise from an improper configuration of the JDBC driver at upgrade time for IBM Security Identity Manager.


CAUSE
During an IBM Security Identity Manager installation upgrade, the user must specify the location of the JDBC driver for IBM Security Identity Manager to use in connecting to the database. If the administrator does not identify an Oracle 10.x JDBC driver (ojdbc14.jar), problems can occur when users attempt to reconcile services following an Oracle upgrade from Version 9.x to 10.x. The error produces a message, similar to what is displayed below: 

CTGIMU552E An error occurred while communicating with the server.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Security Identity Manager requires the JDBC driver must be matched with the database server level. The driver must be updated with the Oracle 10.x driver. 


Replace the ojdbc14.jar file in ISIM_HOME/lib with the JAR file provided by the Oracle Version 10.x installation, and then restart the WebSphere Application Server. The JDBC driver level used by the WebSphere Application Server is printed in the SystemOut.log at server startup.

This is an example log record in SystemOut.log for the Oracle 9.x JDBC driver,
which is the wrong driver:
[12/6/07 10:32:02:369 EST] 00000156 DSConfigurati I
DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name : Oracle JDBC driver
[12/6/07 10:32:02:372 EST] 00000156 DSConfigurati I
DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version : 9.2.0.7.0

This is an example log record in SystemOut.log for the Oracle 10.x JDBC driver,
which is the correct driver:
[12/6/07 10:54:41:913 EST] 00000024 InternalOracl I
DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name : Oracle JDBC driver
[12/6/07 10:54:41:918 EST] 00000024 InternalOracl I
DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version : 10.2.0.1.0
