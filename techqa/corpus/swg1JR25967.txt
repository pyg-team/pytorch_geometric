APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In this scenario, a EAR contains an SCA EJB module as well as a
   web module.
   The runtime environment includes a WPS cluster as well as a web
   server which will host the dynamic web modules.
   
   During the installation of the application in the admin
   console, the targets for the deploy are chosen.  The EJB modules
   that contain the SCA application are chosen to be deployed to
   the WPS cluster.  The  web module is chosen to be deployed to
   both the WPS server cluster and the webserver.
   
   An error is found in the System Error log:
      [11/17/06 15:09:12:852 CST] 000003a2 SystemErr     R
   java.lang.Exception: Cannot map J2EE modules to different
   targets. All
   J2EE modules within an SCA application must be deployed to the
   same
   target.

LOCAL FIX
 *  During the application install, deploy the application only to
   the WPS cluster/server.
   After the deploy succeeds, use the Admin console to modify the
   settings for the application to change the deployment targets
   to include the webserver.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Process Server 6.0.1.x and         *
   *                 6.0.2.x users                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Users who has Web module and SCA        *
   *                      module inside the ear file fail         *
   *                      to install on webserver and cluster     *
   *                      simultaneously.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When an ear file consists of Web module and SCA module,
   application fails to install on Web Server and Cluster
   simultaneously. As a work around, Application can be
   installed on one destination at a time and save.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Users who has Web Module and SCA module inside the ear file
   want to install their app on webserver and WPS cluster
   simulataneously need to apply this ifix.
