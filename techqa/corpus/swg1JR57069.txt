APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a DB2 API stage (DSDB2 stage) is migrated to DB2
   Connector stage, the Connector Migration Tool (CMT) does not
   migrate the part of WHERE clause: 'COLUMNNAME=?', that is
   generated by lookup operation with reference link.
   The Connector Migration Tool (CMT) migrates only the custom
   WHERE clause as specified in: "DB2 API stage (DSDB2 stage) ->
   Output -> SQL -> Query -> Generate SELECT clause from column
   list; enter other clauses -> SQL Clauses -> Clauses -> WHERE
   clause".
   The issue has been identified in Server job with Transformer
   stage performing lookup operation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When the SQL statement is migrated to DB2 Connector, the option
   "Generate SQL" is set to "No", so it possible to manually add:
   COLUMNNAME=? or ORCHESTRATE.<COLUMNNAME> to the user query.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users migrating DB2 API stage (DSDB2 stage) to DB2 Connector
   stage on Server job with lookup operation.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a DB2 API stage (DSDB2 stage) is migrated to DB2 Connector
   stage, the Connector Migration Tool (CMT) does not migrate the
   'COLUMNNAME=?' part of WHERE clause, that is generated by
   lookup operation with reference link.
   The Connector Migration Tool (CMT) migrates only the custom
   WHERE clause specified in: "DB2 API stage (DSDB2 stage) ->
   Output -> SQL -> Query -> Generate SELECT clause from column
   list; enter other clauses -> SQL Clauses -> Clauses -> WHERE
   clause".
