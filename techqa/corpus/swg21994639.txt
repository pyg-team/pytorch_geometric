old client; old jdbc driver TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 User could have different versions of db2 clients and db2 JDBC drivers in different application machines. How to find out old db2 client/driver location from db2 server data before doing upgrade? 

ANSWER
"Client database manager product ID" in application snapshot or CLIENT_PRDID in system view SYSIBMADM.SNAPAPPL_INFO or table function MON_GET_CONNECTION etc will show the client version. The format is like PPPVVRRM, where:

PPP identifies the product, which is "SQL" for the DB2Â® products, "JCC" for DB2 JDBC driver
VV identifies a 2-digit version number (with high-order 0 in the case of a 1-digit version)
RR identifies a 2-digit release number (with high-order 0 in the case of a 1-digit release)
M identifies a 1-character modification level (0-9 or A-Z).

The following is a sample output:

Application name = db2jcc_application
Client database manager product ID = JCC03580

The JDBC driver version will be 3.58 and from the following doc, we can see it's shipped from db2 v9.7.

Combining the Application ID, we can identify where the old db2 client/driver locates.
