Open Mic session 
11 November 2009 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. EST 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 04:11 Technical introduction 06:29 Will I be able to stop and start regions from the CICS Explorer? 07:20 What does integrating the tools into the CICS Explorer give me? 10:55 Do I need CICSPlex SM (CPSM) to use the CICS Explorer? 13:00 Will CPSM Workload Management (WLM) become part of the CICS Explorer? 14:15 Will CICS Performance Analyzer include any more information such as statistical data in future? 15:45 CICS Configuration Manager supports packages and migration schemes in its ISPF interface. Will these become part of the CICS Explorer? 17:57 For Rational Developer for System z (RD/z) users, when will IBM “sync up” the stand-alone release of CICS Explorer with the version bundled with RD/z so that we just use RD/z? 22:09 Will I be able to use CICS Interdependency Analyzer data inside RD/z to help see the impact of program source changes? 24:07 When will IBM implement a filter that allows users to ignore any IBM supplied transactions and programs so that we can view just our own? 26:02 With the use of the CICS Performance Analyzer (CICS PA) plug-in, can we use CICS PA to analyze real time data? 26:57 Since we now have the CPSM WUI and CEDA and the CICS Explorer all essentially performing the same functions, will all of these interfaces that allow CSD manipulation continue to be supported in the future? 30:15 What version of the CICS Interdependency Analyzer and CICS Performance Analyzer plug-ins are suitable for version 7.6 of RD/z 34:39 I wondered if you could discuss how you write a plug-in for the CICS Explorer that would interface with CICS? With 3270 we had BMS, are there any kind of similar facilities for writing applications that run in Eclipse with CICS? 42:47 Which version of the CICS Explorer is shipping with RD/z 7.6? Is there any thought about CICS Explorer doing more deep analysis real time like tracing memory chains? 45:20 What was the APAR that was mentioned to allow CICS Explorer to connect to a single CICS region? 46:10 Closing remarks 47:25 End of Call 
Panel of Experts: Colin Stone CICS PA plug-in Developer Joe Winchester CICS Explorer, IA, CM, PA Software Developer John Knutson CICS Tools Marketing Manager Kat Sharp CICS IA and CM plug-ins Developer Matthew Webster CICS Tools UI Strategist: CICS Explorer Will Yates CICS Explorer System Test Specialist
