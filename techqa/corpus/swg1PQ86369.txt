APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At times, Internet Explorer 6 doesn't send the body or Expect
   100-continue in an HTTP 1.1 POST request, but the browser waits
   to receive a 100-continue.  This is a violation of RFC 2616.
   
   In detail:
    1)  The client (browser) does not send the EXPECT 100-continue
   header in the POST.
   
    2) The client does not send the body in a POST request, but
   expects to receive 100-continue. This is a violation of the
    RFC 2616 spec.
   
   
   If Internet Explorer is made to do 1) or 2) at all times, then
   our application will always be able to handle POST requests from
   IE 6.
   
   This behavior causes the session to be in "deadlock" because
   the proxy is waiting on the entire POST request (including body)
   from the client and the client is waiting for the proxy to send
   a responnse (100-continue).
   
   To resolve this problem, the proxy needs an additional directive
   that causes it to forward responses to client when the entire
   post request is not yet received.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Not applicable
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  100-Continue not sent to client to keep connection alive.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To enable the polling of client and server-side connections for
   POST
   requests, please add the following directive in ibmproxy.conf.
