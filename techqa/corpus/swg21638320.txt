Text:
CVE-2005-2969; SSL V3; SSL V2; RC4; MD5; AES; DES; Disable; cipher; weak TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Server admin received following suggestion from security scan: 

SSL Version 2 (v2) Protocol Detection. The remote service encrypts
traffic using a protocol with known.

The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0, which reportedly suffers from several cryptographic flaws and has been deprecated for several years. 
An attacker may be able to exploit these issues to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.

Ports : 25

Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and use
SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, or higher instead.


ENVIRONMENT
Customer has checked configuration in Server document: 

Under Ports > Internet Ports, 'Enable SSLv2' is not checked.
'Protocol version' set as V3.0 only.

SSL Ciphers selected:
AES encryption with 128-bit key and SHA-1 MAC
AES encryption with 256-bit key and SHA-1 MAC
Triple DES encryption with 168-bit key and SHA-1 MAC
'SSL negotiated over TCP/IP port' set as Disabled.

However, weak ciphers like RC4-MD5 are still being used by SSL V3 connection.
