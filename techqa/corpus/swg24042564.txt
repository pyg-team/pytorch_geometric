5.0 Installation instructions
=============================

5.1 Installing the provisional
------------------------------

5.1.1 Media image update

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file:
6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577.tar or 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577.zip
to a temporary directory on the system that contains the media
to be updated. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>
represents the fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows, this includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX/Linux systems or
an unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure
that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.

3. Run the following command to apply the provisional to the installation
media.

On a UNIX/Linux system, if the provisional was expanded to
<TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577, the command for applying
the patch to the installation media would be:

tar xf <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577/IV78577.tar -C <CDIMAGE>

where: <CDIMAGE> is the full path to the original CD image
or expanded media directory.

NOTE: <CDIMAGE> must be a writable directory.


On a Windows system, if the provisional was expanded to
<TEMP>\6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577, the command for applying
the patch to the installation media would be similar to the
following depending on the unzip utility available:

unzip <TEMP>\6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002-IV78577\IV78577.zip -d <CDIMAGE>

where: <CDIMAGE> is the full path to the original CD image
or expanded media directory.

NOTE: <CDIMAGE> must be a writable directory.
