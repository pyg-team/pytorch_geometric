APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Case Manager Builder is configured on the
   following configuration, the logon behavior is incorrect.
   1) Highly Available WebLogic 11G system with one admin server
   and an IBM Content Navigator (ICN) Cluster with two nodes.
   2) The environment is configured with Kerberos Single SignOn
   (SSO)
   
   Expected result: Case Manager Builder UI appears without any
   additional
   prompts to log-on. The log-out button is disabled, preventing
   the user from logging out of the browser session.
   
   Actual result:  If you go to Case Manager Builder before going
   to
   Navigator, you get the Case Manager Builder login page instead
   of the
   browser prompt for credentials - Also, you can also log out of
   Case Manager Builder. This is not the correct behavior for
   single-sign-on.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.0.3-ICM-FP003 or later.  With the fix, using Case
   Manager Builder in an environment configured with SSO against
   WebLogic will work as expected, no additional prompts to login
   and the logout button will be disabled.
