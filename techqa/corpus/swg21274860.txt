Title: IBM How to import objects from one IBM FileNet Image Service's domain to another using CSM_exim - United States

Text:
CSM EXPORT IMPORT TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I copy Image Services (IS) documents from one domain to another? 

CAUSE
Used when moving documents between Image Services systems.

ANSWER
The following shows an example of an import into the Image Services domain "sas1" from the default export file (CSM_EI_DAT.DIR and CSM_EI.DAT.<cache_id>) created during an export from the Image Services domain "cssfax":

CSM_exim -i -c page_cache1:cssfax:FileNet,page_cache1:sas1:FileNet

CSM_exim does not export or import fast batches. 

See the IBM FileNet System Tools Reference Manual [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/cm/filenet/docs/isdoc/412x/Systools.pdf] to see how to export using CSM_exim.
