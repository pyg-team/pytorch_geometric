QUESTION
 How to find the exact date of when a user has replied to a hold notice in Atlas 6.0.0? 

ANSWER
Within the Atlas UI the date a user replied to a notice is not displayed. However, go to the Notice Dashboard, and select 'Reports' > 'Notice Detail', and then select a method to view the report, the 'Confirmed on' column will present the date the user responded. To find this using an SQL query the syntax for the query can be found using the following: 

select
ntcr_ntc_name,
ntcr_recipient_name,
ntcr_sent_date,
ntcr_response_received_on
from
rep_notice_response_vw

where "ntcr_ntc_int_id" is a number like: 576
and "ntcr_recipient_name" is a name like: 'KENNELLY%';

Please note that this SQL query will only work for users which have access to the database.
