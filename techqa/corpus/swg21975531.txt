PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ICMAdminClientPlugin plug-in contains errors messages are displayed in the Case Manager Client intermittently while opening cases 

SYMPTOM
Error message screenshot: 

 * 
 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21975531&amp;aid=1]


CAUSE
These errors can be caused by network or server throughput limitations. The Case Manager Client loads *.jgz compressed files, which can be large in size. The slow loading of these files can cause the ICMAdminClientPlugin plug-in contains errors messages.

ENVIRONMENT
Case Manager 5.2.1 distributed installation (the Content Platform Engine is on separate servers)



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Add the debug=true flag to the IBM Content Navigator URL to open the Case Manager Client desktop. For example:


 * http://<Case Manager server name>:<port number>/navigator/?desktop=icm&debug=true 
 *  
   If the error stops happening with the debug=true flag, then it may be triggered by the cause mentioned in this technote. The reason is that the debug=true flag will have Content Navigator load JavaScript modules separately in individual js files, and not compressed together in the large *.jgz files. 
 * NOTE: this is a diagnostic step only and not the recommended configuration:
   In the IBM Content Navigator admin desktop, configure the plug-in file paths to be local on the Content Navigator server. (Go to Plug-ins -> JAR file path. If Content Navigator is clustered, make sure the JAR file path is identical on all the nodes.) 
 * Test with different browser versions and browser types. Different javascript engines in the various browser may be able to handle javascript loading problems more gracefully. (The ICMAdminClientPlugin plug-in contains errors were often seen in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 10 or older versions.)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Tune the performance of hard disk drives, the Java application server, and the network. 

 

Performance tuning is beyond the scope of this tech note. As the performance bottleneck can be located at many different components of the system architecture, a holistic approach to system tuning may be necessary to fix this symptom. The following tech note has ECM performance tuning guidance.
