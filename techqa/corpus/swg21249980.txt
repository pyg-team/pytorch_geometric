QUESTION
 IBM® Rational® Functional Tester (RFT), when run in Eclipse™ Java™ Scripting mode, creates temporary files on the local file system of Microsoft® Windows®. In some circumstances this is undesirable when directories have limited space. Is it possible to prevent the these files from being created, or have them created in another location? 

CAUSE
These files and directories are created by Eclipse, which starts along with RFT Java Scripting. If you start up RFT and close it down, RFT creates a structure consisting of one file, config.ini, and four directories. These directories are: 

 1. org.eclipse.update 
 2. org.eclipse.ui.ide 
 3. org.eclipse.osgi 
 4. org.eclipse.core.runtime. 


These directories contain 47 other files. Their total size is around 24 MB. 

The location of these files and directories depends on the privileges of the Windows user who runs RFT. For users with administrative rights: 

 * 
 * C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\eclipse\configuration


For users without administrative rights:  * 
 * C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\.eclipse\org.eclipse.platform_3.0.2\configuration
   


ANSWER
It is not possible to prevent Eclipse from creating its temporary files and directories. However it is possible to have them created in a different location: 

 

 1. Open the config.ini file in the following directory:
    
    C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\eclipse\configuration
    
    
 2. In this file, search for the line:
    
    #initial workspace dir
    
    
 3. Directly under this line, replace the following one:
    
    osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/IBM/rationalsdp6.0/workspace
    
    by:
    
    osgi.configuration.area=D:/eclipse-temp
    
    D:/eclipse-temp is the location where you want the temporary data of Eclipse to be saved.
    
    
 4. Save the modified config.ini file. The parameter osgi.configuration.area defines the directory where Eclipse saves temporary files.


Note: Use the forward slashes / as directory delimiters, to specify the location for the temporary files of Eclipse. This is different than the usual back slashes \ .
