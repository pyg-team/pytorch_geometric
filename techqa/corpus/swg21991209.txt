Title: IBM QRadar: Appliance taking long time to boot - United States

Text:
file system check; boot; reboot; boot; boot time TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is a reboot of the QRadar appliance taking longer than expected? 

CAUSE
QRadar v7.2.4 and later incorporates a file system check during reboot as part of regular maintenance. Depending on the file system format and size, this may take several minutes to complete.

ANSWER
There is no way to bypass the file system check during reboot. There is no other option but wait until file system check completes. 


To verify that the file system check is causing this issue. Log in to the appliance using an IMM, iDRAC, or KMM to determine where the system is in the boot process.
