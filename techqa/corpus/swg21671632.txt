QUESTION
 Import a report from a Cognos Disclosure Management archive into existing one in Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.2.1.8 

ANSWER
In Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.2 FP1 IF 8, we have added support for importing a report from a Cognos Disclosure Management archive into an existing one. This feature is available only in XBRL. The import button is available on the XBRL Home tab on the General Ribbon. To use this feature, a user must have the following permissions: 

 * Application Permissions: Manage Projects, Manage Entities, Manage Units and Measures, Manage Time Periods 
 * Report permissions: Import report objects


By using this feature, users are able to: 
 * Import all report objects from the given *.cdm archive into the opened report in a new section. The new section will have the same name as the imported report. 
 * Import all tags from the given *.cdm archive into the opened project. The imported tags will be linked with the aspects that are already defined in the opened project.


Restrictions  * The taxonomy from the imported project must have the same entry point as the taxonomy used in the opened project 
 * The imported project must have only one instant time period defined 
 * The imported project must have only one entity defined 
 * All units from the imported project must be already associated with the opened project 
 * The opened project must have only one instant time period defined 
 * The opened project must have only one entity defined 
 * The imported entity is ignored and all the imported tags will used the entity associated with the open project 
 * The imported time period is ignored and all the imported tags will used the entity associated with the open project 

If at least one of the above restrictions is not met, Import will not take place and the user will receive an error message. 

Procedure
1. In the XBRL Home tab click on Import button from General group.
2. Complete the steps in the wizard.

Known Issues
If the opened project has more than one time period defined import will throw an exception. Clicking the exception icon in the Processes window throws an unhandled exception. The import failed, report objects are imported but not tags. To fix the problem and be able to import from the *.cdm archive you should modify the destination project such that it will have only one instant time period linked to it.
If a previous import failed remember to delete previously imported report objects from the newly created section.
