Text:
access; cannot expand; object store; FNRCE0051E: E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND; the system cannot read the property definition; does not have Full Control access TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Authenticated Users Lost Access to Navigate an Object Store in Both FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) and WorkplaceXT 

SYMPTOM
In WorkplaceXT, when clicking an object store, it prompts: 

The system cannot read the property definitions. 


In FEM, when expanding an object store the following is received: 

 

FNRCE0051E: E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND: The requested item was not found. Object identity: classId=PropertyTemplateInteger32&objectId={52D50BB9-F0A3-4F0A-9B9D-0A71B0772472}&objectStore={01F29133-E28C-4AC1-8135-E5EFD90115A7}


CAUSE
The object with GUID as shown {52D50BB9-F0A3-4F0A-9B9D-0A71B0772472} is the property template Search Schema Version. That template did not have Authenticated-Users in its Security Access Control List (ACL) for the authenticated users. When FEM is being initialized, the property definition will also be scanned, depends on user privileges. In this case, Authenticated-Users is required.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Logon to FEM with a working user, look in the Property Templates folder and locate the Search Schema Version property, Right-click and select Properties and go to the Security tab, note that Authenticated-Users is missing.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add Authenticated-Users to the property template,
