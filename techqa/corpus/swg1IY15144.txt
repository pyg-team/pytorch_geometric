ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When for some reasons the TCP session between
   Webseal and Ldap Server is dropped
   ( this happen for example if LDAP server is restarted
   or  when a firewall is between WebSeal in the DMZ  and the
   Ldap Server in the internal network)
   WebSeal is not able to open a new TCP session until a user
   tries to authenticate himself o WebSeal. As a consequence
   at first login attempt he gets "Authentication mechanism is
   not available ".
   In a real production environment it could happen quite often,
   a fix is needed so that WebSeal can reopen a TCP session
   before a user needs to authenticate himself.
   .
   I was able to reproduce the problem in the Lab by
   using a simple TCP relay program .
   The Relay Machine is placed between WebSeal and LDAP
   server and changed the IP of the LDAP server with the
   IP of the Relay on WS ldap.conf.
   In this way WS communicate to the RM ( listening on
   port 389) and the RM than  communicate with LDAP server.
   From this test is carried out that the message
   "Authentication Mechanism isnot available "is showed
   every time after the TCP session between WS and LDAP server
   is broken (I forced this interruption by turning off
   the relay program and immediately turn it on again).
   The problem is reproducible on PD 3.7 too.
   The same problem occurs when PD is configured against a
   LiveContent Directory Server 8A.3 installed on a Solaris 2.8
   machine; sometimes it appears after a certain period of
   inactivity but it seams to be deterministic when restarting
   the DSA without restart the PD servers also.
   The error occurs when attempting to login into the pdadmin
   Console and when trying to authenticate a user from
   a servlet application (servlet container: WebSphere; Tomcat)
   which uses PDPermission class.
