ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is an update for the WebSphere Business Integration Adapter for WebSphere MQ 2.8.0. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This fix pack includes the following fixes:

JR21894/CR71909
If the list of supported business objects does not contain a business object that is defined in the static meta-object, a NullPointerException is generated during adapter startup. 

JR22461/CR62138
In addition to the previously supported Client mode (the default), the adapter now provides support for Bindings mode. To use the feature incorporated with the enhancement, specify the connector-specific configuration properties ConnectionMode as Bindings (note that it is case insensitive) and LocalQueueManagerName as appropriate. The adapter will use Bindings mode to connect to the local queue manager for processing requests and events. 

JR21381/CR71128
The problem of trimming spaces from the correlationID in the MQMD header has been fixed in the WebSphere MQ adapter. The problem was found when binary characters were a part of the correlation ID. With this update, MQ messages with correlation IDs containing any number of spaces are processed successfully.

JR22404/CR 67384
The adapter will trace a message at trace level 1 when it detects an event in the Input Destination, as per the adapter tracing standards. The adapter has now been fixed not to trace a message for an empty Input Destination.

JR22407/CR 67516
As per functional specifications, WebSphere Business Integration Adapter for JMS needs to support all verbs in the same fashion. It was found that, during request processing, the adapter did not support any verbs other than CRUD, Exists, and RetrieveByContent. This issue is resolved, so that the adapter supports custom verbs.

CR71465
Support for IBM WebSphere MQSeries version 6.0 is now provided.
