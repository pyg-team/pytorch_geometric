ABSTRACT
 This fix updates the IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition for the portal server to address documented security vulnerabilities. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This fix updates the IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which the portal server distributes to clients. 


The vulnerabilities addressed by this fix exist when the affected JRE is installed on systems running the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser client or Java WebStart client. 

The affected JRE is installed on a system when logging into the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Portal using the Browser client or WebStart client and a JRE at the required level does not exist. The portal provides an option to download the provided JRE to the system. 

This fix provides updated JRE packages for the portal server which can be downloaded by new client systems. Once the fix has been installed on the portal server, instructions in the README can be used to update the portal clients.

There are two fixes provided:
