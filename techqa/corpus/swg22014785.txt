======================================

Important:
In the Data Studio V4.1.3, eclipse is upgraded to Eclipse Neon(4.6.3).
Upgrade scenario DS 4.1.2 to 4.1.3 is not supported.
If you previously installed 32-bit products on your computer with a 32-bit version of Installation Manager, you must download the 32-bit version of the IBM Data Studio package because it includes a compatible 32-bit version of Installation Manager. You can then use the 32-bit package to install either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the IBM Data Studio product.
Note: If Data Studio fails to start after you installed Version 4.1.3 on Windows 32-bit, see the troubleshooting instructions at the following link: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22013128 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22013128].

For Microsoft Windows 8, you must have administrator privileges and disable the user account control (UAC).
