APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You run the CCVBMAIN batch utility with a CONNECT statement
   using an authenticated port which requires pass tickets to be
   configured in the ESM and the batch job CCVPRINT dataset has
   messages:
   .
   CCV0000E?   CCVBMAIN message number not found?
   CCV9003I    CCVBMAIN, RC=08
   .
   The CICS CM server MSGUSR dataset contains message:
   .
   DFHXS1201 mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss applid  The password supplied in
           the verification request for userid xxxxxxx was invalid.
           This occurred in transaction CWXN when userid yyyyyyyy
           was signed on at netname ????????.
   .
   where xxxxxxx is the userid associated with the CCVBMAIN batch
   job and yyyyyyyy is the userid associated with the CICS CM
   server address space.
   .
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): ESM external security
   manager passticket connect ipaddress reuse replay
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Users of CA Top Secret ESM can add the SIGNMULTI keyword to
   their NDT as follows:
   .
   TSS ADDTO(NDT) PSTKAPPL(applid) SESSKEY(AAAAAAA) SIGNMULTI
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of CICS Configuration Manager.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CCVBMAIN does not handle passticket     *
   *                      failures correctly.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When CCVBMAIN is used to communicate with a CICS CM server via
   an authenticated port, and the CICS CM server is running with
   non-reusable passtickets, CCVBMAIN fails to handle rejected
   passtickets correctly leading to unpredicatable, but generally
   incorrect processing.
   Similarly affected is the batch journal housekeeping program
   CCVBHKP.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Programs CCVBMAIN and CCVBHKP are modified to recognise that
   passtickets cannot be reused and handle the situation correctly.
   Each interaction with the server via an authenticated port now
   uses a unique passticket.
   Rejected passtickets are correctly interpreted as such and
   processing continues normally.
