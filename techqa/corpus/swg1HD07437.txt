ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario.
   1. Select the "Start + Mechanical Design +
   Drafting".
   2. Select the "ISO" and "A4 ISO" and click the OK
   button.
   3. Select the "New Detail Sheet" function.
   4. Create two Texts in "Detail Sheet".
   (see Scale.CATDrawing)
   5. Create one "New View" in Sheet.1.
   6. Select the "Instantiate 2D Component" function
   and select the "2D Component" in Detail View.
   
   7. Appoint a position in "1:1 scale View".
   8. Create another "New View" in Sheet.1, and
   change a scale to 1:5.
   9. Select the "Instantiate 2D Component" function
   and select the "2D
   Component" in Detail View.
   10. Appoint a position in "1:5 scale View".
   Result:
   The two Texts are overlaped on "1:5 scale View".
   It seems that the size of two Texts are not applied a
   1:5 scale. But, position of two Texts are applied
   a 1:5 scale.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN CATIA DOCUMENTATION DELIV
   ERED WITH CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 12.
   
   Documentation Reference
   Interactive Drafting
   Basic Tasks
   2D Components -> Re-Using a 2D Component -> Modifying text in 2
   D Component instances.
   
   MODIFICATION:
   If you want to use as symbols 2D components with
   text, activate both the Apply Scale property for the
   text (in Edit -> Properties) and the Create with a
   constant size setting (in Tools -> Options ->
   Mechanical Design -> Drafting -> Annotation and
   Dress-up tab): the size of both the 2D component
   and its text will then be independent from the view
   scale
