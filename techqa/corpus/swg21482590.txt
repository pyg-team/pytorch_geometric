Title: IBM SPSS Complex Samples is unable to access a joint probability file - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm trying to run one of the analysis procedures in the SPSS Complex Samples module. I've specified an analysis plan file, but I'm getting a warning stating that:

The procedure cannot access a default joint probability file with specification: pathname\filename.sav. The file specification is either syntactically invalid, specifies an invalid drive or directory, specifies a protected directory, specifies a protected file, or specifies a non-sharable file.
This command is not executed.

What's the problem here? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This warning results when a file containing joint inclusion probabilities is required, which will be the case when sampling without replacement (WOR) and unequal probabilities within strata has been specified in the analysis plan file. If the sample was drawn within the SPSS Complex Samples module, then such a file would have been created. However, if you are analyzing data from a source such as a government survey, most likely such a file will not be provided. Even though the sample was likely drawn without replacement, publicly distributed files are typically set up to be analyzed as single-stage designs specifying with-replacement (WR) sampling. You can recreate your analysis plan file specifying WR sampling and you will no longer need a joint probability file
