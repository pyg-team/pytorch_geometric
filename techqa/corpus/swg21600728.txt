QUESTION
 What Data Collection is required for troubleshooting problems for IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (ECM SM) 

CAUSE
This Technote describes the background information that IBM Software Support needs for analyzing IBM FileNet System Monitor (FSM) issues. Collecting this information (also known as MustGather data) before you call IBM Software Support helps in problem determination and can save time when resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

ANSWER
Collecting General Information 

ECM SM 5.2
New in ECM SM 5.2 are Tasks to collect Debug data and Configuration and then is placed in a ZIP file.

Please run the following Tasks for CALA Debugging.
Product: Standard
1) Task: Configure Debug Settings Select the Server
Check "Activate CALA debugging"
When instructed or need temp files, use “Keep temporary output files”
When instructed or need Detailed Debugging Files, use “Activate detailed CALA debugging”
Run the Task.

2) Run the process, task, etc. so the debug files are created.

3) Task: Configure Debug Settings (to turn off Debugging)
Select the Server
Check "Restart CALAREX" only.
Run the Task.

4) Task: Collect Debug Files Select the Server
Check "Upload zipped Debug files to server"
Run the Task.

5) Task: Cleanup Debug Select the Server
Check "Cleanup CALA Debugging"
Run the Task.

6) Provide the zipped Debug File copied to the path:
$CENIT_ROOT/temp/<Client name or ECM SM server >_debug_files_<date>_<local time>.zip 

Additional Data for Monitors
Monitor configuration from the ECM SM client(s).
a) <ECM SM Install Path>/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged.ctb file 
b) <ECM SM Install Path>/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged folder


Please run the following Tasks for Cala_Rex Debugging.
Product: Standard
1) Task: Configure Debug Settings Select the Server
Check "Activate CALAREX debugging"
When instructed or need temp files, use “Keep temporary output files”
When instructed or need temp files, use “Activate detailed CALA debugging”
Check "Restart CALAREX".
Run the Task.

2) Run the process, task, etc. so the debug files are created.

3) Task: Configure Debug Settings (to turn off Debugging)
Select the Server 
Check "Restart CALAREX" only.
Run the Task.

4) Task: Collect Debug Files Select the Server
Check "Upload zipped Debug files to server"
Run the Task.

5) Task: Cleanup Debug Select the Server
Check "Cleanup CALAREX Debugging"
Run the Task.

6) Provide the zipped Debug File copied to the path:
$CENIT_ROOT/temp/<Client name or ECM SM server>_debug_files_<date>_<local time>.zip 

ECM SM 5.1, FSM 4.5X, and FSM 4.01
To help IBM Software Support find a solution, collect information about the problem and your system environment. When supplying the data below, please package in a compression utility (i.e. WinZip).

ECM SM Server Must Gather
1. OS and version.

2. ECM SM or FSM version, Fix Pack, and Interim Fixes

3. Configuration
a. For FSM 4.5x and 5.1, provide the following:
<FSM install dir>\.prodinfo\FSM_SERVER.settings
<FSM install dir>\.prodinfo\standard.settings.
b. For FSM 4.0.1, go to the web console, click system configuration then details. 
Save a screenshot in a file.

4. ECM SM or FSM Database used and version.

5. On the FSM server, provide all files/folders(PAM) in the following directory.
<FSM install path>/repos/config/
Client Issue/Monitoring for a specific client issue (All Versions)
1. OS and version of client being monitored.

2. What products are on that client machine that are being monitored,
if any (e.g. Image Services, Process Engine, Content Enginge, Application Engine, etc and the version).

3. Supply the .plusdebug files from the machine being monitored.
Make a .plusdebug folder. This creates a debug file for each monitor. 
Place this folder on the system that has the problem monitor.
Wait for monitors to run so the .sh debug files are generated
or restart cala client to force all monitors to run.
UNIX - create /tmp/.plusdebug (Use the mkdir command.)
Windows - create <FSM install>\cala\temp\.plusdebug (Use mkdir command to create the folder.) 
and wait for the monitors to run 
so the *.sh debug files are generated (or restart cala client to force all monitors to run)

4. Supply the .plusdebug files from the machine running the Task(s), %TEMP%\.plusdebug 
(The Windows %TEMP% environment variable is usually <Drive>:\Windows\Temp.
The debug file will get rewritten each time the monitor is run.)

5. Monitor configuration from the ECM SM client(s).
a) <ECM SM Install Path>/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged.ctb file 
b) <ECM SM Install Path>/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged folder

You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis:1. IBM Support Assistant (ISA)2. Electronic Service Request (ESR)3. FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
