ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows, ITM 622 fp5, SAP Agent 7.1
   
   Problem Description:
   When installing application support for SAP Agent 7.1 using
   setup.exe, only the 32 bit version was displayed and installed
   to the agent deport.
   The 64 bit version was not displayed or installed.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Set up an ITM TEPS/TEMS 622FP5 env on Windows 2003 EE 32-bit.
   
   2. Install application support for SAP agent 7.1 to this
   TEMS/TEPS by using setup.exe
      (The image is at
   \\rtpgsa\rtpgsa\projects\i\itm_sap_agent\yyyymmdddhhmm.yyyymmddh
   hmm 201204051401 for example
   
   3. When the installer displays the "select the agent to
   configure for remotely deployment" dialog, it only contain one
   entry for SAP agent, here customer thought it should display two
   entries for SAP agent, one is for 32-bit agent, and the other is
   64-bit agent. Then customer can remote deploy the 64-bit agent
   to remote 64-bit Windows server.
   
   4: Choose the only entry for SAP agent and continue to finish
   the installation.
   
   5: Check the depot, found there were no package for 64-bit SAP
   agent.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use  tacmd addbundles to add 64 bit SAP agent to agent depot
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When installing application support for SAP Agent 7.1 to a
   32-bit monitoring server or portal server, the 64-bit version of
   application support is not presented.
   
   The IBM Tivoli Monitoring installer only installs application
   support for the same architecture as the monitoring server or
   portal server. This problem applies to all agents, not just the
   SAP Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to present all available application
   support regardless of architecture.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Use "tacmd addbundles" to add the 64-bit SAP agent to the agent
   depot.
