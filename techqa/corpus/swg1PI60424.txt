APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ MSTR asid abended.
   CSQV086E <ssid>  QUEUE MANAGER ABNORMAL TERMINATION
   REASON=00C510AB
   ABEND=S026,REASON=08118001,CONNECTOR HANG:
   CONNAME=<conname>,JOBNAME=<ssidMSTR>
   QUEUE MANAGER TERMINATION REQUESTED, REASON=00C510AB
   .
   The S026 abends are occurring when QMGR receives
   a disconnfail event for CSQx's connection to
   structure <structure> as a result of the RESET
   CFSTRUCT(<structure>) ACTION(FAIL) command
   (normally QMGR would have also disconnected and
   would not receive this event, however this does
   not appear to be the case here).
   
   During event processing, the QMGR compares the
   instance number of the structure with that in the
   admin structure, and as they are the same requests
   a shared ENQ on CSQx's connection to the admin
   structure.
   However CSQx holds this ENQ exclusively and will
   continue to do so until it disconnects from the
   admin structure (usually at qmgr shutdown), and
   so QMGR suspends without responding to the event.
   
   XCF detects that QMGR has not responded to the event,
   and after several minutes abends S026-08118001,
   followed several minutes later by S026-08118002
   which causes QMGR MSTR asid to terminate abnormally.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 8 *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The command RESET CFSTRUCT('xx')        *
   *                      ACTION(FAIL) can cause other queue      *
   *                      managers in a QSG to hang.              *
   *                      This can result in error messages       *
   *                      IXL040E, IXL049E, IXL050I and abend     *
   *                      S026 reason 08118001 or 08110102,       *
   *                      followed by the queue manager           *
   *                      terminating with reason 00C510AB.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When command RESET CFSTRUCT('xx') ACTION(FAIL) is executed in a
   member of a QSG that is not connected to structure 'XX' causes
   XCF and XES notification events that are not properly handled by
   the other queue managers in the QSG resulting in queue managers
   hanging without responding to XES events.
   
   When XES events are not responded to, abend S026 is generated
   and the XES connector hang resolution terminates the queue
   manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The XCF and XES notifications properly force disconnects from
   failed application structures as requested by the RESET
   CFSTRUCT('XX') ACTION(FAIL) command without causing connector
   hang and XES abends.
