QUESTION
 
Coredump Troubleshooting Techniques: What details are required? 

CAUSE
Providing core files is not useful when discovering the cause of a core file as the environment of the core is required to troubleshoot coring issues.

ANSWER
 

The most useful tool for troubleshooting coring application is a debugging tool, such as GDB:

Download GDB from the internet and install on the server where the program cored (or a copy of the server).

See below for the links.

Place gdb in your user path (/usr/local/bin)

Then run
gdb fullpath_to_binary_that_cored fullpath_to_core_file
(gdb) bt
(gdb) info threads

For example:
gdb /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/solaris2/nco_pad /tmp/core
(gdb) bt
(gdb) info threads

The results of back trace provides details of where the program exited and possibly why.

Alongside the raw information from GDB the full debug log from the cored process, and the long listing of the core file (to provide the core file creation timestamp).

Linux : Example using 'gdb'
'gdb' is available as an installable package on linux and other UNIX platforms.
e.g.
file /tmp/core
ls -l /tmp/core

gdb /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/solaris2/nco_pad /tmp/core
(gdb) bt
(gdb) info threads

Solaris : Example using 'pstack'
'pstack' and 'pflags' are included with the operating system.
e.g.
cd /tmp
file core
ls -l core

pstack core
pflags core

AIX: Example using 'dbx'
dbx is available as a installable package for AIX.
e.g.
dbx /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/bin/aix5/nco_pad /tmp/core
where
threads
