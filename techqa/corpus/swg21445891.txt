QUESTION
 How do I use the JBoss silent install and config response files? Are any default files provided? 

ANSWER
Here are the sample default files that have been created using the GUI. These are default files and should be customized for your own environment. 

The parameters that you should change in these default files, at the very least, are your own hostname, the MS kernel hostname, the JBoss User name and password, the JBoss start dir, server directory and path. Change any other parms as needed in your environment. 

After you have customized the files to your very own environment, check the file permissions and userid you are using to install and configure. Then use these commands: 

To install, use the command as follows:
./setup_DC_<OS>..bin -silent [-is:log <log_file> ] -options <response_file>
For example,
./setup_DC_lin.bin -silent -is:log /tmp/DClog.txt -options ./itcam_install.rsp

After installing, cd to the 'config_dc' dir by doing:
cd $DC_HOME/installer/config_dc

Then configure as follows:
./config_dc.sh -silent -options <response_file>
For example,
./config_dc.sh -silent -options ./itcam_config.rsp

If you get any errors, look in the /var/ibm/tivoli/common/CYN/logs dir for the log files.
