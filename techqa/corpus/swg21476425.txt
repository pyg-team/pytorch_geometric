Title: IBM My LPAD function doesn't appear to work - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to run an LPAD function in SPSS for Windows. My syntax is as follows:

COMPUTE var=lpad(var,'0').
EXECUTE.

I get no error messages, but the command doesn't appear to function correctly. Why is this the case? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order for the LPAD function to work, we need to use the LTRIM and RTRIM functions first to clear the variable of any spaces. First create a variable called var and make it String. Now the correct syntax for you to use to clear the spaces is:

COMPUTE var=lpad(ltrim(rtrim(var,' ')),4,'0').
EXECUTE.

First, we trim the spaces from the right of the value for VAR. Then, with the value right-justified, we trim off the spaces on the left side. We may then use the LPAD function to pad the value with zeros. (The "4" refers to VAR being a string variable 4 characters in length. You'll want to change that value if your variable is of a different length.)
