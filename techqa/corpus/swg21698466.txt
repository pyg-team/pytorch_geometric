ENVIRONMENT
SQL Server Database



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The reason for SQL Server Error Code 18488 is "The password of the account must be changed." 

Please see the Microsoft Document: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131024.aspx [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131024.aspx] 

Change the password for the account that is used in SQL Server. Then, complete setup with the new password. If the error not seen during setup and during another attempt to connect to the database, log in to the admin page (
https://<server : port>/<application-context>/admin
) to change the connection. From there, go to Server > Database Connection and update 
the password.
