IBM SPSS Text Analytics 

Text Analytics 14.1 supports the same platforms as Modeler 14.1. 



IBM SPSS Statistics Integration with Modeler 

To use the SPSS Statistics integration features in Modeler 14.1 (that is the Statistics Transform, Statistics Model and Statistics Output nodes), a Statistics 18.0.2 with hotfix or above installation is required.





IBM SPSS Data Collection 

To use the Data Collection source node IBM SPSS Data Collection Data Model needs to be installed. It is important to note a 64-bit Modeler installation (client or server) will not recognize a 32-bit Data Model installation. Only 32-bit versions of Modeler should be installed in environments where Data Collection data is required.
