Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
There is no Netezza emulator software available for download under Fix Central. 


CAUSE
This is not an IBM Software sold and supported product.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The Netezza emulator software (formally known as Netezza Simulator) is an As-Is download from the Netezza Developer Network (NDN) page:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=266888e9-4b4b-44cd-bd51-e32d05da9143 [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=266888e9-4b4b-44cd-bd51-e32d05da9143]

In the bookmarks section, you will see:
IBM Netezza Software Emulator - for Developers (Windows or Mac OS versions):
https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-im-ibmndn [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-im-ibmndn]

Once logged in there I can see multiple products for download including
"IBM Netezza Software Emulator for Developers v7.1 for Windows with RedHat Linux v6.4 Version 7.1"
and others for different versions on Netezza (7.0.4, 7.0.3 etc back to 6.0.8) for increasingly older versions of Linux and Windows and Mac.

There is also this link that explains what the Netezza Emulator is, and how to get access to the private NDN where you can download it:
