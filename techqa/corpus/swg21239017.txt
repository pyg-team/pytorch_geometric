PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an unsatisfied link error. This can occur when starting IBM® Rational® ClearQuest® Web server processes. 

SYMPTOM
Attempting to login to the ClearQuest Web produces a blank page. On the server, you can check the stderr file in the directory: 

<install directory>/rational/clearquest/cqweb/cqserver/logs and found requestmgr-7.

Full text of the log is as follows:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't find library cqjniproxy (libcqjniproxy.so) in sun.boot.library.path or java.library.path
sun.boot.library.path=/opt/rational/common/IBMJava2-142/jre/bin

CAUSE
 

Cause on Linux or UNIX platform server
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not set.

Cause on Windows platform server
PATH environment variable values referencing ClearQuest paths are invalid. This can happen after an upgrade of ClearQuest, or if you have installed Oracle software.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Resolving the problem on Linux or UNIX platforms 

To run Rational ClearQuest Server and the Rational ClearQuest Web Application components, you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH parameter as documented in the ClearQuest Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.install_upgrade.doc/install/t_os_prereq_linux.htm]. 


After the server restarts you should be able to access the ClearQuest Web server and be prompted with a login screen as expected. 

 

Resolving the problem on Windows platforms 

Check the system PATH environment variable. 

Follow these steps: 

 1. Go to Control Panel > System, and click the Advanced tab. 
 2. Click the Environment Variable button. 
 3. Under System Variables select PATH. 
 4. Verify that all Rational paths are correct, separated by a semicolon (;), and are located at the beginning of the variable.


Note: The server may need to be rebooted for System variable changes to take effect.
