QUESTION
 How can I write a query to retrieve all the rules that are referenced in a Rule Flow? 

CAUSE
Users will have to develop their own query extensions to accomplish this task. This document aims to ease this process by providing a sample.

ANSWER
You can achieve this by creating a Query Extension (an eclipse plug-in). By creating an extender class and verbalizing its method, you can expose this functionality to be used in the query editor. The process of integrating the plug-in is described in the following section of the documentation: 

WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Customizing > Customizing Rule Studio > Customizing business rule management > Customizing queries > Extending Queries

WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Customizing > Customizing Rule Studio > Customizing business rule management > Customizing queries > Integrating Query Extensions into Rule Studio

The attached sample can be tested in two ways:


 1. Deploying the project as an eclipse plug-in 
 2. Running the project as an Eclipse application


Steps to test this sample: 
 1. Extract the archive"Querying-rules-from-ruleflow-Plugin" and import "MyQueryExtension" project into the Rule Studio 
 2. Change the perspective to "Plug-in Development" in Eclipse 
 3. Run the plug-in project as an "Eclipse Application" with JVM arguments: -Xmx1024m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=128m 
 4. In the new instance that is launched, import the "multipleprojects" sample from ILOG samples wizard 
 5. Open the rule project "loanvalidation-eligibility" and create a query of this sort: Find all business rules such that each business rule is referenced by ruleflow "eligibility.evaluation" 
 6. Inspect the rule flow "eligibility.evaluation" 
 7. Run the query 
 8. Notice that the results displayed are the rule artifacts that are connected to the rule flow
