PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are getting a java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException when attempting to package IBM Rational Data Architect (RDA) 7.5 or IBM Rational Business Developer (RBD) 7.5 products with Packaging Utility (PU) 1.2. 

CAUSE
The version 7.5 product disk image does not contain certain artifacts related to the product resulting in the error being thrown. (This does not affect product installs, only packaging.)


For Rational Data Architect, this defect is being tracked by APAR PK73823. For Rational Business Developer, this defect is being tracked by APAR PK74489.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

WORKAROUND: 

 1. Create a "My IBM" account at: https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg [https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg]
    
    This username/password will be used to open the trial site repository in Packaging Utility.
    
    
 2. Launch Packaging Utility
    
    
 3. On the "Copy Packages" interface, along with the disk image repository, select "Open Repository..." and put in the location to Rational online repositories, such as:
    
    /software/rational/repositorymanager/repositories/rationalsdp7/repository.config
    
    A username and password dialog will come up. Use the "My IBM" account credentials created in Step 1. The trial site repository will be added to your source repositories. It may take a few minutes for PU to read the repository.
    
    
 4. When you add the repository trial site repository you will see in Packaging Utility, there is an expandable checkbox next to the repository.
    
    Expand this, and you will find numerous repositories listed, please select only the repository for the product you are attempting to package.
    
    The screenshot below displays what should be selected if you are attempting to package Rational Business Developer 7.5:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21322440&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21322440&aid=1]
    
    
 5. You can now copy the package from your disk image as usual. PU will retrieve the remote repository artifacts from the trial site when it cannot find them on the local disk image, and the copy will be successful.


Note: Ensure that the trial site is active when you are attempting this. If the trial site is down, the packaging will not complete.
