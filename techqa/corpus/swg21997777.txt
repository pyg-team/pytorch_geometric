Title: IBM Cannot add a delegate with the error message "Error creating AdminP request, please contact your administrator." - United States

Text:
"Error creating AdminP request; please contact your administrator"; admip request; delegation error TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You are getting the following error message when trying to add a
delegate to the Access & Delegation list.

"Error creating AdminP request", please contact your administrator." 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21997777&amp;aid=1]



CAUSE
The Access Control List (ACL) entries of the admin4.nsf is incorrect and leaving only Default in the list or the Default is set to "No Access".



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, copy the ACL entries of another database, such as the events4.nsf, to the admin4.nsf and make sure that the Default access is set to Author. 

In one case, the admin4.nsf is unusually large in size and you need to run compact against the database to resolve the issue.
