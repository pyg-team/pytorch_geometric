LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users upgrading an MQAppliance firmware.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The problem is caused when there a large number of files in the
   local file system.
   The upgrade process performs a copy operation of the files and
   the duration of of the copy operation contributes to the timeout
   of the upgrade.
   Users then see the error message.
   
   The installation may succeed despite the error being reported,
   and a successful installation can be confirmed by ensuring that
   the "show version" or "dspmqver" commands report the expected
   level information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue is caused by a limitation of the lower-level
   components used to apply firmware images on the MQ Appliance,
   and is being reviewed by the component owner.
