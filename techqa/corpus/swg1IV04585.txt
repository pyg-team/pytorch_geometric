APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Agent fails to discard events for stopped situation.
   
   Situation events remain stored in persistent files on the
   agent, if situation is stopped while agent is running in
   autonomous mode.
   
   Symptoms: Persistent files <hostname><pc>_autoattr.asa
   are present in the agent CTIRA_SIT_PATH after it reconnects
   to TEMS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete <hostname><pc>_autoattr.asa file and recycle ITM agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Agent fails to discard events for a stopped situation.
   
   
   Agent fails to discard events collected in autonomous mode for a
   stopped or modified situation. Situation events remain stored in
   persistent files on the agent if a situation is stopped while an
   agent is running in autonomous mode. Symptom: Presence of
   persistent files <hostname><pc>_autoattr.asa in the agent
   directory when agent is connected to the monitoring server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Agent framework now discards events for stopped or modified
   situations.
