APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An application using the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS is
   connected to a WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 queue manager using the
   CLIENT transport.
   
   When the runmqsc command:
   
   DISPLAY CHSTATUS(channel name)
   
   is run on the queue manager for the channel that the
   application has used to connect to the queue manager, the
   following output is displayed:
   
   RVERSION(00000000)
   RPRODUCT(MQJM)

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects two categories of user:
   
   1. Users of the WebSphere MQ command runmqsc who run:
   
   DISPLAY CHSTATUS(channel name)
   
   to display the status of a channel.
   
   2. Users of the WebSphere MQ Explorer who display the status of
   a Channel by highlighting a Channel in the Channels pane, right
   clicking and selecting Status->Channel Status... from the pop-
   up menu.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Applications that connect to WebSphere MQ using the CLIENT
   transport provide version information to the queue manager
   about the level of WebSphere MQ Client code that the
   application is running. This version information is in the
   format:
   
   VVRRMMFF
   
   where:
   
   - VV = Version
   - RR = Release
   - MM = Maintenance level
   - FF = Fix level
   
   The runmqsc command:
   
   DISPLAY CHSTATUS(channel name)
   
   will report this version information in the RVERSION attribute.
   
   The WebSphere MQ Explorer shows the version information in the:
   
   Remote Version
   
   column in the Channel Status window.
   
   
   In order to determine the version information to pass to a
   queue manager, the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for Java and
   classes for JMS, and the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter,
   looked inside the MANIFEST.MF file contained within the file:
   
   com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
   
   for the property:
   
   version
   
   However, the MANIFEST.MF file did not contain an entry for this
   property. This caused the WebSphere MQ classes for Java and
   classes for JMS, and the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter,to
   specify:
   
   00000000
   
   as the version number being used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for Java and classes for JMS,
   and the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter, have been updated
   to use the information in the property:
   
   com.ibm.mq.jmqi
   
   within the MANIFEST.MF file contained within the JAR file:
   
   com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
   
   to determine what version information to pass to the queue
   manager.
   
   Applications using the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter or Java
   and JMS clients which have this APAR applied will report
   their version information correctly to the queue manager,
   which will be reflected in the information returned by
   runmqsc and the MQ Explorer.
