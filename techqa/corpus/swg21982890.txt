[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982890&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982890&aid=1] 


CAUSE
Process Engine client was not applied to WorkplaceXT. 


ENVIRONMENT
Linux, Content Platform Engine



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. Access http://<xt-server name>:<xt-port #>/WorkplaceXT/vwsoaprouter [http://xtservername:port/WorkplaceXT/vwsoaprouter] site and search for the word buildLine as shown in the example. Note that you must replace xt-server name and xt-port to reflect yours. 

 * PUI Version Info: filenet.vw.toolkit.utils.VWBuildStamp 
   jarVersion=5.2.1 
   buildLine=dap521.003.172 
   buildDateMask=MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss 
   buildDate=11/20/2015 23:21:48 


2. Compare that buildLine information in step 1. to the build information returned from the CPE ping page (i.e http://<cpe-server name>:<cpe-port #>/FileNet/Engine) 

3. If the build information in step 1 does not match with what is returned from the CPE ping page, you must install CPE client on WorkplaceXT to match the CPE server version and patch level, and redeploy WorkplaceXT.
