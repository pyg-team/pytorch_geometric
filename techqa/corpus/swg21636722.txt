QUESTION
 What is the best practice when using an IBM Rational ClearQuest Bridge with IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) in a ClearQuest MultiSite environment? 

ANSWER
There are two approaches to using a ClearQuest Bridge with RTC in a MultiSite environment. 

The configuration is still a manual process using one of the approaches in the description.
The biggest limitation with either of these approaches is that you can only link to a 
record that is locally mastered.


Approach 1

Integrations point to a single ClearQuest site, but the each ClearQuest site must 'friend' the 3rd party server. 


 1. Set up RTC as a friend to one 'primary' ClearQuest site.
    
    
 2. Set up one project area link from RTC to the primary ClearQuest site.
    
    
 3. Set up RTC as an external friend on all ClearQuest sites (so that rich hover and backlink deletion works everywhere).
    
    
 4. (Optional) Make sure the mastership of records does note change if they have links to avoid problems with backlink deletion.


Drawbacks: You can not create links to ClearQuest records not mastered at the primary site. 


Approach 2 

Integrations point to multiple ClearQuest sites. 
 1. Set up friends between RTC and all ClearQuest sites.
    
    
 2. Set up project area links between the RTC project area and ClearQuest user databases on all sites.
    
    
 3. (Optional) Make sure the mastership of records does not change if they have links to avoid problems with backlink deletion.



Drawbacks: There will be menu items in RTC for every ClearQuest side, and you have to know where the record is mastered before you bring up the selection dialog.
