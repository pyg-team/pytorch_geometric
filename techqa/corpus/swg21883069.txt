QUESTION
 What is the procedure to apply Websphere Application Server iFixes to a Tivoli Integrated Portal installation on a Unix platform? 

ANSWER
Warning: The following procedure applies only to Websphere Application Server "iFixes". Do not apply Websphere Application Server "fix packs" directly to a TIP installation. WAS fix packs must be bundled in a Tivoli Integrated Portal fix pack to ensure all TIP and administrative console functionality is still intact and to keep TIP in a supported configuration. 

To apply a Websphere Application Server (WAS) iFix, do the following: 

 1. Copy the .pak files to the <TIP HOME>/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/maintenance directory 
 2. Update the <TIP HOME>/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/responsefiles/install.txt as follows:
    
    Uncomment the following line:
    
    #-W maintenance.package=
    
    Add the literal path to the maintenance folder from step 1. For example:
    
    -W maintenance.package=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/maintenance
    
    Set the value for the "-W product.location=" option to the literal path for <TIP HOME>. For example:
    
    -W product.location=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2
    
    Save the file.
    
 3. Stop TIP
    
 4. As the user you used to install TIP, run the WAS Update Installer to apply the iFixes:
    
    <TIP HOME>/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -silent -options responsefiles/install.txt
    
    Once the installer completes, check the logs under <TIP HOME>/logs/update to ensure all of the fixes were applied.
    
 5. Start TIP
