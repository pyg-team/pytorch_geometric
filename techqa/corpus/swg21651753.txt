ABSTRACT
 CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) Feature Pack for Security Token Extensions V1.0 general availability (GA) date was 11 October 2013. The new feature pack further enhances operational efficiency by adding support for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) security tokens. This document contains a summary from the announcement letter, a link to the announcement letter, and additional ways that you can become familiar with this enhancement. 

CONTENT
CICS TS Feature Pack for Security Token Extensions V1.0 provides the capability for application security controls using SAML security tokens. SAML is an XML based framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. It is an Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standard for making security assertions regarding identity, attributes, and entitlements between entities, such as a partner company or another enterprise application. The SAML implementation within CICS TS is Javaâ„¢ based, further increasing operational efficiency by enabling the SAML security token processing to be offloaded to specialty engines. Additionally, utilizing a standards based approach to security can reduce or remove the need to create, maintain, and manage custom security infrastructure.


CICS TS Feature Pack for Security Token Extensions V1.0 delivers the following benefits: 

 * Reduces complexity and management overhead of multi-system security architectures. 
 * Secures token service integrated with CICS, which reduces the number of component parts. 
 * Removes the need to develop complex security code to support SAML-aware programs. 
 * No loss of end-user identity facilitates audit. 
 * Single source of security data removes the need to synchronize and reconcile.
   


CICS TS Feature Pack for Security Token Extensions V1.0 adds SAML security tokens support to CICS TS V4.2 and CICS TS V5.1, and includes:  * A linkable interface for SAML-aware applications 
 * Support for SAML tokens in inbound web services
