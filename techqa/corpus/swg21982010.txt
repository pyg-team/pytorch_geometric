 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does Cognos Analytics Continue to utilize Quirks Mode, requring users to run Internet Explorer in compatibility mode? 

ANSWER
Many IBM® Cognos® Analytics user interfaces now use standards mode HTML, including the Cognos Analytics portal, Cognos Analytics – Reporting, and HTML viewers and reports. Because reports have moved from quirks to standard HTML, there might be small differences in the look of your reports. These differences do not have an impact on the majority of reports that were created in previous Cognos versions. However, minor changes might be required in a small number of existing reports. 
Some older user interfaces continue to use quirks mode HTML, including Query Studio, Analysis Studio, PowerPlay® Studio, and Event Studio.
