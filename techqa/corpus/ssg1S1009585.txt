Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM SONAS (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL is used by IBM SONAS. IBM SONAS has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
OpenSSL is used in IBM SONAS for providing communication security by encrypting data being transmitted.
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
