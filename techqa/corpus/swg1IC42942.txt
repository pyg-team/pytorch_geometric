   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply fixing level when available.           *
   *                 This problem is currently projected to be    *
   *                 fixed in levels 5.2.5, and 5.3.1. Note       *
   *                 that this is subject to change at the        *
   *                 discretion of IBM.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   The server crashes when it fails to open dsmameng.txt due to
   the system limit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The server code has been modified to handle this situation
   properly. The server will issue messages to explain the
   problem and also provide steps to resolve it.
   The following messages will be displayed:
   "ANR9999D psmsgnls.c(1352) Error 24 There are too many files
    open.  The server cannot open language file dsmameng.txt
   
   ANR8224W The Tivoli Storage Manager server has reached the
   system limit for open files. Use the System Administrator
   Manager program (SAM) to change the value of the maxfiles
   parameter. Increasing this value will increase the maximum
   number of files a process is allowed to open."
   
   HP customers should increase the default value of the
   maxfiles parameter. The HP Installation Guide will be updated
   with the following text:
   "The maxfiles parameter specifies the number of files a
   process is allowed to open at any given time. The default
   value for HP is 60.  However, this value is very low
   and can cause server problems.  To ensure proper server
   operation, increase the maxfiles value to at least 512."
