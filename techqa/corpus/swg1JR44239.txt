ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In BPM 8.0.0, tracking data is not sent to Performance Data
   Warehouse. You will see that tracking data is building up in the
   LSW_PERF_DATA_TRANSFER table of the related Process Server
   database. If you view the Performance admin console it does not
   show any error that send tracking definitions is in progress.
   There will not be any noticeable signs that errors are causing
   the problem.
   
   The issue is due to the startup beans service, which is
   required by Performance Data Warehouse data transfer, being
   disabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enable the "startup beans service" for your PDW server.
   This must be enabled for polling to occur.
   Restart the server after this change is made.

   In Version 8.0.0, the startup beans service is not enabled, by
   default, in some installation scenarios for the application
   servers in which the Performance Data Warehouse application is
   running.
   In Version 8.0.1, this issue has been addressed (the startup
   beans service should be enabled by default in all installation
   scenarios).
   Version 8.0.0 users affected by this problcan enable the
   startup beans service as documented in this technote:
