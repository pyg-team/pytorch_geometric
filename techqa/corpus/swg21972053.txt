 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Infosphere Information Governance Catalog (IGC) has been configured to generate events to start workflows in Business Process Management (BPM) using the InfoSphere Subscription Manager . However, no workflows are being generated in BPM. When the event is generated on IGC the following error is shown in WebSphere logs:

Failed to login to execute task for schedule [d70c6594.80cb2b5c.ha7komua6.pi0alkj.bb7pqa.cll0jlkj1sl4cqj3uda8a], execution ID is [dvlna081Node01/devdgp01-d70c6594.80cb2b5c.ha7komua6.pi0alkj.bb7pqa.cll0jlkj1sl4cqj3uda8a-a347c908-0e61-4fb5-8548-bbb3417c678d], execution date is [03/27/15 11:12:01:315 AM], scheduled execution date is [03/27/15 11:12:01:315 AM], service name is [EventCallbackTaskExecutionService]: java.rmi.RemoteException: java.lang.RuntimeException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: PKIXCertPathBuilderImpl could not build a valid CertPath.; internal cause is:

ENVIRONMENT
InfoSphere Information Server in a WebSphere cluster configuration

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem is caused by issue documented on technoteTechnote 1967014: Information Server background tasks in WebSphere cluster installations use the wrong security domain [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967014]. Follow the instructions from that document to resolve this problem.
