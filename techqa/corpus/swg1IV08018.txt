ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNM 3.9.
   
   Tree status in TIP not updated with first parameter for time
   update.   Remains a question mark too long.
   
   Recreation
   
   Set status.properties to these settings.
   # Update period for trees in seconds
   status.tree.updateperiod=30
   status.tree.fastupdateperiod = 10
   status.tree.fastupdatecount = 1
   
   Does the tree status remain a question mark for 10 or 30
   seconds?
   
   The ITNM code provides separate properties for the initial
   display of
   the status (fastUpdatePeriod and fastUpdateCount). This
   functionality
   works perfectly OK within the ITNM product, however when we
   build the
   Dojo TIPTreeTable we have the option to pass only one
   (pollInterval)
   property. Therefore we pass the 'updatePeriod' property.
   
   The TIPTreeTable does an immediate poll and then a sets a timer
   to poll
   on every 'updatePeriod'. Unfortunately when the initial poll of
   the
   TIPTreeTable happens, the Transient Webtop Entities are still
   not
   registered within ITNM, hence the (?) icon stays until the next
   poll
   happens.
