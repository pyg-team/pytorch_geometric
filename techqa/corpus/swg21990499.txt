Title: IBM EIF probe not sending event when ObjectServer is available again - United States

Text:
saf cached flush eif probe probewatchheartbeatinterval TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SAF events cached by EIF probe when ObjectSserver was down are not flushed to the ObjectServer when it becomes available again. 

SYMPTOM
Delayed events.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Enabled the ProbeWatchHeartbeatInterval property, which would generate a ProbeWatch Heartbeat event at the specified interval in seconds.
By doing that, any cached events will be flushed to the ObjectServer along with the ProbeWatch Heartbeat event.
