PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After configuring IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) server with Microsoft SQL server 2008 database, RQM is unable to connect to the database. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is shown in the "Database Status" section of the RQM admin page: 

The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "SQL Server did not return a response. The connection has been closed."'

CAUSE
One possible cause for this error is that the IBM WebSphere Application Server being used is FIPS-enable (Federal Information Processing Standard). This is a Microsoft JDBC driver defect.
