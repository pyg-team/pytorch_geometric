Title: IBM Why is the IBM Rational DOORS Module view not updated with newly entered objects? - United States

Text:
Module View; View Refresh; Module Refresh TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The module view is not updated with newly entered objects from other sessions when "View > Refresh" is selected from the module menu. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Module data is loaded only when a module is opened. 

Using the View > Refresh function does not reload the module data; it just refreshes the view. 

 

Users need to save their changes before they can be retrieved 

After successfully saving changes will be visible the next time a module is opened.
