ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Reporting menu is too wide for the browser window, the
   menu bar will shift left, causing the mouse to leave the
   Reporting menu and instead hover over the adjacent menu
   (Organization menu), which then causes the menu to shift back
   to Reporting, and the cycle repeats.

   Reporting > SOX
   3. Click the Add Folder button, wait for the Java Applet to
   appear and enter a Name for the new folder
   4.    Repeat Step(3)  2 more times  (creating total of 3 new
   Report Folders)
   
   5. Login to the OpenPages Application,
   http://servername:7009/openpages , as OpenPagesAdministrator
   user
   6. Click on the Reporting Menu on top navigation bar and
   confirm that you see the new report folders there
   
   7. Click on ALL Reports, then click on the Add button on the
   right.
   
    8. Select the dropdown arrow on the report field and select
   any report there

   1. Login to the OpenPages Application,
   http://servername:7009/openpages , as OpenPagesAdministrator
   user
   2. Hover the mouse over the Reporting Menu on top menu bar and
   notice that the menu will jump back and forth between the
   Organization menu and the Reporting Menu shown below.
   3. Confirm that the horizontal scroll bar exists on bottom of
   page when reporting menu is displayed. .  If it does not,
   reduce the width of the browser window until it does.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Reduce the report columns and/or shorten the report names under
   the All Reports column in the Reporting menu so that horizontal
   scroll bar does not appear.
