APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Stored proc SYSPROC.ADMIN_INFO_SYSPARM returns all ZPARM, HDECP
   and IRLM parameters. It returns 'ONLINE=N' as ADDITIONAL_INFO
   for the last IRLM parameter 'SYSTEM LOCK TABLE LIST ENTRIES'
   sometimes and sometimes has no data returned.
   The resultant output is inconsistent.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the DB2-supplied stored         *
   *                 procedure SYSPROC.ADMIN_INFO_SYSPARM,        *
   *                 DB2 10 for z/OS and DB2 11 for z/OS,         *
   *                 are affected by this change.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The ADDITIONAL_INFO column of the       *
   *                      last result set row returned by         *
   *                      ADMIN_INFO_SYSPARM is blank. The        *
   *                      keyword ONLINE= is missing from         *
   *                      this column.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY PTF                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   The ADDITIONAL_INFO column of the last result set row is
   blank due to storage overlay. Currently, the procedure result
   set columns are not properly initialized which can result in
   storage overlay.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To address this problem, this APAR modifies ADMIN_INFO_SYSPARM
   to properly initialize storage for the procedure result set
   columns.
