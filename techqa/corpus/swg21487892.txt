Title: IBM Silent install for Mac - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The Site License Administrators Guide says the command line installer can be found on the disc at /MacOS/Administration/SPSS Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin. I do have an Administration folder which has the also needed installer.properties but no 'SPSS Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin'. 

Was the silent installer just excluded for some reason? Is there another way to run a silent install? 

ANSWER
Due to space limitations, this file was left off of the installation media. 

It is now available as the IBM SPSS Statistics Client 19 Mac Silent Installer English (CI396EN) file via the IBM Downloads [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/] site. You will need to be authorized to download software by the primary contact for your account. Please open a Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/] if you need assistance in downloading this file.
