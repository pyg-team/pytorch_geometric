To remediate IBM WebSphere Application Server, please consult the security bulletin Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Java SDK affect WebSphere Application Server January 2016 CPU (CVE-2016-0475, CVE-2016-0466, CVE-2015-7575, CVE-2016-0448) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21975424] for vulnerability details and information about fixes. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

 * Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 
 * Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA


Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
