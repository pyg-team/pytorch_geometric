RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Dropping the NC* tables that use this script: 

Steps:
1. Stop the Cognos Service
2. Take a physical backup of the Content Store or Notification database
3. Select the appropriate folder for your content store or notification database type under <install>/configuration/schemas/delivery/<dbtype>/ 
4. Run NC_DROP_<dbtype>.sql against the content store or notification database 
4. Restart Cognos Services. 

Should dropping the NC* tables not resolve the issue, then restore the content or notification store from the last backup version.
