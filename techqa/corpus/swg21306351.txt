Title: IBM WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files does not poll for inbound events - United States

Text:
ntfs folders permission readonly flatfiles adapter j2ca websphere TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When WebSphere® Adapter for Flat Files polls for events on an NTFS partition with folders (either event or archive) that do not have read permission, the adapter cannot identify that the folders do not have read permission and terminates at the verification stage.

This problem is due to a defect in the JDK and has been verified on:
Java™ version 1.4.2
Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2)
Classic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM Windows 32 build cn1420-20040626 (JIT enabled: jitc))


SYMPTOM
 

* Disable read permission for a folder in a NTFS partition(Folder name -> right click -> Properties. Goto Security tab. Click on the Deny check box for "Read")
* Use it as the event folder for polling or use it as the archive folder.
* The adapter fails since the JDK returns true when asked if the folder is readable.



CAUSE
Known defect in JDK version 1.4.2.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not use the adapter on NTFS partitions where folders are configured without read permission.
