APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WinCollect sends syslog payloads terminated with ASCII
   character 13 (0x0D - \cr).  QRadar sends syslog payloads to an
   off-site flow source using ASCII character 10 (0x0A -\lf).
   This inconsistency is causing issues with proxy syslog servers
   and offsite flow sources.  If using syslog-ng server as a
   master record of events and WinCollect is configured to send
   syslog-ng which sends to us the \0x0D character which causes
   issues.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define the syslog-ng as an offsite event target because
   syslog-ng accepts the 0x0A character as a syslog payload
   terminator.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WinCollect sends syslog payloads terminated with ASCII
   character 13 (0x0D - \cr).  QRadar sends syslog payloads to an
   off-site flow source using ASCII character 10 (0x0A -\lf).
   This inconsistency is causing issues with proxy syslog servers
   and offsite flow sources.  If using syslog-ng server as a
   master record of events and WinCollect is configured to send
   syslog-ng which sends to us the \0x0D character which causes
   issues.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An updated WinCollect agent executable was released that changed
    the TCP message terminator from a CR (0D) to a LF (0A).
   AGENT_x64_WinCollect-7.2.0.799013-setup.exe
   AGENT_i386_WinCollect-7.2.0.798992-setup.exe
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Define the syslog-ng as an offsite event target because
   syslog-ng accepts the 0x0A character as a syslog payload
   terminator.
