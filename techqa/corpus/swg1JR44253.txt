ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Secured Soap webservices are supported by using following
   solution:
   1. copy $TOP/samples/webservices/webservices.clients.jar to
   $TOP/jars folder
   2. update runtime classpath using configureEnv.sh or
   updateRtClasspath.sh
   3. invoke webservices using the following script:
   
   
       var endpointUrl =
   http://<ipaddress>:<port>/ProductWS_HTTPRouter/services/Prod u
   c t P o rt";
       var requestXmlStr = "<?xml version='1.0'
   encoding='UTF-8'?>";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "<soapenv:Envelope
   xmlns:soapenv='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "<soapenv:Header> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + " <wsse:Security
   xmlns:wsse='http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-
   wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd' soapenv:mustUnderstand='1'> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + " <wsse:UsernameToken> " ;
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "
   <wsse:Username>cusadmin</wsse:Username> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "
   <wsse:Password>cusadmin</wsse:Password> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + " </wsse:UsernameToken> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + " </wsse:Security> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "</soapenv:Header> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "<soapenv:Body> ";
       ... ...
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "</soapenv:Body> ";
       requestXmlStr = requestXmlStr + "</soapenv:Envelope> ";
       var soapClientConstructor =
   createJavaConstructor("com.ibm.pim.services.clients.SoapClient")
   ;
       var client = runJavaConstructor(soapClientConstructor );
       var soapClientMethod =
   createJavaMethod("com.ibm.pim.services.clients.SoapClient",
   "invokeService", "java.lang.String", "java.lang.String",
   "boolean");
       var resp = runJavaMethod(client, soapClientMethod,
   endpointUrl, requestXmlStr, false);
   
   In current SoapClient implementation the SoapAction is not sent
   properly, which is required when using SOAP1.1
