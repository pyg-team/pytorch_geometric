certificate expiration replacement TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Getting an error when replacing an old, expiring certificate. 

SYMPTOM
When replacing an old, expiring certificate, with a new certificate having this alias with a double quote: 

1108071cn=*.abc.com, ou=domain control - myssl(r), ou=see www.myssl.com/resources/xyz (c) 3, ou=gt8728350, serialnumber=rkijbkjhm4/gpmajsdqzup-ujb69vhdsncn=myssl ca, o="maptrust, inc." c=us

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675559&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675559&aid=1]

that has been imported into Personal certificates under NodeDefaultKeyStore:

(Path in Admistrative Console)
SSL certificate and key management > Key stores and certificates > NodeDefaultKeyStore > Personal certificates > Replace certificate)

The following error occurs: 

CWPKI0666E: Certificate "1309071cn=*.abc.com, ou=domain control - myssl(r), ou=see www.myssl.com/resources/xyz(c) 3, ou=gt8728350, serialnumber=rkijbkjhm4/gpmajsdqzup-ujb69vhdsncn=myssl ca, o=" is not a personal certificate


CAUSE
The new certificate's alias has a double quote in its name ("maptrust, inc."):

1309071cn=*.abc.com, ou=domain control - myssl(r), ou=see www.myssl.com/resources/xyz (c) 3, ou=gt8728350, serialnumber=rkijbkjhm4/gpmajsdqzup-ujb69vhdsncn=myssl ca, o="maptrust, inc." c=us

Note that the alias needs to be in quotes since it contains blanks, so the first quote around "o=maptrust, inc." causes the beginning quote to end, which makes the certificate unrecognizable, thus the errors.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-importing the new certificate with and assign a new alias that is shorter and does not have a double quote.
