CAUSE
Understanding of mean transaction times

ANSWER
You can navigate to Transaction times on DataPower through the WebGUI from Status->Connection->Transaction Times. The times are transaction mean times, which is a moving average based on their overall latency. The timer starts when the service is identified. 

There is some slight overhead that is not accounted for; such as when data is buffered in the driver before being sent out on the network. In almost all cases this overhead would be very small; less than 1 millisecond.

The time can also vary based on the configuration; for example, with a Web Service Proxy, the entire message needs to be read first, to figure out which WSP should operate on the request.

Here is a screen-shot that displays transaction times:
