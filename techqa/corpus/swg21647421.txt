Title: IBM EIF probe not receiving ITM events - United States

Text:
itm clearing event omnibus eif probe connectionmode TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM is sending events to EIF probe which is then forwarded to the OMNIbus Server. It is later observed that a clearing event is logged in the ITM trace/log but it does not seem to be received by EIF or Omnibus. The triggered event is clear and still exists in OMNIbus. 

SYMPTOM
Situation in ITM is no longer true but event is not cleared in OMNIbus. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 iptrace command shows that the EIF probe on the OMNIbus side is resetting/closing(<RST>) the TCP/IP connection after it receives the event. The event is not logged in the EIF logs and it is just dropped.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to set the connection_mode parameter in om_tec.config on the ITM Server (TEMS) to "connection_less" instead of "connection oriented". 

To do this, modify the following line in om_tec.config

From: ConnectionMode=co
To: ConnectionMode=connection_less

EIF on ITM will need to be restarted for the change to take effect e.g. tacmd refreshTECinfo -t eif
