QUESTION
 Since upgrading to AIX 5.3 TL7 or AIX V6, why do some rsct daemons show inoperative? 

ANSWER
Beginning with RSCT V2.4.8.0 and above RMC will consider certain resource managers to be idle when they have no work to do for a specified period of time. To conserve system resources, RMC can then gracefully shut down those idle resource managers. RMC currently uses a value of ten minutes to decide that a resource manager is idle.
Therefore, running lssrc will show several RSCT daemons as "inoperative":

# lssrc -a | grep rsct
ctrmc rsct 311474 active
IBM.ERRM rsct_rm 286888 active
IBM.ServiceRM rsct_rm 331940 active
IBM.CSMAgentRM rsct_rm 368832 active
IBM.DMSRM rsct_rm 360626 active
IBM.HWCTRLRM rsct_rm 307358 active
IBM.DRM rsct_rm 340168 active
ctcas rsct inoperative
IBM.AuditRM rsct_rm inoperative
IBM.LPRM rsct_rm inoperative
IBM.HostRM rsct_rm inoperative
IBM.SensorRM rsct_rm inoperative

As long as there are no errors in the error report indicating a core dump or an abnormal termination, the system will run normally without those daemons, and if they are needed they will be started on-demand.

NOTE: IBM.DMSRM is also started by the RMC subsystem but it is a component of CSM and not RSCT.
It should show active if there is an good RMC connection between the partition and the HMC.

Here is a table from the RSCT for AIX V5.3 TL7 Administration Guide (SA22-7889-13) that shows which daemons are subject to idle shutdown by RMC:

Audit log resource manager Provides a system-wide facility for recording information about the system's operation. It is use by subsystem components to log information about their actions, errors, and so on. on-demand yes IBM.CIMRM
CIM resource manager Enables you to use RMC to query system configuration through Common Information Model (CIM) classes. on-demand yes IBM.ConfigRM
Configuration resource manager Provides the ability, through its command-line interface, to create and administer a peer domain (a cluster of nodes configured for high availability). on-demand (if offline). Otherwise on-line auto-start no IBM.ERRM
Event response resource manager Provides resource monitoring — the ability to take actions in response to conditions occurring in the system. auto-start yes IBM.FSRM
File system resource manager Provides a resource class to represent file systems. on-demand yes IBM.HostRM
Host resource manager Provides resource classes to represent an individual machine, including its paging devices, physical volumes, and processors. on-demand yes IBM.LPRM
Least-privilege resource manager Controls access to root commands or scripts, and local or remote execution of those commands or scripts on AIX® or Linux®. on-demand yes IBM.SensorRM
Sensor resource manager Provides a way to extend the monitoring capabilities of the system by enabling you to create a single user-defined attribute for monitoring. on-demand yes IBM.StorageRM
Storage resource 
manager Provides management and data protection capabilities for shared storage resources within a RSCT peer domain. on demand no
