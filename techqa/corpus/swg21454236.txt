PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Services Management Agent Environment tree does not show up in the Physical Navigator view for my SOA agent. 

SYMPTOM
You will not see a sub-tree under the Services Management Agent tree.


CAUSE
This is caused because there is no SOA traffic being generated.

ENVIRONMENT
ITM 6.2.2 with ITCAM for SOA 7.1.x.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem simply run some SOA traffic through it. You will then see the Services Management Agent sub-tree show up under the Services Management Agent tree. This is how it looks when you have valid SOA traffic that's processed by the SOA agent.
