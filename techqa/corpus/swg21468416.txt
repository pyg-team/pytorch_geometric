Installation Instructions 
You may install this software using the System Management and Installation Tool ( SMIT [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.genprogc/doc/genprogc/smit.htm]) utility. You must be logged on as root or have the superuser authority. To install this software using the SMIT interface, follow these steps: 
 * You must install the Runtime Environment package before installing the Utilities package, if installing both.

 * Download the Utilities package; for example, xlcpp.util.9.0.0.aix.nov2010.tar.Z.

 * Uncompress and untar package into an empty directory, using the following command: 


zcat <filename>.tar.Z | tar -xf - 

 * Run the command:


smit install_latest 

 * This command invokes the SMIT, which presents a menu-driven user interface for the installation process. First specify the INPUT device/directory of the software. Type in the name of the directory which contains the uncompressed package, or press F4 to select from a list of directories. 

 * If you have read the license agreement and agree to its terms, you must select 'yes' next to Accept new LICENSE agreements? to continue with the installation.

 * Leave the default values in other fields, or modify them according to your preferences.


Notes: 
It is recommended that you keep the default setting '_all_latest' in the SOFTWARE to install. This will ensure that all necessary filesets are installed. Otherwise, you will have to specify the filesets individually. 

You may preview the installation process without actually installing the software by selecting 'yes' next to the Preview only? field. 

Press Enter when you are done customizing the installation options. Installation starts and messages are displayed as each part is installed. The installation log will be stored to file $HOME/smit.log. 

If you selected '_all_latest' SMIT will attempt to install all runtime filesets. As a result you may see the failed installation status for some message catalog filesets due to missing prerequisites. Those errors may be ignored if you do not need the runtime message catalog(s) for the national language(s) in question.
