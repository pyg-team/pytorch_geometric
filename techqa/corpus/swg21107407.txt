PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Enabling security for the WebSphere® Test Environment (WTE) v5.x server configuration of WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD) v5.x and Rational® Application Developer (RAD) v6.0 and v7.0. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following instructions assume that there is a server configured in the WebSphere Test Environment. To enable security for the WebSphere Test Environment, do the following steps: 

 

 1. Open the Server perspective. 
 2. Open the server configuration in the Server Configuration view. 
 3. Select the Security tab. 
 4. Check the Enable Security box. 
 5. Enter the user name and password for the administrator or any user that is part of the administrator group in Microsoft® Windows® in the Local OS Authentication section. 
 6. Enter the password again for verification. 
 7. Press Ctrl + S to save the changes.
    

For Linux® users: 

Start the server in the WebSphere Test Environment. Find the Security enabled true log entry in the console, which indicates that security is enabled. The console log at the end of this page shows an example. You might receive an exception in the console log that indicates that you do not possess sufficient permissions to start the server. Please consult your system administrator to obtain sufficient access levels to start the server. 

For Windows users: 

The specified user must have the following permissions in Windows: 
 * Log on as service

Press Ctrl + S to save the changes. Log off and back on to the operating system for the permission to take effect. 
 * 
 * For Windows NT:
 * 
 *  Select Programs > Administrative Tools > User Manager > Policies Menu > User Rights. Check Show Advanced User Rights. Select Log on as service from the drop down list. Click Add. Click Show Users. Select the user name in the Names field. Click Add. Click OK. Repeat step two for Act as part of the operating system. Click OK. Press Ctrl + S to save the changes. Log off and back on to the operating system for the permission to take effect.

 *  Click Start > Control Panel. Double-click Administrative Tools. Double-click Local Security Policy. 
   Expand Local Policies Double-click User Rights Assignment. Double-click Log on as service from the right side of the window. Select Add User or Group. Type in the username in the Enter the object names to select field, and click Check Names. The user name in use and machine name appear in the Enter the object names to select field. Click OK.
