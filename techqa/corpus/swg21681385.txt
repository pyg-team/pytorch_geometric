RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



The WebGUI installation documentation makes the assumption that the prerequisite software is already installed. The prerequisite software needed for the WebGUI 8.1.0 installation is WAS 8.5.01 and Jazz for Service management 1.1.0.3. Details on the part numbers needed and the installation order are listed below for Linux and AIX. 



AIX
 1.  IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus 8.1 Core – AIX 64bit Multilingual (CN05GML )
 2.  Note: not having this installed will not prevent the WebGUI installation from completing but, without an Object Server installed and running you will not be able to configure a datasource. 
 3.  IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.1 for Jazz for Service Management for AIX Multilingual (CIES5ML )
 4.  During this step the Installation Manager will see both WAS 8.0.5 and WAS 8.5.01 make sure you choose WAS 8.5.0.1 
 5.  Jazz for Service Management V1.1.0.3 for AIX Multilingual (CIXA1ML )
