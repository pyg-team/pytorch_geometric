PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to control the HTTP server logs in TAM ESSO 8.1 

SYMPTOM
In TAM ESSO 8.1 we are now using WebSphere and IBM's HTTP Server. If unchecked the HTTP Server logs can grow to gigabytes in size. 


CAUSE
By default there is no file rotation in place the HTTP Server is logging access and storing it into one file.

ENVIRONMENT
TAM ESSO 8.1 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the machine running your IMS Server is running out of disk space, check the HTTP Server log file which is located by default in Program Files\IBM\HTTPServer\logs

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop the HTTP Server and once stopped, you will be able to move and delete the access.log. When the HTTP Server starts up it will create a new access.log file and start logging once again. 





You may consider log rotation so when the access.log file reaches a specific size it is written off to the logs directory and you can then move it to storage without taking down the HTTP Server.

You may consider using the Customlog and the rotatelog utilities within IHS. 
To do this, modify your httpd.conf file and replace your default CustomLog setting 
for the access.log with the following: 
CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs.exe logs/access.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M 500M" common 

This will create an access log with the year, month, day, hour, and minute 
and roll over when the file reached the specified megabyte size. In this 
example it is set at 500mb. 

*** Note that the date/time stamp is recorded in GMT time. 

If you think 500mb is too small you can increase it to 1000M and the 
logs will be created when they reach that size. 
You will then be able to move the old logs off that server to free up 
space.
