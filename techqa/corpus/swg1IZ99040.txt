APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM for SOA Data command line interface collector
   configuration does not provide a mechanism to validate user ID
   and password on WebSphere environment with Global Security
   turned on.
   When using the command line interface to configure the WAS DC
   the script will request ID and PWS only if an XTERM display has
   been assigned to the session. This prevents our customers from
   fully automate a none interactive script to deploy our agents in
   their environment.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When used as part of a batch or script processing, the Data
   Collector command line interface configuration tool fails to
   propagate the required config commands when WebSphere
   global security is enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added logic will provide the required function to be propagated
   properly with global security enabled in WebSphere.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  N/A
