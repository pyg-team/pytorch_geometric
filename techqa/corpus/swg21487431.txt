Title: IBM Windows 7 and Legacy Viewer - unable to launch - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using Windows 7 Professional and I need to access some older .spo output files. I install the Legacy Viewer per the instructions in KnowledgeBase article 87785, but when I launch the application I receive the following error:

"SmartViewer 15.0 could not be configured for this user."

I've even tried creating a new user profile with administratove rights and installing under that profile, and I continue to get the same error.

What can I do? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - No Workaround Available.
You will have to install the Legacy Viewer on a computer that is running Windows XP since this software has never been tested under Windows 7.
