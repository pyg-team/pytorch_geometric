APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In WLE 7.2 when running optimizer/simulation 'Instance Duration
   Trend' diagram is blank and is not reflecting any data. It works
   just fine for the same simple process in WLE 7.1.
   
   
   I have used the export of the process that was provided by the
   customer, running many (around 40) instances, completing them,
   sending definitions etc. Nothing helps and no error, the same
   way 'Instance Duration Histogram' is reflecting data just fine.
   
   The issue easily reproduces with simple BPD running an 'Ad-hoc
   simulation' via 'Start new simulation for the current process
   only' button.
