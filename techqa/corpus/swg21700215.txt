ENVIRONMENT

CE 5.2.1.3
Windows 2008 R2 with SP1
WAS (embedded WAS)
DB (embedded DB)

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Checked the TxtExtractSetup.msi.log, found the following: 





MSI (s) (3C:24) [09:43:08:312]: Windows Installer installed the 
product. Product Name: Text Extraction Connector. Product Version: 
14.0.12. Product Language: 1033. Manufacturer: IBM Corporation. 
Installation success or error status: 0. 

Checked the TaskRoutingServiceSetup.msi.log, found the following: 


CustomAction _F401ADF0_A991_4D7F_A720_9C87CE6F49FB returned actual 
error code -1 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation 
happened inside sandbox) 
MSI (s) (3C:80) [09:39:16:710]: Product: IBM Content Collector Task 
Routing Service -- Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. Action _F401ADF0_A991_4D7F_A720_9C87CE6F49FB, location:
D:\Apps\IBM\ContentCollector\ctms\TaskRoutingService.exe, command: 

-add-win32-service-entry
...
MSI (s) (3C:80) [09:39:17:194]: Windows Installer installed the product. Product Name: IBM Content Collector Task Routing Service. 
Product Version: 16.8.27. Product Language: 1033. Manufacturer: IBM Corporation. Installation success or error status: 1603.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1.) Use the Service Control utility, which comes with Windows, to remove the service entry for the configuration access service.
2.) Manually install CTMSUI.msi and the *UI.msi files that for each of the connectors you need.
3.) Store the following lines ( CTMSUI must be first ) in the text file E:\APPS\IBM\ContentCollector\msi\ui-list.txt

CTMSUI.msi
CMV8ConnectorUISetup.msi
FileSystemConnectorUISetup.msi
FileSystemRepositoryUISetup.msi
idmConnectorUISetup.msi
LotusConnectionsUISetup.msi
P84xConnectorUISetup.msi
SPConnectorUISetup.msi
TxtExtractUISetup.msi
TxtExtractUISetup.msi
UtilityConnectorUISetup.msi

4.) Open a command prompt, cd to the directory

E:\APPS\IBM\ContentCollector\msi

5.) Run the following command

for /f %i in ( ui-list.txt ) do start /wait msiexec /i %i TARGETDIR=E:\APPS\IBM\ContentCollector\ctms

This is going to kick off, one at a time, the install of each of the MSIs in the list. You should be able to just click 'next' through each of them to install each UI component. Since the installers are running in GUI mode you will see right away if any of them have a problem.
