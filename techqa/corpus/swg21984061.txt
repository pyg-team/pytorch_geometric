Title: IBM Report data showing '<unsupported: NVARCHAR2>' - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When testing Cognos Analytics 11.0.0 report against a Data Module package connecting to both Oracle 11g and Oracle 12c, the cells of the reporting object (list/crosstab/etc) shows '<unsupported: NVARCHAR2>'.



SYMPTOM
This only happens in the following situations: 

- only for data types that use NVARCHAR2. Other tested data types that work are VARCHAR2 and NVARCHAR 

- only for Data Module packages. FM packages work. 

- only against Oracle datasource. Both Oracle 11g and 12c are affected. SQLServer using NVARCHAR2 works.


CAUSE
Identified to be a client driver issue.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please update to the latest Oracle Instant Client version. 

Please make sure to refresh the Data Server schema after copying the new drivers.
