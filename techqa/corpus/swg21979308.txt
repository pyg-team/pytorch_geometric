QUESTION
 What do I download and install to get the lastest CDC build (version)? 

ANSWER
Passport Advantage (PPA) has the 11.3.3 base release for IIDR/CDC.
1. For CDC/i, users always need to go to Passport Advantage first to download and install the base 11.3.3, and then go to Fix Central (FC) to install the latest build (fixes and enhancements).

2. For users upgrading from pre-11.3.3, they need to go to Passport Advantage first to download and upgrade to the base 11.3.3, and then apply the latest Fix Central update.

3. For users doing a fresh install of 11.3.3, they can go directly to Fix Central to download and install 11.3.3 latest build without installing the base 11.3.3 first. Or they can go to Passport Advantage first and then go to Fix Central, in case they are used to that model.
