APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The z/OS system hung, and an IPL was required. A standalone dump
   showed that many jobs, including *MASTER*, DMPSRV, CONSOLE,
   OMVS, JES2, and user jobs such as brokers, were in an ENQ wait
   for resource NAME=MAJOR=NETMAGDB (a resource for a 3rd party
   product).  The ENQ was held by a broker job that was going
   through MEMTERM processing due to an ABENDS40D.
   .
   The dump of the *MASTER* address space showed that the TCB for
   memterm processing for the ENQ owner was waiting in MQ. SYSTRACE
   of the *MASTER* address space showed that the MEMTERM TCB was in
   a loop of WAIT, STORAGE RELEASE, and STORAGE OBTAIN  every
   second. The WAIT PSW was in CSQ3RRSX+x'185C' (UK94940) in
   routine SETDIE.  It was called from EBACTL_RETRY2 to wait for 1
   second at a time for EBACTL to be turned on for a thread for the
   broker job. The TCB for that thread was alrady gone.
   .
   The MQ change team found that the code added by PM75418 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM75418] can
   cause memterm processing to hang indefinitely. Presumably the
   fact that memterm processing hung prevented subsequent memterm
   processing by z/OS from releasing the NETMAGDB ENQ.
   .

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After applying the PTF for PM75418 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM75418],     *
   *                      UK91873 / UK91874, MEMTERM processing   *
   *                      for an address space connected to MQ is *
   *                      hanging.                                *
   *                      The LPAR may potentially become         *
   *                      unresponsive.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The connected address space has experienced abends, and has then
   been MEMTERM'ed with S40D. During MEMTERM processing, context
   services has invoked CSQ3RRSX for END_CONTEXT processing. The
   ACE associated with the context has EBACTL set off, indicating
   that it is in MQ code. CSQ3RRSX therefore waits for EBACTL to be
   set back on.
   However, EBACTL will never get set back on as the address space
   that it was running under has been MEMTERM'ed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to not wait for EBACTL to be turned back on
   if the connected address space has been MEMTERM'ed, preventing
   the hang from occurring.
