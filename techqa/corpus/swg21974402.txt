Title: IBM Connection fails when configuring Identity Insight with the message queue - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you run the verification step and your attempts to connect fail, channel access might be blocked because the default value for the Channel Authentication Records feature is enabled. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The application relies on the MQSERVER environment variable; therefore, no additional configuration is required. For more information, see the WebSphere MQ technote: 

WMQ 7.1 / 7.5 / 8.0 queue manager RC 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED or AMQ4036 or JMSWMQ2013 when using client connection as an MQ Administrator [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137]
