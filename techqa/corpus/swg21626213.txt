Title: IBM Scroll arrows won't go past 200 items - United States

Text:
SCCD; scroll; arrows; list tab; 200 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why on the list view of any application if there are more than 200 entries listed, the scroll arrows won't allow scrolling past 200 entries? 

ANSWER
Do these steps:

1) Go To > System Configuration > Platform Configuration > System Properties

2) In the System Properties app, filter for "maxselectrows"

3) Expand the "webclient.maxselectrows" property. Set the "Global Value" to 3000 or whatever you prefer.

4) Hit Save.

5) Stop and restart the Maximo application in Websphere Application Server. This property cannot be updated through Live Update, so you need to restart SCCD for the new value to get loaded at start.
WARNING: Setting the limit to too high a value may result in performance issues. 

Any new setting should be implemented and fully tested in a test environment before making these changes in your production environment.
