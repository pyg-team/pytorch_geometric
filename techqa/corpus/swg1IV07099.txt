ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM:
   
   Pages on the application are allowed to be captured within a
   frame from another server. This can be exploited by
   attackers by sending a forged link to a user. The link will be
   to a malicious page with this application captured in a
   frame. All activity by the user can be monitored and
   recorded by the attacker allowing the compromise of the
   username, password, or any other sensitive input the user
   enters.
   
   Earlier versions of Cross Frame scripting could be prevented
   by a frame busting script like the following. However, the
   new variations of the finding are able to frame the page even
   when the following fix is applied making the following
   script insufficient.
   
   <script LANGUAGE="JAVASCRIPT">
   if(top != self)
   {
   top.location=self.location;
   }
   </script>
   
   A page vulnerable to XFSv2 also leads to other
   vulnerabilities such as clickjacking. Clickjacking takes the
   form of embedded code or script that can execute without the
   user's knowledge, such as clicking on a button that appears
   to perform another function. For more on clickjacking,
