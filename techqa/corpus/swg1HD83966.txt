ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Not possible to use double space as delimiter
   between attributes in WebEditor
   scenario:
   Open Web editor R19SP3 on smdemo DB login as
   joe
   Open preferences view
   Open display attributes
   Click on documents class
   In the Field separator , set double space
   Save this new separator
   Click then on create object
   create a new document
   Click again on create object and create a new
   task/general task
   Then go back on home page and look at the recent
   objects view, double
   space are replaced by bad characters &#160;
   We try to change regional settings but change
   nothing.
   problem is the "Recently objects" when there are
   objects from
   different superclass (otherwise there is a grid that
   seperates the
   attributes and then there wont be a problem. It
   also works fine in a
   tree view.
   delete the configuration files for my test user, but it
   didn't
   help. As soon as I had objects from different super
   classes in the
   recent objects list i.e. attributes will be displayed in
   the same
   column using the deliminter I got the problem again
   .
