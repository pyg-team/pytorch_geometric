   BIRT reports are missing the horizontal scroll bar
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  On FF and IE, the browser's horizontal scroll bar will show
   up if the report is wider than the page (basically, same
   behaviour as in 3.0.x); on Chrome, the scroll bar is part of
   the page, but it's at the bottom, instead of up directly
   underneath the report contents
