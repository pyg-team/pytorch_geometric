APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An appliance restart or other unpredictable behavior can be
   triggered by malicious ASN.1 content coming into the DataPower
   appliance from a variety of entry points.
   
   The problem can be externally triggered from malicious network
   data entering services as follows:
     - compressed or signed or encrypted messages entering a B2B
   Gateway
     - signed or encrypted messages entering a service with a
   cryptobin action set to verify or decrypt the messages
   
   The problem can also be triggered from certain CLI commands (and
   their WebGUI/SOMA equivalents):
   
     - boot image (firmware upgrade action)
     - certificate (Crypto Certificate configuration)
     - crypto-import (action)
     - decrypt (deprecated S/MIME file crypto action)
     - key (Crypto Key configuration)
     - verify (deprecated S/MIME file crypto action)
   
   This problem can also be triggered by modifying the contents of
   files used by existing Crypto Key and Crypto Certificate objects
   (the new file will be read at the next firmware restart or
   object reconfiguration).
   
   This problem is known as CVE-2012-2110.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restrict access to the affected CLI commands.  There is no local
   fix for this problem in cryptobin and B2B Gateway services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A vulnerability exists when parsing malicious improperly-formed
   ASN.1 data.  It can cause unpredictable results including an
   appliance restart.
   
   Malicious data can enter the appliance from the network
   when a service is configured to decrypt or perform
   signature verification, as B2B AS1/AS2/AS3 messages to
   be processed by a B2B Gateway, or as PKCX#7 or S/MIME
   traffic to be processed by a cryptobin action.  In addition,
   various CLI commands that refer to ASN.1-encoded data can
   potentially be entrypoints for malicious data.
   
      This problem is known as CVE-2012-2110.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 3.8.2.14, 4.0.1.12, 4.0.2.8 and 5.0.0.0.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Restrict access to the affected CLI commands (including commands
   that can modify ASN.1 data referenced by existing objects).
   There is no temporary fix for the network entrypoints.
