QUESTION
 How do you replace the IBM JRE on the IBM Rational Host On-Demand Server on all platforms? 

ANSWER
These instructions are for Host on-Demand Administrators to replace the JRE provided on the Host On-Demand server for Windows clients. 

 1. Download the IBM 6.0 SP12 JRE for Windows from the Host On-Demand Fix Central sit [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Rational&product=ibm/Rational/IBM+Host+On-Demand&release=1.6.0.12&platform=Windows&function=all]e [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] and save to an accessible location.
    
    
 2. Go to your Host On-Demand Server and go to the JREInstall subdirectory within the Host On-Demand publish directory. The default path for each server platform is:  * Windows: C:\Program Files\IBM\HostOnDemand\HOD\JREInstall 
     * AIX: /opt/IBM/hostondemand/HOD/JREInstall 
     * Linux: /opt/IBM/hostondemand/HOD/JREInstall 
     * i5OS: /QIBM/ProdData/IBM/hostondemand/HOD/JREInstall 
     * z/OS: /usr/lpp/HOD/hostondemand/HOD/JREInstall
       
       
    
    
 3. From the JREInstall subdirectory, back up the file IBM-Win32-JRE.exe to another location or rename this file. 
    
    
 4. Copy or ftp in binary previously downloaded file, ibm-java-jre-60-win-i386_SR12.exe, into the JREInstall directory.
    
    
 5. Rename the Java executable file to IBM-Win32-JRE.exeto ensure that the HODMain.html links work.


This IBM JRE is included on the Host On-Demand server and accessible by way of the "IBM 32-bit RunTime Environment for Java 2" link on the HODMain.html page. When no JRE is detected when a client is downloaded or started, this JRE is available to the user to download unless the Host On-Demand Administrator has disabled the download.
