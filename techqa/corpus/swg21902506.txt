Title: IBM RPT script with TLS protocol does not play back in ITCAM - United States

TLS SSL; 71RRT-RPTCONF; 71RRT-RPTPLAY; 71RRT-CONF; 71RRT-PLAY TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TLS protocol requires a change to ITCAM t6 environment to run Service Tests. 

SYMPTOM
This problem occurs with Service Tests created in RPT (Rational Performance Tester) 8.2.1.5 for HTTPS exchanges with a server based on TLS. 

When the test is exported to ITCAM and executed, SSL handshake failures occur, whereas they do not happen when the test is executed within the RPT 8.2.1.5 workbench.


CAUSE
RPT 8.2.1.5 Java version does not match the ITCAM version which introduces a different behavior when the server is using the TLS protocol. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
CommonBaseEvent log shows RPWD0002E Unexpected exception javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
ITCAM T6 agent Java version must be changed to Java 1.6 SR9 for the script to run correctly on the agent.
