APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS CM Plugin package COMMAND function does not add the command
   for the correct repository or container specified in the Target
    Container section of Package Commands view dialogue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When attempting to add a new command to a package in the CICS
   Configuration Manager (CM) Plug-in, the function requires a
   source and target configuration, however, the specified command
   was not added to the correct repository or container specified
   in the target repository/container section of Package Commands
   view dialogue.  Instead, it uses what has been specified in the
   source repository.  The server accepted the modification to the
   overall package as it did not contravene any rules, but the
   subsequent package would not install because the rule did not
   make sense.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CM Plug-in has been altered so that the target repository is
   passed correctly when adding a new command to a package.  The
   subsequent install will be successful.
   This fix will be made available in Version 5.1.0.1 of the CICS
   Configuration Manager plug-in for CICS Explorer.
