RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

 Considerations before collecting data 
Take note of the following before collecting the information described below:

 * Performance  * Runtime tracing may be verbose, and it could impact performance during peak time. If possible, reproduce the problem on a non-production environment to capture tracing.
      
   
    *  If using WebSphere Version 8, there is an option to utilize High Performance Extensible Logging(HPEL) to minimize the impact of logging and tracing. The logs need to be formatted using the logViewer utility [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rtrb_logviewer.html] before uploading to IBM. For more information on enabling HPEL, refer to WebSphere Knowledge Center Using HPEL to troubleshoot applications [ https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/ttrb_usinghpel.html].
   
   

 * Security  * Some trace strings could capture sensitive or personal infomation. Please be sure to sanitize the logs before uploading to IBM. Commerce uses data masking to help mask sensitive data. See Knowledge Center Masking Sensitive data in traces [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZLC2_7.0.0/com.ibm.commerce.developer.doc/concepts/csdlogging.htm?lang=en]
   
   


 COLLECTING DATA 



 I. Configure environment 

Follow the instructions below to configure your environment to capture the required diagnostic information: 

 1. Update the size of the trace files to 20MB and the number of historical trace files retained to 20. If using HPEL, set the maximum size to at least 500MB.
 2. Enable the following runtime trace string:
    
    com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_SERVER=all: com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_USER=all: com.ibm.websphere.commerce.WC_ACCESSCONTROL=all
     *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif]Enabling trace What is this data These trace components increase the amount of diagnostic data logged to the WebSphere server trace file. Why do I need this data This data will capture more detailed diagnostic trace information for the subject component. Where can I find this data Please look at the following Commerce Information Center documentation for more information on enabling Commerce trace components:  1.  Configuring logging in WebSphere Commerce [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wchelp/v7r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.commerce.admin.doc/tasks/tlslogging.htm] 
       
       
    
    
    

 * Related WebSphere Commerce MustGather's  * You may want to review the Access Control Policy Load (acpload) mustgather [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21440727] if your access control problems are related to a newly, loaded policy.
   
   





 II. Reproduce problem 

 

 1. Note the specific steps used to reproduce the problem and any details that may be relevant such as (UserID, command name, policyId, etc.).
 2. If there is another UserID that can successfully execute the command in question, also run the collector against the working scenario.
 3. Typical Access Control problems occur as a result of invoking a command. Repeat the steps to invoke the particular command in order to reproduce the problem.





Ill. Validate the issue was captured 
Before sending logs to IBM, ensure that the issue being reported was captured. Recommend to review the following documents to help facilitate proper log collection: Avoiding pitfalls when collecting traces. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648137] 




 IV. Collect data 

Include the general information requested in MustGather: General Issues in WebSphere Commerce [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21440709] alongside the component-specific information requested below. 


 1. Collect the following files from the system:  1. WC_profiledir/logs/server_name/trace.log1 
     2. WC_profiledir/logs/server_name/SystemOut.log2 
     3. WC_profiledir/logs/server_name/SystemErr.log3 
    
    
 2.  *Naming conventions can be found here [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wchelp/v7r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.commerce.base.doc/misc/mabhelp.htm].
 3. 
 4.  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif]What are these files? 1 If tracing is enabled, WAS will log the detailed trace messages to this file by default. 2 This file contains the standard logging messages. 3 This is the log file where error messages are logged to. 
 5. 
 6. Run the following database queries to collect the necessary information from your database (output results in CSV format): 
    Query Output file name SELECT * FROM SITE SITE.csv select * from ACPOLICY ACPOLICY.csv select * from ACRESCGRY ACRESCGRY.csv select * from ACRESGRP ACRESGRP.csv select * from ACRESGPRES ACRESGPRES.csv select * from ACACTION ACACTION.csv select * from ACACTGRP ACACTGRP.csv select * from ACACTACTGP ACACTACTGP.csv select * from ACPOLGRP ACPOLGRP.csv select * from ACPLGPSUBS ACPLGPSUBS.csv select * from ACPOLGPPOL ACPOLGPPOL.csv select * from ORGENTITY ORGENTITY.csv 






 SUBMITTING DATA TO IBM SUPPORT 
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR) 
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
