ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ---------------------------------------------
   Action Taken/Reproduction Scenario:
   ---------------------------------------------
   1. Create a content ("content_01") and update it multiple times
   so it has at least 3 versions.
   2. Add a label ("label_02") for version 2.
   3. Enable system initiated syndication by setting the following
   in WCMConfigService.properties:
      deployment.itemChangedTaskDelay=30
      This ensures WCM will initiate syndication every 30 seconds
   automatically.
   4. Setup syndication for the library with "content_01" to a
   subscriber.
   5. If you check the subscriber, "content_01" will have the same
   number of versions and corresponding labels as it has on the
   syndicator.
   6. Now on the syndicator, edit the version 2 label to "new
   label_02" and add a label ("label_03") for version 3.
   7. Wait 30 seconds or more. On the subscriber, the label for
   version 2 is still "label_02" and there is no label for version
   3.
   
   ---------------------------------------------
   Expected Results:
   ---------------------------------------------
   On the subscriber, the label for version 2 should be updated to
   "new label_02" and version 3 should now be labelled "label_03".
