Title: IBM listIU.sh -v fails with message ACUIR00003E - United States

Text:
ACUIR00003E; listIU; listIU.sh; TCR; fails TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Command "listIU.sh -v", issued as root, runs for a while and then terminate with error message:

ACUIR00003E The query failed with return code, 2 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can examine the logs file located in the folders: 

/usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/<user> (for DE installed as root)
/home/.acsi_<username>/logs (for DE installed as non-root) 

by looking for any meaningful troubleshooting information concerning the listIU execution failure.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Most of the time the problem is related to locked files which prevent the process from executing smoothly, or maybe DE is not running at all.
Before any further investigation on the logs files, try restarting DE with these steps:

If DE is installed as root
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin # ./acsisrv.sh -stop 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin # ./acsisrv.sh -start

iF DE is installed as non-root
/home/.acsi_<username>/bin # ./acsisrv.sh -stop 
/home/.acsi_<username>/bin # ./acsisrv.sh -start

Then issue listIU.sh again.
