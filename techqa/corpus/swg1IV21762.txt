Title: IBM IV21762: INCORRECT MATCHING OF QPI PROCESSORS ON ESX SERVER. LACK OF INFORMATION IN ILMT 7.2.2.2 README FILE. - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The readme file for ILMT 7.2.2 Fix Pack 2 does not contain
   information about a very important fix concerning QPI
   processors.
   Prior to Fix Pack 2 installation, the QPI processors were not
   being correctly matched on the virtual server (ESX / Hyper-V).
   It was caused by incorrect implementation of the QPI matching
   logic while processing data from a VM Manager.
   
   Example: the 'Intel Xeon;2S 8 X7560' processor was being matched
   to 'Intel Xeon 8 null' entry in ILMT causing default PVU value
   usage and incorrect calculations.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Documentation:
   No workaround. No other information source available.
   
   Software:
   Install Fix Pack 2 for ILMT 7.2.2.
