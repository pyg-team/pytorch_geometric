Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect server products in WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect some configurations of IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile that is shipped as a component of server products in WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition. The IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server is not affected. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION:The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Dynamic Process Edition 6.1, 6.2, 7.0 

If you are using an unsupported version, IBM strongly recommends to upgrade.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Please consult the following security bulletins for vulnerability details and information about fixes. 

 * Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-4000) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21957980] 
 * Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java SDK (CVE-2015-0478, CVE-2015-0488, and CVE-2015-1916) and with Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect IBM Integration Designer (IID) and WebSphere Integration Developer (WID) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961812]

WebSphere Application Server is used by WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Business Services Fabric, and WebSphere Business Monitor. 
The following setting in java.secruity allows you to reenable ciphers using DH and DHE key exchange that you had to disable as a temporary workaround: 
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize <768 WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
