Title: IBM DASH consolecli export failure "Client requested protocol SSLv3 not enabled" - United States

Text:
DASHL2; DASHL2SSL; DASHL2SEC; SSLv3; SSLHandshakeException; protocol; not supported TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM) Dashboard Application Services Hub consolecli export fails with the following in the consolcli log:

"CTGWA4121E Error verifying username/password, response code: 0." 

SYMPTOM
 The following error is written to the systemOut log:

"SSLHandshakeException: Client requested protocol SSLv3 not enabled or not supported"


CAUSE
The sslProtocol in WAS was set to TLS, which does not support all SSL protocols.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the sslProtocol value set in the <JazzSM Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/security.xml. The default value for DASH is "SSL_TLS" which support all SSL protocols. A value of "TLS" does not support all protocols and results in the systemOut error when the export is run.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the sslProtocol value in the security.xml to a supported value ("SSL_TLS", or "SSL_TLSv2"). Restart DASH for the change to take effect.
