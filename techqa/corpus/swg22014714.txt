QUESTION
 Is there a simplified list of instructions to manually Vulcanize my TRIRIGA UX Application? 

ANSWER
The Wiki containing the instructions to Vulcanize UX Applications contains much detail and must be reviewed before you take advantage of these more streamlined instructions. 
Review the Main Wiki here: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/How%20to%20vulcanize%20your%20UX%20application [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/How%20to%20vulcanize%20your%20UX%20application] [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en] 

The purpose of this note is to provide a simpler, higher-level list of the steps necessary to Vulcanize UX Applications. 

Though you can run this process from the local workstation, it is generally recommended to run this process on the Application server for better performance. 

 

Let’s get started… 

========================================================== 

 

 1. If you do not already have NPM and Node.JS installed on your workstation, you need to get and run the command as outlined here and on the tools page link in the main Wiki [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en].
    
    You can get NODE.JS from the link below and install it. Commands can be run at the terminal or a command prompt.
    https://nodejs.org/en/ [https://nodejs.org/en/]
    
    As of 3/15/18 Select: 8.10.0 LTS
    After installing you can test by checking the version. Run this command.
    
    npm -v
    
    
 2. Next install the tri_vulcanize command. 
    
    npm install tri-vulcanize -g
    
    or
    
    sudo npm install tri-vulcanize -g 
    
    
 3. Next get the WebViewSync Jar file for the TRIRIGA version you are running from the developerWorks Community folder at:https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=9e3a5b9d-6a06-4796-a6c1-5137b626e39c#fullpageWidgetId=W89a8af160e64_4167_a047_b5bc553dcaf4&folder=705ed044-fa9c-4d87-8353-3017fcd6f863 [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=9e3a5b9d-6a06-4796-a6c1-5137b626e39c#fullpageWidgetId=W89a8af160e64_4167_a047_b5bc553dcaf4&folder=705ed044-fa9c-4d87-8353-3017fcd6f863] [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=9e3a5b9d-6a06-4796-a6c1-5137b626e39c]
    
    Move the JAR file to a new folder. 
    *With HTTPS you need to make sure that there is an SSL Certificate installed.
    
    Run the following to initialize the .jar file. You are prompted for the TRIRIGA URL and Login. When complete it will return test success and Sign out of TRIRIGA
    
    
    java -jar WebViewSync_3.5.3.jar init
    
    
 4. Run command to Addview or Pull to make the vulcanized view visible (be sure to change the jar name to match your version and note that the triview_group_move app that is referenced below is an example. Change it as needed.) If this is the first time, you are doing this run Addview. If it was done already, you would use the Pull command
    
    
    java -jar WebViewSync_3.5.3.jar addview -v triview-group-move
    
    or
    
    java -jar WebViewSync_3.5.3.jar pull -v triview-group-move
    
    
    It will pull the files for the view and return Success
    
    **Mention of SYNC command in the parent Wiki has been bypassed. It will be taken care of by the Push command below. 
    
 5. Run the tri-Vulcanize command. You need to change this to match your credentials.
    ***Review the ‘Some things to consider’ section of the main Wiki [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en].
    
    
    tri-vulcanize --user system --password admin --url
    http://support00.tivlab.usnv.ibm.com:25001/p353a1053 --view triview-group-move --component triview-group-move-dev --output triview-group-move/triview-group-move.html
    
    
    It is not unusual to see [warn] messages like these. They can be ignored.

    In some cases you may need to manually copy images to the vulcanized view record. See the main Wiki [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en] Item 3 for more information.
    
 6. Run the Command to push vulcanized files to TRIRIGA server:
    
    
    java -jar WebViewSync_3.5.3.jar push -f -v triview-group-move
    
    
 7. Clear Object MetaData Cache
    
 8. Optional: Clear Browser Cache
