ABSTRACT
 This extension to the embedded Trust Association Interceptor component provides single sign-on to WebSphere Application Server by IBM Security Access Manager for Web. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This adapter enables single sign-on (SSO) to WebSphere Application Server by configuring WebSphere Application Server to allow trust associations. 


The embedded Trust Association Interceptor++ (tai++) accepts an iv-creds HTTP request header from IBM Security Access Manager for Web and a trust password in a Basic Authentication header. The embedded tai++ authenticates the trust password and dismantles the iv-creds HTTP request header to build the credential of the original user.

The extended version of the Trust Association Interceptor++ (ETAI) includes additional capabilities: 

 * Removes the need for any Security Access Manager configuration on WebSphere Application Server. 
 * Map the credential attributes of the original user to different registry formats or add no credentials at all. 
 * Process Tivoli Federated Identity Manager security tokens. 
 * Additional trust mechanism based on mutual authentication over SSL and validation of incoming certificate chain. 
 * Works with iv-user only, in the absence of iv-creds. 
 * Propagate rich identity to JAX-WS, LTPA, RMI/IIOP in the form of Security Access Manager binary security token. 
 * Propagate Security Access Manager security attributes to the JAAS authorization token using a login module. 
 * Consume SAML 2.0 assertions from TFIM enable junctions generated by Tivoli Federated Identity Manager without the need for iv-user or iv-creds. 
 * Signature validation of SAML 2.0 assertions using a local keystore and remote Security Token Service (STS) such as Tivoli Federated Identity Manager.
