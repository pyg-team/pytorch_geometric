PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
IBM Installation Manager hangs while being installed on AIX 64-bit systems.

SYMPTOM
The hang situation may occur in the following cases: 

 1. While IBM Installation Manager is being installed on AIX 64-bit systems, a hang situation occurs as soon as IBM Installation Manager install wizard is launched. 
 2. While IBM Installation Manager is being used to install another product or fix pack such as Websphere Application Server fix packs (such as SCA feature pack)


CAUSE
This issue has been recognized as an issue in Eclipse platform. 


The following bug reports are already opened in Eclipse Bugzilla responsible for the hang issue:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=305991 [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=305991]
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36806 [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36806] 

This situation is caused by the fact that Eclipse requires confirmations from X (Reflection X is being used while interacting with AIX system) very often that particular operation succeeded, which as such freezes the UI execution until the confirmation is received.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue has been resolved in Installation Manager version 1.4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3352&uid=swg24026183]. 


Upgrading to 1.4 will resolve this issue and allow the installation to complete as expected.
