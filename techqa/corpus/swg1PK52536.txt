PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary: Paging navigation links affect other rendering
   portlets when links are broadcast.
   
   Detailed Problem Description:
   
   Recreation Scenario:
   1.  Create a site area with several content items (enough to
   ensure that paging will be necessary when rendered in a menu)
   2.  Set up a menu with a paging component configured to list the
   content items in the site area.  Configure the paging parameters
   to ensure there are multiple pages of menu results.  Set up the
   menu to render links to the content items (See InfoCenter for
   examples of menu and paging configuration and markup).
   3.  Set up a page with two local rendering portlets
   4.  Set the first local rendering portlet to render the menu and
   to broadcast links to this page, receive links from none.
   5.  Set the second rendering portlet to render a content item by
   default and to broadcast links to none and to recieve links from
   other portlets and this portlet.
   
   Clicking on a content item in the menu in the first rendering
   portlet correctly causes the content item to be displayed in the
   second rendering portlet.  However, clicking on a paging link
   affects both rendering portlets when it should only affect the
   rendering portlet showing the menu.  The second rendering
   portlet showing the content items should not change when you
   click on a paging link in the first rendering portlet.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Analysis:
   
   The second rendering portlet was receiving the broadcast for the
   paging component links and processing it like regular links from
   the menu.
   
   Failing Module: WCM - Web Content Management (General)
   
   Problem Solution:
   
   Change the local rendering portlet to ignore links for paging
   components that are broadcast from other portlets.
