VTAM multinode persistent sessions (MNPS) support provides a means by which sessions running on a failing VTAM node can be recovered on another VTAM node.

# MNPS-capable applications The number of MNPS-capable applications in the sysplex using the RAPI interface or APPCCMD interface



# MNPS-capable applications using APPCCMD The number of MNPS-capable applications in the sysplex using the APPCCMD interface



# RAPI sessions The number of MNPS sessions using the RAPI interface



# APPCCMD sessions The number of MNPS sessions using the APPCCMD interface



Avg # APPCCMD session partners The average number of session partners, per MNPS application, for sessions using the APPCCMD interface



Avg # COS entries The average number of different class-of-service (COS) entries used by each MNPS application program application



# HPR endpoint nodes The number of nodes in the network that can be the endpoint of HPR connections involving MNPS applications



NLP average size The average outbound NLP size. This can be calculated using the VTAM Tuning Statistics function. The display for Tuning Statistics shows the number of bytes sent for each WRITE subchannel. The values are displayed in the BYTECTO and BYTECT fields. The number of bytes for each subchannel is: 9999999999 * BYTECTO + BYTECT. Sum this value over all the Write subchannels, and divide by the number of Outbound PDUs (displayed as OPDU in the Tuning Statistics display).



Rate of outbound NLPs The aggregate outbound NLP rate (that is, the average number of NLPs sent per second) across all write subchannels carrying MNPS data traffic. This can be calculated using the VTAM Tuning Statistics function. For each write subchannel, the display for Tuning Statistics shows the number of Outbound PDUs (displayed in the OPDU field). Sum this value across all the write subchannels, and divide that number by the Tuning Statistics interval in seconds.



Average NLP round trip time The average amount of time NLPs stay in the system. Three seconds is considered an average value for the NLP round trip time. Round-trip delay can be returned using the performance monitor application (PMI), in the RTP data vector.
