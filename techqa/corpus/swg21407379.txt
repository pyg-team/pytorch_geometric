PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When scheduled from BW, Information Server Pack for SAP BW Load job fails with PULL Job Test Failure (255) 

SYMPTOM
When executing a DataStage BW Load PULL job from BW the following error message occurs :
'/opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSEngine/bin/dsjob -domain 

server_name:9080 -user user_name -password ***** -server 
<server_name>.COM -run -jobstatus -wait Dev Test ' 

DataStage job failed: Status code = 255 
BW Load: PULL Job Test Failure (255) 


CAUSE
When a BW Load job request is made from BW the RFC daemon executes the dsjob command and receives the DataStage user name and password from SourceSystems.config file located in 

/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSBWConnections/<BW_ConnectionName>/SourceSystems directory.
When the password changes for the dsjob command at OS level then the BW PULL job will fail.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the SourceSystems.config file by changing the password from the DataStage Administrator for SAP client menu to match a new password.
