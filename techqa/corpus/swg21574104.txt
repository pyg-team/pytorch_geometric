QUESTION
 Provide some guidelines on the number of robotic scripts that can be deployed and run on the same Robotic Response Time (RRT / T6) agent? 

ANSWER
ITCAM for Transactions documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5MD2_7.4.0/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/User_Guide/Robot/rt_robotdeploy.html] contains the following information: 

A typical deployment is 10 to 20 robotic agents running 10 to 100 robotic scripts every 10 to 15 minutes.

Scalability recommendations: 


 * Rational Robot GUI, RPT running Citrix scripts: 10 scripts per agent every 10 minutes
   
 * CLI, Rational Robot VU, LoadRunner: 50 scripts per agent every 10 minutes 


It is possible to have higher numbers of Rational Performance Tester (RPT) HTTP test scripts. However, it is not possible to give precise scalability recommendations as the numbers depend not only on the resources of the playback machine, but also the complexity of the RPT recordings. 

In tests on high specification hardware, it is possible to run 300 scripts every 15 minutes but these are very simple http scripts each containing 3 pages with approximately 10 elements per page. 

Although the documentation does not mention Rational Functional Tester (RFT) specifically for scalability, RFT numbers are similar to those mentioned for Rational Robot GUI test scripts. 

Determining how many scripts can run is ultimately a "try it and see" process.
