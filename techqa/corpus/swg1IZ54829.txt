ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPC Explorer fails to validate elements that are set to nil
   .
   "If a message contains elements which are nillable, such a
   message may contain elements that are set to nil. If such a
   message is displayed, the BPC Explorer will render an empty
   input field which is ok. But if the form is submitted, the BPC
   Explorer still tries to validate the field although, it should
   just keep the nil value in case that the user did not enter any
   literal in the field. The fix will make sure that the field is
   not validated if the user did not enter any value.
