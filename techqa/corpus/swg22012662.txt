Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM® SDK for Node.js™  in IBM Cloud (CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3737,  CVE-2017-3738) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on November 2, 2017 and December 7, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM SDK for Node.js. IBM SDK for Node.js has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

CVEID:CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the \"error state\" mechanism when directly calling SSL_read() or SSL_write() for an SSL object after receiving a fatal error. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the decryption or encryption process and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077]for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078]for more information

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.6.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v6.12.0.0 and earlier releases.
These vulnerabilities affect IBM SDK for Node.js v8.9.0.0 and earlier releases.

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf ssh <appname> -c cat staging_info.yml

Look for the following lines:
{"detected_buildpack":"SDK for Node.js(TM) (ibm-node.js-xxx, buildpack-v3.xxx)","start_command":"./vendor/initial_startup.rb"}

If the Node.js engine version is not at least v4.8.7 or v6.12.2 or v8.9.3 your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v4.8.7.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v6.12.2.0 and subsequent releases.
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v8.9.3.0 and subsequent releases.

To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=4.8.7"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=6.12.2"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=8.9.3"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application using the IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack v3.17. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None.
