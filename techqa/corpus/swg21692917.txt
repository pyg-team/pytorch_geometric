Title: IBM SiteProtector Event Collector manual debug logs - United States

Text:
EC; SP; log; trace TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you manually generate debug logs for SiteProtector's Event Collector component? 

CAUSE
The Event Collector component of SiteProtector is used to collect events from the Agent Manager for newer sensors and from older sensors directly. Once it has collected events from these sources, it sends them to the SiteProtector Database for storage. If an issue with the Event Collector is suspected and the Event Collector is not communicating with SiteProtector, IBM Support might request the logs that are generated by the instructions in this Technote.

Important: If the Event Collector is successfully communicating with SiteProtector, these instructions should not be used. Instead, users should follow the steps in Technote 1697782: SiteProtector Event Collector debug logs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697782].


ANSWER
Follow these instructions to generate and collect the logs: 

 1.  Open Windows Services on the Event Collector server and stop the issDaemon service.
     
 2.  Navigate to the \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector directory and open the current.policy file in a text editor such as Notepad.
     
 3.  Locate the following line and change it from:
     
     EmTraceLevel =L 1;
     
     to:
     
     EmTraceLevel =L 5;
     
 4.  Save and close the file.
     
 5.  Start the issDaemon service.
     
 6.  Replicate the issue that we are troubleshooting or wait at least 10 minutes.
     
 7.  Stop the issDaemon service.
     
 8.  Add the following directory to a compressed file:
     
     \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector\Logs\
     
 9.  Revert the changes made to the current.policy file in Steps 2 - 4 to disable debug logging.
     
     Important: If you skip this step, the log files can grow to a very large size and cause disk space issues on the server.
     
 10. Start the issDaemon service.
     
 11. Send the compressed file containing the logs to Support by using Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep) [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/index.html].
