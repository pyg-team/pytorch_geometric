APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DirectSQL() function caches DataSource configuration & does
   not recognise edits unless the ImpactServer is restarted.
   
   
   Steps to replicate:
   1. Start two ObjectServers.
   2. Create a DataSource to connect to ObjServ1.
   3. Creat a Policy with DirectSQL() function running SQL to
   created DataSource.
   
   4. Run Policy.
   5. Edit DataSource to connect to ObjServ2.
   6. ReRun Policy.
   7. Policy continues to access ObjServ1.
   
   8. Restart ImpactServer.
   9. ReReRun Policy.
   10. Policy now accesses ObjServ2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Bounce the ImpactServer to read in DataSource edits to the
   DirectSQL() function cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DIRECTSQL() FUNCTION CACHES DATASOURCE CONFIGURATION & DOES
   NOT RECOGNISE EDITS UNLESS THE IMPACT SERVER IS RESTARTED.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If user changes the Datasource configuration, ie port, or
   hostname, Impact doesn't recognize the changes until the server
   is restarted. It causes that Impact connects to the to the old
   information and causes failure
