 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document contains the step-by-step instructions to configure single sign-on (SSO) for IBM FileNet Collaboration Services and IBM Lotus Quickr connectors by using Tivoli Access Manager and WebSEAL. 

CONTENT
To configure single sign-on integration between Tivoli Access Manager for e-business and IBM FileNet Collaboration Services: 

 1. Complete the pre-deployment tasks. 
 2. Configure and deploy IBM FileNet Collaboration Services with Tivoli Access Manager and WebSEAL. 
 3. Verify the deployment of IBM FileNet Collaboration Services with Tivoli Access Manager and WebSEAL. 
 4. Configure IBM FileNet Collaboration Services and Lotus Quickr connectors with Tivoli Access Manager and WebSEAL or configure single sign-on for IBM Connections.


Completing the pre-deployment tasks 


1. Install and configure Tivoli Access Manager for e-business by using the IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business V6.1 Installation Guide. See IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business Version 6.1.1 Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v2r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.itame.doc_6.1.1%2Fwelcome.htm] for more information.


You must install the three components of Tivoli Access Manager: 

 * Policy Server 
 * WebSEAL 
 * Authorization Server


2. Install and configure IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE) and IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine (AE). See Product Documentation for FileNet P8 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3247&uid=swg27010422] for more information. 
You should configure the LTPA SSO on the WebSphere Application Server on which Application Engine and Content Engine applications are installed. To synchronize the keys, you should export the key from the instance of WebSphere Application Server that is running Content Engine and import it into the instance of WebSphere Application Server that is running Application Engine. 


3. Configure Application Engine with Tivoli Access Manager for e-business integration by following the steps in chapter 4, "Single sign-on using Tivoli Access Manager for e-business" of the Single Sign-On Solutions for IBM FileNet P8 [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247675.pdf] redbook. [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247675.pdf]


Configuring and deploying IBM FileNet Collaboration Services with Tivoli Access Manager 


You must first configure and deploy IBM FileNet Collaboration Services and then verify the deployment with Tivoli Access Manager.


To configure and deploy: 

1. Install IBM FileNet Collaboration Services [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.installingp8qkr.doc/p8qin000.htm]. 

2. Configure IBM FileNet Collaboration Services. See Creating and deploying the application [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.installingp8qkr.doc/p8qdc010.htm]”in the information center. 

When configuring IBM FileNet Collaboration Services, the Application Engine URI addressing format must be configured as in the following URI example:

http:// <TAM Server>/Workplace

3. Verify the deployment of IBM FileNet Services for Quickr [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.installingp8qkr.doc/p8qdc040.htm].

4. Create a junction to IBM FileNet Services for Quickr by using the server task sub command on top of the pdadmin command in the Tivoli Access Manager WebSEAL server:

server task default-webseald-<TAM Server> create -t tcp -h FileNet_Services_for_Lotus_Quickr Server -p <port_no> -i -b ignore -j -J trailer -f -A -F <LTPA Key> -Z <LTPA Key password> /<junction_name>

For example:
server task default-webseald-abc.net.com create -t tcp -h xyz.net.com -p 9080 -i -b ignore -j -J trailer -f -A -F C:\xyz.key -Z passw0rd /p8 

The junction name in the example above is p8.

Tip: For more information on the syntax and the options for creating the junction, see Creating a junction point (server task create) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v2r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.itame.doc_6.0/rev/am60_webseal_admin344.htm].

5. Restart the WebSphere Application server where IBM FileNet Collaboration Services is installed and the WebSEAL server instance. 



Verifying deployment of IBM FileNet Collaboration Services with Tivoli Access Manager 

To verify the deployment: 
 1. Access the following links within a web browser to verify if Tivoli Access Manager is successfully configured on IBM FileNet Collaboration Services:


http:// <TAM Server> /<junction_name>/dm 
http:// <TAM Server> /<junction_name>/dm/atom/libraries/feed 

where "dm" is the IBM FileNet Collaboration Services context root. 
You must provide the Tivoli Access Manager credentials for accessing both the above links. 

Configuring IBM FileNet Collaboration Services and Lotus Quickr connectors with Tivoli Access Manager


See the following instructions for Lotus Quickr connectors only. If you have IBM Connections as client, skip to the next section, Configuring single sign-on for IBM Connections.


To configure single sign-on for Lotus Quickr connectors:


1. Install IBM Lotus Quickr connectors and configure the connectors according to the instructions in Installing connectors for your users [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_and_upgrading_qc85]in the Lotus Quickr product documentation [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=Product%20Documentation]. 

2 . Configure Lotus Quickr connectors with Tivoli Access Manager [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Configure_TAM_and_WebSEAL_with_Lotus_Quickr_qp85].

Note: If you do not complete Step 5 and Step 6 successfully when configuring Lotus Quickr connectors [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Configure_TAM_and_WebSEAL_with_Lotus_Quickr_qp85], you receive an error message (302) when you add a team place by using the Tivoli Access Manager WebSEAL server.

See Configuring single Sign-on for Lotus Quickr 8.5 for WebSphere Portal [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lqwiki.nsf/dx/Configure_Single_SignOn_for_ECM_Services_qp85] for more information. 


Configuring single sign-on with Tivoli Access Manager for IBM Connections 

IBM Connections uses single sign-on (SSO) to secure the transfer of user ID and password information that is used to authenticate with the system. With SSO, users can switch to different applications without needing to authenticate again. 

SSO is automatically enabled when IBM Connections is installed on a single WebSphere® Application Server profile or when different profiles are federated into the same cell. 

To configure single sign-on for IBM Connections:

1. Install IBM Connections. [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/lcwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_ic40]

2. Enable SSO for Tivoli Access Manager [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/lcwiki.nsf/dx/Enabling_single_signon_for_Tivoli_Access_Manager_ic40].

See Configuring single sign-on [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/lcwiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_single_signon_ic40] for more information.
