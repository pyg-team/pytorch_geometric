ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I found a possible bug in the NT porting of pdadmin tool shipped
   with PD 3.7.1 since it hangs when massively loading ACLs from
   an external file of commands.
   The test I did involved a sample of about 3000 ACLs creation
   commands written in a text file (acl2create.txt) that I submitte
   to the pdadmin tool issuing the command:
   pdadmin -a sec_master -p mypassword acl2create.txt
   This worked fine on a Solaris box (for 2 times|) while on an NT
   box it hanged several times and I had to reissue the batch load
   for the missing ACLs. I did the same test on another NT machine
   with a fresh PD installation to be sure that there wasn't a
   configuration problem, and I got the same errors, even if for ot
   ACLs.
   I tried to increase also the maximum wait time of event
   notification (notifier-wait-time=120 and more...) but the proble
   still persist. Then I tied to get the same result by the mean of
   of the ivadmin tool, simply issuing the command for each ACL;
   this time I could successfully load the 99% of the ACLs against
   10% for each invocation of the pdadmin tool, but there was alway
   1% of ACLs creation missing with those error messages:
   Could not perform the administration request.
   Error: Fault address error (status 0x16c9a
   Surely the last one is a better result, but it's still insuffici
   production environment, where must be scheduled overnight the
   creation/modification of about 30000 ACLs.
   I need a fix or an official workaround at least for one of those
   problems.
