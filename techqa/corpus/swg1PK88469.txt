   Performance issues are handled in a different APAR
   
   Description of problem:
   
   The customer is having performance
   delay when opening Requisite Pro Project within RSA Requirements
   Perspective takes more than 20 minutes.
   
   When opening a Requisite Pro Project from Networkdrive.
   In some cases the opening of the Project fails with a error
   message saying 'a error occurred' in some cases it takes up to
   30 Minutes to open it. The project has dependencies to dB2.
   
   This seems to happen to one particular project.
   
   After doing some db2 tuning, the time to open the requisitePro
   project seems to have improved
   
   Our DB2 performance tuning efforts improved the situation
   significantly.
