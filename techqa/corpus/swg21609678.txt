Title: IBM Multiple kuxagent processes on an AIX box - United States

Text:
ITM_UNIX_OS_AGENT 5724C040U TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are multiple kuxagent processes seen on an AIX LPAR? 

CAUSE
If the AIX LPAR has multiple WPARs and each WPAR is running IBM Tivoli Monitoring Unix (UX) agent process they all show up as kuxagent processes on the LPAR. Hence, multiple kuxagent processes are seen on a single LPAR.

ANSWER
Do not install the ITM UX agent on a WPAR as a stand-alone machine. Run ITM UX agent (6.23 FP01 or above) on the LPAR to collect WPAR metrics (for all WPARs under the individual LPAR). 

NOTE: ITM UX OS Agent can be installed on WPAR starting from 6.23 but it can be used just for Remote Deployment of other agents, WPAR can't be used to collect metrics as a stand-alone AIX machine. Each LPARs can run ITM UX agent as stand-alone machines.
