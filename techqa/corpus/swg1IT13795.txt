APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user observed problems with DataPower WebService Proxy
   having MQ Front side Handler. In certain scenarios, the logs
   showed request matching attempts to an unrelated WSP MQ FSH in
   another application domain. In some situations, the match to
   the actual target WSP (or any other WSP) even failed, due to
   missed match criteria.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  MQ Web Service Proxy requests result in a Port value of 0. If
   all other unique identifiers such as URL IP and Operation are
   the same the request may go to the first compiled WSDL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.13, 7.1.0.10, 7.2.0.6 and 7.5.0.2

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Create another unique identifier if using MQ for a Front Side
   Handler on a Web Service Proxy
