ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer upgraded from 2.7.1 to 3.2.1 and with the removal of
   the Active Check Interval they are finding that their system
   does not timeout correctly.
   
   What is really occurring is that at the time the system should
   timeout and require them to login they are being sent back to
   their homepage and no login is required.
   It seems that their SSO is automatically authenticating them.
   They are using Apache 2.2 with JBoss 5.10 GA.  Authentication
   is through Active Directory
   
   Working with the customer I confirmed jboss timeout set to 5
   minutes and Portal section refresh is not set.
   With this test after an appropriate amount of time has passed
   for it to timeout the following behavior was observerd.
   
   What is expected here is to get an error message or prompted
   for a login.
   
   We confirmed this on a subsequent test with a record open. If
   you try to change tabs within the record it returns them to the
   home portal within the record.
   But after that all features will work without having to log
   back in.
   
   Kenny To was able to reproduce in QA with the following results
   
   I'm able to reproduce the issue from the record. If you have a
   record opened, wait for the session to timeout, then click on a
   different tab within the record, you will be kicked to the
   homepage without any prompts. That's one of the security holes.
   The other security hole that I found was the scenario with
   opening a record from a master detail query; without being
   prompted, the record will open.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Two new properties have been added that will control a
   warning to the user before their session times out.  If a user
   is still away while the session expires, when they click ok on
   the alert, they will be taken to the unauthorized page.  NOTE:
   if they click back on the sign-on link, with Single Sign On,
   they will be taken back to the portal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added an alert before the session is to expire. If session
   expires, user is redirected to unauthorized/need sign in page.
