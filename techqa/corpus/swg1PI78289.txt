APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Editing rows on the grid view will not validate mandatory fields
   that are already empty and not changed.
   If the field already has a value, and the user deletes the
   value, then the validation succeeds.
   
   
   Prerequisites:
   
   OpenPages installed
   
   Set up profile/field
   1.	Log into the OpenPages UI as OpenPagesAdministrator
   2.	Navigate to Administration -> Profiles
   3.	Click on OpenPages Platform 2
   4.	Scroll down to Associated Users and associate
   OpenPagesAdministrator to this profile, if not already
   5.	Under Object Types, click on SOXBusEntity
   6.	Across from Object Fields, click on Include
   7.	Tick the checkbox next to Comment and click Include
   8.	Under Object Fields, click on Comment
   9.	Click on the Edit button, tick Required, and click Save
   10.	On the cookie trail, click on SOXBusEntity to go back to the
   object details
   11.	Under Navigational Views, click on Add New
   12.	Give the view a name of BEGrid, click next, next and next
   again
   13.	Click on Choose Fields
   14.	Tick Description and Comment, then click Apply, then Finish
   
   Create test data
   1.	On the top right, click on Add New and select Business Entity
   2.	Enter Ent01 as the name, then click Save
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   1.	Log into the OpenPages UI as OpenPagesAdministrator
   2.	Navigate to Organization -> Business Entities
   3.	Change the View to BEGrid
   4.	In the quick filter, enter % and press enter
   5.	Doubleclick on the row for Ent01 to enter edit mode
   6.	Enter a value for Description but leave the mandatory Comment
   field empty, then press Enter. Note that this allows you to save
   the record and ignores the mandatory field.
   7.	Doubleclick on the same row again to enter edit mode, enter a
   value for Comment, then press enter to save.
   8.	Doubleclick on the same row again to enter edit mode, empty
   the Comment field, then attempt to save again. This time the
   field is validated.
   
   
   Expected Results:
   
   The grid view should validate all fields to see if they are
   mandatory, even if no change is made to them.
   
   Actual Results:
   
   The grid view does not validate fields that have not been
   changed, even if they are mandatory.
   
   Error Message:
   
   None

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem: Rows containing fields that are set as required in the
   profile may be saved, even if the required fields are empty.
   
   Cause: Fields that are required in the Field Group are validated
   by the platform.  However, fields that are required in the
   profile are only validated on the client.  (This is true of the
   Detail page as well).  For the grid view, fields were only being
   validated if they changed.  In this case, the value did not
   change but was still invalid because it was a field that was
   added after the object was created.  This problem would also
   occur if a field became required after the object already
   existed.
   
   Solution:
   Always validate the required fields even if they have not
   changed.
