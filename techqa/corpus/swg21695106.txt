Title: IBM Guardium STAP for DB2 on z/OS receiving ADHQ1071E - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Guardium STAP for DB2 on z/OS can fail with a ADHQ1071E abend 

SYMPTOM
When starting the Guardium STAP for DB2 on z/OS, it can crash with the following error in the STAP joblog: 

ADHQ1071E Terminating due to missing XML profile at start up 


CAUSE
The Guardium S-TAP for DB2 on z/OS requires a valid and relevant DB2 Collection Profile rule be available in the currently installed Policy on the Guardium Collector Appliance


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, check the currently installed policy on the Guardium Collector Appliance to verify it contains a DB2 Collection Profile rule. If that rule has "Svc. Name" specified, then it must contain the DB2 SSID of the DB2 subsystem this S-TAP will be monitoring. 

Reinstall the policy with the overwrite option to ensure it is the currently active policy.
