APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a badly formatted or out of range value was passed as a
   property value via CEWS, the CE server validation code was
   discarding such values instead of throwing an exception.  The
   result was null values being saved to the repository for those
   properties.
   
   For example, if a caller tried to update an integer property
   value with "555555555555" (555.5 billion), no exception was
   thrown and the persisted value was null.
   
   This situation was only possible via a custom application making
   direct calls to CEWS.  The CE .NET API, CE Java API, and CE
   server do not produce these types of illegal values when sending
   data over the network.  Most Web services toolkits for client
   use also have safeguards against this.

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Customers with applications that directly call CEWS should   *
   * do testing to see if their Web services toolkit prevents     *
   * such values from being sent from to the CE server.  If not,  *
   * of if there is any doubt, it is recommended to update to     *
   * P8CE-4.0.1-012 or later.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CE server code now throws an exception for this condition
   instead of silently discarding the values.  The change is
   included in P8CE-4.0.1-012.
