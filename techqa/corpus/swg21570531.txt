Text:
Rulerunner TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error starting client service in Taskmaster Client Service Manager - Cannot start service DCTMSub on computer 

CAUSE
This error message is commonly displayed if the account running the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service on the Rulerunner has insufficient permissions to the local machine, or if the service is disabled.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open the Services control panel from Administrative Tools:


1. If the service's start up mode is disabled, then change it to be automatic or manual. 

2. Set the service account to a local administrator account that has sufficient permissions to network resources such as the batches directory and application rules files. 

Note: Test after making required changes. If the problem persists, consider performing a repair or reinstall of the Taskmaster software using a local admin account.
