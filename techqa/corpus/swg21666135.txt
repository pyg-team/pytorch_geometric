 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a hang, crash, or out-of-memory problem in IBM Business Process Manager. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the BPM Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Gathering this information before calling IBM support helps in understanding the problem and saves time when analyzing the data. You can use ISA Lite [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24020510] to automate this process.



IBM SUPPORT ASSISTANT
Automated data collectors are available in IBM Support Assistant to improve the accuracy of complete data collection. You can use ISA Lite to automate the gathering of the required log files. 

Note: When you use ISA Lite, also gather a detailed problem description, environment description, and other requested materials.

Tuning guidance:
Issues often times end up having solutions in Tuning and Performance. Check that your environment is properly tuned and best practices are followed. Note: IBM Support cannot provide assistance with tuning. Refer to the following Guide specific to your version of the product: 

IBM Business Process Manager 7.5 Performance Tuning & Best Practices [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4784.html?Open] 

IBM Business Process Manager 8.0 Performance Tuning & Best Practices [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4935.pdf]


Review the Java Diagnostic Guide [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/diagnosis/] as an additional resource for memory tuning. This information is also linked in each of the above guides. 

Review the Collecting troubleshooting data for performance issues [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21611603] document for additional information about Performance.


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

What is the difference between the different problem types? 

 * Crash The process for the server exits abruptly. A Javacore or other dump file might be generated. 
 * Hang The process for the server continues to run, but is unresponsive, or does not process new work. The system.out log file might have messages detecting a thread as hung. This process might or might not also exhibit High CPU usage. 
 * Out of Memory An "Out Of Memory" error message is found in the logs or Javacore file.


What is the difference between this document and the IBM Business Process Manager document Collecting troubleshooting data for performance issues [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21611603] ? 
This document captures the diagnostic steps for abrupt system failures and outages. Performance focuses on scenarios where the system is typically working, however fails under large or specific load. Performance might also be related to response time goals or resource (CPU/memory) usage goals for a particular scenario or workload. 

How can I perform analysis of the data? 
The How do I... (Troubleshooting) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/howdoi/index.html] Java™-related guided documentation is available to assist with troubleshooting. 

There are various presentations for WebSphere Application Server, which are available through the WebSphere Technical Exchange, that cover diagnostic and analysis techniques.
