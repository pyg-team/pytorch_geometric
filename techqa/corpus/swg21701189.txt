Title: IBM ITCAM SOA agent (d4) support of TLS - United States

Text:
soa data power DP D4 agent CAMD4ALL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The SOA D4 Agent was configured for the WebSphere Data Power appliance, which initially used SSLv3. Communication to the Data Power Appliance was changed to TLS, but the SOA agent still attempts to connect using SSL. 

SYMPTOM
The startDC.sh/startDC.bat passes the following Java Parameter during the startup of the SOA DC, 


"-Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=com.ibm.net.ssl.www.protocol"

This parameter is what causes the SSL communication via the version of JAVA the customer uses when running the startup script.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Determine your JAVA version prior to running the startDC.sh/startDC.bat script by running 'java -version'. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
APAR IV66110 (updated with IV68808) implement the POODLE 
(CVE-2014-3566) fix which uses a default TLS rather than SSLv3 protocol.

If you are using a jre not containing IV66110 please see the following
