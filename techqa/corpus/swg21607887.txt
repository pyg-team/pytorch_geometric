 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Instructions on clearing the java class caches in IBM WebSphere Application Server. Both the JVM's shared class cache and WebSphere Application Server's OSGi class cache. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Support may ask you to clear the class cache. There are several reasons for this. After an upgrade, it is possible that the class cache's are still holding onto previous versions of classes. It is also possible that the caches became corrupted.
