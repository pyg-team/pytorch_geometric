APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CVEID: CVE-2016-9693
   DESCRIPTION: IBM Business Process Manager has a file download
   capability that is vulnerable to a set of attacks. Ultimately,
   an attacker can cause an unauthenticated victim to download a
   malicious payload. An existing file type restriction can be
   bypassed so that the payload might be considered executable and
   cause damage on the victim's machine.
   CVSS Base Score: 7.1
   CVSS Temporal Score: See
   https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119517 for
   the current score
   CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
   CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Because of how the "download in CSV (comma separated values)
   format" function in IBM BPM was implemented, a browser sends all
   data to the server and expects the same data back as a
   downloadable stream. The server-side URL is vulnerable because
   of
   
   - insufficient authorization (available for anonymous users)
   - insufficient file extension checking (possibility to bypass
    the .csv file extension restriction)
   - accepting GET requests that can easily be sent to victims in a
    chat or email
   
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for the latest fix pack of all supported IBM
   BPM releases: 7.5.1.2, 8.0.1.3, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.5.0, 8.5.6.0 CF02,
   and 8.5.7.0 CF 2016.12. The fix will also be included in IBM BPM
   8.5.7.0 CF 2017.03.
   
   This fix by default completely disables the vulnerable URL and
   updates all IBM BPM product components that cause requests to
   this URL to use the client-side JavaScript instead.
