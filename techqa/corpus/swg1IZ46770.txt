APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps To Reproduce
   First you will need to expose the glaccount attribute from the
   LaborCraftRate object in the Labor application in the Craft tab
   details section.
   Then bring up Liberi labor record and populate that newly
   exposed gl account field and save the record.
   Go to Labor reporting application
   Click new row and enter Liberi in the labor field and make sure
   the craft field also gets populated and you will notice that the
   gl debit account field should auto populate with the labor gl
   account from previous step.
   At this time the location field should be blank.
   Populate the location field and at this the time the gl debit
   account field will be over written with the location gl account
   and that is the bug the labor gl account should not get over
   written with the location gl account.
