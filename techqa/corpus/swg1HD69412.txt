ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT column does not get reset to 0 after a
   successful login
   Detailed scenario:
   - Log in to System Configuration Editor as joe
   - Browse to Miscellaneous Configuration > UserAccount
   Management Preferences
   Select Account Lockout Threshold
   - Create a Domain level override for
   UserAccountManagement.AccountLockoutThreshold
   and set the value to 3
   - If you look in the database, the
   INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT column and the
   USER_LOCKED column in the USERS table for
   bob are both set to 0
   Login to SMARTEAM - Editor with the bob account,
   but enter an incorrect password
   - The standard Incorrect user or password
   message will appear:
   Error No: 00256
   Illegal Login 'bob'. Access has been denied.
   Reason:
   Incorrect user or password.
   - If you look in the database the
   INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT
   column in the USERS table for bob is now set to 2
   Click OK on the error and then log in again with
   the bob acount and again enter an incorrect password
   - Again the standard Incorrect user or password
   message will appear
   - If you look in the database the INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT
   column in the USERS table for bob is now set to 3
   - Click OK on the error and then log in again with
   the bob acount but this time enter the correct password
   - You now should be logged into SMARTEAM - Editor with bob
   - Exit SMARTEAM - Editor
   If you look in the database the INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT
   column in the USERS table for bob is still set to 3
   - Login to SMARTEAM - Editor again with the bob account, but
   again enter an incorrect password
   - Again the standard Incorrect user or password message will
   appear
   - If you look in the database the INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT
   column in the USERS table for bob is now set to 0
   and the USER_LOCKED column for bob is set to 1
   - Click OK on the error and then log in again with
   the bob acount but this time enter the correct password
   - You will receive the error message that states
   that bob is locked out
   Error No: 00256
   Illegal Login 'bob'. Access has been denied.
   Reason: User is locked. Too many logon attempts.
   I feel that the INCORRECT_LOGIN_COUNT column
   should be reset to 0 once the User logs in successfully to
   SMARTEAM - Editor.
