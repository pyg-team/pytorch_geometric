ABSTRACT
 The End of Support (EOS) date for IBM SDK for z/OS Javaâ„¢ 2 Technology Edition V1.4 (5655-I56) was 30 September, 2011. IBM will continue to support clients with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.1 running CICS applications using Java V1.4.2 on z/OS V1.11 until 30 September 2013 with the caveats outlined in this document. 

CONTENT
The Software service discontinuance announcement letter that says IBM SDK for z/OS Java 2 Technology Edition V1.4 (5655-I56) was withdrawn from support 30 September 2011 is 909-187 [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&appname=Demonstration&htmlfid=897/ENUS909-187].

IBM will continue to support clients with CICS TS V3.1 running CICS applications using Java V1.4.2 on z/OS V1.11 until the end of September 2013. But, you should be aware of the caveats: 

 * z/OS V1.11 is the last release for which SDK1.4 (5655-I56) support is planned. See IBM SDK for z/OS Java 2 Technology Edition V1.4 [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/tools/java/products/j142pcont.html] for details.
   
   
 * z/OS V1.11 went end of support (EOS) in September 2012. See the Support Lifecycle page for z/OS [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/index_z.html] for details. Clients who want to maintain a fully-supported environment with CICS TS V3.1, Java V1.4.2, and z/OS V1.11 will need to negotiate an extended support contract for z/OS V1.11 after this time.


If you are running CICS TS V3.1 with Java applications, IBM encourages you to upgrade to a more recent release of CICS TS in order to take advantage of the various enhancements that CICS and Java technologies can offer in more recent releases. 

CICS TS V4.2 contains a range of enhancements to benefit both leading edge clients and those who are conservative with new technology adoption. This includes capability delivered in areas such as Events, Java, Management, Connectivity, and Scalability, ensuring that you can extend existing applications, easily deploy new workloads within CICS, and manage your infrastructure more productively. 

These capabilities build on the Business Flexibility, Governance, and IT Simplification themes delivered in CICS TS V4.1, providing Systems Programmers, Application Developers, and IT Architects more reasons than ever to continue to use CICS TS as their transaction processor of choice on System z, with wide scope for growth through emerging technologies. 

For more information about the latest CICS TS enhancements see the CICS Transaction Servers family page [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/tserver/].
