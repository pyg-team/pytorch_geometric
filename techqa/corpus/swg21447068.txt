ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Application Server 7



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Ensure the classloading policy for the RES application has been set to parent LAST 
 2. Stop the RES Console application 
 3. Stop the server on which RES is installed 
 4. Delete the folder ILOG_Rule_Execution_Server under the temp directory, for example, <WASProfile>/temp/<nodeName>/<serverName>/ILOG_Rule_Execution_Server 
 5. Restart the server and application. 
    

Note that deleting the temp directory is a critical step.
