 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities have been identified in the GNU C Library (glibc) packages for the standard C and the standard math libraries on Linux systems, that affect IBM SmartCloud Provisioning 2.1 for Software Virtual Appliance (CVE-2014-5119, CVE-2014-0475). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-5119 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5119]
DESCRIPTION: The GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, which is caused by an off-by-one error in the __gconv_translit_find() function. By setting the CHARSET environment variable to a malicious value, a local attacker might exploit this vulnerability to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95044 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95044] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0475 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0475]
DESCRIPTION: A directory traversal flaw was found in the way glibc loaded locale files. An attacker able to make an application use a specially crafted locale name value (for example, specified in an LC_* environment variable) might possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that application. 
CVSS Base Score: 6.8 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94452 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94452] for more information
