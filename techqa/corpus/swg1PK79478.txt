APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The LTPA Timeout and Authentication Cache descriptions are
   misleading and incorrect on multiple pages in the
   Version 6.0, 6.1 and 7.0 Information Centers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects all users of WebSphere    *
   *                  Application Server who are setting up the   *
   *                  authentication mechanism that will be used  *
   *                  to exchange information between servers.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The "Authentication cache timeout" and  *
   *                      "Timeout value for forwarded            *
   *                      credentials between servers" fields,    *
   *                      which are set on the Authentication     *
   *                      mechanisms and expiration page of the   *
   *                      administrative console, are             *
   *                      described in the Version 6.0, 6.1,      *
   *                      and 7.0 Information Centers. However,   *
   *                      their descriptions are misleading.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Version 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 Information Centers include the
   "Authentication mechanisms and expiration," "Configuring the
   Lightweight Third Party Authentication mechanism," and
   "Server-level security settings" topics. The first
   two topics contain misleading or incomplete information about
   the "Authentication cache timeout", and "Timeout value for
   forwarded credentials between servers" fields. The third topic
   contains incomplete information about the "Authentication
   cache timeout" field.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following changes will be made to the Version 6.0, 6.1,
   and 7.0 Information Centers for WebSphere Application Server:
   
   The description of the "Authentication cache timeout" and
   "Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers
   fields" in the "Authentication mechanisms and expiration"
   topic will be updated with the following text:
   
   Authentication cache timeout
   
   Specifies the time period during which the authenticated
   credential in the cache is valid. This time period must be
   less than the time period specified for the Timeout value for
   forwarded credentials between servers field.
   
   If the application server infrastructure security is enabled,
   the authentication cache timeout can influence performance.
   The timeout setting specifies how often to refresh the
   security-related caches. Security information pertaining to
   beans, permissions, and credentials is cached. When the cache
   timeout expires, all cached information not accessed within
   the timeout period is purged from the cache. Subsequent
   requests for the information result in a database lookup.
   Sometimes, acquiring the information requires invoking a
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)-bind or native
   authentication. Both invocations are relatively costly
   operations for performance. Determine the best trade off for
   the application, by looking at usage patterns and security
   needs for the site.
   
   There is no relationship between the authentication cache
   timeout value and the orb request timeout value.
   
   In a 20-minute performance test, setting the authentication
   cache timeout so that a timeout does not occur during that 20
   minute period yields a 40% performance improvement.
   Data type  Integer
   Units          Minutes and seconds
   Default  10 minutes
   Range:          Greater than 30 seconds
   
   
   Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers
   
   Specifies the period of time during which the server
   credentials from another server are valid. After this time
   period expires, the server credential from the other server
   must be revalidated.
   
   Specify a value for this field that is greater than the value
   specified for the Authentication cache timeout field.
   Data type  Integer
   Units  Minutes and seconds
   Default  120 minutes
   Range:  An integer between 5 and 35971
   -------------------------
   
   The steps that refer to the "Authentication cache timeout" and
   "Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers
   fields" in the "Configuring the Lightweight Third Party
   Authentication mechanism" topic will be updated with the
   following text:
   
   - Enter a positive integer value in the Authentication cache
   timeout field.
   
   This timeout value determines how long the authenticated
   credential in the cache remains valid.
   
   The optimal value for this field depends on your
   configuration. If you have a small number of users, you should
   specify a value that is higher than the default value. If you
   have a large number of users, you should specify a value that
   is lower than the default value. The value that you specify
   for this field must be less than the value specified for the
   Timeout value for forwarded credentials between servers field.
   
   The default value is 10 minutes.
   
   - Enter a positive integer in the Timeout value for forwarded
   credentials between servers field.
   
   This value refers to how long the server credentials from
   another server are valid before they expire. The default value
   is 120 minutes. The value in the Timeout value for forwarded
   credentials between servers field must be greater than the
   value in the Authentication cache timeout field.
   
   
   The description of the Authentication cache timeout field, in
   the topic "Server-level security settings," will be updated to
   read:
   
   Specifies the time period during which the authenticated
   credential in the cache is valid. This time period must be
   less than the time period specified for the Timeout value for
   forwarded credentials between servers field.
   Data type  Integer
   Units  Minutes and seconds
   Default  10 minutes and 0 seconds
   Range  Greater than 30 seconds. Avoid setting Authentication
   cache timeout value to 30 seconds or less.
   -------------------------
   
   Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the
   current documentation before you read this text. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the February,
   2009 update to the Information Centers.
