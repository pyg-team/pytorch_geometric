 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am working with IBM SPSS Statistics Product and I know that I can buy additional options for the software. Upon licensing I see that these additional options do have different feature codes. Can I get more information about this and the additional options? What procedures are included in which options and where can I find them in the menus? 

ANSWER
When you launch IBM SPSS Statistics and open a new syntax file with -> File -> New -> Syntax you can run the following command:
SHOW LICENSE.

You will then get a table with the name of the additional options you have purchased and licensed with an authorization code. 
If you have licensed all available options this list would look like below:

IBM SPSS Statistics ('Core Base')
IBM SPSS Regression
IBM SPSS Advanced Statistics
IBM SPSS Categories
IBM SPSS Exact Tests
IBM SPSS Missing Values
IBM SPSS Conjoint
IBM SPSS Custom Tables
IBM SPSS Complex Samples
IBM SPSS Decision Trees
IBM SPSS Data Preparation
IBM SPSS Forecasting
IBM SPSS Neural Networks
IBM SPSS Direct Marketing
IBM SPSS Bootstrapping
IBM SPSS Statistics Base ('Extended Base')

Most of all procedures and menus of Statistics are included in the main option. The number before the option name below is the license feature code, for example 00 is the code for the core system and 21 the code for the extended base option with Frequency tables, Crosstabs and so on.


1200 IBM SPSS Statistics 

1221 IBM SPSS Statistics Base 
So if you have not licensed any additional modules the list for SHOW LICENSE is: 

IBM SPSS Statistics 
IBM SPSS Statistics Base 

and you will get the majority of all available features and (statistical) procedures of IBM SPSS Statistics with these two options. 

However, there are additional options which can be licensed with Statistics. Below is a list of the additional module names, their feature codes and what procedures are included in these additional options. The corresponding Syntax command name for the procedure is included in brackets.
