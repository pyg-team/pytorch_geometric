Attempts to create a pivot/report in IBM Rational Portfolio Manager results in OutOfMemoryError in the Tomcat application server, which makes the Tomcat application server crash and generate core files.

CAUSE
When a very large result set is returned by the pivot/report, the Tomcat application server runs out of memory when loading it.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Limit the size of the data returned by the pivot/report by using shorter time intervals or smaller data sets (for example separating the reports by pools or similar).
