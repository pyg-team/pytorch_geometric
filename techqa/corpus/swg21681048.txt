QUESTION
 ITCAM for SOA database appears to be full. Is there a way to prune it ? 

CAUSE
The relationship metrics tables in the SDMS database are updated every five minutes with new data from the ITCAM for SOA agents. As a result, these tables can potentially grow unbounded, which can in turn have an impact on overall database performance and maintenance.

ANSWER
Here is the documentation that describes it in detail.
