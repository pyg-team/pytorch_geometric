APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The MQ V6 information center does not provide sufficient
   information on performing a silent install of the IBM WebSphere
   Eclipse platform supplied with WebSphere MQ.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users who attempt a silent install/uninstall of IBM
   WebSphere Eclipse platform supplied with WebSphere MQ using
   msiexec.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Additional information needs to be added to the information
   center to better document unattended (silent) install and
   uninstall of IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform with command line
   options.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new section titled "Unattended (silent) install and uninstall
   of IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform supplied with WebSphere MQ"
   needs to be added to the WMQ V6 information center under "Quick
   beginnings for windows-->Installing the WebSphere MQ
   server-->Preparing for server installation-->Prerequisite server
   software" with the following text:
   
   About this task
   The WebSphere Eclipse Platform can be installed either from the
   WebSphere MQ installation launchpad or unattended (silently). To
   install from the WebSphere MQ installation launchpad,
   see: Installing and uninstalling IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform.
   
   WebSphere Eclipse Platform is installed using the Microsoft
   Installer (MSI). You can invoke MSI directly, without using the
   WebSphere MQ Installation Launchpad. This means that you can
   install WebSphere Eclipse Platform on a machine without
   interaction. This process is called unattended (or silent)
   installation, and is particularly useful for installing
   WebSphere Eclipse Platform over a network on a remote machine,
   because you can install from a shared drive on a LAN server.
   
   The machine on which you want to install must be able to share
   the WebSphere MQ Server CD, or a copy of the files on it, and
   you must be able to execute a command on that machine.
   
   If you are running WebSphere MQ on Windows Vista or Windows
   Server 2008 with User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you must
   invoke the silent installation from an elevated command prompt.
   Elevate a command prompt by using a right-click to start the
   command prompt and choose Run as administrator. If you try to
   silently install from a non-elevated command prompt, the install
   fails with an error of AMQ4353 in the install log.
   
   To perform a silent install of IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform
   supplied with WebSphere MQ without using the launchpad, you need
   to run msiexec with command line parameters. see: Using command
   line parameters with msiexec
   
   An example of a possible msiexec command for the silent
   installation of the WebSphere Eclipse Platform is:
   msiexec.exe /qn /i "D:\Prereqs\IES\MSI\IBM WebSphere Eclipse
   Platform V3.0.msi" ADDLOCAL="Base" AGREETOLICENSE="yes" /l*v
   c:\log.out
   
   To install the WebSphere Eclipse Platform to a non-default
   directory, use the following parameter:
   TARGETDIR="<dir>"
   where <dir> is the name of the non-default directory where you
   need to install the WebSphere Eclipse Platform.
   
   For further information on using the msiexec command for
   unattended installation, please see: Installing using msiexec
   
   WebSphere Eclipse Platform can be uninstalled using Add/Remove
   Programs or Programs and Features.
   
   An example of a possible msiexec command for the silent
   uninstallation of the WebSphere Eclipse Platform Version 3.0 is:
   
   msiexec /x "D:\Prereqs\IES\MSI\IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform
   V3.0.msi" /qn /l*v c:\Uninstall_log.out
   
   where D:\Prereqs\IES\MSI\IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform V3.0.msi
   is the name of the .msi file originally used to install the
   WebSphere Eclipse Platform Version 3.0.
   
   The msiexec command line install options that can be used with
   eclipse install are as follows:
   
   /i "path\MSI\IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform V3.0.msi"
   Install the product using the .msi specified.
   
   /l*v c:\install.log
   Produce a log file called install.log, containing all
   information in verbose format.
   
   /m mif_file
   Generate a Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) status
   .mif file called mif_file.
   
   TRANSFORMS="1033.mst"
   Specifies that the installation is in U.S. English. For
   further information about installing in different national
   languages, see Using transforms with Msiexec.
   
   /q determines the level of user interface displayed (for a more
   detailed list of user interface levels, refer Using command line
   parameters with Msiexec)
   
   /qn Performs a silent install/uninstall
   
   /x "path\MSI\IBM WebSphere Eclipse Platform V3.0.msi"
       Uninstall the product using the .msi specified.
   
   Additional paramters that can be used are as follows:
   ADDLOCAL="Base" (To Install the specified feature. "Base" is the
   only option that is allowed with the installaton of WebSphere
   Eclipse Platform)
   
   AGREETOLICENSE="yes" (To accept the terms of the license)
   
   TARGETDIR="<directory>" (To install the WebSphere Eclipse
   Platform to a non-default directory). Please be aware that at
   v6 the TARGETDIR does not function - refer to APAR IC47296 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC47296].
   
   For a detailed description of the above mentioned parameters,
   refer Using command line parameters with Msiexec.
   
   Please note, The SAVEINI, USEINI and ONLYINI options have no
   effect on the eclipse install and they are valid only for MQ
   server or client installs.
