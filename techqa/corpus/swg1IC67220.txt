APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When there are multiple outstanding service
   invoke operations (using asyncdeferred response) within an
   aggregation block and a message is received at the stop
   terminal of the FanIn primitive processing from the Service
   Invokes will continue. This should not  happen,
   and the results of the invocations should be removed.

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: When using invocation style async for        *
   *                 multiple service invoke primitives, this     *
   *                 APAR should be applied to prevent the stop   *
   *                 terminal of the fan in primitive from        *
   *                 generating an error.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   With multiple Service Invoke primitives leading to a Fan In
   primitive, the invocation style of the Service Invoke can be
   set to either sync or async. After connecting a Stop terminal
   to the Fan In primitive and setting the invocation style of
   the Service Invoke primitive to async, a message received at
   the Stop terminal will not halt the service invokes and cause
   an error such as:
   
   "CWSXM0100E: Multiple replies have been produced for a single
   request"
   
   NOTE: This was also the case when using a sync invocation
   style and was fixed with IC59660 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC59660].
