QUESTION
 How can I import a Paradox (.db) file into SPSS for Windows? I've set up an ODBC data source using Microsoft's Paradox driver. However, I get an error at the second step of the Database Wizard. When I grab the table I want to bring over from the 'Available Tables' box and attempt to move it to the 'Retrieve fields in this order' box, I get an Error Message dialog box that says:

"Table 'xxxxx' has no columns and will not be shown." 

Why is this happening? 

ANSWER
There are several ways of importing a Paradox data file into SPSS. To import a Paradox file using either the Microsoft Paradox driver or the SPSS OEM driver will require having the Borland Database Engine (BDE) installed on your computer. You may also have to add the directory containing the BDE to your system path. If you do not have BDE installed, another way would be to save the Paradox file out as a text or delimited format that SPSS can read
