Title: IBM EAccessViolation when trying to launch the authorization wizard. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to license Clementine/SPSS. I get an error message which reads "EAccessViolation" when I try to launch the authorization wizard. Why is this occurring? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Two instances of the Licence Authorization Wizard cannot be open at the same time (i.e. you cannot have the license authorization wizard open for SPSS when you are attempting to license Clementine). Please close the open wizards before attempting to re-open the wizard and activate the product.
