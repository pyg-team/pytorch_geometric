ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the page:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.8.0/com. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.8.0/com.]
   ibm.odm.distrib.config.was/config_dc_websphere/tsk_was_deploy_
   dvs_arch.html (and corresponding page for older version), we
   have:
   
   19. In the side pane, open Applications  > Application Types >
   WebSphere enterprise applications, and click jrules-ssp-WAS85
   
   However, when following the installation as described in this
   document, there is no WebSphere Enterprise Application with
   such name.
   This is the name of the ear file that is being used to install
   the
   DVS related application, but it is being set with an
   Application Name
   "Testing and Simulation" and when we reach the step9, we
   get this Application Name ("Testing and Simulation") being
   displayed instead of "jrules-ssp-WAS85"
   Note that in 8.5, the Application Name being set was different (
   
   "Decision Validation Services" instead of "Testing and
   Simulation", but the same issue occurs. There is no "jrules-ssp-
   WAS85" or
   "jrules-ssp-WAS8" to click on.
   
   In the same page, in 20-21-22-23 we set the class loader to
   "Parent Last" for the
   two modules.
   But we don't set it for the the parent application. A check
   should be performed to confirm that
   Parent Last is also being set too. This should be performed
   between 19. and 20., by
   clicking on the "Class loading and update detection" before
   clicking on the "Manage Modules".
