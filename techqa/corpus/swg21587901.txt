 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
How to clear/ expire portal navigation cache, preferably 5 - 10 minutes such that any user/ group navigation changes are effective without have the user to logout and login ?

ANSWER
Setting the expiry to a time as small as 5 minutes will lead to significant performance problems and is not recommended, because the reconstruction of the cache content is an expensive operation. Recommended timeout values are in the range of hours. Furthermore, there is the technical limitation that the navigation model of the user is bound to the HTTP session, independent of cache timeout settings. This is why the new navigation is seen only after a logout/login. 

If the additional self-registration steps are executed via WebSphere Portal then it is possible to actively invalidate the model cache via portal internal API. In addition it is possible to actively invalidate the access control caches. However the APIs are not generally publically available. Please contact portal L2 support for further details on the process to obtain this information.
