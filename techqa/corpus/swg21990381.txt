QUESTION
 Someone told me I need to download and install a Java Software Development Kit (SDK) if I am going to use TRIRIGA with the full version of WebSphere Application Server. How do I do this? 

ANSWER
Confirm through the TRIRIGA Compatibility Matrix for the version of Application Platform you are planning to install [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/16665262-0aef-427f-8fa8-dcfcc66a26ff/page/f04a1ea1-c5bd-4176-bde6-dee790ddfc92/attachments] [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/Archive%20of%20IBM%20TRIRIGA%20Support%20Matrices]what version of WebSphere is supported and what version of the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition that version of WebSphere requires.
