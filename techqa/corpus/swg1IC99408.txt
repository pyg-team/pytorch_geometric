APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem occurs once you execute RUNSTATS with column details
   like below:
   RUNSTATS ON TABLE DB2INST1.TESTTABLE ON ALL COLUMNS WITH
   DISTRIBUTION ON ALL COLUMNS AND DETAILED INDEXES ALL
   
   Afterwards the select statements might return warning:
   SQL0437W  Performance of this complex query might be
   sub-optimal. Reason code: "6".  SQLSTATE=01602
   
   The warning is caused by inconsistency between values in
   SYSSTAT.COLUMNS and SYSSTAT.COLDIST tables, where the COLCARD
   value of SYSSTAT.COLUMNS is the incorrect one.
   You can check the conditions by obtaining db2look with mimic
   option for the database, and comparing UPDATE statements for
   SYSSTAT.COLUMNS and SYSSTAT.COLDIST tables:
   
   1. The UPDATE for SYSSTAT.COLUMNS table sets incorrect COLCARD
   value 3:
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLUMNS
   SET COLCARD=3,
       NUMNULLS=0,
       SUB_COUNT=-1,
       SUB_DELIM_LENGTH=-1,
       AVGCOLLENCHAR=-1,
       AVGCOLLEN=16
   WHERE COLNAME = 'C1' AND TABNAME = 'TESTTABLE' AND
   TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1';
   
   
   2. The correct cardinality is stored in SYSSTAT.COLDIST table
   (note 4 different COLVALUE contents):
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST
   SET COLVALUE='VAL1            ',
       VALCOUNT=92041
   WHERE COLNAME = 'C1' AND TABNAME = 'TESTTABLE'
         AND TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1'
         AND TYPE      = 'F'
         AND SEQNO     =  1;
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST
   SET COLVALUE='VAL2            ',
       VALCOUNT=1602
   WHERE COLNAME = 'C1' AND TABNAME = 'TESTTABLE'
         AND TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1'
         AND TYPE      = 'F'
         AND SEQNO     =  2;
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST
   SET COLVALUE='VAL3            ',
       VALCOUNT=26
   WHERE COLNAME = 'C1' AND TABNAME = 'TESTTABLE'
         AND TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1'
         AND TYPE      = 'F'
         AND SEQNO     =  3;
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST
   SET COLVALUE='VAL4             ',
       VALCOUNT=9
   WHERE COLNAME = 'C1' AND TABNAME = 'TESTTABLE'
         AND TABSCHEMA = 'DB2INST1'
         AND TYPE      = 'F'
         AND SEQNO     =  4;
   
   
   
   The incorrect RUNSTATS results as above might occur when
   following conditions are true:
   (1) The table has compressed index,
   (2) The index has pseudo deleted keys.
   
   The problem is more likely to occur in an index where there is a
   high degree of commonality in the index keys.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To workaround the SQL0437W warning you might consider:
   1. Running RUNSTATS without column details.
   2. Update SYSSTAT.COLUMNS COLCARD value manually to reflect the
   number of distinct values in SYSSTAT.COLDIST table.
   3. REORG problematic table and indexes for the table to get rid
   of pseudo deleted keys, followed by a new RUNSTATS with all
   desired column options.
   
   Note that problem might reoccur again after introduction of new
   pseudo deleted keys in the index and subsequent RUNSTATS
   operation.
