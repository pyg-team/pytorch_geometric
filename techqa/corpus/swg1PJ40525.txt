APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a storage area becomes offline or unavailable, ingested
   documents are created unfiled and with minor version number.
   
   This is occurring because the Content Engine (CE) Client
   (WorkplaceXT (WPXT), etc) is not able
   to delete or remove the document after an unsuccessful call to
   the document.setContent(...) method due to no storage area being
   available.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Using ICC or WorkplaceXT for document ingestion with         *
   * 5.0.0.2-P8CE-FP002 or prior.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When using ICC or WorkplaceXT for document ingestion, if the *
   * target storage area happens to be unavailable (due to        *
   * hardware, network issues, etc) the applications would create *
   * minor versions of documents without content, not the         *
   * expected major versions with content.  These minor versions  *
   * could not be deleted until the storage area was back online, *
   * making it impossible for the ingestion applications to       *
   * correctly clean up their incomplete work.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Content Engine 5.0.0.3-P8CE-FP003 or later, and   *
   * upgrade the ingestion application to a version that          *
   * implements cleanup of incomplete documents.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fix in Content Engine 5.0.0.3-P8CE-FP003 or later will
   allow the ingestion applications to clean up incomplete
   ingestion in this case.
   Note that the ingestion applications me require modification to
   actually perform the cleanup.
