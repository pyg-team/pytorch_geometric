ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When WPS is configured to use work-manager based navigation, the
   following use of the BPC EJB API may result in messages or
   variables showing wrong or null data objects:
   a) The local BPC EJB API is used
   b) The input message of a human task or business process is
   submitted using the local BPC EJB API
   c) The input message is used in java code after it has been
   submitted to BPC for further processing
   
   Reason:
   The work-manager based navigation comes with an object cache for
   efficient read access to data objects. In the scenarios
   described, without the i-fix, a reference to the data object in
   the inter transaction cache is passed to the client making the
   local EJB calls.
   Later use of the data object may occur by the client code and by
   the BPC container, which leads to wrong or null data.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There are two new custom properties that control the behavior of
   
   the cache (if enabled):
   
   - interTransactionCache.passByReference={true|false}
     If the value of this property is set to 'false' then the
     returned data will be a copy of the cached object.
     The default value for this property is 'true'. This is
     equivalent the behavior before this fix is applied.
   
   - interTransactionCache.integrityCheck={false|true}
     If the value of this property is set to 'true' (and if
     interTransactionCache.passByReference is set
     to 'true' as well) data objects are checked when they are
     added or read from the inter transaction cache.
     If the cached object has been modified by another client a
     message like the following is
     written to SystemOut.log:
     WARNING: CWWBB0699W: The content of the internal database
     cache for entity
     'com.ibm.bpe.database.ScopedVariableInstanceB' with key '
     SVIID = _SVI:9028012b.81aa9d26.d03267f6.f2f40003}' is not
     valid anymore.
   
     The default value for this property is 'false' - only if the
     server is running in 'development mode' the default value is
     set to 'true'.
   
   
   Note that the server must be restarted before the custom
   property become effective.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  iFix available on top of V7003
   Fix will be included in V7004
