ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has a multi-honed WebSEAL in the DMZ
   customer is building multiple webseals each attached to their
   own unique physical interface and listening for external traffic
   on 80 and 443
   the internal mgmt sevrer communication seems to only communicate
   to the webseals for acldb updates and junction creates, etc
   on the primary interface.
   .
   this would seem to lead to a single point of failure regarding
   updating or managing the webseals, once the primary interface
   has problems, we lose the ability to manage the other instances
   even though there are no problems to their interface
   .
   we verified this by running an iptrace when doing a junction
   list on the 2nd webseal instance, the request to destination
   port 7236 was to the primary interface address.
