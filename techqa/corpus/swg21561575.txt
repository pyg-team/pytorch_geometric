PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 AS2 - Unable to send outbound batches - Error: Could not figure out algorithm type for algorith 

SYMPTOM


Unable to send outbound AS2 Payload batches to Trading Partner.

The .RQ file is not being created.

Error Message Error: -- java.io.IOException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not figure out algorithm type for algorithm 
RSA/ECB/PKCS1_02Padding - no signature or key-agreement could be found for it
EDIINT 14 Aug 2007 17:42:28,061 ERROR - process(): Exception caught: java.lang.NullPointerException


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Solution 

The error seems to be cause by a incorrect password. The error basically states that the signature cannot be computed using the keycert. Therefore, it is suspected that the .RQ file was not created.

Note: The password for the private key is only needed to be pass via the cmurefresh command if the default password which is "password" is not being used.

The syntax for cmurefresh command: cmurefresh -S <passphrase> -N EDIINT
