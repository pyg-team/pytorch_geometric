PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)

This requirement is documented in Appendix C in the FileNet Image Services 4.1.2 Installation manual and Appendix E in the FileNet Image Services 4.2.0 Installation manuals.

If the correct value is not inserted in the Client Character Set, the Content Engine server reports a login error and cannot logon to the FileNet Image Services server. 

SYMPTOM
When this problem occurs, errors similar to the following are written in the FileNet Content Engine p8_server_error_log.

CAUSE
The problem is caused by entering the incorrect value for the Client Character Set in the fn_edit System Attributes tab. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The character set that is used within FileNet Content Engine must match the value that is entered for the FileNet Image Services Client Character Set in the fn_edit utility. 

The cause of the problem given in the Symptom section of this technote was the Client Character Set was entered as ISO 8859-1 in fn_edit. The correct value should have been ISO8859-1. An additional space was entered between ISO and 8859-1.
