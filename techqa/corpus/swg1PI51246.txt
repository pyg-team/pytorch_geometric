APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Consider the simple scenario, where an output card has an XML
   structure (using the native XSD as a Typetree) and the only
   rule is the version field, populated with a literal value:
   
   ="1.0"
   
   ...mapped.
   
   Under WTX 8.4.0.5, this produces a zero byte XML file.
   
   However, with the addition of the ="UTF-8" rule, under WTX
   8.4.0.5 produces:
   
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   
   You might expect the first map to produce:
   
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   
   ...or something similar.  This is what we get with WTX 8.4.1.3
   anyway.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00047625
   PB / PB
   As a workaround, also map the 'encoding' field or use a newer
   WTX version.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers who use native
   schema and map XML header version
   
   Problem Description:
   Empty XML document produced when there should be content. Only
   version in XML header is entered.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added code to handle version output mapping, insuring that data
   is properly encoded and version makes it into work file so it
   can be used as input to other output cards.
   
   Applies to:
   8.4.0.5
