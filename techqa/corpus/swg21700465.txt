 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability affects IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Version 6 that is used by IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138] 

DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
