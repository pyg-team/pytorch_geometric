Title: IBM Information Server Install with Oracle metadata repository fails with error CDIPR2122I - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Information Server install fails with the following error:

Error: Ensure the Oracle database is configured in the correct UTF8 code page. Expected: NLS_CHARACTERSET = AL32UTF8 and NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET = AL16UTF16. Found: NLS_CHARACTERSET = WE8MSWIN1252, NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET = AL16UTF16. Resolution: If the Oracle database is not created in the expected code page: NLS_CHARACTERSET = AL32UTF8 and NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET = AL16UTF16, recreate database before installing IBM InfoSphere Information Server 

CAUSE
Oracle XMETA metadata repository database was created using a character set other than UTF-8

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create the metadata repository database in Oracle with a character set of AL32UTF8. The script provided will create a tablespace within an existing database. The required character set for use with IBM Information Server is AL32UTF8. If the database is configured to use another character set, data entered or transferred that contains characters not supported by the configured character set will not be stored, processed or displayed correctly by IBM Information Server. To avoid issues with unsupported characters use a database which is configured to use the AL32UTF8 character set.
