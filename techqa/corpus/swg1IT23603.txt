APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CognosReportService logs shows that it has been working on one
   role for  34 minutes and its still not done.  There is no way
   this would ever get up for 1393 roles.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 558220
   SF / SF
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of Issue:  Cognos takes too long to start when there
    are lots (100s or 1000s) of  ICC roles defined.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of Fix:  Rewrite the logic that maps ICC roles to
   Cognos roles to reduce the number of Cognos queries needed from
   several thousand to a dozen.  And remove the updating of
   workspace permission on workspace folders if the folders already
    exist.
