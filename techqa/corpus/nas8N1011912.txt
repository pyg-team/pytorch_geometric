To correct the error, you must verify that QSERVER subsystem is active and QPWFSERVSO job is active under it. 

Restricting access to the host servers will cause all or portions of Access for Web to fail. This information is included in the Info Center in a section on Exit Programs. It is equally true that if the host servers are not running the Access for Web configuration will fail.
