ABSTRACT
This document provides information on the IBM DataPower Gateway Firmware Support Lifecycle.

CONTENT
IBM® DataPower® Gateway is a purpose-built gateway that provides security, traffic control, mediation and optimized access to a full range of mobile, web, application programming interface (API), service-oriented architecture (SOA), B2B and cloud workloads. It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.

IBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.

Hardware 

DataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].

For end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. 

Firmware 

Businesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.

Effective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:

 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.
    
    
 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.
     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.
     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.
    
    

Firmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.

Firmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.

Note: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported. By using the information in this table, customers can effectively plan their firmware investment without any gaps in support.

Notes: 

 * For information on current DataPower firmware versions, see Supported Firmware versions and recommended upgrade levels for IBM DataPower Gateways ".
 * Refer to the Contact Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] page for how to reach IBM DataPower Gateways Support.
 * Customers are responsible for completing migration activities to currently supported levels before a release level reaches end-of-support.
 * Short duration support extensions are available on a case-by-case basis, for an additional fee, immediately following the end-of-support for a specific firmware level. Extensions would be for a very limited time period with limited terms and conditions. An extension is intended to provide support while customers complete their migration to a supported release.
