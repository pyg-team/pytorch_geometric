ENVIRONMENT
You have a Sametime 8.5.2 community server that is registered with the Sametime System Console (SSC) 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Prerequisites: 


1. Upgrade the Sametime System Console (SSC) to 8.5.2 IFR1 before trying to upgrade the Sametime Community Server from 8.5.2 to 8.5.2 IFR1.

2. Make sure the existing (8.5.2) community server is registered properly with your Sametime System Console.

3. Make sure that the Community Server is stopped before upgrading to IFR1.
Make sure the Sametime System Console is running.

Once you have verified the above, check the \Domino\Console folder on the Sametime community server for a file named CONSOLE.PID. If you see CONSOLE.PID file at this location, make a backup of the file at some different location and simply delete it from \Domino\Data\console folder. Then, try re-running the IFR1 upgrade installer.
