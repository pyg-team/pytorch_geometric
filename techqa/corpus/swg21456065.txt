Optim Connect authorization ACX9001E connection TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When connecting to the Optim Connect Server via Optim Connect Studio studio the error "ACX9001E: You do not have the authorization for the requested operation" is given. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The user you are connecting with is not an administrator on the Optim Connect Server. This can occur if the product was not installed with an administrator account. 

Alternatively if an administrative account is not available then you can grant another account administrative rights over Optim Connect via the NAV_UTIL utility as follows: 

 

nav_util add_admin username | * 

 

Username must be the name of a valid user account. 

 

 

* will allow all users to act as administrator. 

 

It may also be necessary to restart the Optim Connect Server.
