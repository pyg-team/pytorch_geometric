Decompressing TAR files with WinZip 
The product files are delivered as compressed TAR files. You must decompress the files into the same directory to install them. 

If you use WinZip to extract the TAR files, deselect TAR file smart CR/LF conversion:  1.  Open WinZip Classic. 
 2. Select Options > Configuration, and click the Miscellaneous tab. 
 3. Clear the TAR file smart CR/LF conversion check box. 
 4. Unzip and import the data.


To avoid problems with the extraction of the TAR files, decompress them to the same folder at the root of your hard drive. 

Installation issue 
If you have downloaded the fix pack (Decision Center and/or Decision Server) prior to 6 Jan. 2012, you will need to update two files in each of the installers to allow the fix pack to install properly. However, if you have downloaded since 6 Jan. 2012, you are not concerned by this workaround. 

To fix the installers in Decision Center or Decision Server, please follow these steps: 

Decision Center 
When you downloaded the fix pack, you got a file called wodm_decision_center.7.5.0.1.zip. After unzipping the file, you got a directory called WDC.im15.7.5.0.1.updatesite. Here you need to update the following information before installing:
