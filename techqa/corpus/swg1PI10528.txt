   ****************************************************************
   Intelligent Management enabled web servers return 404 error
   codes for requests destined for static clusters due to an
   error/window in the Intelligent Management REST service that
   prevents proper routing information from being returned to the
   web servers about the static cluster definition. The
   error/window presents itself when the Intelligent Management
   REST service is serving a delta response back to the web
   server and a change has occurred in the On-Demand
   Configuration data that causes the web servers interest in the
   static cluster to change.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Intelligent Management REST service has been altered such
   that it recognizes when a web server's interest in an existing
   On-Demand Configuration object has changed while the service
   is attempting to serve a delta response. The response is then
   altered to include all relevant objects in-relation to that
   interest change, ensuring complete and proper routing
   information is delivered to the web server.
