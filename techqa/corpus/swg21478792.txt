Title: IBM Warnings 4492 and 208 when running VALUE LABELS command - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running SPSS syntax and I get these warnings in my VALUE LABELS command syntax:

>Warning # 4492 in column x. Text: t
>The (ADD) VALUE LABELS command included a symbol other than a value where a
>value (either numeric or string) was expected. For compatibility with
>previous systems, a parenthesized value would have been acceptable. All
>value labels up to the next slash will be ignored.


>Warning # 208 in column y. Text:
>A text string is not correctly enclosed in quotation marks on the command
>line. Literals may not be continued across command lines without the use
>of the continuation symbol '+'.

Why is this occurring? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check to see if you have an apostrophe in one of your labels. If so, SPSS may be reading that apostrophe as the end of the value label instead of an apostrophie within the label. For example,

VALUE LABELS varname
1 'Yes'
2 'No'
98 'Respondent doesn't respond'
99 'Other'.

will return those warnings because in the last line SPSS is reading 'Respondent doesn' as the value label and try to read "t respond" as a value of VARNAME rather than the rest of the label. Enclose the label in double quotes, such as 

99 "Respondent doesn't respond".

and the warning messages will disappea
