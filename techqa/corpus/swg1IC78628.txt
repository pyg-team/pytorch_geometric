APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A DataPower Tivoli Access Manager (TAM) object supports the use
   of SSL connections to the TAM registry server.  The
   cryptographic material to complete this connection is provided
   to the DataPower TAM object in a keystore database (kdb) file.
   If the TAM registry server requires authentication of a client
   through certificate authentication, the kdb file  must contain a
   valid certificate.
   
   If the required client certificate in the kdb file is not the
   default certificate, the label of the required certificate must
   also be provided so that the TAM object can use the correct
   certificate to authenticate to the TAM registry server.
   
   This configuration property is called "ldap-ssl-key-file-dn"
   from the command line, "LDAPSSLKeyFileLabel" for use through the
   XML Management Interface, and "Registry Server SSL Key File
   Label" in the WebGUI.
   
   This configuration property is ignored in DataPower versions
   3.8.1.0 and later no matter where it is set (command line,
   WebGUI, SOAP request through XML management interface, or
   configuration import).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the use of TAM feature.
   
   If the required client certificate in the kdb file is not the
   default certificate, the needed specification of the required
   certificate label does not take effect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 3.8.1.16, 3.8.2.7, 4.0.1.4,
   4.0.2.1 and XE82 1.0.0.2
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Refrain from using TAM user registry SSL client authentication
   certificates that are not the default certificate in their
   keystore file.
