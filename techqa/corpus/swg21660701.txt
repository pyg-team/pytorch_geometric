Title: IBM Can not upgrade to v9.1 on a Guardium appliance that was built at v7 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have a Guardium appliance that was initially installed at v7. You have upgraded it to v9, however, the health check patch 9997 to upgrade to v9.1 fails. You see the message "ERROR:root partition has less then 1G of free space" in the health check log. 

CAUSE
v7 appliances were built with 3GB space in the root partition. In v9.1 this is no longer enough for the appliance to function correctly.

ENVIRONMENT
Appliances that have been upgraded from v7.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the healthcheck<time_stamp>.log created by the health check patch you see the error:


 * 
 * ERROR:root partition has less then 1G of free space.


This can occur for other reasons, but if your appliance has been upgraded from v7 the cause above will prevent an upgrade to v9.1. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To set the internal file system with the required partition space you must rebuild the appliance at v9 then upgrade to v9.1. Follow the instructions below: 

 

 * 
 *  show system patch installed 
 * 
 * 
 * and
 * 
 * Administration Console->Data Management->System Backup
