QUESTION
 When installing WebSphere Process Server through the launchpad, can I change the default shared resource location? 

ANSWER
Yes. You can change the default shared resource location by using the following procedure.
The following steps are for new installations. If you already have installed and want to change the shared resource location, you will have to uninstall and reinstall after following these steps.

Steps

1. Locate the default shared resource. Depending on whether you are an administrative (root) or non-administrative (non-root) user, find the default shared resource location in one of the following tables.


Administrative or root users



Platform Default Location for shared resources AIX /usr/IBM/BPMShared HP-UX /opt/IBM/BPMShared Linux /opt/ibm/BPMShared Solaris /opt/IBM/BPMShared Windows <ProgramFiles>\IBM\BPMShared 


Non-administrative or non-root users 

Platform Default Location for shared resources AIX <HOME>/IBM/BPMShared HP-UX <HOME>/IBM/BPMShared Linux <HOME>/ibm/BPMShared Solaris <HOME>/IBM/BPMShared Windows <APPDATA>\IBM\BPMShared 


2. Modify the <imageLocation> /launchpad/content/userExtensions.js file, where <imageLocation> is the location of the installation image of WebSphere Process Server. 



3. Replace the existing defaultSharedPlugins() and defaultSharedPlugins_nonroot() functions with the following versions updated with your preferred location, <NEW_SHARED_LOCATION>. 


function defaultSharedPlugins() 
{  * var sharedLocation='<NEW_SHARED_LOCATION>'; 
   
   return sharedLocation; 

} 

function defaultSharedPlugins_nonroot() 
{  * var sharedLocation='<NEW_SHARED_LOCATION>'; 

 * return sharedLocation; 

}
