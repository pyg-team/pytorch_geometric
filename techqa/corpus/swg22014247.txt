 What is changing in the Support experience? 

CAUSE
As we strive to seek new and better ways to improve our communications and the support we offer, IBM is rolling out a new Support Community across all products. We are excited to announce that we are launching a new Support Community/Experience for our TRIRIGA products.

ANSWER
Our new IBM Support Community streamlines support for you, our clients, and for our support engineers. 

This new community will be your main resource for support-related information and resources and provides more transparency into your ticket resolution workflow.

You can open and manage cases, connect with support engineers, and access extensive self-service resources. Additionally, your support experience will be consistent across all IBM products and services.
