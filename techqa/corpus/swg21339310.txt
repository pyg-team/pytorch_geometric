Title: IBM Why is the Y axis scale different between the HTML and PDF versions of the report? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If we run a report in html the graph Y Axis ticks start at 10 (suppressing 0's) which is what we want. If we burst and run in PDF it starts at 0. 

Why is it different and how can we keep the graphs starting at 10? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is occurring because of the fact that PDF's are geared to a paper size, whereas HTML is geared to a web browser. There's more room on the PDF, so it isn't as aggressive in condensing the y axis scale. There are a couple of settings you can use to control this behavior. In Report Studio, if you click on the Y Axis in the Chart object, and scroll down through the list of properties, you'll find a number of useful settings in the General section. A key one that affects PDF's only (as opposed to HTML) is the Use Same Range for All Instances. By default, this is set to Yes, which means that all the charts generated in the report run will use the same scale, regardless of if that scale makes sense. Another useful setting is the Maximum Value and Minimum Value, which will set the upper and lower values. However, these values are not dynamic. Set the Use Same Range for All Instances to NO and now Html and PDF chart reports now show the same scales.
