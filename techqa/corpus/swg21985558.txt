4. Add the GetDocumentInformation service to your business process which adds meta data to nodes in ProcessData. One of these node is called DocumentID, and you can do a Select standard or extended rule to pull the node into a field or variable in the map.

5. Use a LightweightJDBC adapter to similarly connect to an external database, and place a value into process data. You would need to have a database table set up where a random number can be selected.

These are mainly just suggestions and in some cases more knowledge about the product is needed to actually perform these tasks. In the case of the user exit to connect to an external database, Support will only be able to assist to the connection with the database. The purpose of this article is just to collect the information available in one location. Should other examples be created, or the current ones updated, this article should contain the most current information.
