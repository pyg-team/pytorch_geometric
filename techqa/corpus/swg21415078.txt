 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does only one of my WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances SLM Peer Group members apply the SLM settings? 

ANSWER
There are a few possibilities that should be explored with your configuration and environment. 

In order to resolve this problem, check that all the criteria below is met: 

 1. The XML Management Interface has to be enabled on both devices 
 2. Ensure that the URLs in the peer group are correct 
 3. When using hostnames in the peer group URLs, make sure you have a working DNS configuration 
 4. The SLM policy needs to be identical on both appliances. If they do not match, the peering will not work. 
 5. If you are receiving this error: 
    
    [network][error] : tid(47): Host connection could not be established
    [network][error] : tid(47): Host connection failed to establish: SLM_PEER : tcp port 5550
    
    Ensure that there is no firewall in between the appliances blocking the port for the XML Management Interface. 
 6. Review the XML Management Interface configuration and check the advanced tab, to ensure, the default user agent is not used, or if used, that it has been set up with an SSL Proxy Profile.
