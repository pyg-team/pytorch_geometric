FAILURES 
-------- 
Filesets listed in this section failed pre-installation verification
and will not be installed. 
Missing Filesets 
---------------- 
The following filesets could not be found on the installation media.
If you feel these filesets really are on the media, check for typographical 
errors in the name specified or, if installing from directory, check for 
discrepancies between the Table of Contents file (.toc) and the 
images that reside in the directory. 
ILMT-TAD4D-agent 
<< End of Failure Section >> 

There was already an existing /tmp/.toc file which was left over from a previous install. 

When running the installp for the LMT install, the installp found this .toc file and tried to use it but it contained references to another products install files, not LMT. 


ANSWER
Delete the .toc file (in this case it was in /tmp/.toc where the install image files resided). 

Then run 

inutoc /tmp 

to rebuild the .toc file with references to the LMT install images in /tmp.
