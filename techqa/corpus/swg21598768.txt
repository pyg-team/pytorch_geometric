QUESTION
 When you install the IBM Business Process Manager Version 8.0 products, the launchpad prompts you to enter credentials for "IBM service repository." What are the credentials that you need to use on this panel? 

ANSWER
Lauchpad has the capability to install the recommended fix pack and the interim fixes from the Internet during product installation. 
During a typical installation, you are prompted to provide your IBM ID and password to connect to an IBM service repository. You can obtain an IBM ID and password by registering at http://www.ibm.com [http://www.ibm.com]. The following screen shot shows the credentials prompt:

The connection to the service repositories is required to download and install any fix packs and required interim fixes from the Internet. This process includes fixes for the WebSphere Application Server and IBM Business Process Manager products.

You can click Cancel to install the product without downloading the required fixes from the Internet. After successfully installing the product, you can use Installation Manager to manually install the required fixes.
