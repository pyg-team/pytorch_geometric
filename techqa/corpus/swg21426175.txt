QUESTION
 Can you upgrade your Windows clients to Microsoft Windows 7 with ClearCase version 7.1.1 and maintain older ClearCase versions on your ClearCase VOB and view servers? 

CAUSE
 

You are planning an upgrade of your Windows clients to Windows 7 with ClearCase 7.1.1 and need to know if the VOB and View servers they interact with need to be upgraded as well.


ANSWER
 

ClearCase supports compatibility across releases. Therefore, if the version of ClearCase currently installed on the View or VOB server meets the documented compatibility requirements, you may not have to upgrade those servers to 7.1.1. 

For instance, you can upgrade your Windows clients to Windows 7 with ClearCase version 7.1.1 and keep your ClearCase View and VOB servers at ClearCase version 7.0.x. This way you can maintain your existing server environment while upgrading only your Windows clients.

Refer to the ClearCase documentation under the topic of Compatibility across releases [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ms_install.doc/topics/c_compat_acr_rls.htm]for version compatibility information and requirements.

For information about installing ClearCase version 7.1.1 on Windows 7 clients refer to technote 1404683 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21404683].
