QUESTION
 How can we change the session timeout for Deployment Portal (or PEM) users? 

ANSWER
For WebSphere, edit this file....

/qibm/UserData/WebSphere/AppServer/V61/Express/profiles/<CADS SERVER>/config/cells/<CADS CELL NAME>/applications/peb.ear/deployments/peb/peb.war/WEB-INF/web.xml 

Modify this value....

<session-config>
<session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
</session-config>

The value is in minutes, and the default is 30. 

Restart your WebSphere instanceure.
