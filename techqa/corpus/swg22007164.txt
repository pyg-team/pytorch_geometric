QUESTION
 How can I manually update an already loaded IBM Rational Rhapsody model in Gateway and why is it not updating automatically? 

CAUSE
You want to update the model in Gateway after changes were made in Rational Rhapsody.

ANSWER
After saving the changes in Rational Rhapsody and switching to Gateway, you normally get a message to reload the model. All changes are updated then automatically. 

In some cases, you do not get this message and you must manually launch the update process in Gateway. 

Right-click the Rhapsody model in Gateway and select "Force reload". 

The reason for not updating automatically can be an enabled intermediate file. 

Use the setting for enabling the intermediate file only for testing and debugging purpose but not for productive usage of your project.
