Title: IBM Ciphers that should be used by IBM Spectrum Scale V4 for transport security - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What ciphers should be used by IBM Spectrum Scale V4 for transport security? 

CAUSE
There is an inherent limitation in TLS in that the protocol does not periodically refresh the key material that is used to protect the data that is exchanged. Depending on the cipher suite used, and the amount of data transmitted between two nodes, if the key is not updated after the threshold for that cipher is reached, the data may be at risk to an attack that would compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of the transmitted data. The AES-GCM cipher suite (only available on TLS 1.2) is particularly affected by this issue, given that the number of bytes that can be safely exchanged on a single TLS session is the lowest amongst cipher suites (this limit is on the order of hundreds of GiB, see references [1] and [2] below). 

This could be exploited by an attacker with the capability to collect large quantities of network traffic exchanged between two nodes and then perform sophisticated cryptanalysis to decrypt part of the traffic exchanged, or be able to inject messages in the encrypted communications between two nodes (with partial control over their content). IBM Spectrum Scale uses long-lived TLS connections and when using the AES-GCM cipher suite it may exchange enough data to increase the risk of this type of weakness being exploited. 


ANSWER
Based on these considerations, if you determine you may be at risk, we recommend customers to set the cipherList config variables as follows: 

For environments where nistCompliance=off 

 * AES128-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA

For environments where nistCompliance=SP800-131A  * AES128-SHA 
 * AES128-SHA256 
 * AES256-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA256


Notes: 
1. When a cluster contains both GPFS V3 (use of OpenSSL) and IBM Spectrum Scale V4 (use of GSKit) nodes, ensure the use of a cipher that is supported by all nodes:  * AES128-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA

2. IBM Spectrum Scale also supports the keywords DEFAULT, EMPTY and AUTHONLY in place of a cipher list. DEFAULT, EMPTY and AUTHONLY are not affected by this issue. 

The default security mode is EMPTY in IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1 or earlier and is AUTHONLY in IBM Spectrum Scale V4.2 or later. When EMPTY is specified, Spectrum Scale does not authenticate or check authorization for network connections, or encrypt transmitted data. When AUTHONLY is specified, Spectrum Scale checks network connection authorization, but data sent over the connection is not encrypted, therefore not protected.
