IBM API Connect V5.0.8.3 is now available. This update provides important development and APAR fixes. 

We advise all users of IBM API Connect V5.0 to install this update to take advantage of the fixes. 

Note: The Linux distribution for the Developer Portal OVA has moved from a Debian V7 base to an Ubuntu V16.04 base. Support for the Debian V7 OVA is being withdrawn in May 2018. You are strongly encouraged to migrate your Developer Portal to the Ubuntu V16.04 base now, as support for Debian V7 upgrades will be removed by May 2018. 

Support lifecycle policy for IBM API Connect Version 5.0.8.3: 

IBM API Connect Version 5.0.8.x is a Long Term Supported (LTS) release and is a recommended product level for which support, including defect and security updates, will be provided through cumulative, in-place Fix Packs until the effective end of support (EOS) date for IBM API Connect Version 5.0. An LTS release is intended for customers that may need a longer-term deployment for their environment.
