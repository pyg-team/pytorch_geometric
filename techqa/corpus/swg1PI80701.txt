    > Members of the IMS PROCLIB data set
    > HWSCFGxx member of the IMS PROCLIB data set
    > ODACCESS statement
   
   New ODRACFST= parameter is added to the ODACCESS statement in
   the IMS Connect HWSCFGxx configuration member of the IMS
   PROCLIB data set.
   
   ODACCESS statement
     ODRACFST= parameter
       Specifies the RACF statistics option for the RACF user
       authentication calls on incoming DB request messages to
       ODBM when RACF=Y is specified.
   
       The RACF statistics option controls the STAT= parameter
       option that is used in the RACF RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY
       user authentication call.
   
       The STAT= parameter specifies whether the statistics
       controlled by the options specified on the RACF SETROPTS
       command should be maintained or ignored for the execution
       of RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY call. The parameter also
       controls whether a message is to be issued when the logon
       is successful.
   
       N is the default.
   
       Y  Specifies RACF to record and update statistics by using
          the STAT=ASIS option in the RACROUTE call.
          When STAT=ASIS, the messages and statistics are
          controlled by the installation's current options on the
          RACF SETROPTS command.
          Statistics are updated daily at most.
   
       N  Specify RACF to not update statistics by using the
          STAT=NO option in the RACROUTE call.
          When STAT=NO, the options specified on the RACF
          SETROPTS command are ignored.
   
       The ODRACFST= setting can be changed using the IMS Connect
       type-2 command UPDATE IMSCON TYPE(CONFIG).
   
       For details of the STAT= parameter in the RACROUTE
       REQUEST=VERIFY call, see ?z/OS Security Server RACROUTE
       Macro Reference?.

   The QUERY IMSCON TYPE(CONFIG) command is enhanced to display
   the ODRACFST value.
   
   The filter keyword ODRACFST is added to the SHOW keyword.
   
   SHOW
     ODRACFST
       Displays the RACF statistics option for the RACF user
       authentication calls on incoming DB request messages to
       ODBM when RACF=Y is specified.
   
   The following entry is added to the output fields table.

                                   specified.
   
                                   Y  RACF statistics is

   The UPDATE IMSCON TYPE(CONFIG) command is enhanced to allow
   the ODRACFST value to be changed.
   
   The ODRACFST attribute keyword is added to the SET keyword.
   
   SET
     ODRACFST
       Specifies the RACF statistics option for the RACF user
       authentication calls on incoming DB request messages to
       ODBM when RACF=Y is specified.
   
       The RACF statistics option controls the STAT= parameter
       option that is used in the RACF RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY
       user authentication call.
   
       The STAT= parameter specifies whether the statistics
       controlled by the options specified on the RACF SETROPTS
       command should be maintained or ignored for the execution
       of RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFY call. The parameter also
       controls whether a message is to be issued when the logon
       is successful.
   
       ON   Specifies RACF to record and update statistics by
            using the STAT=ASIS option in the RACROUTE call.
            When STAT=ASIS, the messages and statistics are
            controlled by the installation's current options on
            the RACF SETROPTS command.
            Statistics are updated daily at most.
   
       OFF  Specify RACF to not update statistics by using the
            STAT=NO option in the RACROUTE call.
            When STAT=NO, the options specified on the RACF
            SETROPTS command are ignored.
