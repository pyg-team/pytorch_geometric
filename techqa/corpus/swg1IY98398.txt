LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Japanese characters in Event Display Item values are garbled
   when displayed in Event Flyover popup.
   
   Japanese and other multi-byte characters are represented
   differently in the TEP than they are in the TEPS/TEMS.  When a
   situation specifies a Display Item, its value can contain these
   multi-byte characters.  Such characters are unreadable when
   displayed in the TEP if not converted to the native Java
   character encoding.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The logic was changed to convert multi-byte characters from the
   TEPS to the TEP encoding before they are displayed.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
