PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2.x - Unable to log on to Administration Console for Content Platform Engine ( ACCE ) following upgrade 

SYMPTOM
After upgrading to FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2.x from an earlier version of FileNet Content Engine, users are unable to log on to the Administration Console for Content Platform Engine ( ACCE ). After entering credentials on the ACCE logon screen, a message is displayed indicating 

The user ID or password is not valid for the server 

Clicking the, More Information hyperlink displays message id, 

 

CIWEB1005 

Ensure that you entered your user ID and password correctly 

 

No errors are logged in the SystemOut / stdout logs of the J2EE Application Server. Logging on using the same credentials using FileNet Enterprise Manager ( FEM ) is successful. 


CAUSE
The JAAS configuration used by CPE 5.2.x includes a JAAS LoginConfiguration stanza labeled "Navigator" that is used by ACCE. Using a JAAS configuration from a prior version of FileNet Content Engine which does not contain the "Navigator" stanza or contains duplicate "Navigator" stanzas will result .... in all ACCE logon attempts failing.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Websphere Application Server 

 

 1. Using the IBM Websphere Application Server Administration Console, navigate to Security
    
    
 2. Global Security
    
    
 3. Java Authentication and Authorization Service
    
    
 4. Application Logins.
    
    
 5. Inspect the list of Login Modules and if you do not find one labeled Navigator, re-run the "Configure Login Modules" step in FileNet Configuration Manager.
    
    
 6. Verify that the Navigator entry is listed under Application Logins, restart the Websphere instance and attempt to log on to ACCE


Oracle Weblogic Application Server


 1. Inspect the Oracle Weblogic startup script - startWeblogic and look for a generic JVM parameter labeled -Djava.security.auth.login.config which will point to a jaas.conf.Weblogic configuration file. If you are using a managed node edit the startManagedWeblogic startup script or specify the java.security.auth.login.config argument in the Weblogic Admin Console ( Environment -> Servers -> %servername% -> Start tab -> Arguments ). 
    
    
 2. Verify that the jaas.conf.Weblogic file referenced does contain a Navigator stanza entry.
    
    
 3. If the file does not contain the Navigator entry replace it with a copy from <CE_Install_Dir>\config\samples\jaas.conf.WebLogic or if the JVM argument is missing entirely, set it : -Djava.security.auth.login.config=<CE_Install_Dir>\config\samples\jaas.conf.WebLogic
    
 4. If the JVM argument is missing entirely, set it: 
    
    -Djava.security.auth.login.config=CE_install_dir\config\samples\jaas.conf.WebLogic
    
 5. If the sample jaas.conf.WebLogic file contains a duplicate IBM Content Navigator stanza, remove one of the stanzas and save the file. 
    
    
 6. Restart the Weblogic instance and attempt to log on to ACCE 


Please note that FileNet Configuration Manager does not have a " "Configure Login Modules" when configured for Oracle Weblogic Application Server. 

 

JBoss Application Server 

 1. Open <jboss_home>\server\<servername>\conf\login-config.xml and look for a Navigator login module: <application-policy name="Navigator">
    
    
 2. If the Navigator Login Module is not present, re-run the "Configure Login Modules" step in FileNet Configuration Manager. 
    
    
 3. Verify that the Navigator entry is present in login-config.xml, restart the JBoss instance and attempt to log on to ACCE
