ABSTRACT
 This technote describes how to enable and disable the startup of administrative and sample portlets during Portal startup to speed up the server start and reduce the Portal memory footprint. 

CONTENT
WebSphere Portal 6.1.0.2 introduces a new configuration task to enable and disable the lazy load of administrative and sample Portlet Applications. When enabled the applications are not loaded during startup of the server but when accessed for the first time. The configuration task is also available in later fix packs like 6.1.0.3. 

The following Portlet Applications are affected by the task: 
"PA_Blurb"
"PA_MPagesandFavorites"
"PA_Properties"
"PA_Eecontentandlayout"
"PA_appearance"
"PA_Set_Permissions"
"PA_portletWiring"
"PA_ThemesAndSkinsMgr"
"PA_Resource_Manager"
"PA_TCustomizerPortApp"
"PA_Portlet_Manager"
"PA_Manage_Webservices"
"PA_Web"
"PA_Principals_Manager"
"PA_ResourceView"
"PA_Credential_Admin"
"PA_PolicyExplorer"
"PA_PolicyEditor"
"PA_PolicyEditorCA"
"PA_Settings"
"PA_URL_mapping"
"PA_UniqueNames"
"PA_Markups_Manager"
"PA_Clients_Manager"
"PA_Import_XML"
"PA_WCM_Admin"
"PA_FrequentUsers"
"PA_Tracing"
"PA_WPS_Welcome"
"PA_MageVirtualPortals"
"PA_TateCatalogPortApp"
"PA_PropertiesPortApp"
"PA_ParamConfig"
"PA_Roles"
"PA_ApplicationCatalog"
"PA_Policy_Status"

To enable lazy load, proceed as follows: 
a. Stop the portal server.
Note: If in a cluster environment make sure both DMGR and Nodeagents are running.
b. Enter the following command to run the appropriate configuration task for your specific operating system:

* UNIX:

./ConfigEngine.sh enable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password

* Windows:

ConfigEngine.bat enable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password

* i5/OS:

ConfigEngine.sh -profileName profile_root enable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password



To disable lazy load, proceed as follows: 
a. Stop the portal server.
Note: If in a cluster environment make sure both DMGR and Nodeagents are running.
b. Enter the following command to run the appropriate configuration task for your specific operating system:

* UNIX:

./ConfigEngine.sh disable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password

* Windows:

ConfigEngine.bat disable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password

* i5/OS:

ConfigEngine.sh -profileName profile_root disable-portal-light-startup-performance
-DPortalAdminPwd=password -DWasPassword=password


Limitations of lazy load: 

 * If applications are manually stopped, e.g. via the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console or wsadmin, and they are accessed by users, the applications are automatically started again. 
 * When using the activation task (ConfigEngine.bat|.sh activate-portlets) to activate all portlets, all portlets are started, even if they are set for lazy load.
