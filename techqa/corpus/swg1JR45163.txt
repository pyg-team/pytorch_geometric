ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPM uses three temporary directories for storing temp files.
   /tmp
       /opt/ibm/BPM/v7.5/profiles/ProcCtr01/temp/com.ibm.bpm.fds
       /opt/ibm/BPM/v7.5/profiles/ProcCtr01/wstemp
   The WSTEMP folder has some auto-clean up but manual clean up is
   sometimes needed; refer to:

   try/deleting_temporary_files_in_websphere_application_server
   For the OS temporary and BPM temp directory. These are not
   cleaned up from BPM.
   The following files can be found in the directories:
   -application imports (twx, saved as zip)
   -application exports (tw saved as zip)
   -managed asset files - CSS, JAR, png, etc. These gnenerally do
   not have extensions
   -compiled data (jars) from inbound WSDL calls
   BPM should auto-clean up these files after some time. Excessive
   build up will consume large amounts of disk space.
   Raised as concern in PMRs:
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  manually delete these files, recommending files that currently
   do not have a OS file lock AND are older than one (1) day
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem will be fixed in the future release.
