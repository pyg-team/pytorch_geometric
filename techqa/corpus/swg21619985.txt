QUESTION
 We are in the process of planning for a future project and need to know if there is a limit to the number of sources we can have defined. Is there a limit to the number of sources that can be defined? 

ANSWER
The limit for the number of sources is 1,000 across all entity types (i.e. the combined total cannot exceed 1,000 across all entity types combined). However, the actual limit on the number of sources depends heavily on your hardware and environment factors.
One of these factors is on the database side. You will likely have a problem with candidate selection, due to a database limitations. A member can only be compared to a maximum of 1,000 other members across different sources. One possible way this will be seen is when a member is part of an entity that has members in over 1000 sources - you will not be returning all of the members of the entity. This is currently a limitation for all databases that we support. 

You will need to test with the number of sources that you need to ensure that your hardware and database can handle the number of sources you require.
