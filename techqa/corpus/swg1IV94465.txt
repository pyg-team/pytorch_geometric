   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * There was a class cast exception                             *
   * psdi.plust.app.workorder.PlusTWMAssignment incompatible with *
   * psdi.app.workorder.WO when saving a labor. This is due to    *
   * the fact that psdi.plust.app.workorder.PlusTWMAssignment     *
   * does not extend psdi.app.workorder.WO.                       *
