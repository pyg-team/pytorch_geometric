   This APAR also includes a number of additional product fixes:
   1. Fix abend S0C4 in Exit Router (CEXEXRTR) when using SSL
   ports with statistics collection active.
   2. Fix abend S0C4 in Batch Take-up Utility (CEXBDST0) when
   message exit not present in the standard list.
   3. Fix statistics column overflow problem in Status Monitor
   to show nnnK or nnnM as appropriate.
   4. Change batch utilities to support 45 byte DNS names.
   5. Fix incorrect display of interval start time in Status
   Monitor when interval not yet active.
   6. Fix user message exit INIT failure in IMS Connect when
   exit has been disabled due to an initialization error in
   Message Translation.
   7. Fix incorrect editing of hex values in Batch Maintenance
   Utility and Installation Verification Program (IVP).
   8. Issue more informative message when Unicode Services
   callable service routine not found: new error messages

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is adding the following new function:
   The transaction timer feature allows time-out values to be
   specified for a transaction and any associated acknowledgements.
   These values may be specified and activated in the
   IMS Connect Extensions transaction definition.
   Time-out values are specified in IRM_TIMER format
   as documented in the IMS Connect Guide and Reference:
   Hex Value Description
   00        (default)
   E9        (no timer)
   FF        (wait indefinitely)
   01-27     (.nn second)
   28-63     (nn seconds)
   63-9E     (nn minutes)
   To activate this feature, a transaction should be
   defined and populated with appropriate time-out values.
   Refer to the IMS Connect Extensions Guide for a description
   of how to define a transaction.
   The following Dialog and the Batch Utilities have been
   changed to support this new feature:
   a. The Dialog transaction definition panel CEXDFTXN and
      associated help panels.  The following new fields have
      been added to the panel:
   / Activate Transaction Timer Message timeout . 19 (.25 second)
                          ACK/NAK timeout . 28  (1 second)
   b. The Batch Definition Maintenance Utility CEXDFDSI.
      The following new parameters have been added to the
      transaction definition statement:
                                                +-,REPLACE=NO--+
   --DEFN=(TXN,name)--+--------------------+--+--------------+--->
                      +- ,DESC-"description"-+  +-,REPLACE=YES-+
     +-,TRANSACTION_TIMER=(+-INACTIVE-+,+-,MSGTO=xx,ACKTO=xx)
   -+---------------------+----------+-+-------------------------->
                          +-ACTIVE---+
   c. The Batch Definition Extract Utility CEXDFDSO.  This
      utility has been changed to support the new transaction
      definition parameters.
   This APAR has also corrected the additional problems that were
   mentioned above.
