ABSTRACT
 The search criteria displays only the properties that are in all classes in a multi-class search. 

CONTENT
IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office supports multi-class searches when all of the properties are common between all classes.

However, if a multi-class search was created by using the IBM FileNet Workplace XT file designer, and the multi-class search criteria contains properties that exist in one class, but not in other classes, when the search is opened in IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office, the search criteria displays only the properties that are common between all classes.
