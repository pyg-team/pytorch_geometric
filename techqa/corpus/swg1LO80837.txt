ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an iNotes user receives a mail with 2007 word or excel
   attachments, the MIME type is incorrect.
   STEPS
   1). Access iNotes on Domino 901
   2). create a new memo and attach the Test1.docx (or any file
   with .docx), send it to yourself
   3). Open the new document and look at the source to check the
   MIME, you will see the following MIME type instead of correct
   MIME type.
   Domino server creates the following mime content, which is
   WRONG:
   Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="Test1.docx"
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Test1.docx"
   Instead of ;
   Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel .
   This is the same way I reproduced in Domino 853.
