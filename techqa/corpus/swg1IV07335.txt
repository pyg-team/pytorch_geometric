PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Version 1.1.0.1 has been released for IBM CICS Explorer. This is
   available via two options:
   
   1. Update the CICS Explorer from within the CICS Explorer using
   the IBM-hosted Update-Site.
   2. Download the update from Fix Central to be installed locally
   into the CICS Explorer.
   
   Updating using the Update-Site
   * Start CICS Explorer.
   * Select Help -> Check for Updates from the main menu.
   * An update should be found for the CICS Explorer, verify that
   the update version is 1.1.0.1_201109081915 or higher.
   * Click through the wizard to install the update.
   * Once the update has completed you'll be prompted to restart
   the CICS Explorer for the update to take effect. Click Yes.
   * Optionally, verify that the CICS Explorer version has been
   updated:
     * Select Help -> About IBM CICS Explorer from the main menu
   and note the version, it should be 1.1.0.1 or higher.
   
   Note: The version of the CICS Explorer may now be higher than
   1.1.0.1 as the update updates to the latest version of the CICS
   Explorer.
   All updates are cumulative so the latest version contains this
   update as well as any later updates.
   The CICS Explorer is now up-to-date with this update installed,
   and no further action is necessary.
   
   If no update was found using the above steps, verify that the
   version of the CICS Explorer is prior to 1.1.0.1.
   To do this select Help -> About IBM CICS Explorer from the main
   menu and note the version currently installed.
   If the version is lower than 1.1.0.1 and no update was found,
   then make sure that the IBM-hosted Update Site is installed (it
   is by default):
   * Click Window->Preferences
   * Select the Install/Update->Available Software Sites preference
   * Make sure there is an entry with name "IBM CICS Explorer
   Update Site" and a location of:
     http://download.boulder.ibm.com [http://download.boulder.ibm.com]
     /ibmdl/pub/software/htp/cics/updates/explorer/1.1/latest/
     (concatenate the URL above).
   * If the entry is not there, or incorrect, delete the existing
   entry, and click Add... and add the url above into the text box
   and click OK.
   * Retry updating the CICS Explorer as already described
   previously.
