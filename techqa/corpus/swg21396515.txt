 When you experience a problem with IBM Installation Manager, collecting this information before contacting IBM Support will help clarify the problem and save time analyzing the data. It also will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and will save you time. This MustGather document contains instructions for general issues regarding IBM Installation Manager; for any product-specific uses of Installation Manager, refer to the Related Information section of this "Collecting Data" document. 

ANSWER
When working on problems with Installation Manager, it is essential for IBM Support to have all Installation Manager system specific reference files. The location is centrally managed within Installation Manager log storage which hosts configuration settings, logs, uninstall.exe, the installation registry XML file, and subsidiary data. This provides more information than a single Installation Manager xml log. IBM Support can use the data to diagnose the problems and learn the history of Installation Manager usage.
