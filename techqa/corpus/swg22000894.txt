PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You load projects into your CICS Explorer workspace that use the project facet feature and see warnings in your Problems view, like this:
* Implementation of project facet java could not be found. Functionality will be limited. / <plug-in name here> / Unknown / Faceted Project Problem
* Implementation of project facet osgi.bundle could not be found. Functionality will be limited. / <plug-in name here> / Unknown / Faceted Project Problem

When you try export your projects, the export fails and the error "Host plug-in JavaSE_0.0.0 has not been found." is reported. 

SYMPTOM
The projects you load into your CICS Explorer workspace are from somebody else (perhaps an example application or some code that other members of your team have been working on). These projects use the project facet feature although they might not explicitly be Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) projects.


CAUSE
Eclipse project facet support is included with the Eclipse Java EE features. 

If the projects you import have been created to use project facets, then Eclipse will be unable to work with them correctly unless the Eclipse Java EE features are installed, even if you are not using any specific Java EE function.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the Faceted Project Problem, you must have the Eclipse Java EE features installed. 

Install the IBM CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support feature into your CICS Explorer environment. See Installing the CICS SDK for web and JSP [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.core.help/topics/tasks/task_install_web_sdk.html] in the CICS Explorer User Guide for more information.
