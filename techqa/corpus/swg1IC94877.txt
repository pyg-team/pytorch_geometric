APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When DataPower is configured as an SSL server that requests
   client authentication, it might incorrectly reject certain large
   ClientVerify SSL handshake messages from the client.
   
   Specifically it might incorrectly reject any ClientVerify
   messages created with RSA keys larger than 4096 bits.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SSL handshakes where DataPower is the SSL server might fail if
   there is client authentication and the client's RSA key is
   larger than 4096 bits.  For example 8192-bit RSA clients might
   not do client authentication successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 4.0.2.15, 5.0.0.10, and 6.0.0.2.
