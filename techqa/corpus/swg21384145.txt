Title: IBM Not all IC transactions are eliminated on the top group level - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After running consolidation with status there are still some uneliminated amounts on the consolidated top group on an intercompany account. 

SYMPTOM
The control table has been set up, including the difference posting section, but still not all transactions are eliminated.


CAUSE
There are intercompany transactions reported against a counter company that is not connected to the top group, either directly or via sub group(s).

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
One way of finding intercompany transactions that will remain uneliminated is to run the reconciliation report under Group/Reconcile/Intercompany balances with the option “Only transactions within own group” unticked. Then you will get a section at the end of the report with “Balances with other companies”. 

However, to get a company included in that report it has to be connected to a group (can be any group including a "dummy" group" created specifically for this purpose), according to the selected consolidation type. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Adjust the reported values on the intercompany account so that only correct company codes within the group are used as counter companies. 

You can also remove the tick in the checkbox for “valid counterpart” under Maintain/Company structure/Define, for companies that should not be available to use in the counter company selection.
