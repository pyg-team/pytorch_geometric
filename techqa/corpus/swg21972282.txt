RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The reports will need to be imported to resolve the data source configuration error.

The BirtReports.zip and TSM_Cognos.zip files from the installation package will be needed, these can be found in the COI\PackageSteps\BirtReports\FILES path.

Change to the following directory:

C:\IBM\Tivoli\tipv2components\TCRComponent\bin

Run the following commands, substituting the actual path to the report files and using the actual password for the tipadmin account.

trcmd.bat -import -bulk <path to file>\BirtReports.zip -username tipadmin -password <password>
trcmd.bat -import -bulk <path to file>\TSM_Cognos.zip -username tipadmin -password <password>

Successful import of the report files should resolve the problem configuring the data source and allow reports to be accessed via the Tivoli Integrated Portal.
