Title: IBM WEBGUI: User session becomes invalid - United States

Text:
timeout; invalid session TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Usage of several WebGUI/Webtop TIP interface features have been identified to encounter user session being timed out and become invalid. 

SYMPTOM
Upon failure of user's action on the identified features, users will be directed back to the TIP login page with the following error. 

"Your session has become invalid. This is due to a session timeout or an administrator has logged you out"


CAUSE
Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 6 update 29 (1.6.0_29) installed on the WebGUI/Webtop client. The offending Oracle JRE version 1.6.0_29 has been identified to contain a secure connection bug which is fixed in JRE version 6 update 30 (1.6.0_30).


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

The use of the following features have been identified to encounter the problem are: 

1. Having failed to create or modify maps via Java Map Editor. 

2. Saving a filter via Filter builder interface 

3. Saving a view via View builder interface 

4. Clicking on a monitor box on an Event Dashboard whose click action is configured to update an AEL on the same page 

5. Executing an action that triggers the sending of a TIP event through TIP wire to an AEL originating from features made available from other integrated products such as IBM Tivoli Network Manager and Tivoli Business Service Manager



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

WebGUI/Webtop client machines that are currently installed with the offending JRE version 1.6.0_29 are advised to upgrade to the unaffected JRE version 1.6.0_30 

Those that are installed with versions prior to the offending JRE version 1.6.0_29 are advised to skip this version and upgrade directly to JRE version 1.6.0_30
