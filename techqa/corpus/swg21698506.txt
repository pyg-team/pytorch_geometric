VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3569 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3569]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols by the ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an unexpected handshake to trigger a NULL pointer dereference and cause the daemon to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99706 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99706] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704] for the current score
