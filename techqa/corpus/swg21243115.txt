PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You upgrade to a new release of z/OS and CICS Transaction Server fails to initialize. You see the following messages:

DFHAP1203I Language Environment is being initialized.
DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control. 

CAUSE
There is a mismatch in z/OS levels between Language Environment modules, CEECCICS and CEEPLPKA.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that there is only one instance of CEEPLPKA and CEECCICS in your library concatenations, and that they are at the correct z/OS level.
