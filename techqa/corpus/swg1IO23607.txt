APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The application involves physical scanning with the Start Batch
   Panel enabled. After the images have been scanned in, put the
   batch on 'Hold' status. Then try to process the same batch,
   click on any image within the batch, the image is not displayed
   in the Viewer pane.
   
   Try an application without the Start Batch Panel, perform the
   same steps. With the batch on 'Hold' status, click it from
   Datacap Desktop to process, select any image, the image is
   displayed in the Viewer pane.
   
   Thus it is narrowed down to having the Start Batch Panel enabled
   causing the behavior.
