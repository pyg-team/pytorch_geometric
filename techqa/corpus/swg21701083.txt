PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM historical exports statistics query is not returning any data for the KYN agent 7.1 FP3 IF8. Also situations based on this attribute group, e.g. "last export status" are , are not working. No errors in TEPS/TEMS and KYN logs 

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for AD (YN Agent) 7.1 FP3 IF8 
KAX component for the YN agent is 622 FP2
OS Agent 630 FP4
KAX component for OS agent is 630 FP4

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The YN Agent is a 32-Bit Agent and despite the fact that the OS Agent is now 630 FP4 and its accompanying KAX component, the YN Agent is still using the 622 FP2 KAX (TEMA) component and seeing all the issues associated with this older version of the TEMA. This is because 32-Bit agents need 32-Bit TEMAs to work. 

You should upgrade the YN Agent's KAX component by using the command-


tacmd updateframework -n <endpoint:UX) -v 063004000 

 
This will update the 32-Bit TEMA component on the endpoint so that it may work properly with the 630 FP4 Proxy on the TEMS.
