Title: IBM Security Bulletin for IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker: Multiple security vulnerabilities in IBM JREs 6 & 7 - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple security vulnerabilities exist in the IBM Javaâ„¢ Runtime Environment component of WebSphere Message Broker for IBM JRE 6 SR16 (and earlier) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment component of IBM Integration Bus for JRE 7 SR7 (and earlier). This also includes a fix for the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) SSLv3 vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). These were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2014 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker are shipped with an IBM SDK for Java that is based on the Oracle JDK. Oracle has released critical patch updates which contain security vulnerability fixes and the IBM SDK for Java has been updated to incorporate those updates.

Vulnerabilities affecting WebSphere Message Broker/IBM Integration Bus
The vulnerabilities that are affecting IBM Integration Bus and WebSphere Message Broker are:

CVE-2014-6457, CVE-2014-6558, CVE-2014-3065, CVE-2014-3566

The following list may impact broker depending on what Java code a user has deployed to the broker:
CVE-2014-6511, CVE-2014-6512, CVE-2014-6468, CVE-2014-3566

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.
