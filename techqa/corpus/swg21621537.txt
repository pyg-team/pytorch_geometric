PROBLEM
While executing upgrade-profile task it fails with following : 

From the ConfigTrace.log : 


/usr/IBM/WebSphere8/PortalServer/jcr/wp.content.repository.install/config/includes/jcr.mig_cfg.xml:215: java.lang.Exception: org.xml.sax.SAXException: The database name component of the object qualifier must be the name of the current database. 
at com.ibm.cm.jcr.migrator.MigrationController.execute(MigrationController.java:139) at org.apache.tools.ant.UnknownElement.execute(UnknownElement.java:275) 
at org.apache.tools.ant.Task.perform(Task.java:364) 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
MSSQL is case-sensitive. 


In this particular case, the name of database would be in upper case in the server, but the name specified in wkplc_dbdomain.properties is in lower case. 

Hence update in wkplc_dbdomain.properties appropriately and re-run the upgrade-profile task. 
For instance, 
Change jcr.DbName=jcr615db to jcr.DbName=JCR615DB
