APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enterprise Manager export or import of a document whose filename
   does not contain extension in the filename does not import or
   export the document.  Export fails with an "XML document must
   have a top level element" error.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1.  Add a file without an extension in the filename to P8 using
   workplace.
   2.  Export the document using EM, and specifying the content
   folder.
   
   Actual Results:
   Document export fails with an "XML document must have a top
   level element" error.
   
   Expected Results:
   Enterprise Manager should export and import files that do not
   have file extensions without error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One workaround is to not specify the content folder during the
   export operation.  This workaround only works for small exports,
   as it loads the entire export XML into memory and may lead to an
   out of memory exception if the export is large.  Another
   workaround is to add extensions to the filenames.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * P8 4.0.1 FileNet Enterprise Manager - import/export          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Exporting documents with content fails if either a) the      *
   * RetrievalName property is specified but the file name has no *
   * extension or b) a ContentFolder is specified in FileNet      *
   * Enterprise Manager (FEM) when                                *
   * exporting the document.  A workaround for the problem can be *
   * used and export accomplished by either specifying a file     *
   * extension or not specifying the Content folder in FEM        *
   * however this workaround is not always feasible.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to the P8CE-4.0.1-013 fix pack to get the fix for    *
   * this problem.                                                *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The underlying export code failed to handle the non-file
   extension scenario.  The defective code has been fixed to handle
   this and exporting documents with content succeeds regardless of
   if a file extension is used or content folder specified.  The
   problem has been fixed in the P8CE-4.0.1-013 fix pack.
