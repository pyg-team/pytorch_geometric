APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Receiving a message saying parm TRCLEV in the
   DIAGNOSTIC_STATISTIC SECTION is UNKNOWN.
   
   The syntax checker incorrectly flag parm TRCLEV in the
   DIAGNOSTIC_STATISTIC section as 'unknown' as it should accept
   this parm.
   In the keyword definition module DFSWDRDF, the parms chain does
   not include the TRCLEV parm where it should.
   
   Encountering a 'loop' occurs when I look in 'HELP > ABOUT', with
   message:
   	ISPP100  Panel "DFSWHAB " error.  Panel not found.
   ISPP100  Panel "DFSWHAB " error.  Panel not found.

   - in the DIAGNOSTIC_STATISTIC section of the general PROCLIB
   member DFSDFxxx:
        - the parameters TRCLEV, NAME, LEVEL, PAGES.
   
   - in the IMS Connect configuration member HWSCFGxx:
         - in the HWS statement: the parameters CASCADE, MULTIRTP,
   TMRACFST, WTORCMD.
         - in the ODACCESS statement: the parameter ODRACFST.
