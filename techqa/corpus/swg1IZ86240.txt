APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Apply button in the Event Enrichment Wizard does not execute
   successfully.  An attempt to execute it results in a javascript
   error relating to script.js.  The wizard can be completed, but
   will be missing the following line:
   
   'EnrichmentOrgNodes[0].<Fieldname>=<Objectserverfieldname>'
   
   The problem occurs only when the server has been set to use a
   language other than English in
   $NCHOME/impact/etc/NCI_server.props and
   $NCHOME/guiserver/etc/server.props
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The missing line can be manually added.  The only other option
   is to run the server using an English locale.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Event Enrichment wizard Apply button is not working. As a
   result, the condition will not be added to the policy for
   example:
