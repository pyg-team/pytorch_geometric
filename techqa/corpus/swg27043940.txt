 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 The Case Manager Platform Installer Tool, for single server installations, may fail at step 31 which is the step that runs configPE.bat.

You may see this error in the installation log:
OUTPUT>Terminated with error:
OUTPUT>Error: [FNRPE1210000029E]Database object name is already used by an existing object

To Work around this issue perform the following steps:
1. Copy PEInitD.properties from C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\install-scripts to C:\Program Files\IBM\FileNet\ContentEngine\tools\PE
2. Manually initialize the region by running C:\Program Files\IBM\FileNet\ContentEngine\tools\PE\peinit.bat
3. Remove the cmpit.properties file from IBM Case Manager Platform Installation Tool folder where you ran the 5.2.1-CMPIT-WIN.exe.
4. Replace the existing file it with the cmpit.properties from C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\cpit\install-scripts directly.
5. Edit the PROCESSED_31 entry to change its value to YES in cmpit.properties file and save the file.This will cause the ase Manager Platform installer to resume at the next (32nd) step.
6. The Case Manager Platform Installer should start at step 32/38 and complete successfully.
