QUESTION
 jdbc calls are observed in the ITCAM for AD/WAS product. Does this mean that ITCAM can be used to monitor "MySQL" also? 

ANSWER
ITCAM for WAS / Application Diagnostics was designed to monitor J2EE based WAS and non-WAS servers. Whenever Level 2 or Level 3 monitoring is enabled, you will be able to see the JDBC call response times in live component traces and reports. If you have ITCAM for Transactions enabled/configured, you will see jdbc methods/calls there too. Thus, it is possible to track the response time of every SQL call to a MySQL database. 

This does not mean you can monitor the MySQL database, as ITCAM for WAS/AD is not designed to do that. If you do want to monitor the MySQL database you must use the ITM Universal Agent to do that or if you want to monitor other Databases like DB2, Oracle, you can use another ITM agent for that. 

The ITCAM for WAS/AD application only sees JDBC calls and you can get an idea of how long these method calls took in the application. For other detailed monitoring aspects of the MySQL or DB2 or Oracle database, use UA or another specific agent for that database itself.
