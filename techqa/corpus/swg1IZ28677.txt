ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has created an OperarorView in Impact 4 which works
   fine. However on restarting Impact they have noticed
   the following error message in wasce.log:
   
   10:21:40,071 ERROR [ManagerBase] IOException while loading
   persisted sessions: java.io.WriteAbortedException: writing
   aborted; java.io.NotSerializableException:
   com.micromuse.response.client.soapclient.OpviewEventPair
   java.io.WriteAbortedException: writing aborted;

   According to L3 this is a non-fatal error message and does not
   affect the operation of the program.
   
   Here is the more analytic description:
   
   "This is something that should be fixed. I fixed a similar issue
   for the GUI Server. Basically, anything placed into the
   HttpSession within the application code must be serializable.
   From the error message, there is information that is placed into
   the session that is not serializable. Under certain conditions,
   the application server will serialize session data and when
   restarted deserialize it. If it is unable to do so, the attached
   error message will appear in the logs. As Yasser mentioned, it
   is a non-fatal error, but it is noisy and confusing to
   non-developers."
