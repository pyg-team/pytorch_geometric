PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  No Intent to FixAfter discussion between PowerPlay and Drill thr
   ough product management and development, it was determined that
   this particular defect would require an extremely complex, high
   risk code change that could have a broad impact on Cognos 10 BI
   drill through. Since this situation would arise only in rare cir
   cumstances, we are not intending to fix this defect.
