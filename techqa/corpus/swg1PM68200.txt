APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you open a module in exclusive edit mode, a given amount of
   memory is consumed.
   
   However, if you open a module in read-only mode, then switch to
   read-only more, vastly more memory can be consumed.
   
   Testing with a module containing 5000 objects and 100 text
   attributes, each containing a small line of text, opening
   directly in exclusive edit mode consumed approximately 800MB.
   When first going via read-only mode, this figure increases by
   approximately 200MB.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The underlying design for this functionality cannot be
   easily changed.  Improvements have been made in memory
   handling to help reduce the occurrence of this.
