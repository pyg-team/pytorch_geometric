APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  VISUALIZATION: CANNOT ADD IMPLEMENTS RELATIONSHIP IF SUPPLIER
   INTERFACE EXISTS MORE THAN ONCE IN THE REFERENCED PROJECTS
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Even if you add the implements relationship manually to
   Class1.java, and attempt to use
   Filters->Show/Hide Relationships
   you will not be able to show the relationship on the diagram
   
   Additionally, if you delete both views from the diagram, and
   drop them again, the relationship
   will not be added to the diagram, even if the Implements exists
   in the code.
   
   However, you can detect if the problem will occurr by doing the
   following:
   
   1. select the visualized class
   
   2. select the implements tool
   
   3. Click on the class and then drag the connector towards the
   white space on the diagram
   
   4. You will see a menu with the choices:
   
   Create Java Implementation To New Java Interface
   Create Java Implementation to Existing Element
   
   5. Choose the second option
   
   6. Type the Interface name
   
   7. If you find multiple exact matches, then you will most likely
   have this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the workspace contains a type with the same qualified
   name
   as a type defined in one of the referenced libraries
   (ex. java.l
   ang.String), creating a relationship where the
   target is this "c
   lone" type causes problems. This is because
   the qualified name i
   s resolved to the type found first based
   on the build class path
    order.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix delivered - cancel the operation as soon as we
   realize that the type being used to create the relationship
   is not the type selected by the user. We also bring up an
   error message indicating the problem and providing the user
   a possible fix.
   "Could not create the relationship because the target type
   could not be resolved properly.
   Check the order of project dependencies in Java Build Path
   preferences to ensure that other projects/libraries
   containing a type with the same qualified name are placed
   lower than the project/library containing the selected
   target type."
