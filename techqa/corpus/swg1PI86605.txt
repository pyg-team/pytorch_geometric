PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our knowledge centers monthly. The following
   Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the month_year
   update to the Knowledge Centers. To access the latest on-line
   documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 8.5 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: 781157
   Problem: Customer was configuring SSL between the IHS
   administration server and the WebSphere deployment manager
   when he encountered an error trying to stop or start IHS from
   the admin console, "Could not make a connection to the IBM
   HTTP Administration server on node
   server_nodename/webserver_name"
   IHS admin_error.log has the error, SSL0223E.  SSL Handshake
   Failed, No certificate
   Knowledge center topic, Configure SSL between the IBM HTTP
   Server Administration Server and the deployment manager, is
   unclear and incomplete and needs updating.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Configure SSL between the IBM HTTP
   Server Administration Server and the deployment manager, is
   updated as follows:
   Procedure step 1 a and b now reads:
   Procedure
   
    (1) Obtain a server certificate. Create a CMS key database
   and create a new self-signed certificate for the IHS
   administration server.
        -   Use the iKeyman utility or gskcapicmd command line for
   distributed operating systems. Use the gskkyman tool for z/OS ?
   operating systems. For more information about command line
   instructions for creating the CMS key database and self-signed
   certificate, see IBM HTTP Server certificate management .
       The following steps assume that you are using the iKeyman
   facility
        a.   Use the IHS iKeyman utility graphical user interface
   to create a CMS key database file. For more information, see
   Working with key databases
        b.   Use the IHS iKeyman utility graphical user interface
   to create a new self-signed certificate for the IHS
   Administration Server and save the certificate as
   /conf/admin.kdb. For more information, see Creating a
   self-signed certificate.
   
   Step 3 b NOTE (bullet #3) now reads:
   In the admin.conf file, the SSLServerCert label name must
   match the certificate label name of the personal certificate
   in ikeyman stored in the IHS admin.conf's admin.kdb file. If
   these labels do not match, IHS does not start from the
   WebSphere administration console and the IHS admin_error.log
   will log the error SSL0223E: SSL Handshake Failed, No
   certificate.
   
   Step #3 b bullet #4 now reads and bullet #5 is new:
    If the self-signed personal certificate in the IHS admin.kdb
   file is not flagged as the default certificate, the previous
   example uses the SSLServerCert directive.
   Alternatively, instead of using SSLServerCert, open the
   admin.kdb in ikeyman and click view/edit the self-signed
   certificate under the personal certificate section. At the
   bottom of the page, check the box set the certificate as the
   default.
