APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Rational Developer for z (RDz / IDz) Host Connection
   Emulator (HCE) does not support TLS 1.2 with MS-CAPI
   
   When you select to connect using HCE you have the option of
   choosing SSL > TLS.
   
   The two sides then negotiate the version to use for the session
   and the supported ciphers.
   
   The underlying code used by the HCE does not provide TLS 1.2
   with MS-CAPI.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use JKS connection instead of MS-CAPI.
   
   This APAR provided the ability to use a JKS for TLS v1.2 in the
   RDz client v9.5.1.2:
