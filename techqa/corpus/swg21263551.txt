PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use the instructions in this technote if you do not have a default profile created in your IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD) version 7.0 and cannot create a new profile for WebSphere® Application Server v6.1, or if you would like to create a new profile. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To create a new WebSphere Application Server v6.1 profile using the WebSphere Profile Management Tool wizard, you have two options, either from within or from outside RAD v7.0. 

Creating a profile from within RAD v7.0 

 1. Select Window > Preferences... 
 2. Select Server > WebSphere 
 3. Under the pane specifying: WebSphere profiles defined in the runtime selected above, click the Create button 
 4. Follow the steps below on WebSphere Profile Tool wizard


Creating a profile outside of RAD v7.0  1. Shut down RAD v7 
 2. Navigate to the following directory: <rad_home>\runtimes\base_v61\bin\ProfileManagement 
 3. Run pmt.bat to launch the WebSphere Profile Tool wizard. 
 4. Follow the steps below on WebSphere Profile Tool wizard



WebSphere Profile Tool wizard  1. Create a profile  1. When the Welcome dialog appears, click Next. 
     2. When the Environment Selection dialog appears, click Next.
        Please note, if any WebSphere Feature Packs such as the IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 Feature Pack for Web Services have been installed on WebSphere Application Server v6.1, then you will see the option as a function choice to add to the profile creation on this page:
        
        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21263551&amp;aid=1]
        
        
        
     3. When the Profile Creation Options dialog appears, select the Advanced profile creation radio button.
        Note: If you select Typical, by default your profile will Run the application server process as a Windows service, which is not recommended for a development environment. 
     4. When the Administrative Security dialog appears, uncheck the Enable administrative security, checkbox and click Next.
        Note: The default profile does not store a username and password, however, you can enable this option as well. 
     5. When the Window Service Definition dialog appears, uncheck the Run the application as a Windows service, checkbox and click Next.
        Note: It is recommended to uncheck this option as running as a system service on start-up is not desired in a development environment and consumes resources. 
     6. When the Profile Creation Summary dialog page appears, confirm the details to be correct, and click Create.
    
    
 2. Verify the new profile has been created successfully  1. Navigate to the following directory: <rad_home>\runtimes\base_v61\bin\profiles\ 
     2. Ensure that a folder with the profile was created. If you did not specify the name of the profile, by default it should appear as: AppSrvXX, where X is a number between 0-9.
    
    
 3. Run RAD v7.0 and create a new server  1. From the main menu select File > New > Other > Server > Server. 
     2. Click Next. 
     3. Select WebSphere v 6.1 Server. 
     4. When the WebSphere Server Settings dialog appears, for the WebSphere profile name select the name of the profile you have just created. 
     5. Click Next. 
     6. Click Finish.
    
    


You have just successfully created a new profile and attached it to a new server.
