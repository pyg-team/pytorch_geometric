Title: IBM Ability to wrap text in WebGUI Journal window - United States

Text:
journal; long; text TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You would like to be able to specify that long text in Journal should wrap. 

ANSWER
There was an APAR back in Webtop 1.3.1 and it is APAR IY88204. The APAR added a new property called ael.journal.linewrap that could be set to true to wrap long Journal text. The feature is not available in Web GUI 7.3.1, but it is available in Web GUI 7.4. If you want the feature in 7.3.1, you would need to raise a RFE.
