Title: IBM Duplicate Plug-in Propagation result messages seen using WebSphere Application Server release V8 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running the Plug-in Propagation from either the WebSphere administration console or command line, you may see duplicate result messages. 

SYMPTOM
These duplicate messages will also be recorded in the configure_<webserver>_webserver.log which is generated during the use of the Plugin Configuration Tool. 

example:
{Plugins_Home}\logs\config\configure_IHS_webserver.log

PLGC0062I: The plug-in configuration file is propagated from C:\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\dmgr01\config\cells\WASCell01\nodes\WASNode01\servers\webserver1\plugin-cfg.xml to C:\WebSphere\Plugins/config/webserver1/plugin-cfg.xml on the Web server computer.

PLGC0048I: The propagation of the plug-in configuration file is complete for the Web server. WASCell01.WASNode01.webserver1.

PLGC0048I: The propagation of the plug-in configuration file is complete for the Web server. WASCell01.WASNode01.webserver1


CAUSE
A code path was discovered in which, if security is disabled, the propagation processing will occur twice.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The additional propagation does not have any adverse affects on the environment. The duplicate messages can safely be ignored. 

This issue will be corrected in the next major release of the WebSphere Application Server.
