LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Microsoft Outlook, e-mail documents can be flagged as
   private.
   Content Collector could not read this information. Therefore,
   you could not use this e-mail property for configuring decision
   points in task routes if, for example, you did not want to
   archive private e-mail or if you wanted to archive it into a
   different repository location.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with Fix Pack 2, you can define a the private flag as a
   custom metadata field that can be used for configuring decision
   points in task routes. For details, see the techdoc on using
   message properties in IBM InfoSphere Content Collector when
