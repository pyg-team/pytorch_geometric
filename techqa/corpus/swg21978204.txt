Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Netezza Platform Software clients - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 1, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Netezza Platform Software clients. IBM Netezza Platform Software has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0705 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0797]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 


CVEID: CVE-2016-0701 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0701]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, caused by the use of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters based on unsafe primes that are generated and stored in X9.42-style parameter files. By performing multiple handshakes using the same private DH exponent, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110234] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
