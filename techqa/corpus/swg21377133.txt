   Verify from system Hardware profile. 
 * What version of CDC component was installed?
   Should be stated in error message <V#R#M#>.

   Run following command on unix prompt “srvctl status database -d <Oracle Database Name>”. Replace <Oracle Database Name> with current Oracle Database in question.
