ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  *1. Problem summary include a full description of the specific
   doc change(s) to be made (indicate below):
   
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/rtrb_contro [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/rtrb_contro]
   llingtimeout.html
   .
   The paragraph describing ConnectionResponseTimeout is under the
   'HTTP   transport timeout properties' which states just
   underneath the header that these are deprecated features.  It
   might be more clear that this property still controls the total
   amount of time a request will run if it's moved up into the
   'Transport Channel Timeout Properties' section (or at least
   referenced here).
   .
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/xrun_transp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/xrun_transp]
   ort.html
   .
   This page also gives the ConnectionResponseTimeout as an HTTP
   transport custom property.  Technically, its true (since it
   covers both transports and channels), but it should be made more
   clear in the ConnectionResponseTimeout definition that it covers
   both, and thus isn't part of the deprecation.
   .
   Also, in previous versions, when installing the plugin for the
   HTTP server on z/OS, the 'TrustedProxy' custom property had to
   be set, and this was explained on the infocenter page.  This
   setting has disappeared from v6.1, and it would be helpful to
   mention this on the plugin installation page:
   .
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/trun_plugin [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.zseries.doc/info/zseries/ae/trun_plugin]
   _ihsz.html
   .
   Step 8 on this page covers what's needed in order for the
   appserver to read private headers (this was originally what the
   TrustedProxy property was intended to allow).  I think this is
   probably the most appropriate place to mention the TrustedProxy
   property is no longer needed for plugin installation.
   .
   *2. Impact to customers (externals):
   The current explanation in the infocenter doesn't give a clear
   explanation of where to set the output timer on z/OS.  Also,
   it's not clear whether TrustedProxy should continue to be used
   or not.
   .
   *3. Date requested for update to be completed (not published)
       Note: Target date really should be negotiated with ID
             person prior to opening the apar.
   .
   *4. InfoCenter / Admin Console help feature or book this
         problem affects (indicate below):
   Infocenter pages above.
   .
   *5. Does this change require the addition or deletion of
      InfoCenter articles?
         [ ]Yes
         [x]No

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  The Information Center needs to be updated. *
   ****************************************************************
   The topics "Controlling timeouts,"HTTP transport custom
   properties," and "HTTP transport channel custom properties,"
   that are contained in the z/OS version of the WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.1 Information Center, do not
   mention that the ConnectionResponseTimeout custom property can
   be specified for both HTTP transports and HTTP transport
   channels. Also, the topic "Installing and configuring the
   plug-in for IBM HTTP Server for WebSphere Application Server on
   z/OS" does not indicate that trust files provide the same
   functionality that was provided by the TrustedProxy custom
   property in earlier versions of the product.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR requires changes to documentation.
   
   NOTE: Periodically, we refresh the documentation on our Web
   site, so the changes might have been made before you read this
   text. To access the latest on-line documentation, go to the
   product library page at:
   
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   
   A change to the z/OS version of the WebSphere Application Server
   Version Version 6.1 Information Centers will be made available
   in March, 2008
   
   The topics "Controlling timeouts,and "HTTP transport custom
   properties" will be updated to indicate that the
   ConnectionResponseTimeout custom property can be specified for
   either HTTP transports or HTTP transport channels.
   
   The topic "HTTP transport channel custom properties" will be
   updated to include a description of the
   ConnectionResponseTimeout custom property.
   
   Step 8 of the topic ""Installing and configuring the plug-in for
   IBM HTTP Server for WebSphere Application Server on z/OS" will
   be updated to include the following note:
   
   The trust file provides the same functionality for the IBM HTTP
   Server for z/OS, powered by Apache, as the TrustedProxy custom
   property provided for the Version 5.3 HTTP Server for z/OS in
   earlier versions of the product.
