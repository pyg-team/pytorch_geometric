PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you are having problems installing Maximo Products on UNIX, it may be useful to collect the Debugging information. 

SYMPTOM
Installer fails on UNIX


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To capture the debug output from the Unix command line clients need to perform the following: 

Enter one of the following (based on which shell) at the command line prior to executing the installer:

export LAX_DEBUG=true 
or 
setenv LAX_DEBUG true 
or
LAX_DEBUG=true 
or 
set LAX_DEBUG or whatever would be appropriate for the Unix shell.

Then run the installer. The output that is produced should help debug the installer. If you cannot determine the issue based on the Debug information, please open a PMR and include the Debugging information.
