 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document explains how to create an LPD flight recorder trace for developer analysis. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This document explains how to setup the QSPL/QSPLDTAARA data area to enable the Spool Initialization IPL flight recorder trace for developer analysis of issues involving the QSPL data base during the IPL of an IBM i system. 

Note: Use of these instructions requires having either 6.1 PTF SI46162 [http://www-912.ibm.com/a_dir/as4ptf.nsf/ALLPTFS/SI46162] (C2305610) or 7.1 PTF SI47165 [http://www-912.ibm.com/a_dir/as4ptf.nsf/ALLPTFS/SI47165] (C7102279), or a superseding PTF, installed on your IBM i system.

Caution: When experiencing problems with spooled files, it is highly recommended to discuss the problem with a representative of the IBM i Global Support Center (iGSC) before following the instructions in this document. The problem might be a known issue that can be easily resolved through configuration changes, printer hardware settings, or Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs). In these cases, following these instructions might not be necessary. 
Creating the QSPLDTAARA Data Area to Enable the Spool Initialization IPL Flight Recorder 

To enable the Spool Initialization IPL flight recorder, use the following Create Data Area ( CRTDTAARA) command to create a data area called QSPLDTAARA in the QSPL library: 

CRTDTAARA DTAARA(QSPL/QSPLDTAARA) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(3) VALUE(NYN) AUT(*ALL) 







Sending the Spool Initialization IPL Flight Data to your iGSC Representative 

When requested by a representative of the IBM i Global Support Center (iGSC), use the following Dump System Object ( DMPSYSOBJ) command to collect the Spool Initialization IPL flight data: 

DMPSYSOBJ OBJ(QSPFLGHTRC) CONTEXT(QSPL) 

Note: The resulting QPSRVDMP spooled file can be downloaded to a PC using the instructions in the following document: 

N1019300: Copying the Text from a Spooled File Using System i Navigator [Copying%20the%20Text%20from%20a%20Spooled%20File%20Using%20System%20i%20Navigator] 

and then sent to your iGSC representative using the instructions in the following document: 

N1019224: MustGather: Instructions for Sending Data to IBM i Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019224] 







Changing the QSPLDTAARA Data Area to Enable the Spool Initialization IPL Flight Recorder 

If the QSPLDTAARA data area in the QSPL library already exists, use the following Change Data Area ( CHGDTAARA) command to change the second character to 'Y': 

CHGDTAARA DTAARA(QSPL/QSPLDTAARA (2 1)) VALUE(Y) 







Changing the QSPLDTAARA Data Area to Disable the Spool Initialization IPL Flight Recorder 

To disable the Spool Initialization IPL flight recorder, use the following Change Data Area ( CHGDTAARA) command to change the second character to 'N': 

CHGDTAARA DTAARA(QSPL/QSPLDTAARA (2 1)) VALUE(N)
