APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The C&DS Search Web Service documentation states users should be
   able to search on Topics tagged to objects within the C&DS
   repository.  It has been observed that users are unable to bring
   back any search results when constraining search queries that
   include topics.  Here are details/example:
   
   The following code snippet brings back the following results
   (these are correct results, note that it is NOT constraining on
   topics):
   
   retFields.add("$$repository/title_field_name");
   retFields.add("$$repository/author_field_name");
   retFields.add("$$repository/version_created_date_field_name");
   retFields.add("$$search/topics");
   retFields.add("$$search/topicsPath");
   Structured structCriteria = new Structured();
   
   ArrayList<QueryItem> items = new ArrayList<QueryItem>();
   QueryItem qItem = new QueryItem();
   qItem.setField("$$repository/keyword_field_name");
   qItem.setValue("CASH-JOB");
   items.add(qItem);
   
   structCriteria.setQueryItem(items);
   InitialSearch initialSearch = new InitialSearch();
   initialSearch.setStructured(structCriteria);
   request.setInitialSearch(initialSearch);
   PageResult results = search.search25(request);
   
   
   Search results are the following:
   qResult.getHitCount()1
   FieldName:$$repository/title_field_name
   FieldValue:CCC-Ingestion Job
   FieldName:$$repository/author_field_name
   FieldValue:admin
   FieldName:$$search/topics
   FieldValue:CCC
   FieldName:$$search/topicsPath
   FieldValue:/repository/Content Types/CCC
   
   
   Note the topic value set for the 1 object found  above (CCC).
   
   Next step is to augment the search code above to include
   '$$search/topics' as an additional queryItem. Attempts to use
   $$search/topics fail to return the expected value.
   
   For example, adding this additional queryItem:
   
   qItem1.setField("$$search/topics");
   qItem1.setValue("CCC");
   items.add(qItem1);
   
   No objects are returned. Have also tried doing a single
   free-form query, just returning objects tagged with the 'CCC'
   topic (no other search criteria):
   
   FreeFormQueryItem qItem = new FreeFormQueryItem();
   qItem.setValue("'$$search/topics' = 'CCC'");
   structCriteria.setFreeFormQueryItem(qItem);
   
   Result is that no objects are returned.
   
   
   It is known that users are not able to search for Topics within
   the DM thick client, however, the Web Services documentation
   (see attached) suggests that this is possible.
   
   See Chapter 3 Search Service concepts, page 11
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue has been reported to the IBM SPSS C&DS development
   team and investigation has found our documentation is incorrect.
   The functionality to search via topics is not available via
   Deployment Manager thick client or Deployment Manager web
   portal.
   
   It is recommended that you use LABELS rather than TOPICS for
   your C&DS repository objects as this is a searchable item.
