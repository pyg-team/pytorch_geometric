PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive an HTTP Client (4xx) or Server (5xx) error when you attempt to connect to host systems for the CICS Explorer or associated plug-ins. Some of the more commonly seen HTTP error status codes are 400, 404, 500, 503, and 504. If the Automatic Updates feature is enabled within the CICS Explorer then this happens every time you attempt to connect. Otherwise, the error occurs after you check for an updates. 

CAUSE
Proxy entries are often setup by users of CICS Explorer to enable updating of the CICS Explorer or plug-ins over the internet. When the proxy is enabled all network connections made by CICS Explorer subsequently will attempt to use the proxy.

The HTTP response might vary depending on the proxy setup and whether the address attempted is valid at the destination the proxy routes to. The proxy is started by the Eclipse Framework when the CICS Explorer update feature is started, either manually or by Automatic Updates. Therefore, with Automatic Updates enabled users are likely to experience this problem persistently.

ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer V1.0.0, V1.0.1 and V1.1.0 .

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In CICS Explorer, HTTP and HTTPS Proxy setup should have entries to allow necessary traffic to route through to the Internet. However, it should also have Proxy bypass setup to ensure that connections intended to stay within the local network are not directed through the Proxy. To do this within the CICS Explorer: 

 1. Click on Window > Preferences
    
    
 2. Click on Eclipse platform > Network Connections to display "Proxy entries" and "Proxy bypass"
    
    
 3. Add the addresses of servers on your local network


As this is a feature inherited from the Eclipse framework, see the Network Connections page [http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-net-preferences.htm] in the Eclipse manual for detailed instructions. 

The proxy features in CICS Explorer might not be the only proxy settings in your environment. If a third party or operating system proxy is in use, the settings should allow traffic from CICS Explorer to the relevant host systems. 

Alternatively, if your setup requires using a proxy server to gain access to your host systems: the Proxy setup should be configured to direct traffic through to the host servers. RELATED INFORMATION
