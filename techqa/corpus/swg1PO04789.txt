PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a standard user logs in and starts a new motivation, such
   as new Screening or new online application, the left hand
   navigation bar should automatically retreat or auto hide until
   the user leaves the Intelligent Evidence Gathering (IEG) script.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR is included in Release 6.2.0.2. Please refer the
   release notes under
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048751 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048751]
   PO04789, WorkItem:118764 - Resuming an IEG script from a
   Standard User Home page should result in the left hand
   navigation bar to retreat
   Previously in citizen portal, when logged in citizen started a
   new Screening or Application or resumed an existing one, the
   system was in some cases not hiding the left hand navigation
   bar of the Home page while the citizen entered data within the
   screening or application IEG script. This resulted in an
   inconsistent user experience for the citizen, and the
   possibility that the citizen might accidentally click on the
   left hand navigation bar of the Home page resulting in
   navigational issues.
   This issue has been resolved and the left-hand navigation bar
   of the Home page is now hidden consistently from the citizen
   when entering data within a screening or application IEG script
   and displayed again once the user completes or exits the IEG
   script.
   Customization Instructions:
   If there exists a custom motivation that does not go through
   the standard pages of UA OOTB flows such as
   "StartIntakeScript", "SetupScreening" or
   "StartNewLifeEventScript" for screening, intake or life events
   then that flow will have custom development impact.
   These standard pages by default call the OOTB Resolve.jspx
   before launching IEG pages in which the feature for retreating
   the left hand navigation bar is introduced. The new custom flow
   should make sure it is calling the Resolve.jspx page and its
   associated Resolve.properties in order for the left hand
   navigation bar to retreat properly on the new page.
   If calling Resolve.jspx in the custom flow is not feasible or
   if it is customized then the following JSP scriptlet must be
   included in the page which triggers the execution of the IEG
   script in order for the left hand navigation bar to be
   retreated.
   <JSP_SCRIPTLET> <![CDATA[
   out.print("<script>top.CuramExternalApp.hideAppNavigation();</sc
   ript>"); ]]> </JSP_SCRIPTLET>
   Similarly, if the finish page of the IEG script is customized
   then the following scriptlet must be explicitly included to
   resume the hidden left hand navigation bar making it visible
   and accessible to the user.
   <JSP_SCRIPTLET> <![CDATA[
   out.print("<script>top.CuramExternalApp.showAppNavigation();</sc
   ript>"); ]]> </JSP_SCRIPTLET>
