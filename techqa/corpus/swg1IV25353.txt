ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JEA has a business requirement to allow changes to asset and
   location
   when the status of a work order in APPR.  These types of
   changes are permitted only if the GL Account are not
   changed.  To accomplish this business requirement, JEA is
   attempting to
   modify the Work Order Edit Settings for the JEA Org ID.
   Preliminary
   test results permit Asset and Location changes after the new
   settings
   are applied.  However, the GL Account is also allowed to change
   for a
   work order in APPR even though the setting was not checked for
   the GL
   Account.

   Note: While Location and ASset fields are read-only, GL Account
