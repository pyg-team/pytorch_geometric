Title: IBM Take Action commands fail to start or stop a Tomcat application server - United States

Text:
Tomcat; start; stop; take action; Start_Application_Server; Stop_Application_Server; application server; TEP; TEMA; portal TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Start_Application_Server Take Action command fails to start a Tomcat application server. The Stop_Application_Server Take Action command fails to stop a Tomcat application server. 

CAUSE
For starting and stopping Tomcat application servers from the Tivoli Enterprise Portal server, the Monitoring Agent uses the scripts startup.sh and shutdown.sh. These scripts must be present in your Tomcat home directory.
These scripts are provided with typical Tomcat distributions. However, if you use a non-typical setup with a custom starting script (for example, the version of Tomcat provided by the Red Hat or SuSE Linux distribution), these files are not present. In this case, the Monitoring Agent is unable to start or stop the application server.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check whether the startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts are present in your Tomcat home directory.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Create the startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts in your Tomcat home directory. They can be simple calls to start and stop the application server using your custom script. 

 

You can also check the content of these scripts in the standard Tomcat distribution. You can download it from the Apache web site: http://tomcat.apache.org [http://tomcat.apache.org]
