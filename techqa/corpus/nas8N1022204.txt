 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 HTTP Server is supported by IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-7679 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7679]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a buffer overread in mod_mime. By sending a specially crafted Content-Type response header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read one byte past the end of a buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2017-7668 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7668]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a buffer overread in the ap_find_token() function. By sending a specially crafted sequence of request headers, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-7659 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7659]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the mod_http2 component. By sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the server process to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127418 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127418] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-3169 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3169]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in mod_ssl. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an HTTPS port, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127417 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127417] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-3167 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3167]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() function by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication requirements.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416] for the current score
