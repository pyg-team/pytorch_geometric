ECM00146336 Modeler Server 14 will not install onto Windows 2008 non-R2 OS due to missing MSVC libraries. ECM00146747 After upgrading from Clementine 11 to Modeler 13 the 'Round' function always arounds up.

ECM00149568 Modeler 13.0.6 adapter install fails on "Arithmetic overflow" errors caused by Post Install processing of certain streams. ECM00149676 Modeler is unable to find a valid license for Statistics if Statistics is licensed with a network license. ECM00149761 Databasenode.datasource parameter does not work in batch mode when stored value is not empty.

ECM00150639 Error: Error initializing scoring engine: (3) (code: (0: Invalid value)). ECM00150990 Failed to open DLL. Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Controls.DLL ECM00151012 Incorrect SQL being generated in attached stream - seems to be outer join rather than inner join as specified. ECM00151063 Attached stream fully pushes back to SQL in 11 and 12 but not in 14. ECM00151139 Using a Split on a field that uses more than a single page to view will always display page 1 data. ECM00151578 "Error reading file <....str> f" when trying to load a stream containing autoclassifier model.
