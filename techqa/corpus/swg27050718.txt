Feature enhancement 

As a part of this fix, enhancement made to the Single Page Mode Support in WebScan client to support large volume batch. 

This enhancement provides the following improvements: 

 * Reduced memory consumption: The viewer has only one page in display, so the viewer uses low memory to avoid browser crash. 
 * Page movement: Performance improvement on moving a page up or down.


To apply this feature, add the following statement under <P tip="Setting for scan process" title="Scan" n="Scan"> section in the task setting xml file for the scan task: <V n="ShowSinglePage" label="Show Single Page" tip="Show singe page in the virtual image viewer." type="checkbox">1</V> 

Important: This enhancement is not supported for thumbnails, as there is only one page in the thumbnail.
