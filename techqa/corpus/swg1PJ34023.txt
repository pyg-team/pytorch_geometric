ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPF CONFIG ISSUE:  ADDING AE INTEGRATION.XML 3010 COMMAND TO
   BP8ACTIONS.XML DOES NOT RETURN LATEST VERSION INFO
   A configuration issue was encountered when adding the
   AE/Workplace 3010 "GetInfo" or "ShowProperties" command
   (configured in the AE/Workplace Integration.xml file) to the
   Bp8Actions.xml file.
   If the id parameter is passed, AE/Workplace will always return
   the metadata/info for the original (MajorVersion == 1.0)
   version of the document whose metadata/info is being requested
   via 3010 instead of the current version.
   This occurs even when the vsID parameter is being passed.
   To avoid this problem, do *not* pass the id parameter:  pass
   the vsID parameter only.
   Specifically, to use the Show Properties (3010) function in
   BPF with versioning enabled, modify the following three
   configuration files:
   1. Bp8Actions.xml -
   Add an action named ShowProperties in this xml file. NOTE: Keep
   the "id" parameter. This parameter will only be passed to
   Bp8WPCommandQueryServlet. It will not be passed to AE.
   
   2. Bp8ExtCommands.xml -
   Find the command ShowProperties and delete its parameter
   "id".
   
   3. Bp8ExtTasks.xml -
   Find the task ShowProperties and delete its parameter "id".
