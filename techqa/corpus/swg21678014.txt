PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User is not able to login to TIP web portal. 

SYMPTOM
When logging into TIP, the user will see an error similar to the following: 

Error 500 

An error occurred while processing request: /ibm/console/login.do 

Message: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibm.isc.api.argus.ArgusUtil

In TIP trace.log file, the following sample error can be seen: 


[6/30/14 18:17:30:516 PET] 00000018 SystemErr R [Fatal Error] RPS%253Ahref%253ATIPCell%252Fisc%252Ftwa.war%253Aroles%253AtbsmReadOnlyUser.xml:138:183: Invalid byte 2 of 4-byte UTF-8 sequence.

[6/30/14 18:17:30:517 PET] 00000018 FileSystemSto E FileSystemStore getDocument( String ) CWRGS5044E An error occurred while parsing the file 'RPS%3Ahref%3ATIPCell%2Fisc%2Ftwa.war%3Aroles%3AtbsmReadOnlyUser.xml'.
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Invalid byte 2 of 4-byte UTF-8 sequence. 


CAUSE
One or more of the Argus policy XML files contain non-UTF-8 special characters, such as vowels with an accent (e.g. ó, ű, etc). 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
From the SystemErr message, the location of the character is specified after the file name. In the example above, it is located on line 138, character 183. 

Edit the Argus policy XML file and replace the special character (�) with a normal character. Restart TIP.
