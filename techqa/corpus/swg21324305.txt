QUESTION
 How to increase the limit of the number of Child CR's that can be attached/associated to a Parent CR? 

ANSWER


In Telelogic Change, there is a limit to the number of Child CR's that can be added to a Parent CR. By default this limit is 100.

A message similar to the following example will appear on the CR Submit form if this limit is exceeded when a Child CR is added to a Parent CR.

"The query limit of 100 was exceeded for this report format. The query found 105 results, please refine your query, select a new report format or contact your administrator to change the query limit for the report you ran."



Solution:

This query limit can be increased by making changes to your user_framework.cfg configuration file: 

The user_framework.cfg file is located in the <CS_HOME>/cs_app/webapps/synergy/WEB-INF/wsconfig directory

The relevant parameters available in user_framework.cfg file are 

1. Related Change Requests Control Def 

2. Related Change Requests Control Read-only Def 

3. Related Change Requests Control Skinny Def



By default, The MAX_QUERY values for these parameters are set to 100.

You can increase the MAX_QUERY value, save the changes and then restart jetty or Load Configuration data from the Admin login.

You can then associate additional Child CRs to the Parent CR subject to the values set for the parameters listed above.
