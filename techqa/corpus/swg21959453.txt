Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM License Metric Tool and IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM License Metric Tool v9 

IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis v9

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Upgrade to version 9.2.1.0 or newer. 

In order to upgrade to version 9.2.1.0 or newer: 

 * In IBM Endpoint Manager console, expand IBM License Reporting or IBM BigFix Inventory node under Sites node in the tree panel. 
 * Click Fixlets and Tasks node. Fixlets and Tasks panel will be displayed on the right. 
 * In the Fixlets and Tasks panel locate Upgrade to the newest version of License Metric Tool 9.x or Upgrade to the newest version of IBM BigFix Inventory 9.x fixlet and run it against the computer that hosts your IBM License Metric Tool or IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis server.


Note: In an airgapped environment, you have to run BESAirgapTool and BESDownloadCacher first in order to update your site. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
In order to mitigate the vulnerability, limit the available ciphersuites using the following procedure: 

 1. Stop the server 
 2. Locate and edit server's server.xml file. It is located in <server_installation_dir>\wlp\usr\servers\server1. 
 3. Add the following attribute to ssl stanza:



enabledCiphers="TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_ 
128_CBC_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256" Your ssl stanza may look similar to the following after the change: 


<ssl clientAuthenticationSupported='false' id='defaultSSLConfig' keyStoreRef='defaultKeyStore'
enabledCiphers="TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_
128_CBC_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"/>

4. Save the file and restart the server.
