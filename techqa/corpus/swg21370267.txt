QUESTION
 How are passwords stored in scripts created using Rational Robot, Rational Performance Tester (RPT) and Rational Functional Tester (RFT) for use on ITCAM for Transactions - Robotic Response Time agents? 

ANSWER
Passwords are stored as plain text, unicode, encoded or encrypted form in scripts according to the exact Rational product and version being used as follows: 

 

Rational Product Version Password Rational Robot Version 7 Encrypted (1) Rational Performance Tester Version 7 Java Class byte code(2) Rational Performance Tester Version 8 Default = Java Class byte code (2) 

Optional = Encrypted using datapools (3) Rational Functional Tester Version 8 Default = Plain text 

Optional = Encrypted using datapools (3) 
 1. The password is encrypted if the control has password style set. If the password style is not set then the password is in plain text. It only works with HTML text and standard edit controls
    
    
 2. Rational Performance Tester scripts are stored as Java Class files in the ITCAM script repository. The passwords entered during the recording are stored inside the Java Class files in binary byte code format
    
    
 3. Passwords can be encrypted and used using the new Encrypted Datapool feature
