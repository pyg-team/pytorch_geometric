PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, that can occur when using IBM WebSphere Host On-Demand.

With the release of IBM Websphere Host On-Demand V10.0.7, IBM provided support for Host On-Demand on Microsoft Windows 7 for both client and server. After installing the Deployment Wizard on Windows 7 machine, it fails to start and just hangs. 

SYMPTOM
After starting the Deployment Wizard for Host On-Demand V10.0.7 and higher on a Windows 7 machine, it hangs after the initial display of the application. 

CAUSE
The Deployment Wizard has a JRE that it uses to run. The level of JRE in the Host On-Demand V10 Deployment Wizard is 1.4, which does not run well on Microsoft Windows 7 machines. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The IBM Rational Host On-Demand V11 includes JRE version 1.6 to run the Deployment Wizard. If you are running in a Microsoft Windows 7 environment, upgrade to Host On-Demand V11. 


Note: Files generated with the V11 Deployment Wizard will not run properly with the Host On-Demand V10 server as you might get unexpected results. This scenario is not supported.
