APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Process Federation Server queries for Business Process
   Execution Language (BPEL) tasks use group memberships from the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) user registry
   instead of virtual groups represented in the Java Authentication
   and Authorization (JAAS) subject.  If custom trust association
   interceptor (TAI) solutions return additional virtual group
   memberships, Process Federation Server might return an
   incomplete list of tasks.
