ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   ITM 6.1 (FP4-FP7) with TEPS extensions installed upgraded to ITM
   6.2 FP1
   on Windows Server 2003 x64 Standard Edition
   
   
   Problem Description:
   
   During upgrade to ITM TEPS 6.2 FP1, you receive the following
   message during TEPS configuration:
   
   ***************************
   Response file information
   Callpoint postconfig response file content:
   Tivoli Portal Server
   LDAP connection cannot be configured - verify firewall setting
   and
   LDAP connection parameters.To configure with updated LDAP
   parameters,
   reconfigure the Tivoli Entreprise Server.
   Tivoli Entreprise Browser client
   INST_COMP_PLUGIN_RETURN_CODE:000
   ----- WebHelp to Eclipse Help Converter -----
   
   After clicking OK, the user is still able to proceed with the
   installation.  The user may see the message two more times
   before
   the installation moves on.  The TEPS does configure and start
   after the upgrade.
   
   The message will occur regardless of the LDAP checkbox settings
   in the
   TEPS (or TEMS) configuration boxes.
   
   In the event this message occurs, the embedded WAS does not
   upgraded
   as it should.  The version of eWAS contained in ITM 6.2 FP1 is
   6.1.0.13.
   
   To verify the version of eWAS, perform the following steps:
   
   - From a DOS Prompt, navigate to <ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\BIN folder.
   - Run the "versionInfo.bat" file.
   - The current version of eWAS will display.  If the version
   still
   displays 6.1.0.3, eWAS was not upgraded.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
   Logon as a Windows Administrator, a member of the local
   Administrators group. The following procedure information
   assumes
   that you have a working ITM 6.1 FP4 - FP7 environment with
   TEPS extensions installed.
   
   1) Upgrade to ITM 6.2 FP1 and make sure TEPS is selected.
   2) During the TEPS configuration progress dialog, the LDAP
   connection
   message should be displayed.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The EWAS upgrade fails because the Update Installer operating
   system prerequisites are not met.
   
   When TEPS is being upgraded from version 6.2 to 6.2 fp1, the
   TEPS extension component (eWAS) has to be upgraded to 6.1.0.13.
   The TEPS extension component (eWAS) is being upgraded by Update
   Installer.  Update Installer 6.1.0.13 incorrectly recognizes a
   few operation systems as unsupported.
   
   Operating systems recognized as unsupported include the
   following:
   
   - RedHat 5.1
   - Win 2003 SE 64bit SP2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified as follows:
   1. The operating systems prerequisites checking during Update
   Installer installation was disabled.
   2. A Message is displayed when the TEPS extension upgrade fails.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
