Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance versions 2.1 and 2.5. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: The product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections, if those connections traverse a network to which the attacker has access.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)


AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1
WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
For WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5, the required change is in configuration, and the required changes are described below. 

For WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1, a firmware upgrade is necessary in order to disable SSLv3. Then follow the instructions in the mitigation section below. If this firmware upgrade is applied, and the configuration change to run as TLS only is made, then when upgrading to Version 2.5 firmware, one should apply the 2.5 firmware upgrade listed below or a later level, so that the TLS-only configuration setting is preserved.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3.

To disable SSLv3 for XC10 Version 2.5, take the following steps. From the administrative user interface, under Collective-->Settings-->Manage cryptography standard, specify any of the settings FIPS 140-2, SP800-131a transition, SP800-131a transition with TLSv1.2, or SP800-131a strict. Any of these settings will disable SSLv3. Appliance client applications must be configured so that they can support TLSv1, or TLSv1.2 if that is used. The SP800-131a strict configuration requires TLSv1.2. If the 2.5 firmware upgrade given above is applied, or a later level of firmware is used, it is also possible to use a TLSv1 setting, in addition to those already listed. Then click Apply changes now. This will restart the collective, and data in the cache at the time of the restart will be lost.

For Version 2.1, apply the firmware upgrade given above. If the appliance is in a collective, all the appliances in the collective should be upgraded before making the configuration change. Then, from the administrative user interface, under Appliance-->Settings-->Security-->Manage cryptography standard, specify TLSv1, and then click Submit TLS Settings. This operation will restart the collective, and data in the cache at the time of the restart will be lost.
