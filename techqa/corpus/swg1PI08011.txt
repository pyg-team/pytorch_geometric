   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Oracle Java 7 U51 provides additional security updates that
   require that all JAR files used in applet or Java Web Start
   deployments have the permissions attribute set in the JAR
   manifest file. This requirement will affect the TEP client,
   both browser and Java Web Start modes. Without compliance with
   this requirement, the TEP client may not start after
   downloading. This issue does not affect other releases or
   levels of Java.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   The supplied application support for OMEGAMON XE for DB2 PE/PM
   has been rebuilt to comply with the new security requirements
   of Oracle Java 7 U51.
