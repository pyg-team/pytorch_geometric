QUESTION
 Is the EGit plugin supported with Rational Application Developer (RAD) v8.5.x and future versions? 

CAUSE
EGit version and compatible Eclipse versions. 

ANSWER
Support for any third party plugin may be limited, however, there are instances where specific versions of the Rational Application Developer (RAD) version and EGit version may coexist. 


RAD v9.1.0 (Eclipse 4.2.2.2+):

RAD v9.1.0 shipped the EGit v3.4.1.201406201815-r plugin "as is". RAD provides support for installing this feature using IBM Installation Manager (IM). It does not provide support for any how-to/usage or defect problems with the plugin. IBM RAD makes no commitment as to if or when the EGit version may be updated.

"..
Eclipse Git Team provider support 

The Eclipse Git Team provider is now supported. It is a team provider in pure Java, that allows you to use the Git version control system. Git is a distributed SCM, which means every developer has a full copy of all history of every revision of the code.

Disclaimer: The Eclipse Git team provider for the Git version control system is provided "as is".
Technical support of this component is the responsibility of the Eclipse community ( https://www.eclipse.org/egit/support/ [https://www.eclipse.org/egit/support/]). For more information, see the version 9.1.0 release announcement at 
http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS214-198/ENUS214-198.PDF [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS214-198/ENUS214-198.PDF].

It's a feature that can be selected when installing RAD using IBM Installation Manager (IM) and it is mentioned in the RAD 9.1 KC topic: Planning what features to install [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRTLW_9.1.1/com.ibm.rad.install.doc/topics/c_plan_install_feature_product.html?lang=en]
The EGit may be updated in future updates/fixpacks for a given RAD 9.1+ product version


RAD v9.1 (without the IBM provided EGit) and earlier RAD versions:

The technote:
- Rational Application Developer support for third party and open-source Eclipse plugins and tools [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600040]
, address the limited support for any third party and open source plugins in general.
It lists the Eclipse versions that a given RAD product version is based on. At minimum, any plugin must be compatible with that Eclipse version. If a plugin can be installed and used on a "standalone" version of Eclipse that is the same version used by a given RAD version, IBM RAD support may investigate if there is problem in the Eclipse shipped with RAD.

The document EGit/FAQ [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ] : http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ]
,has two relevant topics:
-- What versions of Eclipse does EGit target? [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ#What_versions_of_Eclipse_does_EGit_target.3F]
It lists EGit Versions and the supported versions of Eclipse.
It is important to point out that Eclipse 3.6.2 (Helios), which is used by RAD 8.5.5.x, is skipped over. EGit 2.1.0.201209190230-r and earlier is supported with Eclipse 3.5.2+ (Galileo) and may be compatible with RAD 8.5.x. This is not a statement of support by IBM RAD.

-- Where can I find older releases of EGit? [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ#Where_can_I_find_older_releases_of_EGit.3F]

The EGit download/update sites:
- Download [http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/]
http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/ [http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/]
,lists the latest release (4.0.1.201506240215-r as of July 2015) and mentions the:
- Main Update Site: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates [http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates] (Recommended) , which defaults to the latest release. 
For example, EGit 4.0.1.201506240215-r supports Eclipse 3.8.2/4.2.2 + (Juno), which should be compatible with any RAD v9.1.0.x or v9.0.x. In the case of RAD v9.0.x (and even RAD v9.1) an earlier EGit versions such as 3.0.3.201309161630-r is supported with Eclipse 3.8.2/4.2.2 + (Juno), is referred to in the technote: 
- Extending IBM Rational Application Developer with 3rd Party Tools [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/e4210f90-a515-41c9-a487-8fc7d79d7f61/entry/third-party-plugins?lang=en]
It refers to the EGit 3.0.3 plugin with various notes/warnings. It has been “sanity tested” to ensure compatibility with RAD v9.0 (based on Eclipse Juno version 4.2.2), but stresses:

"...
Listing these plugins DOES NOT imply their endorsement by IBM or this author, and is not meant to suggest that technical support for the plugins or their usage when co-installed with RAD will be provided by IBM Client Support.
.."

RAD v9.1.0 is known to work with EGit v3.4.1.201406201815-r , as shipped and provided "as is" 

Similarly: 

RAD 9.1.1.2+ with EGit 3.5.3.201412180710-r
RAD 9.5.5.2+ with EGit 4.2.0.201601211800-r
RAD 9.6.0.0 with EGit 4.5.0201609210915-r
