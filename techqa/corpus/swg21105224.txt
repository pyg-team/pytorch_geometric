QUESTION
 How do you recover a data set that does not appear on the CICSÂ® VSAM Recovery (CICS VR) sphere list? 

ANSWER
CICS VR does not contain any recovery information about this VSAM sphere. However, information about the VSAM sphere might reside on a log of logs that is not registered to CICS VR or has not been scanned recently.


If the log of logs has not been scanned recently, invoke a scan of the log of logs by selecting option 1 for "Scan all" from the utilities menu [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwug/dwwug00085.html] of the CICS VR log of logs list.

If the log of logs is not registered, do the following: 

 1. Select option 3 for "List of registered log of logs", from the CICS VR main menu [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfht2/topics/dfht2c00239.html]. 
    
    
 2. Register the log of logs by using the Register option [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwug/dwwug00082.html] on the administrator menu. Enter the log of logs data set name in the CICS VR log of logs register panel [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwig/rrlogoflog.html#rrlogoflog__ppore].
    
    
 3. Invoke a scan of the log of logs by selecting option 1 for "Scan all" from the utilities menu.
