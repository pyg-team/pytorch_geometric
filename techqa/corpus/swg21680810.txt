 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to to start IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services result in the error: 



ERROR [org.jboss.msc.service.fail] (MSC service thread 1-2) MSC000001: Failed to start service jboss.deployment.subunit."cds60.ear"."process-ejb.jar".PARSE: org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service jboss.deployment.subunit."cds60.ear"."process-ejb.jar".PARSE: JBAS018733: Failed to process phase PARSE of subdeployment "process-ejb.jar" of deployment "cds60.ear" 

SYMPTOM
Configuration of IBM SPSS C&DS 6.0 is successful. 

Starting the server fails with the above error.


CAUSE
An unsupported application server was used to configure C&DS, specifically Jboss 6.2

ENVIRONMENT
IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 6.0
Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter
Jboss 6.2



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A review of the server log located in <JBoss server directory>/log/ displays the following error: 

ERROR [org.jboss.msc.service.fail] (MSC service thread 1-2) MSC000001: Failed to start service jboss.deployment.subunit."cds60.ear"."process-ejb.jar".PARSE: org.jboss.msc.service.StartException in service jboss.deployment.subunit."cds60.ear"."process-ejb.jar".PARSE: JBAS018733: Failed to process phase PARSE of subdeployment "process-ejb.jar" of deployment "cds60.ear"

A review of the engine.log located in <IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository installation directory>/log:
displays that Jboss 6.2 was used in the configuration: 

INFO : appserver_install_directory=C:\Program Files\EAP-6.2.0\jboss-eap-6.2



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install a supported version of the application server and reconfigure C&DS. 






Supported versions are listed in the Repository Installation and Configuration Guide [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/cds/6.0/en/installation_documents/Repository_Server_Installation_and_Configuration_Guide.pdf] and can also be found on the IBM Compatibility Matrix [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp].
