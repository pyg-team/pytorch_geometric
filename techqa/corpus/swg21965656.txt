QUESTION
 Why do I see a warning message when trying to download application records in Maximo? 

ANSWER
When downloading records from the list tab of an application you may see a prompt from Microsoft Excel that says"
"The file format and extension of '012345678.xls' don't match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe. Unless you trust its source, don't open it. Do you want to open it anyway?" 

If you click on "Yes" then you are still allowed to open the file and when you look inside the XLS file, it is a file with HTML in it. Recent versions of Excel such as the one found in Office 2013 are stricter in the types of files that they will open. The file must be in XLS (BIFF8) file format to open without this warning prompt. If the file type is a different format (such as HTML, XML, CSV, etc.) the prompt is expected since the file content is different than the extension or MIME type. The Maximo product works as it was designed to create an HTML file and not a file in XLS (BIFF8) format.
