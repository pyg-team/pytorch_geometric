Title: IBM DB2 Distributed end of support (EOS) dates - United States

Text:
EOS; life cycle; end of support; end of support dates; support dates PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

ABSTRACT
 The following table lists end of basic support (EOS) dates as well as the earliest end of extended service dates for various versions and editions of DB2® Universal Database™ (DB2 UDB) and DB2 Connect™ for Windows®, Linux® and UNIX®. 

CONTENT
For customers who have purchased their DB2 licences from IBM, the "End of (base) support" indicates the last date on which you are entitled to base support for your DB2 product (also known as the EOS date). You can extend the support period beyond the end of (base) support date for an additional fee. To arrange for a DB2 support extension, contact your local IBM® representative.
Support terms and conditions may differ for the use of DB2 with certain applications. Customers should check directly with their application vendor for the terms and duration of their support for DB2. Read TechNote 1051638 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21051638] for more information as it relates to SAP.

"End of extended support" indicates the earliest date in which IBM would end the extended support for your DB2 product (that is to say, the latest stop date in a DB2 support extension). 

Please note that the announced dates are also available on the IBM Product Lifecycle Page [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/]
