IBM Storwize V5000 release V7.7.0.5 (code level 127.29.1612050956000) 

If you are unsure about which version to use for your system, consult your IBM or IBM Business Partner representative.

Please refer to the following Concurrent Compatibility information to identify the appropriate upgrade path:



 * IBM Storwize V5000 Software Upgrade Reference [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004336]




This code release may contain critical fixes. All customers are strongly advised to read the accompanying release note to determine whether they are currently exposed to any issues that are fixed in this release. 

We also recommend you refer to the following documents before upgrading: 

Please refer to the System Storage Interoperability Center (SSIC) for the interoperability matrix: 
 * SSIC [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/support/storage/ssic/interoperability.wss]
 * V7.7 Configuration Limits and Restrictions for IBM Storwize V5000 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1005824]



To avoid potential problems, any exceptions to supported interoperability MUST be requested via an approved RPQ (SCORE) agreement. Please contact your IBM representative or authorized IBM Business Partner to request support. 

Please ensure you have read the release note and are familiar with the following Flash Announcements before upgrading: 

Important: Once the software upgrade has completed, the new software will check the version of firmware on all components in the system, except the drives. If any upgrades are needed then the system will automatically perform these upgrades. NOTE: If the Power Supply Unit firmware needs to be upgraded then the fans on that enclosure will run at full speed for a short time and all LEDs on the PSU will flash. This is normal and can be ignored. If the fans are running at full speed without the LEDs flashing, or if the system stays in the fan full state on the same power supply unit then this may indicate a hardware fault. Global Mirror Relationships Must Be Stopped When Upgrading to V7.2.0 or above [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004472] Moving Volumes to Another I/O Group Without Stopping Host Activity is Not Supported for All Operating Systems [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004125] SAN Volume Controller and Storwize Family Software Upgrade Test Utility [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S4000585] If Storwize V5000 Code Upgrade Stalls or Fails then Contact IBM Support for Further Assistance [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1002894] Intra-Cluster Global Mirror Not Supported With V6.x or V7.x [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003725] 

If upgrading from a version prior to V7.3.0.1 please be aware that this upgrade introduces a new cache architecture. For the duration of the upgrade the cache will be disabled for the entire system, which may affect performance. Once this upgrade has completed the cache will be automatically re-enabled. 
This system-wide cache disable is only required when installing the new cache architecture for the first time. Subsequent upgrades will not disable the cache on the entire system. 


You should ensure that the system event log does not contain any unfixed events prior to applying a software upgrade, since these events may prevent a successful upgrade. Use the Troubleshooting, Recovery and Maintenance Guide to fix any outstanding errors. In addition to checking the system event log IBM also strongly recommend using the upgrade test utility.
