 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Image Services is unable to create batches which results in a system shut down. A reboot resolves the issue temporarily. 

SYMPTOM
Below error tuple is observed in the elogs. 

2018/03/15 00:00:23.012 77,0,8 HGENL0008E <fnsw> DOCs (10844.4860.190 0x2a5c.12fc) ... [SERIOUS]
DOCs: Batch create failed because cache is full.


CAUSE
When the Image Services cache size reaches it's limit, Image Services is no longer able to create batches. This results in numerous batches getting queued which leads to system shut down since none of the batches can be processed. IS reboot frees up some cache which allows some of the batches to be processed.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify there is any available free space in cache. Follow the below steps in sequential order. 

On the Image Services server, execute the command CSM_tool > st 

 This will provide a summary of available free space in cache. 

Execute fn_edit 

 Go to Datasets tab. This will provide the file size of cache. 

From the above steps, we can determine if we need to add additional cache.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This can be resolved by increasing Image Services cache size.
