APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The packed descriptor of a Range Partition Table can get
   corrupted when attaching a partition, if the target table
   column(s) have statistics collected, and does not have default
   values defined on its column(s); but the source column(s)
   has/had default values. (The corruption is confined to a wrong
   stats_offset for the column packed descriptor)
   
   In DPF environment, the -901 trap happens during the attach:
   
   alter table t2 attach partition t1p0 starting from (0) ending at
   (9) from table t1p0
   DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because
   it was not a
   valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL processing it
   returned:
   SQL0901N  The SQL statement failed because of a non-severe
   system error.
   Subsequent SQL statements can be processed.  (Reason "Packed
   descriptor
   corruption found. Please run RUNSTATS on this table".)
   SQLSTATE=58004
   
   In non-DPF environment, the -901 trap happens during set
   integrity:
   
   set integrity for t2 immediate checked
   DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because
   it was not a
   valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL processing it
   returned:
   SQL0901N  The SQL statement failed because of a non-severe
   system error.
   Subsequent SQL statements can be processed.  (Reason "Packed
   descriptor
   corruption found. Please run RUNSTATS on this table".)
