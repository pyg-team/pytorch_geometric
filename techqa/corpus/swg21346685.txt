Text:
network output version Adobe Reader TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 PDF rendering becoming much slower than before (45 minutes to render a 3-page report instead of 1 minute).
No changes made to either the report or the package it is based on.
HTML output is also slower than before, but the differene in PDF rendering time is more pronounced 

CAUSE
A used image is not accessable, for example a firewall blocking a dynamic image URL contained within the report

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that all used images are available and that there are no firewall restrictions preventing access to images contained within the report
