 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition. These vulnerabilities affect WebSphere DataPower XC10 versions 2.1 and 2.5. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2015. This bulletin also addresses the “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange cipher suite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

The only mitigation is to apply the recommended fix. If you are using the WebSphere eXtreme Scale Java client to communicate with the appliance, a fix must be applied to the client as well, if that client is used to make SSL connections to servers other than the appliance. Refer to CVE-2015-0138 in the latest WebSphere eXtreme Scale security bulletin for more information.
