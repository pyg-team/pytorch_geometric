APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a Java program creates an embedded Liberty server it can
   specify the location for Liberty output files using the
   setUserDir() and setOutputDir() API calls on the ServerBuilder
   object.  For example:
   .
   ServerBuilder builder = new ServerBuilder();
   builder.setUserDir(userDir);
   builder.setOutputDir(outputDir);
   .
   While most output files are written to the locations specified
   using the API, a single .cache file is incorrectly written
   under the Liberty server directory tree.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround would be to set the WLP_OUTPUT_DIR and WLP_USER_DIR
   variables as system environment variables before starting the
   Liberty server; that is before the application that starts the
   server is run.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Liberty Profile using embedded       *
   *                  Liberty servers                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A file named ".cache" is written to the *
   *                      Liberty installation directory tree     *
   *                      rather than the user-specified output   *
   *                      directory.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem only occurs when the Liberty server is created
   programmatically.  If the Liberty server is started directly
   from a command line the problem does not occur.
   Java example of starting an embedded server:
   ServerBuilder builder = new ServerBuilder();
   builder.setUserDir(userDir);
   builder.setOutputDir(outputDir);
   Server server = builder.build();
   server.start(new String[0]).get();
   The values set by the APIs "setUserDir" and "setOutputDir" are
   not being respected. The code that writes the ".cache" file is
   checking environment variables WLP_OUTPUT_DIR and WLP_USER_DIR,
   which are not set when the Liberty server is started
   programmatically.  Since the variables are not set, the ".cache"
   file is written to the default location, which is
   "wlp/usr/servers/<SERVER NAME>/workarea/platform/bundle/.cache"
   When starting the server from the command line, the environment
   variables can be specified in the server.env file. However,
   specifying these variables in server.env has no effect on a
   server that is created programmatically.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code that writes the ".cache" file has been modified.  If
   the WLP_OUTPUT_DIR and WLP_USER_DIR environment variables are
   not set, the code will use values specified using the APIs:
   
   
   serverBuilder.setUserDir()
   
   serverBuilder.setOutputDir(outputDir)
   
   This means you may set
   the system environment variables to override the settings
   created by the API calls.
