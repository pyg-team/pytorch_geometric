APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Version
   7.0 lists the Embedded ConnectJDBC driver as one of the drivers
   that is provided with the product. However, the driver is
   not listed under the JDBC Provider drop-down list in the
   administrative console.
   
   The "Data source minimum required settings for Microsoft SQL
   Server" topic needs to be updated. The WebSphere Connect JDBC
   driver for Microsoft SQL Server is not provided with WebSphere
   Application Server Version 7.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update Version 7 information center to remove embeded driver
   information

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The "Data source minimum required settings for Microsoft SQL
   Server" topic in the Information Center for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 7.0 inaccurately documents the JDBC
   driver implementation applicability.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Data source minimum required settings for Microsoft SQL
   Server" topic will be updated to remove the description of
   the IBM WebSphere embedded Connect JDBC driver for MS SQL
   Server because it does not apply to WebSphere Application
   Server Version 7.0. In addition, the following JDBC driver
   implementations will be removed:
   - WebSphere Connect JDBC driver
   - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Drvier for JDBC
   - WebSphere Sequelink JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server
   - IBM WebSphere embedded Connect JDBC driver for MS SQL Server
   (XA)
