APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z - RDz - TSO Send command with
   the User(*) option sends the message to all RSE users.
   
   However, according to the TSO manual the Send 'message' USER(*)
   should be sent only to the user executing the command.
   *****************************
   USER(*)
   * - specifies the message is sent to the user ID associated
   with the issuer of the SEND command. If * is used with a SEND
   command in a CLIST, the message is sent to the user executing
   the CLIST. If it is used with the SEND command at a terminal,
   * causes the message to be sent to the same terminal.

   Also, using the LOGON parameter is not working as described in
   the TSO/E manual.  The TSO/E manual states:
   LOGON - specifies that you want the message retained in the
   SYS1.BRODCAST data set or user log data set, if the recipient
   is not logged on, is not receiving messages, or cannot receive
   messages because of SECLABEL checking. If the recipient is
   currently using the system and receiving messages, the
   message is sent immediately.
   
   However, RDz TSO Send is sending it immediately and at LOGON.
   
   Therefore, users are getting lots more messages than before.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Specify a specific userid rather than using * for the userid.
