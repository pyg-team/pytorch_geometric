APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have adapted existing SPSS Statisdtics command syntax for
   use in a Modeler stream Statistics Output node.  In the syntasx
   you reference an operating system environment variable (e.g.
   "GET FILE = '$HOME/user/Desktop/mydata.sav'."), however the
   environment variable is parsed as empty and a syntax error
   results as no such path exists on the system.
   
   This same command syntax works correctly when run from SPSS
   Statistics.  It should process exactly the same way in a Modeler
   stream as part of a Statistics Output node.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You will have to hard-code your path in the SPSS Statistics
   Syntax used in the Statistics output node.
