   Customer Contact: Julius Wong (Freddie Mac)
   .
   Following are the problem description and purposed fix for IBM
   from the
   customer:
   .
   Tools in use by Freddie Mac.
   Weblogic application server v5.1
   IBM Policy Director
   Solaris v5.5.1
   Code written in Java to J2EE spec.
   Internet Explorer v4+
   .
   Problem is with IE6
   .
   PAG
   Problem.
   Internet Explorer 6 implementation of P3P and its default
   security
   setting not allowing 3rd party cookies in a business to business
   internet web application.  The default ( medium ) setting in IE
   6 is
   defined as follows:
   .
   Cookies from third-party Web sites that do not have a compact
   policy
   (a condensed computer-readable privacy statement) will be
   blocked
   .
   Cookies from third-party Web sites that use your personally
   .
   identifiable information without your implicit consent will be
   .
   blocked
   .
   PAG
   Cookies from first-party Web sites that use your personally
   .
   O
   identifiable information without your implicit consent will be
   .
   deleted from your computer when you close Internet Explorer
   .
   Description.
   Freddie Mac has a web based application that can be accessed
   through
   another vendors website.   If a customer of the vendor logs into
   their
   website they can access our application through it.  When the
   link to
   Freddie Mac is clicked our application opens up as a frame
   within their
   website and we become a 3rd party vendor.  This is when the
   problem
   occurs. If those customers are using the default setting (
   medium ) in
   Internet Explorer 6, IE blocks our cookies.  Since Internet
   Explorer 6
   rejected all of the cookies our website within our website the
   application is rendered inoperable.  We can fix this within our
   web       PAG
   servers by implementing the full P3P standard including the XML
   policy,
   html policy and compact policy for the http header or by just
   adding the    O
   compact policy to the header.  At this point the customer is
   securely
   logging into our website and everything appears to work until
   they click
   on a link within our website such as help. The customer does not
   know
   that the Weblogic cookies were set but the Policy Director
   cookies were
   rejected even though it appeared that they logged in to us
   normally.
   When they click on help a new IE browser opens ( it is on the
   same leg
   as the application ) and the user is asked to re-authenticate
   again.
   This is after they have already logged into our site.  This is a
   problem
   because from what our security people are saying we cannot add
   the
   compact policy which IE needs to the Policy Director http
   header.
   .
   This only occurs if I do not accept the cookies from Policy
   Director
   when I first log in to our application.  If I do accept the
   cookie on
   the initial log in then all the subsequent cookies are accepted
   and no    PAG
   log in prompt occurs.  I tested this by having IE prompt me for
   instructions on whether or not to accept the cookies.  If I log
   in and      O
   only accept our WebLogic cookies then click help I am prompted
   to re
   authenticate to Policy Director.
   .
   From what I can tell,  IE 6 is inheriting the characteristics of
   the
   parent browser.  Since the parent browser declined the cookie,
   any
   children spawned from that browser will decline those cookies as
   well
   even though we are in the same SSL session.  This is completely
   different behavior than was exhibited by IE 5+ ( with the
   exception of
   v5.5 privacy beta ).
   .
   Julius purposed the following fix for Policy Director:
   .
   The P3P fix from IBM will consist of including a header option
   into
   WebSEAL:
   PAG
   1. Putting a new option into iv.conf (PD3.7.1) and webseald.conf
   (PD3.8)
   to
   .
   enable P3P Privacy Headers.
   eg. p3p-privacy-header = blah.....blah
   .
   ***An APAR fix from WebSEAL will be the biggest pain relieve as
   we
   currently have a P3P implementation header for us*****
   .
   The fix that we need to muscle from Microsoft includes:  ****
   Long term
   fix
   needed ******
   1. Fixing IE6.0 ssl-session inheritance for daughter windows
   (pop-up
   boxes).
   2. Reimplementing P3P Privacy Policy distinction between
   persistant and
   session cookie.
   3. Redefining Default IE6.0 Privacy Policy settings.
