QUESTION
 Attempting to execute the ITIM Middleware Config Utility on Red Hat fails with:

"The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag."


CAUSE
In some installations of RedHat, the Middleware Config Installer (Installshield) is unable to run correctly.

ANSWER
First check that display settings are correctly set (xhost <host>, DISPLAY=<host>:0.0, etc) 

Confirm other GUI's can be displayed successfully (xclock , etc). 

Assuming the above is successful....use the following command to execute the Middleware Config Utility: 

 

$WAS_HOME/AppServer/java/bin/java -jar cfg_itim_mw.jar
