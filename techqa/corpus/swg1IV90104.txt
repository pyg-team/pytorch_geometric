APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Linux, BigFix Server 9.2.5 stops gathering external sites if
   they contain relevance strings longer than 1 MB.
   
   In GatherDB.log you will see errors similar to the following
   one:
   
   Mon, 05 Oct 2015 11:29:49 +0200 -- Importing Fixlet #273623325
   Mon, 05 Oct 2015 11:30:41 +0200 -- [IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0109E
   String data right truncation. SQLSTATE=22001 (22001:
   18446744073709451617)
   Mon, 05 Oct 2015 11:30:43 +0200 -- ERROR: Import aborted:
   Database Error: [IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0109E  String data right
   truncation. SQLSTATE=22001 (22001:18446744073709451617)
   
   There are two main scenarios when the error can occur:
   
   1. Linux/DB2 installed at a version < 9.2.5 and an external site
   containing fixlets with relevance strings longer than 1 MB is
   subscribed.
   In this case, when the migration to 9.2.5 is attempted, the
   server upgrade process will fail with the database error 22001
   merging those fixlets into EXTERNAL_FIXLET_RELEVANCE.
   
   2. Linux/DB2 installed at 9.2.5 version and an external site
   releasing a new version X containing fixlets with relevance
   strings longer than 1 MB is subscribed.
   In this case, the gathering of the external site (version
   >= X) will fail while importing the fixlets with relevance
   strings greater than 1 MB.
