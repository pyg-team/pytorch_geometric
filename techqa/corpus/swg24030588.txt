Use Rational Automation Framework to automate the management of supported middleware products such as IBM WebSphere Application Server. The product includes a server that can be accessed from a command line interface, a web client, and optionally, an Eclipse client. From the server, run the supplied actions to install and configure software, and to deploy applications on one or more managed systems. 

Note: Rational Automation Framework was formerly known as Rational Automation Framework for WebSphere. 

Install Rational Automation Framework, Version 3.0 as a standalone product, separate from your existing Rational Build Forge installation. When you install this release, a new instance of IBM Rational Build Forge, Version 7.1.2.2 is also installed. 

Rational Automation Framework, Version 3.0 has the following new features and enhancements: 

 *  Rich client: This version of Rational Automation Framework includes an Eclipse rich client. Use the Eclipse client for Rational Automation Framework to manage your configuration environments and automation plans, and to run installation, configuration, and application deployment actions on managed systems. From the Eclipse client, connect to one or more Rational Automation Framework servers, and manage the configuration environments on those servers. 
 * Existing cell support for IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise, IBM WebSphere Process Server and IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus: Use the Environment Generation wizard to create Rational Automation Framework environments for managing existing WebSphere Virtual Enterprise, WebSphere Process Server, and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus cells. 
 * Sudo support: Assume the privileges of a different user, such as root, and use those privileges to run specific tasks on UNIX or Linux systems. 
 *  FEP iFix support: Use Rational Automation Framework actions to install FEP iFixes. 
 * Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy server support: Use Rational Automation Framework actions to configure a proxy server on WebSphere Application Server, Version 6.1 and 7.0.
