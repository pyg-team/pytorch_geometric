ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   Approver Initials:    MB
   Severity:             1
   Reported Release:     622
   Compid:               5724C04PS Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
   ABSTRACT:             TBSM Datafetchers stop if TEPS not
   initialized
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If TEPS is not fully initialized when the TBSM data fetchers
   request data, the eWAS TIP Web Service will respond with an
   empty list. TBSM think) is loaded.  The response is that the
   list is empty.  TBSM caches caches that and then the user cannot
   create new datafetchers.
   .
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   This is a timing related issue and might be a little difficult
   to recreate.
   .
   TBSM must have its data fetchers started and requesting data.
   TEPS must be brought up. The TBSM data fetcher must request data
   before the TEPS is fully initialized.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not start the TBSM Data Fetchers until the TEPS is completely
   initialized.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TBSM Data Fetcher connected to the portal server web service
   will not return any data if the connection occurs before the
   portal server has completely initialized.
   
   When the TBSM Data Fetcher requests data via the portal server
   web service and the portal server has not completely
   initialized, no exception is thrown to the TBSM data fetcher
   indicating that the portal server is unable to service the
   request.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The portal server web service has been modified to throw an
   exception indicating that the portal server is still
   initializing, forcing the data fetcher to retry.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
