 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 When the IBM Atlas eDiscovery Policy Syndication for IBM eDiscovery Manager connector creates IBM eDiscovery Manager scheduled searches, the high-level, Lucene-based query does not propagate to the IBM eDiscovery Manager "save to folder task audit record." When the audit record is viewed, the query is reported to be null.


CONTENT
You can view the low-level, repository query by creating and viewing an audit report that includes the save to folder audit record in IBM eDiscovery Manager. You can view the high-level query by inspecting the details of the relevant task object in IBM eDiscovery Manager. The high-level query is also recorded in the connector logs and the eDiscovery Manager work manager logs if the logging level is set to INFO or higher. 

The IBM Atlas Policy Suite preservation plan also records the fields and values that are used to create the query for the scheduled search.
