APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The file causing the problem seems to be the AIF.wsdl. It
   contains
   following element:
   <wsdl:documentation>This is documentation <service>a
   service</service></wsdl:documentation>
   
   The <service>-tag seems to be falsely interpreted by WPS runtime
   although WSDL specification on http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl &#65525;2
   mentions that this should be allowed.
   
   I've tried to install the application via AST on the server and
   also via admin console. Both times I got the same error and it
   turned out that the problem occurs when starting the
   application. Deployment via adminconsole seemed to work fine
   until I wanted to start the Application.
   .
      The exception logged is
   org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.FeatureNotFoundException: Feature
   'service' not found.
   (file:/D:/data/wid/20070323atp/WsdlDocPMR/AIF.wsdl,
   3, 54)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Customer was provided a Testfix which worked for them in bot
   6.0.2 and 6.0.2.2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Process Server 6.0.2.x users.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WebSphere Process Server informs        *
   *                      feature not found exception if WSDL     *
   *                      file has undefined elements under the   *
   *                      wsdl:documentation.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   WebSphere Process Server require each elements must have
   relevant definitions even these element is under the
   wsdl:documentation which element just involve description
   information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Appling this interim fix JR27660 to correct this behavior of
   WebSphere Process Server.  To avoid using undefined XML
   elements under the wsdl:documentation, for example: replace
   element "<example>" under the wsdl:documentation with
   "&lt;example&gt;"
