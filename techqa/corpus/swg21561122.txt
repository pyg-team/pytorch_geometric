RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Solution 

Their trading partner was sending them MDNs that were two days old. The customer had already received the MDNs from two days prior.

They were using AS2 with MDN over synchronous. So the fact that they were receiving MDNs that were kicking off EDIINTPARSE alluded to the fact that something was wrong since synchronous MDNs are processed within the AS2SendSyncMDN proces structure. The other problem is the fact that the MDN was sent for a message sent by the customer two days ago.

Once we identitied that they were receiving MDNs out of the normal process we could explain the errors and the fact that the Original-Message-IDs were not found in GIS since they've already received the MDN and have processed the AS2 Message.
