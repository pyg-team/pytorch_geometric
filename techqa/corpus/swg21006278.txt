QUESTION
 Why am I receiving ABEND AKEA in IODM module EKCCMTOM at offset x'1A68' when trying to run in a CICS Version 3.3.0 region? The error occurs shortly after restarting IODM without the cycling region.

In the CICS system initialization table (SIT), STGPROT is set to "No" and RENTPGM is set to NOPROTECT. System modifications (sysmods), UN54096 and UN60897, have been applied. 

ANSWER
Refer to authorized program analysis report (APAR) PN56650 for information about IODM module EKCCMTOM and program DFHZNEP. Set both programs to the EXECKEY parameter of CICSÂ® and give them a datalocation value of "Any." Also, change the queue status field (QUESTAT) of the IDPARMTB table from 'E' to 'D'. The IDPARMTB table defines system-wide Object Distribution Manager parameters vital to the system's operation. Making this change frees you from relying on the use of the send queue processing operator commands, OAQM and OAQC, that are between OID1 and OID2. OID1 is the ImagePlus Object Distribution Manager first-stage, and OID2 the second-stage, shutdown CICS transaction. OID2 completes the Object Distribution Manager shutdown. 

The mode settings for program DFHZNEP state that DFHZNEP must be RMODE=any, AMODE=31. Relink your DFHZNEP as 31 bit so that DFHZNAC can link to ZNEP. 

When you relink DFHZNEP as 31 bit, expect to receive error message: IEW2646 for modules DFHZNEP, EKCCVECT, and EKCCFMSG. Error message: IEW2646I is issued when an RMODE value that is specified in the PARM statement is different than the one in the electrostatic discharge (ESD) record. Included is a binder message, which warns of a conflict. As a result, the RMODE value in the PARM statement will be used, based on the hierarchy specified in the Program Management Manual. 

You might get intermittent failures in OID1 in IODM module EKCCMTOM. Continue to try the failing transaction until you receive a normal completion. 

Another element to this error was revealed during its testing. The abend appears after cycling ODM but without cycling the CICS region. For example, you might first start the CICS region, then OIUP, OID1, OID2, OIUP, OID1 (which fails), OID2 (which also fails). By cycling the CICS region, the first OID1 and OID2 will function normally. 

In this situation, the second OIUP, which initializes the Object Distribution Manager, and all other functions (DISP and so on), function without incident. 

 * If you use the LMODs from EKCPSTLK with the CICS330 libraries (instead of with the CICS211 libraries), OID1 and OID2 fail after the first shutdown of ODM. 
 * If you cycle the whole region, OID1 and OID2 work the first time after an OIUP. 
 * If you bring ODM up and then try to shut it down again, you will get the abends. 
 * With the CICS330 links, the failure is consistent. 
 * With the CICS211 links, the failure is intermittent. 
 * Additionally, with the CICS330 modules: 
 * DFHECI links clean 
 * error message: IEW2646I is not produced 
 * the offset of the abend moves about 8 bytes


Note: The error described in this document was accompanied by error message: EKC0304A return code 8 reason code 00070017 after restarting IODM without a cycling region. If you have an earlier release of IODM, see APAR PN14003 regarding the error message: EKC0304A 00070017.
