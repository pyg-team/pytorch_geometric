ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   
   
   We have a problem using the AccesAgent in our Citrix
   environment. When
   a user logs on in Citrix the AccessAgent software is loaded.
   Result is that users have Single Sign-On.
   The problem is that for multiple users the Citrix session
   suddenly
   hangs.
   
   It is not related to any specific software application (it can
   be MS Excel, Internet Explorer, Windows Explorer, MS Word etc.).
   
   Multiple users are infected on multiple Citrix servers.
   
   As soon as we disable the AccessAgent for the users (we just
   disallow
   start of the software in the Citrix session) the users never
   hang.
   
   We are using AccessAgent 8.0.1.2901.
   
   We also received an ifix for WinSSOAgent.dll from PMR
   07905,211,788
   which we are using.
   
   We have changed the loglevel from "1" to "0" on all Citrix
   servers
   this has made no difference.
   
   I want to let you know that our Citrix servers are automatically
   rebooted every night to clear all user sessions (if applicable)
   en free
   all resources.
   All users sessions are always load balanced over all available
   Citrix
   servers.
   
   value "Maximum number of cached wallets" is already set to
   999999999
   
   -> Now the Customers citrix environment has grown, where they
   have more
   cirtix sessions and users and now they are experiencing the same
   problem.
   -> Problem happens at intermittent times.
   -> Some Users have the Access Agent on there machine some do
   not.
   -> Mainly the Access Agent is on the citrix server
   Workflow when problem is seen:
   Access Agent is installed on citrix server, user connects to
   citrix
   server from the machine to work.
   When the User is working and then the hang happens from there
   connection
   The User then cannot do anything as the session just hangs.
   tech team who look after the citrix server have to log the User
   session
   off from citrix server side.
   The user then has to make a new connection to the citrix server
   the user
   can then work until the session hangs again
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate: N/A
   
   
   Desired Behavior: Citrix not to hang
   
   
   Environment:
   
   The Citrix environment is Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 running
   on
   Windows 2003 Enterprise R2 SP2
   TAM E-SSO Access Agents 8.0.1 fixpack 1 (8.0.1.2901)
   We have double Quad core Intel Xeon CPU's
   8 GB of internal memory
   32 bit
   Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 with Rolluppack 4
   (PSE450W2K3R04).
   
   There are 7 citrix server in total and there about 160 active
   citrix
   users spread aross these 7 servers.
   On average, there are about less than 40 active concurrent users
   on one
   citrix server at the same time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The intermittent Citrix problem with sessions hanging was
   addressed by making thread handling more efficient in
   AccessAgent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An ifix is available on request from support (8.0.1.4201). The
   problem will be addressed in next AccessAgent fix pack for
   version 8.0.1.
