APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After you migrate from IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V7.5.x
   or earlier releases to IBM BPM V8.0.1.x and later releases, you
    might see the following exceptions:
   
   com.lombardisoftware.core.TeamWorksException:Type mismatch.
   Value TWObject[(Active: Y), (Type: 1), (TWClassID:TWClass.<ID>),
   (Property names:
   <Name>, <NameDescription>), (MetaData:objectID=<ID>,
   dirty=true,invalid=false, shared=false, key=null,
   version=null,rootVersionContextID=<ID>,className=<TWObject_Name>
   )] must be of type <TWObject_Name>'
   
   java.lang.NumberFormatException for input string: ""
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Teamworks exception occurs because there are business object
    definitions with same namespace and name. During an upgrade,
   the web service integration updated its engine and algorithms.
   As a result, that different business object, instead of the one
   you assigned in output mapping, is selected and the error
   occurs.
   
   The number format exception occurs because the new engine in IBM
   BPM V8.0.1 and later releases follows the web service
   specifications. If the web service returns an empty number
   field, you receive the exception because there is nothing to
   convert into a valid number value. In the old engine, an empty
   number field was considered unset.
