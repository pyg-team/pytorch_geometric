Title: IBM Domino Web Server keyring still using MD5 may cause TLS 1.2 handshake failure - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When Domino Web servers, configured to support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2, have a server keyring signed with the MD5 hashing algorithm, newer versions of several browsers will fail to authenticate. These browsers no longer support communications with Web servers configured with keyrings built with MD5. Having a server keyring signed with the MD5 hashing algorithm is common when keyring generation used the Domino CA process.

SYMPTOM
 The server console log will show these entries: 

 *  [00570:00010-0000002B] 03/31/2015 15:35:22 TLS/SSL connection 9.123.96.225(4483)-9.83.22.87(50750) 
   failed with server certificate chain signature alogrithms NOT supported by client 
   [00570:00010-0000002B] 03/31/2015 15:35:22 TLS/SSL connection 9.123.96.225(4483)-9.83.22.87(50750) 
   failed with server certificate chain requiring support for MD5 
 * 


Browser users will see:  

 *  [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701159&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701159&aid=1] 


CAUSE
TLS 1.2 gives the endpoint the ability to specify signature algorithms that it will accept. Newer versions of several browsers no longer consider MD5 to be secure so they no longer specify MD5 as acceptable in the TLS 1.2 handshake. Consequently, browser authentication with a Domino Web server, the keyring for which is hashed with MD5, will fail during the TLS handshake.

ENVIRONMENT
 

 * Only Domino 9.0.1 Fix Pack 3 Interim Fix 2 or later support TLS 1.2. 
 * Only Notes 9.0.1 Fix Pack 3 Interim Fix 3 or later support TLS 1.2.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, replace your MD5 Web server keyring with one built using SHA-2 (or SHA1). See Generating A SHA-2 Keyring [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Domino_keyring] for more information.
