1310631 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote outlines a problem starting IBM® WebSphere® Application Server (WAS) 6.0 or 6.1 server instances from IBM Rational® Apllication Developer (RAD) 6.0 or 7.0 where administrative users can start the WAS 6.0 or 6.1 servers without a problem; however, non-administrative users receive various access or authorization errors when attempting to start WAS. 

CAUSE
Rational Apllication Developer can only be properly installed by a user with Administrative rights, however, RAD does not require a user to have administrative rights to run it. 

If you do not have read-write access to the various WAS 6.0 / 6.1 profiles directories, this type of error will occur.

Note: Only the Administrative users is given full access to the WAS 6.0/6.1 profiles subdirectories 
when RAD is installed. Non-Admin users will experience problems trying to run the WAS server 
instances from within RAD.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Check the security settings of your various WAS profile directories:<RAD-INSTALL-DIR>\runtimes\base_v6\profiles
    and
    <RAD-INSTALL-DIR>\runtimes\base_v61\profiles
    
    Be sure that your (non-Administrative) user has Full control of this directory (and all subdirectories of it).
    
    
 2. Restart the sever
    
    
 3. If the problem persists, please consult your IT department to find out how to modify the security policy of the profiles directory for the user.
    
    
 4. Only use this step if the prior steps do not work.

 * Delete all WAS profiles from the profiles directory in question.
   
   
 * Remove the profiles directory 
   
   
 * Use the user's account to create a directory called profiles in
   
   <RAD-INSTALL-DIR>\runtimes\base_v6
   and/or
   <RAD-INSTALL-DIR>\runtimes\base_v61

 * Create a new WAS profile and save it in the appropriate profiles subdirectory.
   
   
 * Restart the server
