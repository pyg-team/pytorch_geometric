QUESTION
 How do I create a default date/time of "now" whenever the today button is clicked using the java calendar for attributes in Change? 

ANSWER


The standard "assigned", "entered", etc. dates are dynamically created and populated by the tool, thus whenever you click the calendar button, you will see this date and time already populated within the calendar tool. When you select " Today " it re-populates the time and date back down to the form. 

A custom date attribute is not dynamically populated by the tool. Users are required to update this field manually. Because of this, there is no preset value for the calendar tool to use, thus the time field is blank. When " Today " is selected, it will take the highlighted day, and the blank time as 00:00 . 

To be able to click Today on any custom date attribute and populate the current time through the calendar would entail modifying the admin_calendar_dflt.html file in the /wsconfig/templates/pt/forms/ directory. This will require some abilities with regards to javascript code to actually be able to implement a "default" time for the Today button, though the code the setToday() function call is be clearly defined. 

Below is the html/javascript code to create a default date/time of "now" whenever the today button is clicked. Modify this section as shown below in the admin_calendar_dflt.html file: >  function initialize() 
{ 
buildCalParts(); 
calDate = new Date(calDateField.value); 
if (isNaN(calDate)){ 
calDate = new Date(); 
d_hour = calDate.getHours(); 
d_minute = calDate.getMinutes(); 
} 
else if (calDateField.value.indexOf(":") == -1) { 
newDate = new Date(); 
d_hour = newDate.getHours(); 
d_minute = newDate.getMinutes(); 
} 
else { d_hour = calDate.getHours(); 
d_minute = calDate.getMinutes(); } 
calDocTop = buildTopCalFrame(); 
calDocBottom = buildBottomCalFrame(); }
