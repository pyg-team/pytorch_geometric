APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When some NAS devices are added as NetAPP and some as "Other NAS
   " and put in same probe job, rerunning probe job causes dataServ
   
   RECREATE STEPS:
   1,Manually  add one NetAPP device as NetAPP
   2. Manually add another NAS device as "Other NAS"
   3. Set agent for the devices
   4. Run a discovery for NAS
   5. Create a probe job with both devices in it.
   6. Run a successful probe using the job.
   7. Run it again couple of times. Check the memory consumed by
   dataServer.

   *                      probe causes data server to consume     *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem can  be mitigated in the field  by seperating
   probe jo bs such that 1 NAS device is probed per job. The fix
   removes the memory issue, so once customer upgrade the level
   with the fix, probe job can be run having mutiple NAS of
   NetAPP and other type in same job.
