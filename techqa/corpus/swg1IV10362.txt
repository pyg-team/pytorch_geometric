APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running some of the tacmd adaptive threshold commands,
   queries running against the TDW which are locking the
   database.
   It should be reworked so that the command uses "with UR" in
   the SQL statement that it runs in the TDW Database. In this way,
   it will not lock out the row and tables in the database, and
   still allow other commands access to the TDW database at the
   same time.
   
   This is only applied to DB2 TDW.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
   Put (UNIT:ctsql in er det) in the trace and it'll show the
   sql syntax like this. - it doesn't have 'with UR' in the syntax.
   
   
   SELECT "KLZ_CPU".WRITETIME "WRITETIME", "KLZ_CPU"."Busy_CPU"
   "BUSYCPU"
   FROM "KLZ_CPU" WHERE ( ("KLZ_CPU".WRITETIME >=
   '1110922080000') AND
   ("KLZ_CPU".WRITETIME <= '1111005082240000') ) AND("KLZ_CPU".
   "System_Name" = 'test:LZ') ) ORDER BY "KLZ_CPU".WRITETIME ASC

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Adaptive Thresholds improvement.
   
   When running some of the tacmd adaptive threshold commands,
   queries running against the Tivoli Data Warehouse (TDW) lock the
   database.  When commands use "with UR" in the SQL statement that
   it runs in the TDW Database, it will not lock out the row and
   tables in the database and still allow other commands access to
   the TDW database at the same time.  This is only applied to DB2
   Warehouse and Summarization and Pruning tables.
   
   In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment, a new environment variable has been added.  See the
   "Install Actions" section of the APAR conclusion for more
   details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been updated to add a new environment variable
   'KFW_REPORT_WITH_UR' to address this.
   
   
   Install Actions
   
   In order for this APAR to be properly implemented in your
   environment, a new environment variable has been added.
   
   The new environment variable 'KFW_REPORT_WITH_UR' appends 'with
   UR' syntax into the sql query against DB2
   Warehouse/Summarization and Pruning tables to prevent locks.
   Default is N.
   
   KFW_REPORT_WITH_UR=N
   
   This variable only works for the DB2 Warehouse and Summarization
   and Pruning tables.
