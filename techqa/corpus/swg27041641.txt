 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 The FileNet P8 and IBM Content Foundation documentation for silently installing IBM Content Search Services fails to include a step to obtain the authentication token. 

CONTENT
An authentication token is required for configuring the connection between IBM Content Search Services and Content Engine (in release 5.1) or Content Platform Engine (in release 5.2). The following topics in IBM Knowledge Center fail to include a step to obtain the authentication token as part of the procedure for silently installing IBM Content Search Services:


 * Installing IBM Content Search Services silently [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.1.0/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin281.htm] [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r1m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin281.htm] (FileNet P8 5.1)
   
 * Installing IBM Content Search Services silently [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin281.htm] (FileNet P8 5.2)
   
 * Installing IBM Content Search Services silently [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin281.htm] (IBM Content Foundation)


Immediately after step 6 in each topic listed above, you must complete the following step to obtain the authentication token: In a command window, navigate to the css_install_location/server_name/bin directory and run the following command:

configTool printToken -configPath "css_install_location/server_name/config" 

You will specify the authentication token when you use Enterprise Manager (in FileNet P8 5.1) or IBM Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (in FileNet P8 5.2 or IBM Content Foundation 5.2) to configure the IBM Content Search Services server.
