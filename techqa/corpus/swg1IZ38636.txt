PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker and    *
   *                 the UserNameServer.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If a user was added to the              *
   *                      UserNameServer, a subscription by       *
   *                      that user would result in a BIP7017     *
   *                      error message from the non-default      *
   *                      execution groups.                       *
   *                      If the execution groups are restarted,  *
   *                      the subscription was processed without  *
   *                      an error from the non-default execution *
   *                      groups.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The UserNameServer will forward new and deleted users and
   groups to the default execution group and they should be
   passed onto the non-default execution groups.
   The messages were not being correctly passed on which meant
   that the non-default execution groups did not know about
   the new user.
   If a subscription was issued for that user, the non-default
   execution groups would reject the subscription where as the
   default execution group would  accept the subscription.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The default execution group was changed to pass on the
   the changes to the users to the non-default execution
   groups.
