 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am using SPSS Server and have a few questions on the license. How/Where do I get the license information for SPSS Server ? How can I see when my SPSS Server license will be expired? How can I see what modules are licensed? 

ANSWER
SPSS Server's license is recorded in a file called spss.err located in the ..\en\windows directory. 
You can use the Show License syntax the same way with SPSS Server in two ways. 

1. Connect SPSS Client to SPSS Server and run the syntax.

2. Without using the client, execute spssb.exe in the SPSS Server directory. This brings up an interactive >SPSS command prompt. Type 'Show License.' and <ENTER>. Type 'Finish.' to get out
