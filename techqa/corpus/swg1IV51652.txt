ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cannot correct GL Debit account if Labour Record and Workorder
   Record merge to form an invlaid GL
   
   if the labour/workorder GL combination is invalid there is no
   way to correct the invalid account.
   
   Environment Maximo Asset Managment 7.5.0.4
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   Ensure JONES laborcraftrate record has glaccount='???-???-300'
   (select glaccount from laborcraftrate where laborcode='JONES')
   
       In Chart of Accounts application, Select Action ->
   Validation
       Options, Ensure that "Validate GL Component Combinations" is
   TRUE
   
       In Chart of Accounts application, Delete account
   '6000-200-300'
   
       Create a new Work Order: GL Account' 6000-200-???'
   
       Approve work order
   
       In the work order Actuals tab, create New Row, specify Labor
   JONES
   RESULT:As expected, get the following error since the
   combination
   results in invalid account combination '6000-200-300': Not a
   valid GL
   account.
   Either the required components are not filled or the component
   values
   are not valid. Make sure the GL account value is entered in the
   appropriate format as defined in the GL Account application.
   (BMXAA4146)
   
       Second attempt. Create another Labor transaction using New
   Row,
   clear out the GL Debit Account field FIRST, now select labor
   JONES.
   RESULT: Again error.
   
   They want to be able to change the GL on the work
   order to a valid GL for the 1% of the time this happens. By
   not allowing them to change it (as the program is currently
   functioning),
