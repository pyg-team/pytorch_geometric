APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After migrating his CA backing store from V2.1 to V2.2,
   two security levels custmer had defined in V2.1,
   which he had explicitly specified as TLS V1.2 only, mistakenly
   included TLS V1.1, in addition to TLS V1.2.
   The customer can successfully remove TLS V1.1 from the security
   levels in the 2.2 backing store using the CA panels. so the
   problem appears to be just with the migration process, not the
   CA panels.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use CA to remove TLS V1.1 from Security Levels after the
   migration process is complete.
