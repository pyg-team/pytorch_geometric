ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM for WAS 6.1
   
   Problem Description:
   
   There are 2 sections in Appendix F which show two different
   syntax for running datatrim.sh
   
   In the 'Executing the Data Trimmer' section it specifies:
   
   Start the Data Trimmer process on the Managing Server. (If you
   have your Managing Server and Database Server on two different
   servers, start the Data Trimmer on the Managing Server server.)
   The syntax is as follows:
   
   $AM_HOME/bin/datatrim.sh
   
   ===
   
   In the same Appendix F, there is a section called "Data Trimming
   Utilities" > "Activation"...the syntax is shown as the
   following:
   
   MS_home/bin/datatrim.sh octigate amuser amuser_password
   
   ===============
   
   The first option is the correct one. The user does not have to
   specify the clear text userid and password when running the
   script.
   
   The information in the Appendix needs to be consistent.
