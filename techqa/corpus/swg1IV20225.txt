ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR IZ86057 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ86057] was released with ITIM 5.1 FP5:
   
   APAR:    IZ86057 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ86057]
   Symptom: ITIM Fixpack installation overwrites the db2jcc.jar and
   the db2jcc_license_cu.jar file.
   
   which was required as some customers use later versions of the
   driver.
   
   However, there seem to be no instructions, in neither the ITIM
   manuals/fixpack readme or the DB2 manuals/fixpacks readmes about
   upgrading the driver for client applications.
   
   My customer has requested if he defines a symbolic link that
   refers to the jdbc driver installed with the DB2
   (/opt/ibm/db2/V9.7/java/db2jcc.jar), then he will never have to
   think about using the correct driver for the DB2 Fixpack
   version.
   
   Basically though, there seems to be no advice on the ITIM side
   about when it's appropiate to upgrade the drivers, or whether
   customers should do it all even? And would using a symbolic link
   be supported?
   
   L3 have agreed this needs to be clarified, however it will take
   some time to investigate and test the recommendations.
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate: The ITIM Fixpack readme gives no
                       instructions on when/if to upgrade the
                       driver.
   
   
   Desired Behavior: Document this to make it clear what is the
                     correct, and more importantly, supported
                     process.
   
   
   Environment: ITIM 5.1
                DB2 any version, but would also apply to Oracle and
                MSSQL drivers.
   
   Thanks
