 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have already downloaded the base Content Manager OnDemand for i Version 7.2 code, which includes Common Server and ODWEK, by following the instructions in the Flash in the "Related information" link below. I've also purchased the optional PDF Indexer feature. How would I go about downloading it? 

CAUSE
Like the base code, this feature must also be downloaded from the Passport Advantage web site. You must be Passport Advantage-entitled (with your software subscription) to the 5770-RD1 product before you can download it or any of the optional chargeable features. 

ANSWER
You should verify with your IBM marketing representative or IBM business partner that you are Passport Advantage-entitled. If you are, you can go to the Passport Advantage Web site and download the Content Manager OnDemand for i software. 


To download the software: 

1. Go to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage] and click the tab labeled Passport Advantage Online. That will bring you to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm], where you can click Customer sign-in.

2. Enter your registration ID or site number. If you do not know what this is or you do not have a registration ID, contact the Passport Advantage group at 1-800-978-2246. Their hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern time (EDT (summer) or EST (winter)), excluding U.S. legal holidays. For customers outside the U.S. or Canada, see https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html [https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html] . If, on the other hand, you need your password reset or are having issues logging on to Passport Advantage Online, dial 888-426-4409.

3. Click on Software download & media access, then Continue to proceed to the "Download Software" tab. All entitled software downloads should be listed. 

4. If you have purchased the Content Manager OnDemand for i PDF Indexer optional feature, then select IBM Content Manager OnDemand PDF Indexer for i5/OS. On the next panel, select "All operating systems" (not "IBM i") for the Operating system and specify your language, then Go, Confirm that the Version says 7.2.0. You should see a checkmark next to "Required: 23 files", Click on the plus sign next to "Select individual files" and look for IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i PDF Indexer V7.2 Multilingual eAssembly (CRRA8ML). Expand the Twistie and place a checkmark next to IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i PDF Indexer V7.2 Multilingual (CIYA4ML). Then click on the Download button. On the screen that follows, you will select a Download location and Download method. Once you agree to the license agreement's terms and conditions, the files will begin downloading. 

5. Depending on the download method selected, the PDF Indexer code might get placed in the C:\DownloadDirector directory. The downloaded zip file extracts into two files. These are a) the code itself (Option 12 of 5770-RD1) in a file named "PDF" and b) a CIYA4ML.pdf file that has the instructions for uploading the code to the IBM i server and loading this option of the Licensed Program Product. This PDF instruction file is also provided below.
