ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You execute the following select:
   
   select ('02/28/2000'::date+3 units year) from systables where
   tabid=1;
   
   and it succeeds. However, because 2000 is a leap year, adding
   three years to Feb. 29 creates an invalid date and the same
   select now fails:
   
   select ('02/29/2000'::date+3 units year) from systables where
   tabid=1;
   
    1267: The result of a datetime computation is out of range.
   Error in line 1
   Near character position 68
   
   
   The second query should succeed, returning 02/28/2003 because
   that is the last day of February in 2003.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * See Error Description                                        *
   * Changed the behavior so that if subtracting a YEAR/MONTH     *
   * interval from a DATETIME YEAR TO DAY (or other DATETIME      *
   * variant involving DAY as MONTH) generates a day number after *
   * the last day of the month (eg 29th, 30th or 31st February in *
   * non-leap year, 30th or 31st February in a leap year, 31st    *
   * April, 31st June, 31st September, 31st November), then the   *
   * date is 'rounded down' to the last actual day of the month.  *
   * (Weirdness: if using a DATETIME MONTH TO DAY, the answer     *
   * will be 29th February regardless of the current year.        *
   * Anything else leads to data being valid some years and       *
   * invalid in other years, which is worse than the problem we   *
   * started with.  It is also the pre-existing behavior.)        *
