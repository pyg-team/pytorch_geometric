ENVIRONMENT

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When trying to install the Maximo 7.5.0.6 Fixpack (=FP) on a Maximo 7.5.0.3 environment, you might get error "Throwable occurred: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The 

driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "SQL Server did not return a response. The connection has been closed.". 

 at com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerConnection.termi 

 nate(SQLServerConnection.java:1368) " 

 

This error is caused by an old SQL JDBC driver. 

 

In order to fix this issue, please follow the steps below : 

 

1. Download and use sqljdbc.jar 4.0 (for example, sqljdbc_4.0.2206.100_enu.exe) 

from http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=11774 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=11774]. 

Extract sqljdbc4.jar and rename it to sqljdbc.jar. 

 

2. The Maximo 7.5.0.6 Fix Pack installer unpacks JDBC drivers that it uses to a temporary directory. 

This directory is located at C:\Users\admin group user\AppData\Local\Temp 

For example, C:\Users\Maximodev01\AppData\Local\Temp 

 

So please run install.exe or install_win64.exe to install the 7.5.0.6 Fix Pack. 

 

3. Click OK on the initial "Tivoli's process automation engine" screen. 

 

4. Click Next on the Introduction screen. 

 

5. On the Choose installation folder screen, make sure the selection is valid, and click Next. 

 

6. It will analyze the installed packages, and give you a list of what is installed. Click Next. 

 

7. Copy the updated sqljdbc.jar to 

C:\Users\Maximodev01\AppData\Local\Temp, replacing the existing 

file. 

 

8. Go back to the Maximo Asset Management Package Summary screen. 

 

9. Click on Next to resume installation and select the 'Defer" option for deploying of Maximo ear files and updating the database. 

 

10. When the Fix Pack installation completes, exit out of the installer. 

 

11. Run Updatedb and rebuild and redeploy maximo.ear accordingly. 

 Delete server WAS cache files and restart the Maximo application Server.
