Title: IBM Policy server message log file shows error HPDBA0222E - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Following errors are seen in policy server message log file:

HPDBA0222E The TCP/IP host information could not be determined from the server hostname. Ensure that the server hostname is correct.
HPDDB0900I Could not send client notification (new-webseald-isam2, 0x106520de). 

CAUSE
These errors are generally seen if reverse proxy instance is configured on remote appliance (and not on the appliance which is configured as master policy server) 

Following screen shows that while creating new reverse proxy instance, by default, uses the host name configured on appliance. 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22006259&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22006259&aid=1] 

Policy server tries to update policy database to all reverse proxy instances while starting runtime service and if it can't communicate over the network then shows above error in log file.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify the hostname used to configure the reverse proxy instance. 

Verify DNS Server and also Host file settings.
Make sure Policy server appliance can resolve the host name of reverse proxy. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can also add the hostname and ip address mapping in host file if host name is not resolvable by DNS server. 

(1) Login to LMI console of Policy server appliance
(2) Navigate to System settings > Network settings > Hosts file
(3) Click New and create a host record
(4) Save the changes 
(5) Restart runtime service and verify the policy server log file if it can send policy database updates to remote reverse proxy instance
