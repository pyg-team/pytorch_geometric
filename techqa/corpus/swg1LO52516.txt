ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We see this behavior in ICC when we restart the ICC
   EmailConnector
   process. The ICC EmailConnector process
   
   runs internally multi-threaded as seen in the attached nsd log.
   For some
   reason it sometimes happens that after restarting the
   
   EmailConnector process everything seems to be fine until the
   first
   database open call. This database open call doesn't return and
   hang.
   
   
   As I said this behavior is not reproducible every time we
   restart the
   EmailConnector service.
   
   Is there anything we can try or check before or while it is
   hanging to
   get details about the
   cause?
   
   
   
   
   ICC is running on a Windows server. On the same sever a Domino
   server
   version 8.5 FP1 is installed and used as runtime SDK to
   connector to
   real Domino Email servers.
   
   we use API version of 03/2010 with no level assigned.
