ABSTRACT
 This Interim Fix must be applied to your WebSphere Application Server when using WebSphere Commerce V6.0. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
When installing WebSphere Commerce, or any WebSphere Commerce Fix Pack, you must also apply this Interim Fix. 

The file permission fix is an extension to the WebSphere Application Server Application Management tooling that sets the file permission on files within the WebSphere Commerce EAR. This allows the Web server (which is running as a different user) to have access to the static content. Without access to these files your WebSphere Commerce instance will not work, since the static content (for example, images and javascript) is not served. 

If you have created your instance BEFORE installing this fix, you can correct this problem by completing the steps outlined in the following technote: Page is forbidden when accessing WebSphere Commerce tools (HTTP Error 403) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21240016].

PREREQUISITES
