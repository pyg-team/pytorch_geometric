OPTIM DIRECTORY SUPPORT
For Optim 11.3 solutions that use Optim designer and Optim manager, the Optim directory and the IBM InfoSphere Optim Connection Manager database must be Unicode and are supported on the following database management systems only.

In DB2, certain directory tables require an 8K tablespace. The default size for DB2 is 4K. Ensure that the directory owner has authorization to an 8K tablespace or that a specific 8K tablespace is specified when installing or upgrading.

SUPPORTED DATA SOURCES
The Optim solutions support data sources heterogeneously. That is, a solution can generally process a business object that consists of data from one or more data sources or extract data from one data source or DBMS and insert it in another. Select a tab for more information about supported data sources.

To prevent inadvertent deletion or alteration of data from system tables for your relational database management system, your Optim solution cannot be used in INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE processing against these tables.

2016

Supported 

SQL Server Loader does not support the GEOGRAPHY, GEOMETRY or HIERARCHYID data types.

Minimum required level of Optim is 11.3.0.5

Optim supports the Always Encrypted feature. This support is currently on Windows only. Currently, due to a limitation in the Microsoft driver, Always Encrypted is not supported for the VARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) data types.

Support levels

The support level for a version of a database is toleration or supported.

If a database is provided at a toleration level, the Optim solution can connect to the data source. The Optim solution also supports data types and features supported in previous releases of the solution but does not support all features of the data source.

If a data source is supported, the Optim solution also:

 *  Supports processing of the most common data types for the data source
 *  Might support or exploit other new features of the data source

In addition, for relational databases, the Optim solution supports extracting object definitions for the database as well as preserving and using (with the Optim create utility) extracted objects. 

SET UP CONSIDERATIONS
 * 
 * You must use the DataDirect ODBC driver manager distributed with your Optim solution to configure the server on a UNIX or Linux machine. For information needed to install and configure the DataDirect ODBC driver manager, see the Progress DataDirect "DataDirect Connect® Series for ODBC Users Guide".
 * The Optim directory cannot reside on UNIX or Linux.]
