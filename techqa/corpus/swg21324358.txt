QUESTION
 The error "ORA-00942: table or view does not exist" appears when installing DOORS XT. What is the problem? 

ANSWER
I am in the process of installing DOORS XT 2.1, following the instructions found in the manual "Installing and Setting Up DOORS XT" . When running the command: 


@?\rdbms\admin\xaview.sql 

as instructed in the section "Changing the database using SQL", I get the error message: 

DROP VIEW v$xatrans$ 
* 
ERROR at line 1: 
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist 

DROP VIEW v$pending_xatrans$ 
* 
ERROR at line 1: 
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist 

View created. 

View created. 




This message is not an error message as such. Most SQL will try and first drop a table / view before subsequently trying to create a new one, as indicated in this message. You should then be able to carry on your installation of DOORS XT.
