Title: IBM WSADMIN issues exception WASX7022E while executing AdminApp export command - United States

Text:
was app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You notice the WSADMIN tool issues following exception when executing the command : 

./wsadmin.sh -username wpsbind -password wpsbind -c "$AdminApp export wps /tmp/wpsTemp/wps.ear" 

WASX7209I: Connected to process "server1" on node dprtla1 using SOAP connector; The type of process is: UnManagedProcess WASX7022E: Problem running command " export wps /tmp/wpsTemp/wearr" -- exception information: com.ibm.bsf.BSFException: error while eval'ing 
Jacl expression: invalid command name "export" 

In the above command , wps.ear is an application that we are exporting and /tmp/wpsTemp/wps.ear is the location where we are exporting to. 

CAUSE
On UNIXÂ®, using wsadmin -c to invoke a command that includes dollar signs results in the shell attempting to do variable substitution.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem appears only in a UNIX environment when running a scripting command as individual command. 

To correct this problem, escape the dollar sign with a backslash. For example: 


 * wsadmin -c "\$AdminApp export ..."
