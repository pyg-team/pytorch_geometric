7.3.0-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0004 Fixes
====================================

IZ80783
When probe failover is enabled, and a slave probe is running on
Windows, the number of handles as seen in the Windows Task
Manager grows continuously. This problem has been fixed.


IZ80678
Alerts with a Manager of GatewayWatch were previously missing
data in the ServerName and Tally columns of the ObjectServer.
This problem has been fixed.


IZ75736
An encrypted PA.Password shows in clear text in the Administrator
GUI. Also, if any value is changed in the Administrator GUI,
encrypted passwords get written out in decrypted form. This
problem has been resolved.


IZ84694
Installation of a 7.3 probe on Windows may fail.


IZ84890
The object server core dumps when starting up due to bad trigger
syntax. This problem has been resolved.


IZ78509
Fields containing single quotes can cause tools to fail from the
Windows Event List. This problem has been resolved.


IZ85473
OMNIbus fix pack installations were failing due to Java out of
memory errors. This problem has been resolved.


IZ86656
OMNIbus 7.3 is now supported on AIX 7.1.


IZ84650
The recorded profiling times may be incorrect on a busy system.
The profiling timer was not being suspended when the Object
Server was busy with other tasks. This problem has been
resolved.


IZ86876
When running the 'uninstall' program for a gateway or probe, the
uninstaller would be removed but the gateway or probe would
remain installed. This has been fixed.


IZ83743
Japanese character strings are truncated when displayed in the
bottom portion of the Windows event list. This problem has been
resolved.


IZ81420
When a group is deleted via the Administrator, the tool access
data associated with that group is not removed. This caused
nco_confpack export to fail. The tool access data associated
with the group is now removed. However, if the Administrator is
not used to delete the group - if the group is deleted using the
SQL interface, with 'drop group <group_name>' - the tool access
data will not be removed, and the nco_confpack export will still
fail.


IZ84304
Reduced memory required for storing large multi-column lookup
tables.
Increased performance of lookup tables with large numbers of
entries.


IZ86660
If a tool that required a prompt was launched, it would be
executed when the prompt window is closed with the 'X' or using
Alt+F4. The new and correct behavior will be for the tool
execution to be aborted.


IZ89203
Probes on Windows failed to locate rules files given by relative
paths on the command line. This has now been fixed.


IZ69192
Probes on Windows could create log file pools instead of writing
to a single log file. This has been fixed.


IZ88264
Updates were made to the default rules file provided for
integration with Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery
Manager (TADDM).
NOTE: Applying the fix pack will overwrite the current rules
file at NCHOME/omnibus/extensions/taddm/tivoli_eif_taddm.rules
without prompting the end user.
