APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a stream which merges several tables together; when I run
   it against the Teradata Native Driver 15.10, I get errors like:
   SQL Validation Error: 42000[-3704] [Teradata][ODBC Teradata
   Driver][Teradata Database] '{' ('7B'X) is not a valid Teradata
   SQL token
   
   If I use driver version 14.10, I do not have such errors.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enable the Legacy Parser in 15.10.
   On Linux this translates to:
   in your odbc.ini, add:
   ENABLELEGACYPARSER=Yes
   and restart Modeler Server.
