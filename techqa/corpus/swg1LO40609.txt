APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  To Full Index Hebrew text in a PDF file attachment the
   FORMATS.INI file needs
   to be modified so the line :
   
   200=pdf
   
   is changed to
   
   200=lpdf
   
   Once this is done and the index built (or rebuilt) then can find
   Hebrew text
   correctly, even in a mixed Hebrew/English String.
   
   However, when this is in place the search will not find English
   text in the
   mixed PDF file.
   
   This seems to be related to SPR : ZQSA6T8FHU which had the
   reverse issue of
   Hebrew text not being found in a mixed language PDF file.
   
   The fix for ZQSA6T8FHU seems to have introduced a problem in
   searching for the
   English text.
