Title: IBM Scan Health widget reports Missing Scan Results and data from scan files is not imported - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Scan Health widget shows the health of scans that are running in your infrastructure. In IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis v9.2 or IBM License Metric Tool v9.2 it may happen that this widget reports endpoints which are Missing Scan Results. Also the data from scan files is not imported into SUA / LMT even though endpoints are working fine and data import logs does not show any errors. 

SYMPTOM
Scan Health widget reports Missing Scan Results for most, or all of the endpoints. The number of endpoints will be close to, or equal to the result of following sql query: 

SELECT count(*) FROM sam.scan_files_persistent sf
JOIN dbo.computers c ON c.id = sf.computer_id
JOIN dbo.datasource_files df ON df.file_name = sf.file_name AND df.computer_id = sf.computer_id
WHERE sf.deleted = 1
AND c.deleted = 0
AND df.deleted = 0


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem is resolved in SUA / ILMT 9.2 patch 1 (9.2.0.1).
