PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving error 'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.' on an Assign Service step of a BP. (SCI64550) 

SYMPTOM


Receiving error 'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.' on an Assign Service step of a BP. 
org.w3c.dom.DOMException: INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.


CAUSE


The "to" parameter of the Assign statement uses an XPath statement.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


XPath statements are not supported in the "to" parameter of the Assign statement.

The parameter is a Path not an XPath. the reason being that an XPath can refer to a node set, so the Assign Statement would have a node set being assigned to a node set and that is ambiguous. 
This restriction is per the BPML specifications.

But a dynamic XPath node can be created using "This Service". Please have a look at this knowledge base ID - PRI24275 for more details.
