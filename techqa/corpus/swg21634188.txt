Title: IBM Connection with Decision Center has failed - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The connection to Rule Team Server or Decision Center might fail with the message "Connection with [Rule Team Server or Decision Center] has failed", but with no further indication of what the issue might be. 

SYMPTOM
The connection to Rule Team Server or Decision Center might fail with the message "Connection with [Rule Team Server or Decision Center] has failed" in the Eclipse UI. However, the Eclipse log (<yourWorkspace>\.metadata\.log) and the server logs do not show any errors that indicate what the cause of the connection failure might be:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634188&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634188&aid=1] 
DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the Eclipse log (<yourWorkspace>\.metadata\.log) and the server logs.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To identify the error that is causing the connection to fail, run the Decision Center print-config-param ANT task using the same credentials and the exact same Rule Team Server/Decision Center URL that you used when failing to synchronize from Rule Studio/Rule Designer. 

The print-config-param ANT task simply prints the server parameters but does not modify its configuration. 

If you run the ANT task from the same machine and with the same JRE running Rule Studio/Rule Designer, the connection should fail as well and you will see the stack trace showing the problem. 

Based on the information in the stack trace, you can then resolve the connection issue.
