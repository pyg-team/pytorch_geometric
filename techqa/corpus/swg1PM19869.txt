APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  FM should:
   
   
   1. Accept quotes in the FMN0POPI definition
   
   2. Regardless of whether quotes are used in the FMN0POPI
      definition the RESET command should cause quotes to be
      wrapped around the datasets.
   
   This applies to HLASM , PL/I and COBOL SYSLIBS.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 1. The SYSLIB data set names as         *
   *                      supplied in the FMN0POPT module are not *
   *                      enclosed in quotes when displayed in    *
   *                      the Compiler Option panels after the    *
   *                      RESET command has been issued.          *
   *                      2. The SYSLIB data set names as         *
   *                      supplied in the FMN0POPT module are not *
   *                      being correctly populated on the COBOL  *
   *                      Compiler Option panel.                  *
   *                      3. The installation compiler options    *
   *                      are not used when a new user or         *
   *                      File Manager FM is invoked with a new   *
   *                      profile member.                         *
   *                      4. The RESET command is ignored when    *
   *                      issued from the Compiler Language       *
   *                      Selection panel.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   The data set names supplied in the FMN0POPT module are not being
   enclosed in quotes prior to populating the panel variables when
   the RESET command is issued on the Compiler Option panels.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SYSLIB data set names in the Compiler Option panels will be
   be enclosed in quotes when the RESET command is issued.
   Installation values will be used if profile variables for the
   value do not exist.
   The RESET command will be detected when issued from the Compiler
   Language Selection panel.
