ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Client had questions about placement of VMs on the ESX host,
   which is done by the VC.
   With TSAM, it is strongly recommended to enable VMWare DRS as
   described by the following technote
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592673 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592673]
   
   However, TSAM needs to document the details on how to enable the
   DRS and which level of DRS is recommended to be enabled for use
   with TSAM, this information is missing in the product
   documentation.
   
   Per VMWare documentation in the following link
   http://pubs.vmware.com/vi35u2/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp. [http://pubs.vmware.com/vi35u2/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.]
   htm?cont
   ext=resmgmt&file=vc_cluster_drs.8.13.html
   
   there are several ways in wich DRS can be enabled. There are 3
   automation levels: manually, partially and fully automated. For
   automated there are 5 sublevels ranging form conservative to
   aggressive.
   
   TSAM L3 confirmed that for DRS, the recommendation is to have at
   least "Partially automated" set as automation level.
   This information and any additional applicable details need to
   be incorporated in the TSAM documentation.

   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of Tivoli Service Automation Manager
   versions 7.2.1.5 and higher
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Client has hanging and canceled requests in this environment.
   Extending memory of a VM fails although ESX has enough memory
   and checking resources before modification gives positive
   results.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION
   An update in the documentation for versions: 7.2.1.6, 7.2.2.2
   and 7.2.3 is necessary.

   Installation and Administration Guide (SC34-2657) and
   Information Center when available.
   
   The documentation changes can also be found in the conclusion
   section below.
