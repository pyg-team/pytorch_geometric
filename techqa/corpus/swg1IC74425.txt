ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware 3.8.1.6
   
   When a SLM statement is added at the port-operation level of a
   WSDL attached to a Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy) with a WSRR
   subscription, the SLM statement will be moved all the way up to
   the proxy level. This issue may also occur when attaching the
   SLM statement at levels higher up in the WSDL tree.
   
   The addition of the SLM statement fails due to an internal
   character length limit being reached. When adding the SLM
   statement, DataPower needs to construct unique SLM resource
   class names in order to set unique SLM preferences. In this
   case, the unique SLM resource class name being constructed ends
   up exceeding the internal character length limit which is 128
   characters.
   
   
   HOW TO REPRODUCE
   1. Create a WS-Proxy with a WSRR subscription.
   2. Click on the 'SLM Policy' tab.
   3. From the 'Auto Generated SLM Statements' section, drill down
   to the WSDL port-operation level.
   4. Click on Request. This will give you a popup window to enter
   the interval (seconds) and threshold (# of requests) and action
   (throttle).
   5. Enter some values for the Interval and Threshold fields then
   click Apply.
   6. Click Apply at the service level to apply the changes to the
   WS-Proxy.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Below are different approaches that may be used to workaround
   this issue:
   1. Attach the SLM statement at a level higher in the WSDL tree
   so that the generated name will be shorter. Or
   2. Manually create the SLM resource class for the level of the
   tree you want the statement on. Or
   3. Use an SLM action within the processing policy at the
   appropriate WSDL level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected DataPower customers are those who are using the service
   level monitoring (SLM) policy tab of the web service proxy to
   add SLM statements.
   
   SLM statements added at some levels of the tree may incorrectly
   appear at the proxy level of the tree.
   
   DataPower is automatically generating an SLM resource class name
   which at times can exceed the maximum allowed length.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix will be available in next major releases
