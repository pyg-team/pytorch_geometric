ABSTRACT
 General Availability (GA) of the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting was 22 June 2010. The GA of the WebSphere Application Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting was 18 June 2010. These free Feature Packs promote efficient development and application innovation by enabling enterprise application developers with an agile dynamic scripting programming model. This document contains highlights from the announcement letter and a link to the announcement letter. 

CONTENT
The Feature Packs for Dynamic Scripting can be used to: 

 * Rapidly develop, evolve, and deploy rich Web applications, using dynamic scripting languages 
 * Expose RESTful Web services and widgets for use in mashups and consoles 
 * Compose composite services, widgets, and applications that combine Web 2.0-style public and enterprise data feeds


The Feature Packs for Dynamic Scripting are optional product extensions for IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS V4.1, and IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 and V7.0. 

Based on technology from WebSphere sMash V1.1.1, CICS TS and WebSphere Application Server Feature Packs for Dynamic Scripting provide support for dynamic scripting languages: PHP, Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), and Groovy. The Feature Packs can enable developers to exploit the programming languages and leverage Web 2.0 technologies, such as Asynchronous JavaScript™ and XML (AJAX), representational state transfer (REST), Atom, JavaScript object notation (JSON), and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) to unleash and reuse enterprise content. The built-in Zero Resource Model (ZRM) provides a simplified way to create RESTful resource handlers with a data store that can be mapped to both IBM DB2 for z/OS and Multiplatforms for improved resilience, security, and performance.
