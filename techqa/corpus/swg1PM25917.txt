APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Clicking on any CR link in home page or any CR's in a report,
   the Cr open up fine, but the color of the links does not change.
   It is observed that the product is forcing the link to stay the
   same blue color.  This makes it difficult when he is viewing a
   list of over a hundred CR's.
   
   Environment:
   
   Rational Change 5.2.0.4
   
   As per the customer the issue is noticed on the following
   browsers:
   
   Internet Explorer 8
   Firefox 3.6.10
   Google Chrome
   
   Support:
   
   We have tested this issue in our test environment and are able
   to reproduce the issue.
   
   We did test this behavior in my test environment and here are
   our observations:
   
   1. On the home page 'The CR links' color does not change when
   clicked on them, hence the issue is reproducible as observed by
   the customer.
   
    2. Whereas, if we generate a report and access the CR's from
   the report, the colors do change, but not dynamically.
        If the page is refreshed or  if the report is accessed
   again, the CR's link color would have changed.
   
   This has been tested on IE 6, 7 , 8 and on Firefox.
