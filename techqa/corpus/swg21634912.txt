 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) is the new standard interface for managing Content Engine (CE) server; however, FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) has been used in CE 3.5.x, 4.x, 5.0, and 5.1. The ACCE interface arranges objects differently than FEM, and users may have trouble finding some objects/directories in ACCE. 

ANSWER
Here is a table of common directories and objects within FEM, and it's new locations in ACCE.
