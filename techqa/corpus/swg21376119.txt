QUESTION
 Is it possible to export the list of Filtered URL's from a scan in IBM Security Appscan Standard? 

ANSWER
Yes, the list of Filtered URL's from a scan can be exported in AppScan Standard. 

This action is possible by exporting the scan results as a part of an XML file. To get this list, go to:File > Export > Scan Results as XML , then save the resulting XML file. 

If you search the XML file for the term FilteredLinks , this will bring you to the section of the file containing all the filtered URL's from the scan. 

 

Additionally should you need a list of other Application Data such as Visited Links or Script Parameters you could search for VisitedLinks or ScriptParameters
