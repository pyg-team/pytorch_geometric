 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. This includes the vulnerability that has been referred to as “FREAK”. 
Default configuration of Tivoli Management Framework does not use OpenSSL.
OpenSSL is used by Tivoli Management Framework 4.1.1 only in linux-ix86 and linux-s390 if the SSLB
component is installed and the odadmin "Network Security" parameter set to SSL or FORCE_SSL.
OpenSSL over addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEIDs details:

CVEID: CVE-2014-3569 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3569]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols by the ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an unexpected handshake to trigger a NULL pointer dereference and cause the daemon to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99706 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99706] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99704] for the current score

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Tivoli Management Framework 4.1.1

On 4.1.1 SSL-B (Linux on Intel or z/OS):
Apply the SSL-B Interim Fix 4.1.1-TMF-0143 to upgrade OpenSSL to version1.0.1k

On 4.1.1 TMR/MN/GW (Linux on Intel or z/OS):
Apply the TMR/MN/GW Interim Fix 4.1.1-TMF-0144 to upgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.1k

How to acquire fix:
download the interim fixes from FixCentral repository
http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable the SSL communication by using the following command: 

 odadmin set_network_security none all 

 odadmin reexec all 

It will revert back the encryption to default xor mechanism.
