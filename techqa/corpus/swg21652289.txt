QUESTION
 How do I assess readiness for migrating to DB2 Text Search text search indexing technology in my IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition content management system? 

CAUSE
DB2 announced the deprecation of Net Search Extender in Version 10.1. Support for DB2 Text Search is added to IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition Version 8.5. Users must begin planning to migrate to DB2 Text Search as the text search engine.

ANSWER
 

Important: The following information applies only to IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition. For IBM Content Manager for z/OS, no migration is needed. IBM Text Search for DB2 for z/OS works with older Java APIs and eClient. 

Before deciding to add a DB2 Text Search index for any given item type, determine which products or applications are using text search on that item type. 

 * Review the Migrating to DB2 Text Search [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.ts.doc/doc/c0053115.html] topics in the IBM DB2 Information Center. 
 * If any C++ applications use that item type, do not migrate that item type from Net Search Extender to DB2 Text Search. 
 * If your content management system uses any Java applications that do not use the IBM Content Manager Version 8.5 APIs, do not migrate these applications until the APIs are upgraded to Version 8.5. 
 * If you use IBM Content Navigator in your content management system, then use the latest version of IBM Content Navigator that supports IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition Version 8.5 features. However, the current needs of your business might require that you continue using IBM Content Navigator Version 2.0.2 or earlier, with a plan to upgrade this client at a later date. If so, then you must replace the existing IBM Content Manager JAR files in the IBM Content Navigator deployment location with the IBM Content Manager Version 8.5 JAR files. 
 * For any application that uses the Net Search Extender text search syntax, that application must be rewritten to use the DB2 Text Search text search syntax. For more information, see the IBM DB2 Information Center, including the topics about DB2 Text Search query planning [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r5/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.ts.doc/doc/c_planningsrch.html]. 
 * Users of IBM Content Collector, IBM eDiscovery Manager and IBM eDiscovery Analyzer should wait until support for DB2 Text Search is added in those products before attempting to migrate their item type indexes to DB2 Text Search.
   

Restriction: For IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition Version 8.5, the deprecated user clients, Client for Windows and eClient, do not work with the syntax of text search indexes generated by DB2 Text Search. The recommended user client is the IBM Content Navigator client that supports IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition Version 8.5 features.
