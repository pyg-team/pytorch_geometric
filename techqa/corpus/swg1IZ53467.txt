APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The internal name for storing custom queries in the BPC Explorer
   also contains the userID that logged on to BPC Explorer. In case
   this userID gets too long, the field for the name to store the
   custom query on the DB is too short.
   This results then in an SQL error message and the user cannot
   store any custom view within the BPC Explorer anymore.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Saving BPC Explorer personalized/customized views requires a
   unique name.
   The user ID was part of the generated name, but with a long user
   ID the length of the name exceeds the allowed maximum.
   Name generation has been improved to make sure that the maximum
   length is not exceeded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem will be fixed with V6202
