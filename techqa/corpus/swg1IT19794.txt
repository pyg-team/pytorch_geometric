APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   While sending a message using the method
   MessageProducer.send(Message), the JMS client detected that
   the queue manager had failed over and performed
   automatic client reconnection. This was done before waiting for
   the queue manager to confirm that the message was put
   successfully.  Because the queue manager failed over after it
   had received the message and before it could send back a reply,
   the message was successfully put using a non-transacted JMS
   session.
   
   After reconnecting, the JMS client sent the message again.
   This resulted in the message arriving on the queue twice.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes for JMS.
   - The IBM MQ V8.0 classes for JMS.
   - The IBM MQ V9.0.0.x classes for JMS.
   
   who have JMS applications that:
   
   - Use a connection factory that has the CLIENTRECONNECTOPTIONS
   property set to either QMGR or ANY to create a JMS connection to
   a multi-instance queue manager.
   - Create a non-transacted JMS session from the JMS connection.
   - Create a JMS MessageProducer from the JMS session for a
   destination hosted on the multi-instance queue manager, where
   the destination has its PERSISTENCE property configured such
   that non-persistent messages are sent to the destination.
   - Use the JMS MessageProducer to send messages to the
   destination.

   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When an application using the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS
   connects to a multi-instance queue manager, using a Connection
   Factory that has been configured to use automatic client
   reconnection (as documented in the Automatic JMS client
   reconnection topic in the MQ V8 and later sections of IBM
   Knowledge Center :
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm]
   .mq.dev.doc/q032520_.htm), then the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS
   will receive a notification from the queue manager when it fails
   over. When the notification is received, the WebSphere MQ
   classes for JMS will pause the application the next time it
   tries to communicate with the queue manager and periodically
   attempt to reconnect. When the multi-instance queue manager is
   available again, and the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS have
   reconnected, they will resume the application and allow it to
   continue processing.
   
   When an application using the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS sends
   a message to a JMS destination by calling one of the following
   methods:
   
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, int, int, int)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, int, int, int,
   CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, int, int, int)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, int, int, int,
   CompletionListener)
   
   the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS will:
   
   - Send an MQPUT request to the queue manager.
   - Wait for an MQPUT reply from the queue manager, indicating
   that the message was put successfully.
   
   If a multi-instance queue manager failed over during these
   operations, then the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS would abort
   the current MQPUT operation and reconnect to the queue manager.
   After reconnecting, the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS would
   perform the MQPUT call again, to send the message for a second
   time.
   
   If the application was using a non-transacted JMS session and
   the messages that were being sent were non-persistent,  then if
   the queue manager fail over occurred:
   
   - After the MQPUT request was sent to the queue manager
   - And before the MQPUT reply was received
   
   the message would be put to the destination twice. Once before
   the queue manager failed over, and for a second time after the
   WebSphere MQ classes for JMS had reconnected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS have been modified so that, if
   automatic client reconnection occurs while sending a message to
   a JMS destination using one of the methods shown below:
   
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, int, int, int)
   - MessageProducer.send(Destination, Message, int, int, int,
   CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, CompletionListener)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, int, int, int)
   - MessageProducer.send(Message, int, int, int,
   CompletionListener)
   
   the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS will reconnect to the
   multi-instance queue manager and:
   
   - Return from the method normally, if the MessageProducer was
   created from a non-transacted JMS session and was being used to
   put a non-persistent message to a destination.
   - Throw a JMSException containing reason code 2003
   (MQRC_BACKED_OUT) if the application was using a MessageProducer
   created from a transacted JMS session.
   - Throw a JMSException containing reason code 2549
   (MQRC_CALL_INTERRUPTED) in all other situations.
