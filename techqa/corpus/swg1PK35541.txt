   Console in WebSphere Application Server V6.1, the client has
   declared a Resource adapter at a node level and declared a
   connection factory for the same resource at the same node level.
   When the client is trying to install the application in the step
   "Map resource references to resources " if a customer clicks on
   the Browse button in "Target Resource JNDI Name " column they
   will not able to see any resource in the page
   "Enterprise Applications > Available resources".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Support has beem modified to deal with empty JNDI names.
