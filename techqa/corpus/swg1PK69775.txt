ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0.x incorrectly lists the -Xlp Java virtual machine
   (JVM) parameter for operating systems other than AIX. In
   addition, the Version 6.1 documentation lists the -XLP JVM
   parameter for the AIX operating system only. The parameter
   applies to the AIX and Windows operating systems with
   WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1.

   ****************************************************************
   The "Tuning Windows systems" topic within the Version 6.0.x
   Information Center incorrectly describes the -Xlp JVM
   parameter. This parameter is available for Windows operating
   systems with WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0.x, the following
   changes will be made:
   - The "Tuning Windows systems" topic within the Version 6.0.x
   Information Center will be updated so that it does not list
   the -Xlp JVM parameter.
   - This parameter will be removed from the "Tuning Linux
   Systems" topic.
   For WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1, the following
   change will be made:
   The -Xlp JVM parameter description in the "Tuning Java virtual
   machines" topic for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1
   will be updated so the description states that it applies to
   the AIX and Windows operating systems.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the September
   2008 update to the information centers.
