ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  **************************************************************
   DESCRIPTION PROBLEM:
    Agents' requests fail on the ITIM 4.5.1 LA0009 or/and IF13, IF
   15. (
   Note: The Agent requests condition must be a "add accounts to
   person
   with auto-provisioning", "changing their password with
   mutile-accounts",
   "Delete a person who has at least 4 accounts ".)
   
   Important key point:
   We verified this issue disappeared when changing MAX_THREADS and
   MIN_THREADS to 1
   enrole.messaging.workflowQueue.attributes
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 MAX_THREADS=10
   MIN_THREADS=5
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 MAX_THREADS=1
   MIN_THREADS=1
   enrole.messaging.workflowPendingQueue.attributes
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 WAIT_TIME=0
   OVERCAPACITY_WAIT_TIME=10 MAX_THREADS=5 MIN_THREADS=2
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 WAIT_TIME=0
   OVERCAPACITY_WAIT_TIME=10 MAX_THREADS=1 MIN_THREADS=1
   
   Env test:
   Irvine Env test:
   ITIM 4.5.1, 4.5.1 with LA0009, 4.51 with IF15 with one HP agent,
   3 Aix
   agents on different machines
   
   Customer's env:
   ITIM 4.5.1 with LA 009, IF 13 and If 15.
   6 AIX agents V4.5.3
   1 W2K agents V4.5.6
    CLIX/AIX agent V4.4.3
   
   CUSTOMER DUPLICATED :  Yes
   L2 DUPLICATED:         Yes
   
   Desired Behavior (Be Specific):  Agents' requests would not fail
   on the
   ITIM 4.5.1 LA0009 or IF13, IF 15.
   
   
   Env Requirement of this failure:
   1. At least 4 Agents on different machine.
   2. ITIM 4.5.1 LA0009, or/ and later IF 15
   3.  LA0009 patch with default setting: enRole.properties
   The following setting is a default enRole.properties after
   applying the
   LA0009
   enrole.messaging.workflowQueue.attributes
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 MAX_THREADS=10
   MIN_THREADS=5
   enrole.messaging.workflowPendingQueue.attributes
    =TRANSACTED=true RECEIVE_TIMEOUT=60 WAIT_TIME=0
   OVERCAPACITY_WAIT_TIME=10 MAX_THREADS=5 MIN_THREADS=2
   
   Steps To Duplicate (if any):
   1) Create 4 services.
   2) Create a static role
   3) Create auto-provisioning policy, then set the role and the
   four
      services above
   4) Create a person, who belongs to the role.
      This kicks the auto-provisioning to the four agents.
   5) Make sure that four accounts were created.
   6) Go to "Manage People", then select the person above.
   7) Select "Manage Passwords", then change password to the four
   accounts.
   8) Go to "View Completed Request", then check the result.
   9) Try to login using the account and password to check the
   change.
