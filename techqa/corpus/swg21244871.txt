QUESTION
 Is there a quick way to check the version of the ITCAM software? 

ANSWER
There are 2 files that determine the version of ITCAM for AD you have installed on your system. 

To check the software version on the MS, go to $MS_HOME/etc/am-version.properties. 

To check the software version on the DC, go to $DC_HOME/itcamdc/etc/version.properties. 

(Note: If you are installing a higher Fixpack level on the DC, then you must use the corresponding minimum level on the MS too. For example, if you are using FP5 on the DC, then you must have at least FP5 on the MS first.) 

However, in version 7.2 of the product, you can have a v7.2 DC talk to a v7.1 MS (with the latest fixpack) and vice-versa. 

You can also click on the "Help" tab in the MS GUI to determine the level installed.
