ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ for HP OpenVMS
   The monmq Show Process is throwing VMS error code
   SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO while fetching the MQ processes list.
   The sequence of events is:
   .
   monmq -> smgshr -> prompt operation -> move() ->
     access violation
   .
   And, if we use option "monmq show proc", monmq process will
   become into loop with violation:
   .
   error - LU: 480664 not opened
   %SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO, access violation, reason mask=00,
   virtual address=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, PC=FFFFFFFF842627C0
   .
   The command fails due to an issue with map global section.
