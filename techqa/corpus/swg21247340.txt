Title: IBM Summary Table not updated with client events. - United States

Text:
tsm archive backups missing data TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Client backups run as normal but the summary table is not being updated with the backup statistics, which also affects the daily report produced by Operational Reporter. 

CAUSE
Events are disabled for the specific client.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the QUERY EVENTRULE command to find out if events have been disabled for the specific node. For example : 

tsm: MYSERVER>q eventrule node=mynode

Date/Time Client Event Rules
-------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
<timestamp> DISABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODENAMES=MYNODE

or

tsm: MYSERVER>q eventrule node=mynode

Date/Time Client Event Rules
-------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
<timestamp> DISABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODENAMES=* 

 

In the first example, it shows that DISABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODE=MYNODE was issued and the second example shows that DISABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODE=* was issued. In either case, it caused the backup statistics to not be logged for the specified client. 

The ENABLE EVENTS command needs to be run to enable the events from the client to be forwarded to the TSM Server actlog which in turn will log a record into the summary tables. For example : 

ENABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODE=MYNODE 

or 

ENABLE EVENTS ACTLOG ALL NODE=* 


Note :
If the "clientsummarystatistics off" server option is used in the dsmserv.opt file, it will prevent clients from logging events to the summary table.
