QUESTION
 LFA : Corrupt events observed and some lines do not appear as events, why? 

CAUSE
Default BufEvtMaxSize of 4096 (4mb) may not be enough for high volumes.

ANSWER
The cache size needs to be able to cater for the flood of events at any one time, setting to a high value is safe as the space does not get used till needed, this was first spotted with a loss of events when the default size of 4Mb was filled in 20 seconds, It's not been seen to happen with an 8Mb setting though in theory it could. 

There is no advised size only that it needs to be large enough to cater for any envisaged event flood as each site and usage will be different.

It is important to use the latest versions of the Logfile Agent and EIF probe available at the time, 6.3.0 FP7 of the Logfile Agent and Version 13 of the EIF probe are known good levels for handling high event volumes at the time this was written
