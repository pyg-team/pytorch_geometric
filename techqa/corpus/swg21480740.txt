 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to upgrade my standalone installation of SPSS for Windows. During the installation wizard, when I select the existing SPSS installation directory and click Next, I receive an alert indicating that version will be uninstalled. The uninstallation commences but rolls back after a few seconds and reports the following error:

Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor.

When I click OK, the SPSS installation aborts. 

What is the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please uninstall the previous SPSS version via Add/Remove Programs prior to installing the new one.

While attempting to uninstall SPSS, you may receive a message to this effect: "Another application has exclusive access to the file c:\Program Files\SPSS\spssm.log." If that happens, you may have installed SPSS with a site license that mistakenly added the SPSS License Manager to your machine. Look for an SpssLM icon in your Control Panel. Double-click on it to open it and click the Stop button. Click OK. You should now be able to uninstall without any trouble
