APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When processing a lot of Lotus Domino email documents with a
   wrong codepage declaration, the IBM Content Collector Email
   Connector might stop processing with an insufficient memory
   error. The problem occurs if the codepage conversion fails and
   many documents are added to the Content Collector blacklist.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To prevent the problem, specify a codepage mapping table that
   maps all unsupported codepages to a supported codepage. See APAR
    HE11156 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HE11156] for detailed information:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HE11156 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HE11156]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a lot of Lotus Domino email documents (more than 2500) that
   cause a codepage conversion problem are processed and these
   documents are added to the IBM Content Collector blacklist
   without restarting the IBM Content Collector services, the
   Content Collector Email Connector might report an insufficient
   memory error and stop processing. No further email can be
   processed until the archiving services are restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0.3 LA001 and 3.0 Fix
   pack 4, the memory leak that caused the Email Connector to stop
   when too many documents with a codepage conversion problem were
   added to the blacklist has been fixed.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  IBM Content Collector V3.0.0.3 LA1
