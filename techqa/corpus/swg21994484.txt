Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in NTP and OpenSSL affect IBM Netezza Firmware Diagnostics Tools - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 NTP and OpenSSL is used by IBM Netezza Firmware Diagnostics Tools. OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on May 3, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. IBM Netezza Firmware Diagnostics Tools has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-8138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8138]
DESCRIPTION: NTP could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. By sending a specially crafted packet with an origin timestamp of zero, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the timestamp validation check.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110025 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110025] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
CVEID: CVE-2016-2108 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2108]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow when deserializing untrusted ASN.1 structures and later reserializes them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and trigger an out-of-bounds write and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 8.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112853] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
