Title: IBM IMShared folder versus SDPShared folder - United States

Text:
SDPShared; IMShared; SDP; IM TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
Why do you see an IMShared folder instead of SDPShared on some machines where IBM Rational products are installed?

ANSWER
If you installed the Installation Manager and Packaging Utility prior to installing any Software Delivery Platform (SDP) tool, then the Packaging Utility will default to a directory target for the shared content named IMShared. 

All subsequent installs of products that use Installation Manager will use the existing directory for shared resources.

This is stated in the Installation Manager Help center here:

Shared resources directory
The shared resources directory is the directory where installation artifacts are located that can be used by one or more package groups.

Important: You can only specify the shared resources directory the first time that you install a package. We suggest that you use your largest drive for this. You cannot change the directory location until you uninstall all packages.
