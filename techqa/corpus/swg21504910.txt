Title: IBM DOORS: Error when attempting to open a module "could not open include file (addins/synergy...)" - United States

Text:
could not open include file TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open a module results in an error when using IBM Rational DOORS" E- DXL: <Line:1> could not open include file (addins/synergy/utils/ecpsconfigutils.inc) (No such file or directory) 
-I- DXL: all done with 1 error and 0 warnings. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The easiest way is to go to the Rational DOORS database to conf/u1000001.dir/csint+AF8-<moduleid> and find the file that is called config.dat. 

Inside the file, find this line: 

csint_status=ON 

Change ON to OFF, save the file, then open the module and it should not force them to read-only mode anymore. It would be a good idea at this point to delete the csint attributes in the module. Also use the Rational DOORS trigger manager DXL (get from somebody in IBM support [https://www.ibm.com/contact]) to delete the module open trigger. 

 

You can get the unique ID of a module in DOORS by opening it in read-only and running the following DXL: 


Module m = current 

string moduleid = uniqueID(item(fullName m))
