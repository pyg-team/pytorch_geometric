APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the IBM Content Collector SMTP Receiver is configured for
   authenticated SMTP, senders of email that
   is to be routed through the SMTP Receiver should authenticate to
   the SMTP Receiver. With the default
   authentication settings, however, email that is to be delivered
   locally does not require authentication.
   This means, the SMTP Receiver writes email from users like
   test@localhost to the message queue without
   SMTP authentication, which might result in unsolicited email
   being archived.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update the SMTP Receiver configuration as follows:
   
   1. Open the file
   <ICCinstallDir>\james\james-2.3.2\apps\james\SAR-INF\config.xml,
   where <ICCinstallDir> is the installation directory of IBM
   Content Collector Server.
   The file is created the first time the IBM Content Collector
   SMTP Receiver service
   is started. If the file does not exist, you must start the
   service once.
   
   2. Search for the <servername> element and delete the value
   "localhost". The element should
   then look like this: <servername></servername>
   Thus, no mail domain is considered local.
   
   3. Save the file and restart the IBM Content Collector SMTP
   Receiver service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1 LA002, the
   configuration settings of
   the IBM Content Collector SMTP Receiver enforce SMTP
   authentication for all users.
