[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883865&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883865&aid=1]


CAUSE
The agent is unable to find an SSL transport library in agent path, and therefore the agent process fails to launch.


ENVIRONMENT

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Host_3z_k3zcma_<hex>-01.log in ITMHOME\TMAITM6_x64 shows following messages, indicating that SPIPE protocol is being used for connection with TEMS, and SSL interface module is unavailable:

...

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy kdebe.dll from C:\IBM\ITM\TMAITM6_x64 to C:\IBM\ITM\GSK8_x64\lib64. 

Start the agent. 

 

Note:The same problem can occur for the ITCAM MSSQL Server agent, and the same resolution applies in that case.
