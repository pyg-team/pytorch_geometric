ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   
   Customer adds a new user to the MS Active Directory and he set
   the user
   so that password must be changed at first login.
   Then he tries to access to the Windows Domain by TAMESSO but he
   gets the
   following error message (translated from italian to english):
   the password must be changed because expired
   please contact help desk
   
   The platform of domain controller is already windows 2003 with
   SP2.
   IMS server isn't running on the domain controller, it's a
   separate
   server.
   
   1. More detailed problem description
        - New user is created on ActiveDirectory
      - Password policy is "change password on next logon"
      - User login on PC that has TAMESSO Engina
      - A pop-up appears: "user has password expired on Windows,
   call
   Helpdesk" (italian message: La password di windows e' scaduta,
   contattare l'helpdesk.
   
   There is already APAR's open for the same issue:
   APAR IZ29709 & IZ34326 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ34326]
   
   LATEST UPDATE ON THESE FROM LINDA:
   working with Microsoft on how to resolve
   
   This is a workflow that is not supported by AccessAgent - the
   user is expected to change his password first before registering
   with AccessAgent. A feature request will have to be filed if
   this workflow is to be supported. Note that upgrading the domain
   controller to SP2 will NOT resolve this issue.
   
   A feature request has been opened and will be tracked in APAR
   IZ34326 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ34326] and that APAR will be closed as a duplicate
