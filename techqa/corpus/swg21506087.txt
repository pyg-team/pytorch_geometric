PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Seeing "invalid action site epoch in filldb.log 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 FillDB log similar to the following:
Tue, 04 Nov 2008 11:41:15 +0000 -- Discarding message from computer 1763327 because it has the invalid action site epoch '04 Nov 2008 11:35:18' (ought to be '12 Feb 2007 18:24:54'). 

The actionsite epoch is basically a time stamp from when the database is created that is used to synchronize your deployment with a particular instance of the database. If you recreated your database by installing a new instance using the same license, you may see these messages in the FillDB log. Recreating the database creates a new action site epoch.

The actionsite epoch is put into the ActionSite which the TEM Clients download every 24 hours or on demand when you take an action. Normally if you re-build the TEM Server it loses the registration list and which disables the on demand functionality and you have to wait 24 hours for the TEM Clients to gather the actionsite. They also gather the actionsite if the TEM Client is restarted.

Once the TEM Clients gather a version of the ActionSite with the new epoch, they will reset themselves and synchronize with the new database.

To resolve it, you should send out an action (any action) as master operator. This should cause the TEM Clients to gather the current actionsite and update their actionsite epoch.

Note: Because the TEM Clients will reset themselves, they will then send up full reports so this will cause increased load on the FillDB processing.
