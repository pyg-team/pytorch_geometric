PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides the various Web Query 2.x features and/options and how these features line up with the features available in Web Query 1.x 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document provides the various Web Query 2.x features and/options and how these features line up with the features available in Web Query 1.x 

With Web Query 2.x, IBM changed how to order the various Web Query features. 

Some options have been merged into a base version of the product, 
some have been merged into one option,
and some have remained the same.

Web Query 2.x refers to Web Query 2.1.0, Web Query 2.1.1, Web Query 2.2.0

Web Query 2.1.1 is a resave of Web Query 2.1.0 + Web Query Group PTF Level 11
- All subsequent Web Query Group PTFs "match" 
That is, 
Web Query 2.1.0 + Web Query Group PTF Level 12 is the same as 
Web Query 2.1.1 + Web Query Group PTF Level 1
etc.

Web Query 2.2.0 the latest Web Query version, released in April 2016

This document will explain how your existing Web Query 1.x options line up with Web Query 2.x.

1. The WebQuery 1.x and WebQuery 2.x options are as follows:

Web Query 1.x

5733QU2 *BASE DB2 Web Query
5733QU2 1 Active Reports
5733QU2 2 OLAP
5733QU2 3 Developer Workbench
5733QU2 4 Run Time User Enablement
5733QU2 5 Spreadsheet Client
5733QU2 6 Microsoft SQL Server Adapter
5733QU2 7 JD Edwards Adapter

5733QU3 *BASE Report Broker

Web Query 2.x

5733WQX 5 Web Query Developer Workbench Users
5733WQX 6 Web Query Runtime Enablement Groups
5733WQX 7 Web Query JD Edwards Adapter

2. How can one compare Web Query 1.x and Web Query 2.x? 

With Web Query 2.x, there are two paths to choose:

1. Express Edition 
Designed as an entry level edition

2. Standard Edition 
Full Web Query functionality

There is no 1-for-1 mapping between Web Query 1.x and Web Query 2.x, so how does one know what to order? 
You will need to choose how to convert additionally purchased QU2 users (either as Licensed Users or Runtime groups). (see Note 1)



Web Query 1.x Web Query 2.x, Express Edition Web Query 2.x, Standard Edition [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] 5733QU2 Option 1 - Active Reports Yes Yes 5733QU2 Option 2 - OLAP Yes Yes 5733QU2 Option 3 - Developer WorkBench Yes (see Note 2) 5733WQX Option 5 Yes (see Note 2) 5733WQX, Option 5 5733QU2 Option 5 - Spreadsheet Client Yes Yes [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010595&amp;aid=1] 5733QU2 Option 4 - Run Time User Enablement No Yes (see Note 1)
5733WQX Option 6 (5106) 5733QU2 Option 6 - Microsoft SQL Server Adapter No Yes 5733QU3 - Report Broker No Yes 5733QU4 - Software Developer Kit No Yes 
JD Edwards Adapter (Option 7) is still an optional feature. For Web Query 2.x, it is only available with Standard Edition. 


Notes: 
1. Customer will need to chose how to convert additionally purchased QU2 users 
a. Either as Licensed Users (5733WQX, Option 4) or RunTime Enablement Groups (5733WQX, Option 6). 
b. This must be decided at upgrade time. Please work with your Business Partner. 
- Licensed Users develop and maintain the Web Query reports and RunTime Enablement Groups run the Web Query reports. 

2. Express Edition does not come with any Developer WorkBench licenses; however, the licenses can purchased. 
Standard Edition comes with one Developer WorkBench license and more can be purchased. 

As before with Web Query 1.x, a separate Software Maintenance Agreement (SWMA) is required for Web Query support. 

Finally, officially there is no need to remove Web Query 1.x (5733QU2, 5733QU3, 5733QU4) while upgrading to Web Query 2.x (5733WQX) but you cannot run both at the same time.
