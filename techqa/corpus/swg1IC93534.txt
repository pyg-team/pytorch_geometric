   1. Add two extra steps, one after 1c and one after 2b, stating
   that the user also needs to backup and then restore the
   directory isc.ear
   TIP_installation_directory/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIP
   Cell/isc.ear
   i.e.  path c:\Program
   Files\IBM\tipv2\profiles\TIPProfile\installedApps\TIPCell\isc.ea
   r\
   
   2. In addition, in 1c, backup the following directory structure:
   TIP_installation_directory/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/
   i.e. path c:\Program
   Files\IBM\tipv2\profiles\TIPProfile\installedApps
   
   
   RECREATE STEPS:  Attempt restore procedure from OS to LDAP
   Authentication or LDAP to OS  Authentication change.
   
   Problem as described by customer:   Unable to log into TIP/TPC
   after Authentication change and restore attempt
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TBD
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected: TPC 5.1.x and 4.2.x
   
   Problem Description:  See ERROR DESCRIPTION.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Future Information Centers will be updated.  Entries for the
   current versions will be added to the Limitations and Known
   Issues technotes.
   
   You cannot log in to Tivoli Intergrated Portal and Tivoli
   Storage Productivity Center after you modify the authentication
   and try to restore Tivoli Storage Productivity Center.
   
   To resolve this situation, complete the following tasks:
   
       Before you change the user authentication configuration by
   adding or removing an LDAP repository in the federated
   repositories framework, back up the existing WebSphere
   Application Server configuration files.
       After you add an LDAP repository to the user authentication
   configuration and want to later change the LDAP authentication
   settings, back up the WebSphere configuration files.
       In the TIP_installation_directory, back up, and if
   necessary, restore the isc.ear file.
   
   
   On Windows operating systems:
   
   TIP_installation_directory\profiles\TIPProfile\installedApps\TIP
   Cell\isc.ear
   
   If you completed a default installation on the Windows operating
   system, the isc.ear directory is located here:
   
   C:\ProgramFiles\IBM\tipv2\profiles\TIPProfile\installedApps\TIPC
   ell\isc.ear\
   
   On AIX or Linux operating systems:
   
   TIP_installation_directory/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIP
   Cell/isc.ear
   
   If you completed a default installation on the AIX or Linux
   operating systems, the isc.ear directory is located here:
   
   C:/ProgramFiles/IBM/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPC
   ell/isc.ear
