Title: IBM Excel 2007 outputs do not adhere to user specified width and height sizes - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In a Report Studio report, the report's author has set the Size and Overflow property of various objects to customize their widths and heights. The desired column and row sizes and text wrapping are seen in HTML, PDF and Excel 2002 outputs but not when the report is exported to the Excel 2007 format. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
By design, Cognos 8 does not fully support user specified column widths in Excel 2007 format outputs.
Cognos 8's Excel 2007 rendering uses Excel 2007 XML (the new 'native' Excel format). This design typically merges rows to increase field height sizes as this provides high quality rendering.

By contrast, Cognos 8's Excel 2002 report output format renders to HTML (actually an extended HTML dialect that Microsoft defined for specifying spreadsheets). When Excel opens the HTML, it uses an internal algorithm to fit it into spreadsheet form.

Regarding Excel 2007 column widths, all table cell column width is determined by the size of the data content of the cell. If the cell data is text and its length is larger than the page size (PDF page size is the default here), then the column width is fixed to the page size, and the string is wrapped. As of 8.4.1, the RSVP.EXCEL.XLS2007_ALLOW_WRAPPING_SINGLE_CELL flag can be used to control text wrapping behavior. In Excel 2007 output, Cognos 8 will wrap long text string into multiple lines on the basis of a default page width. The default product behavior is to output the wrapped multiple lines text into multiple Excel worksheet rows. By setting the above attribute to true, Cognos 8 will provide a different behavior that outputs the multiple lines text into single Excel worksheet row. More information on this setting can be found in technote 1440556.
