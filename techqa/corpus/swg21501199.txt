RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Search for "ojdbc5.zip" in the resources.xml file located in 

<TWAHome>\eWAS\profiles\twaprofile\config\cells\DefaultNode\nodes\DefaultNode\servers\server1 

 

For TWS v8.6 

<TWAHome>\eWAS\profiles\TIPProfile\config\cells\DefaultNode\nodes\DefaultNode\servers\server1 

Change: 


<classpath>${ORACLE_JDBC_DRIVER_PATH}/ojdbc5.zip</classpath>
