Title: IBM RuleApp and Ruleset naming conventions - United States

Text:
character; convention; name; ruleapp; ruleset TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the naming conventions for RuleApps and Rulesets? 

CAUSE
RuleApp or Ruleset names can only contain letters, digits, or underscores. 
The names can only start with a letter or an underscore.


Those conventions are enforced in Rule Studio, the Rule Team Server and Rule Execution Server consoles. In Rule Studio, any forbidden characters will be kept for the 'Display name' but removed for the 'Name' of the RuleApp/Ruleset which is used to build ruleset paths.

You can also validate RuleApp and Ruleset names through the API with : 


 * until V6.7, the validateRuleAppName/validateRulesetName methods of ilog.rules.bres.model.IlrNameValidator. 
 * starting in V7, the ilog.rules.res.model.IlrPath.parsePath static method.


In both cases an IlrFormatException will be thrown if a name is not valid.
