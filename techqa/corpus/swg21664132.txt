PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Install of IBM Content Navigator (ICN) fails with an error like:
"The install was aborted for the following reason: The installer found the current version of IBM Content Navigator 2.0.2. Please uninstall and reinstall the application to fix the installation." 

SYMPTOM
An error message like the following is displayed to the user and logged in the installation log file:
"IBM Content Navigator is up to date. The installer found the current version of IBM Content Navigator 2.0.2. Please uninstall and reinstall the application to fix the installation." 

The error message may also mention that a previous version was found.


CAUSE
 ICN data is left over in the InstallAnywhere (IA) registry.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to clear the InstallAnywhere (IA) registry file of all ICN information and then re-attempt the install. 

The IA registry file is named .com.zerog.registry.xml and is located
- On Windows, in C:\Program Files (x86)\Zero G Registry all directory
- On Linux and UNIX, in 
- /var if the install was attempted under root user
- user's home directory if install was attempted by non-root user

To clear the registry of ICN entries, do the following
1. Backup the registry file
2. Open the file to edit it.
3. In the section <products> ... </products> , delete the subsection containing "IBM Content Navigator". 
4. In the section<components> ... </components>, delete all subsections or lines containing the substring "ECMClient" or reference to the ICN install directory. 
5. Delete the installation directory for ICN.

Re-attempt the install of ICN.
