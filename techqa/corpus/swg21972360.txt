When starting the Application Server service, it can start up in a bad state some of the time. When the Application Server starts in a bad state, then you may see an error such as the following in the iss-services.log: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The main noticeable effect this has is if you have an XGS or GX agent that is making requests through the Agent Manager, then the Agent Manager may fail while attempting to make the request with a HTTP 401 error. 
As a result, the XGS or GX agents may show an Unhealthy status while the Application Server is in a bad state. 

This update allows SiteProtector to properly update its startup information to the database, which allows the Agent Managers to connect to the Application Server.

When configuring SiteProtector to use an SSL configuration for the Application Server, it may be possible to experience a hang when the Application Server is starting and attempts to connect to the database. 

This update allows the SiteProtector Application Server to connect to the database when using an SSL configuration.
