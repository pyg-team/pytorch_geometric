Title: IBM Creating idle user timeout at system, group or user level - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I establish a SESSIONTIMEOUT based upon a user being idle? 

ANSWER
The SESSIONTIMEOUT variable specifies the amount of time a session can be idle before the system terminates it. You can either specify a number of minutes from 1 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 (zero) orunlimitedto disable timeout. A user idle timeout can be created at the system level, the group level, or the user level, as follows: 

System: 

system(admin)=> set system default sessiontimeout TO 300; 

Group: 

CREATE GROUPname
[ WITH
[ SYSIDgid]
[ ROWSETLIMITinteger]
[ SESSIONTIMEOUTinteger]
[ QUERYTIMEOUTinteger]
[ DEFPRIORITY [ CRITICAL | HIGH | NORMAL | LOW | NONE ] ]
[ MAXPRIORITY [ CRITICAL | HIGH | NORMAL | LOW | NONE ] ]
[ USER username [, ...] ] ] 

User: 

CREATE USERusername
WITH PASSWORD 'string'
[ SYSIDuid]
[ ROWSETLIMITinteger]
[ IN GROUP groupname [, ...] ]
[ VALID UNTIL 'date' ]
[ SESSIONTIMEOUTinteger]
[ QUERYTIMEOUTinteger]
[ DEFPRIORITY [ CRITICAL | HIGH | NORMAL | LOW | NONE ] ]
[ MAXPRIORITY [ CRITICAL | HIGH | NORMAL | LOW | NONE ] ]


For information on which setting takes precedence, refer to the "Session attribute order of precedence" document.
