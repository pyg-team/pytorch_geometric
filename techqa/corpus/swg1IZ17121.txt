ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows TMR/managed node
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 5.1.2 with fix packs
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Applications, Version 5.1.0 -
   mySAP.com Fix
   Pack 6, 5.1.0-SAP-FP06
   
   Problem Description: Installation of 5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA0004
   and
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA0006 hangs on Windows managed nodes if the
   output from "wdmlseng" exceeds approximately 5000 characters
   (approximately 120 lines).
   
   The trace_sap_510SAPIF04LCF_after.log and
   trace_sap_510SAPIF06LCF_after.log in $DBDIR/ABH/logs show the
   process stops prematurely.  The bottom of the log will look
   like this:
   
    :
   + + wdmlseng -e a <endpoint>
   + 2>& 1
   EngineStatus=
   Forwarding the request to the endpoint:
    :
   
   The following profiles are running:
   
    :                               (long list of profiles)
    :
   
   ++ grep -c AMW0051E          ---> hangs here
    (log end)
   
   
   May also occur when installing
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA0007
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA0008
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA00010
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA00011
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA00013
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA00015
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   If "wdmlseng" on a Windows managed node returns more than 120
   lines of output for one endpoint which has mySAPAppServer
   objects, install one of the listed ITMfApp 5.1.0:mySAP LAs
   listed above.

   etc.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround: Before installing the LA fix, stop the ITM engine on
   mySAPAppServer endpoints.
   
   When this problem is encountered, end the process and do the
   following:
   Stop the ITM engine on the endpoints and rerun install.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If installing an ITMfSAP LA fix on a Windows managed node and
   the output of wdmlseng is greater than 120 lines, the install
   hangs because the grep utility cannot handle that.  The method
   for determining which endpoints are running mySAP resource
   models has now been changed and will be included in any future
   fixes.
   This problem and the workaround has been documented in techote #
   1298042.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  If the installation hangs:
   end the installation process,
   stop the ITM engine on the endpoints,
   rerun install.
