   ****************************************************************
   It is possible for some z-centric end-to-end plug-in jobs
   to click on the hyperlink Workflow details from the DWC
   monitoring jobs view. In some cases if the user tries the
   available actions the following error messages are issued:
   "AWSUI0833E The operation could not be completed. There has
   been a communication failure."
   The internal message is: "AWSJZC125E Error streaming data
   from/to the broker server."
   The action cannot be executed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is caused by an incorrect processing of the buffer
   containing the jobCommand sent to the agent.
   The error has been corrected and now the actions can be
   performed successfully.
