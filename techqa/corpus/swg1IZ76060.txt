ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When ObjectServer is started by PA, if a user logs off from this
   host, the ObjectServer stops momentarily and gets started by the
   PA an instant later, however, as a result the remote users get
   disconnected from the ObjectServer and they need to log back on
   again.
   
   Steps:
   
   1. Register NCO Process Agent to Services
   2. Make sure OMNIbus Object Server process is NOT running as a
   Service
   3. Start PA as a Service
   4. Start ObjectServer via nco_pa_start.exe -process
   MasterObjectServer or via Admin GUI
   5. Connect to this ObjectServer from a remote machine and make
   sure it's connected
   6. Log off from the local Windows machine where the ObjectServer
   is running (make sure to log off properly. logging off from
   Remote Desktop will not affect)
   7. ObjectServer stops and gets restarted by PA as a different
   PID. Subsequently, the client is disconnected from the
   ObjectServer. You can log back on within 1-2 seconds.
   
   Note, when ObjectServer is running as a service on Windows, even
   if a user logged off from the host where the ObjectServer
   service is started, the remote users keep connected to the
   ObjectServer.

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  After investigating this behavior with Microsoft, we now think
   it should
   be fixed in OMNIbus.  However, the fix could involve a large
   design
   change that is not really suitable for a fix pack.  This APAR
   will be
   closed as a suggestion for a future release on OMNIbus where we
   would change the PA to interact with the Windows Service
   Controller so
   that we can install our components as services but view and
   manage them
   from the Administrator GUI.
   
   
   
   For a workaround, the ObjectServers, probes, and gateways
   should be
   installed as Windows services with dependencies between them.
   The
   OMNIbus commandline to install all services includes one to
   define
   dependencies:
   
        /INSTALL /DEPEND <srv1> /CMDLINE "<use cmdline args from
   the
   Command in the nco_pa.conf>"
   
   
   
   The PA would still be installed as a Service for running
   external
   automations, but it would not be configured to manage any
   processes:
        nco_pad /INSTALL ... /CMDLINE "-noconfig ..."
   
   
   
   If you have an ObjectServer, probe, and a PA all running on
   the same
   box, you'd set up the dependencies as follows:
   
        Process Agent <--- ObjectServer <--- Probe
   
   
   
   Windows supports dependencies among services that run in a
   distributed
   environment.  Service dependencies are stored in the registry
   and can be
   viewed on the "Dependencies" tab in the Service Controller
   GUI.
