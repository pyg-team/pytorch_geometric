APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Actually the Sun JVM version is 1.5(.0_17) and WAS is 6.1.0.13,
   but the heap functionality is not given by default.
   
   The VE comes up with the CYNVE0739E message ... feature not
   supported for Sun JDK. The property is also not set in the
   datacollector.properties file and needs to be added manually.
   
   This is a defect, we should NOT check for heap dump feasibility
   for Sun JDK on JDK 1.5 and above.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually enable the Heap Dump feature by editing the specific
   server datacollector.properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: ITCAM prevents Heap anlaysis on all
   WebSpehre versions on Solaris platform if
   "internal.doheapdump=true" property is not set in the
   datacollector.properties file.
   
   Problem Summary: By default, ITCAM Data collector prevents users
   on Solaris and HP platforms from creating Heap Analysis reports
   on Java 5.0, which uses JVMTI.  In prior JDKs (1.3.1 and 1.4.2),
   this feature is unstable and may cause the system to crash
   sometimes.  However, this feature is stable with JVMTI and ITCAM
   should not prevent the Heap Analysis feature by forcing the
   users to specify the "internal.doheapdump=true" property setting
   in the
   <DC_HOME>/runtime/<server>/<server>.datacollector.properties
   file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A check has been added for SUN non-JVMTI platforms only to
   require the "internal.doheapdump=true" property.  By setting
   this property the user becomes aware that the system can become
   potentially unstable when the Heap Analysis functionality is
   performed.  However, for systems running Java 5.0 and above,
   this check has been removed and the functionality is available
   by default.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   package:
