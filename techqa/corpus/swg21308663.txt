PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Due to the existing limitation in Windows 2003, WebSphere Application Server V6.1 does not support the use of drive letter numbers in Windows 2003 for mapped drives. This applies to any component running in WebSphere Application Server or WebSphere Process Server V6.1 on Windows 2003, but in case of the WebSphere Adapters it primarily affects the WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files. 

SYMPTOM
The information contained in this document has been moved to developerWorks Answers located here [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/208704/websphere-application-server-v61-does-not-support.html]. This technote will be archived in 60 days. Please bookmark the new location.

You will receive an error indicating that the drive is not accessible in the runtime logs while running the WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must use the full Universal Naming Convention (UNC). The location needs to be accessible to the operating system user name used by the adapter. For example: 

X:\sharefolder 

should be listed as \\computername\sharedfolder 

Note: This directory should also have complete access privileges for the user name of the operating system used by the adapter. If complete access is not provided to the mapped folder, it will result in similar error messages.
