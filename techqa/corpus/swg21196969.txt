PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When compiling printer definition files shipped with IBM Host On-Demand that contain Arabic or Hebrew markers, the resulting PDT does not appear in the Print Definition Table drop-down list in the printer properties on non-Hebrew or non-Arabic machines. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If any of the printer definition files that Host On-Demand provides in the hostondemand/HOD/pdfpdt directory are compiled and added to the INDEX.ndx, but do not appear in the printer properties Printer Definition Table, the reason might be a language marker in the printer definition file. For example, vtbidi_epson_ar.pdf contains a marker for Arabic which indicates you must run this printer definition on an Arabic machine. 
The following printer definition files were created for VT BiDi print only. These should not be used for 3270 Host print, or by non-BiDi VT users. They have language markers which indicate the compiled printer definition table needs to be used on a language-specific machine such as Arabic or Hebrew.

vtbidi_epson_ar.pdf 
vtbidi_hp_ar.pdf
vtbidi_hp_heb7.pdf
vtbidi_hp_heb8.pdf
vtbidi_ppds_ar.pdf 

When modifying a printer definition file shipped with Host On-Demand, review the printer documentation for macro definitions, session parameters, formatting controls, and character definitions.
