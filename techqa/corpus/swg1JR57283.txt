APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you run the BPMConfig -create or the BPMConfig -validate
   command with a configuration properties file that contains an
   Oracle LDAP URL like
   
   bpm.de.db.#.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@ldap://acme.com:389/BPM,cn=bpm
   db,dc=acme,dc=com
   
   you receive the following error:
   
   CWMCB0360E: The property bpm.de.db.#.databaseName=orcl does not
   match 'acme.com:389/BPM,cn=bpmdb,dc=acme,dc=com' from URL
   'jdbc:oracle:thin:@ldap://acme.com:389/BPM,cn=bpmdb,dc=acme,dc=c
   om'
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the default Oracle URL for the initial deployment
   environment configuration, and then manually change the URL
   property of all IBM BPM data sources to the value you want.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you use an Oracle database, the BPMConfig command extracts
   the database name from the bpm.de.db.#.url property and compares
    it with the bpm.de.db.#.databaseName property. However, the
   database name is not in an Oracle LDAP URL; as a result, this
   check fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.03
   that omits the database name validation when you specify an
   Oracle LDAP URL in the configuration properties file.
