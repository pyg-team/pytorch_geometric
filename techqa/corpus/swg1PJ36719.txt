   When the return button on the exception trace screen is pressed,
   the correct page is displayed.
   
   
   
   Another strange thing as I explained in my mails is that I
   noticed is
   when you check the build version of
   
   Records Manager, it says rec205.019. According to the
   compatibility
   matrix
   
   it must be rec205.020 after installing fixpack 4.0 - 002 and 4.0
   
   -002.001?
         I
   can defintely confirm that both fixpacks have been nstalled
   and the
   .ear
   
   files recreated for both Workplace and RM.
   
   
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)?
   :Always
   
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : no
   
   Is there a workaround? : no
   
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : System isn't
   working as designned
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N
   no
   
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   
   Not reproduced
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   1) Install and configure the Records Manager 40
   2) Configure Workplace for use with Records Manager
   3) Open Workplace and browse to a document that has been
   declared as a record
   4) Click on the information icon and scroll down to the bottom
   5) Click on the "information" icon beside "record information"
   6) A Record Manager login window appears -login in
   7) Page opens with an error
   
   If you click return the page displays the records manager
   information correctly
   
   
   
   Actual Results:
   
   Error seen
   
   Expected Results:
   
   Information on the Record to be displayed
   
   
   
          Are
   there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s N
   
   
        What
   logs were collected and where are they located?     all
   logs have been attached to DTS
