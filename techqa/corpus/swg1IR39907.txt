ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Automatic power on does not work correctly on terminals
   for Y2K leap year.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Automatic power on does not work correctly on terminals
   for Y2K leap year.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The check to determine if a year was a leap year didn't
   handle the year 2000 (which is also a leap year).  As a
   result, incorrect data was passed to the ADXSERVE call
   in sub POWER.OFF that sets up auto power on.  Changed
   the code to include a check for leap year 2000.
