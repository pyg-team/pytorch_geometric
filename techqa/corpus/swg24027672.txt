WebSphere Decision Server includes the following products to help organizations meet their decision-making objectives:

 * IBM WebSphere Business Events V7.0.1 to detect when events or patterns of events occur and to notify people or systems to take action.
 * IBM WebSphere ILOG JRules V7.1.1 to decide the business outcome through execution of business rules against available data.
