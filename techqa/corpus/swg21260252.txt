QUESTION
 How does WebSphereÂ® Data Interchange know whether to process incoming EDI data via a Data Transformation map or via Receive map? Currently, I am receiving EDI data and processing this real-time via a WDI Receive map. I am considering Data Transformation but don't know how WDI determines what type of translation to use for the incoming data. 

ANSWER
The type of processing WDI uses is determined by the command that is passed. That is, specify PERFORM TRANSFORM for Data Transformation or PERFORM DEENVELOPE for Receive translation or PERFORM TRANSLATE AND ENVELOPE for Send translation. WDI cannot switch between these translation modes under a single PERFORM statement execution. In other words, an entire input file must use the same type of mapping.
