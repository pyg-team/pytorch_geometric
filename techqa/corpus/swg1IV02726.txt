APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During an install if a component fails to unpack, the error
   message given states an error may have occurred but gives no
   detail. The customer must call IBM to determine how to recover
   from the error or if recovery is needed at all. We should
   provide steps for recovery and how to determine if the error is
   severe (unable to unpack a file) or just a warning (component
   already installed).
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     Unable to provide a detailed step-by-step recreation
   procedure. A corrupt install package is needed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When the error is seen, open File Explorer and navigate to
   ITM_HOME\InstallITM directory then open file MIAInstall.log.
   
   Navigate to the last lines of this file and review the error
   message. If a file failed to unpack, note the component name
   and after the install completes launch Windows "Add or Remove
   Programs" and uninstall that component.
   
   Try a reinstall of that component , if it fails again, order new
   media or copy the media locally and again uninstall and
   reinstall the failing component. If this continues to fail,
   download a fresh package and try again. If a fresh package
   fails, contact IBM for support.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a component fails to install due to corruption, package
   problem, etc.  the error message given states that an error may
   have occurred, please check .
   
   During an install if a component fails to unpack, the error
   message given states an error may have occurred please check.
   It does not give any information about how to determine whether
   the error was severe or just a warning.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been updated to scan the MIAInstall.log and report
   the last error found as MSG: under the please check message.
   The message can be used to help the customer decide how to
   recover.  If a failed extraction a new DVD image should be
   requested from IBM or downloaded as the current image has become
   corrupt or was corrupted during download or copy.  If the error
   states already installed, the error can be ignored.  The install
   will continue in either case and complete.  If an extraction
   failed the install should be rerun.  If it fails again, refresh
   the image and try again.  If it continues to fail contact IBM
   for support or download the image again from IBM and proceed
   based on the result of that install.  Sample popup message box:
       Install for Feature[KNTWICMA/Monitoring Agent for Windows
   OS] may have failed, please check!
       MSG:File extraction failed (Input/output error) for
   C:\IBM\ITM\TMAITM6\getstat.vbs
       Press YES if the MSG text appears to be a warning.  For
   example, "Already Installed."
       Press NO if the MSG text appears to be an error.  For
   example "extraction failed" or "Input/output error."
       NO also unselects the component so it can be reinstalled
   from a fresh image or DVD.
       Install will continue after YES or NO is pressed.
   Action by customer:
   If the error seems severe press NO and the component upgrade or
   install will be undone so the component can be reinstalled after
   the media problem has been corrected.  The successfully
   installed files cannot be removed so this may leave the
   component in partial state (pristine install) or mixed state
   (upgrade install).  If no is chosen and there is enough correct
   information to configure and start the agent, for a pristine
   install the agent will show version V610.  For an upgrade the
   previous version will show in MTEMS.  If NO is chosen the
   component should be reinstalled to insure that it will function
   correctly.  If the error is a warning or seems benign, press YES
   and accept the component even though there was an error.  If YES
   is selected and the component does not function properly, it
   will have to be uninstalled then reinstalled to correct the
   malfunction.  The error may occur with either an pristine or
   upgrade install.  If the error message is blank, it means that
   no error was found.  In this case press YES to continue the
   install and ignore the error.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  To check whether the error is a corrupt image or a warning open
   the MIAInstall.log in the HOME\InstallITM directory with notepad
   or other editor.  Navigate to the bottom of the file and search
   up for string [S] [Error].  The message found is the last error
   found during the install.  It will correspond to the please
   check message.  If no error is found, the message can be
   ignored.
   
   Note the name of the component that failed as it may need to be
   reinstalled.  If the component needs to be reinstalled, the
   component version file (ver file) will need to be removed
   (pristine install) or back leveled (upgrade install).  To remove
   the ver file, the name can be found in the message issued.  In
   the example above KNTWICMA is the first part of the name and
   .ver is the extension.  So for a pristine install delete file
   KNTWICMA.ver from the HOME\InstallITM\ver directory.  To back
   level the file, so the component can be upgraded, copy the
   KNTWICMA.VER file from the
   HOME\InstallITM\VerPrevInstall\YYYYMMDD HHSS directory where the
   date time stamp is the latest date and time to
   HOME\InstallITM\ver directory.  Try a reinstall of that
   component.  If it fails again, order new media or copy the media
   locally and again reinstall the failing component.  If this
   continues to fail, download a fresh image and try again.  If a
   fresh package fails, contact IBM for support.
