Text:
112553 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 For TWAIN and ISIS scanned pages, you can set up DotScan to undo rescanned pages to go back to a previous image. 

CONTENT


To enable the UndoableRescan feature, add the following line to the DotScan section of the Fixup for VScan.set.xml, the fixup.set.xml, or both files, based on where you want to enable this feature. 


<V n="UndoableRescan" label="Undo-able Rescan" tip="Specify whether rescanning is undo-able" type="checkbox">1</V>

If the UndoableRescan feature is enabled, when you rescan a page more than once, the previous images are not lost, including the original image. Rescan actions and the capability to undo the rescan actions persist when you put the batch on hold. All of the rescanned images are stored in the batch folder until the batch is submitted.

You can go back to an earlier image by pressing Ctrl+U. You can press Ctrl+U and Ctrl+Y multiple times to look at the images that you rescanned so that you can choose the image that you want. 


Important: The last image that you viewed on the page is the image that is saved when you submit the batch.
