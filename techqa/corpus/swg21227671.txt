QUESTION
 How does CICS Transaction Server for z/OS make use of the zSeries File System (zFS), and how can you access zFS files from your CICS programs? Does CICS care whether the z/OS UNIX® file system is zFS or the Hierarchical File System (HFS)? 

ANSWER
The components of CICS that exploit the z/OS zFS include:

Prior to CICS TS V3.1 

 * The Java™ JDK, the JCICS class library, CICS Java profiles and logs, and the storing of CICS programs written in Java 
 * The Java class libraries used by CICS programs written in Java and provided with DB2 and WebSphere MQ


Starting in CICS TS V3.1  * The Web Services related files - including the WSBIND, WSDL, PIPELINE config files 
 * The Web Services Assistant programs that are written in Java 
 * The CICS DOCUMENT templates that can be stored on zFS 
 * Storing static files returned in response to HTTP requests as specified in the URIMAP resource definition


Starting in CICS TS V4.1  * Bundlepart evbind for event bindings 
 * Bundlepart files for ATOM feed support


Starting in CICS TS V4.2  * Bundlepart epadapter for event adapters 
 * JVM server related OSGi framework files


Starting in CICS TS V5.1  * Bundlepart epadapterset for event adapter sets 
 * Bundlepart warbundle for web applications 
 * Bundleparts policy, library, program, transaction, urimap 
 * Application Bundles 
 * Platform Bundles 
 * JVM server releated Liberty profile files


CICS does not provide direct EXEC CICS commands to access or manipulate zFS files. Starting in CICS TS V3.1, the DOCUMENT templates are able to retrieve templates from an zFS file. This is great to read zFS files that you know in advance exist and have a DOCUMENT definition (for example, configuration files). However, it is not a general application programming interface (API) to navigate, create, or modify files on the zFS. 

The Java SDK provides a number of class libraries to work with zFS directories and files that are supported in CICS. For example, you could write a generalized set of Java programs to read, write, search, and so on. With the new CHANNEL and CONTAINER support, it is easy to shift large amounts of data between COBOL and Java. Note that modifications to zFS files will not be part of the CICS transaction. 

Another option to access the zFS is by using the z/OS POSIX interfaces for C/C++ which in theory could run in CICS providing your application is threadsafe and is configured as "OPENAPI" on the program definition. However, POSIX APIs have not been tested when used by a CICS program, and therefore are not supported by the CICS service team and are used at your own discretion. 

z/OS supports zFS as part of UNIX System Services, and as such the official documentation is in the z/OS information center, in the "UNIX System Services User's Guide". See section An introduction to the file system [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r13/topic/com.ibm.zos.r13.bpxa400/daf.htm]. 

There is also a good introduction to HFS and zFS in the Redbooks publication titled " z/OS Distributed File Service zSeries File System Implementation [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246580.html]". 

CICS is agnostic as to whether the z/OS UNIX file system is zFS or HFS. So, the answer in this document applies to both zFS and HFS.
