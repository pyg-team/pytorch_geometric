PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A P8 Administrator needs to be able to delete a set of document GUIDs from FileNet Content Engine using FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) or Administration Console for Content Engine (ACCE) when there is no commonality for the search resultset. 

SYMPTOM
A specific set of GUIDs need to be deleted and there is no common search criteria that can be used to retrieve these GUIDs using the search function in FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) or Administration Console for Content Engine (ACCE). 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Using FEM or ACCE perform a controlled test by using only a handful of GUIDs

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using the SQL View feature in either ACCE or FEM tool, the following CE query can be used:

SELECT [This], [Id] FROM [Document] WHERE ([Id] in ( 


)) OPTIONS(TIMELIMIT 180)

Once you have a list of bracketed GUIDs you can add them to the query, for example:

SELECT [This], [Id] FROM [Document] WHERE ([Id] in (
{141E5E98-2EE7-460E-AC69-0A3E8D389B7A}
,{63D396A9-55FE-4457-9C32-4F678EEDDD29}
,{7DCAF41D-E9F8-4F4E-A09A-BB30A604BBD3}
,{D9B75EBB-7137-42CF-88DD-7F255437EEE8}
,{ABB3B7F2-71FB-48F3-A7E3-96F7933C9ECB}
)) OPTIONS(TIMELIMIT 180)

and use the FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) action tab to delete the results. For example, review this illustration of deleting 5 GUIDs:

List of documents to be deleted

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882608&amp;aid=1]


Content Engine Query Builder query (note Actions tab for when you want to delete) 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882608&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882608&aid=2] 

Result-set coming back 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882608&amp;aid=3] 


Once you select this it will delete the result-set after re-running the same search.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882608&amp;aid=4] 

Note. Do not forget to set the comma's in-between each GUID in the query. 

Due to some inherent limitations with FEM it is suggested you do not delete or update more then 5000 items per iteration.
