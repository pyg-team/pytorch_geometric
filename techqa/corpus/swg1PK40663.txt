ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  (1) The error message screen shot is captured in the file
   NoVarsSet.gif file in the zip file.
   (2) This is from the customer's experiment after the
   installation fails they sent to us. We find some conflicting
   information in the details they provide.  I recommend you ignore
   these details for now, and debugging the problem yourself first.
    After reproduce the problem and get the same error message that
   the customer gets, you can diagnose based on that, and use these
   experimental results as references as needed.
   Here is the details on what each attached document about:
   'OSGi Bundle  Not Found Failure.xml'
   This file was  created when installing RFT into Aidan (our
   Eclipse
   distribution). The  Eclipse version in use contains Eclipse
   3.2.1 with
   the relevant patches required  by RFT. At runtime, using
   Help-?About-?Plug-in Details, is see the  correct version of the
   system.bundle (the org.eclipse.osgi bundle) is loaded and
   running
   (3.2.2.R32x_v20061101).  When running the installer for  RFT, I
   get the
   error saying that I have version
   org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.1.R32x_v20060919
   and need to update to the newer version
   (org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.2.R32x_v20061101).  Both versions of the
   bundle jar
   are on the file system, but at runtime, Eclipse is properly
   referencing
   the  newer one.
   'Bundle  renamed no env variables.xml'
   If I rename the  older org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.1.R32x_v20060919.jar
   file to
   org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.1.R32x_v20060919.jar-old and re-run the RFT
   installer, the the installer will complete without displaying
   any
   errors.  This file is  the log from that execution of the
   installer.  I
   could not see any errors  in the log, but maybe I don't know
   what I'm
   looking for.  When I open a  command console after the installer
   has run
   and run the 'set' command, I do not  see any RFT specific
   variable that
   have been set.
   
   'NoVarsSet.gif' and  '.log'
   When I start our  eclipse that supposedly has RFT installed into
   it, I see
   the option to switch to  the RFT perspectives under Window-?Open
   Perspective, but when I select Functional Tester, I get the
   error dialog
   from the NoVarsSet.gif screenshot.  The .log file provided is
   from the
   workspace, which is  essentially a new workspace.  I selected a
   new
   directory, restarted our  eclipse with the -clean flag to ensure
   a clean
   configuration. Then I verified the OSGi plug-in version, and
   closed the
   application and ran the RFT  installer.  When I looked at the
   log, it
   looked like there was a null  pointer due to an environment
   variable not
   being set.
   (3)yes, the customer is using GA IM and GA RFT.
   Let us know whether you need additional infomation or questions.
    Send me an email if you need a conference call  with me and
   Chris to speed up clarifying  things.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When installing into an existing eclipse with a launcher
   name different than 'eclipse.exe', the following problems
   are seen:
   a) The offering shortcut from Start menu is broken (affects
   all offerings)
   b) The auto launch of the offering post install does not
   happen (affects all offerings except RFT)
   c) When running RFT you get errors (affects only RFT)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available in  7.0.0.3 version of
   RAD/RSA/RSM/RSD. It will be available in the 7.0.1 version
   of RFT/RPT
   
   Installation Manager provides a variable for the launcher
   name that the offerings use in the install code.
