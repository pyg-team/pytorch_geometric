APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A previously set IBM Java Software Development Kit value (set
   with
   managesdk.sh -setNewProfileDefault) is ignored during creation
   of a secure proxy
   server at server level. The server-level results with Java SDK
   6 64bit regardless of what the Java SDK value was set earlier.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5 creating secureproxy on z/os    *
   *                  who used managesdk.sh                       *
   *                  -setNewProfileDefault                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Server level Java SDK does not          *
   *                      reflect the value used for              *
   *                      managesdk.sh -setNewProfileDefault      *
   *                      after profile creation.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Server level Java SDK does not reflect the value used for
   managesdk.sh -setNewProfileDefault after profile creation due
   to hardcoded value. The value is that of Java SDK 6 64bit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The hardcoded values have been removed so that managesdk.sh
   -setNewProfileDefault will result with the desired Java SDK
   being used for profile creation on node and server level.
