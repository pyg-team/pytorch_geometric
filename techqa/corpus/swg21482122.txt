Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am away from my home internet connection and am trying to license SPSS but am unable to do so. I am receiving error messages that include:

Error 21F
Error 52017

What is going on? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are using an internet connection at one of the following:

A place of business
An educational institution
A government facility

Your access to the internet is likely being controlled and limited by a firewall and it is this firewall that is preventing SPSS from licensing your product properly. 

The solution is to license your product via email:

Run the SPSS License Authorization Wizard. 
When prompted to select a method for licensing, select the method listed as 'via email'. 
Follow the instructions provided. This method does not require that you access the SPSS licensing authorization servers directly, thus avoiding the cause of the error.


The simplest solution is to license your product using your home internet connection. 

However, if you are using a desktop PC attached to an institutional network, you may wish to contact your technology support grou
