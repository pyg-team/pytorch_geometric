ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  From managed beta participant URS:
   
   I'm getting the error message:"No sitemap found"when attempting
   to access my
   Inbox, Calendar, or To Do views (Using Open menu).  I get the
   same results when
   attempting to open using Workspace icon.I tried removing the
   database icon from
   the workspace, refreshed/replaced the design of the mailfile,
   but the issue
   persisted.  The views did not load up.I finally deleted the
   cache.ndk and the
   issue resolved itself.

   Steve Castledine recommends taking a good look at the template
   for bad signs.
   He also suggests unsetting the Prohibit Design Refresh Flag on
   design elements
   in the template. Refreshing design should solve the issue. To
   try and get to
   the root cause see dev comments below. Need some bad template
   from customer:
