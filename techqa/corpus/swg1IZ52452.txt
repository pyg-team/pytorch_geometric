APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It was mention in out probes & TSM (Nokia) guide: Probe for
   Nokia NetAct 3GPP (CORBA) doc version 0.0.4297 for 3GPP v6 page
   5 which mention the below
   
   Nokia NetAct 3GPP v6
   For the 3GPP v6 version of Nokia NetAct, the Probe for Nokia
   NetAct 3GPP (CORBA) acts as an Integration Reference Point (IRP)
   Manager and connects to the Nokia NetAct OMCR GSR system using a
   CORBA interface. The AlarmIRPOperation and
   NotificationIRPOperation points form a part of the IRP agent to
   which the probe connects through a CORBA interface.
   The probe uses one of the following methods for this connection:
    Using Entry Point IRP
    Using Interoperable Object Reference (IOR) files
    Using the Naming Service
   
   --- Customer Reported ---
   
   Unable to find the following said method (which was stated in
   our probe guide) in the probe for
   omnibus-3.x-solaris2-probe-nco-p-nokia-netact-3gpp-v6
   
   1) Using Entry Point IRP
   2) Using IOR files
   3) Using Naming Service
   
   In the new probe customer couldn't find the properties for the
   IOR files. In the V4 probe, there are two properties:
   AlarmIrpFile and
   NotificationIrpFile, but there properties are not valid for V6
   anymore, so the question is how to set the IOR properties in V6
   probe?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  What the README says is correct for this probe (the probe for
   Nokia Netact 3GPP V6). I have pasted below the "Quick Start"
   section from this probe's README for your reference.
   
   Quick Start
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
           - Install patch dependencies
           - Install probe using $OMNIHOME/install/nco_patch
   -install <patch>
           - Set the 'NetActServerName' to the name of the NetAct
   Server
             Set 'AlarmIrpName' to the name used to resolve the
   Alarm IRP in the NamingService.
             Set 'NotificationIrpName' to the name used to resolve
   the Notification IRP in the NamingService.
           OR
             Set 'NamingServiceHost' to the name of the machine
   where the Naming Service is running.
             Set 'NamingServicePort' to the port on which the
   Naming Service is listening.
             Set 'AlarmIrpName' to the name used to resolve the
   Alarm IRP in the NamingService.
             Set 'NotificationIrpName' to the name used to resolve
   the Notification IRP in the NamingService.
           OR
             Set 'EntryPointIrpFile' to the full path of the file
   containing the
             IOR of the EntryPoint IRP object.
             Set 'AlarmIrpName' to the name used to resolve the
   Alarm IRP in the NamingService.
             Set 'NotificationIrpName' to the name used to resolve
   the Notification IRP in the NamingService.
           - For further configuration, run the probe with -help.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of the Probe for Nokia NetAct
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Page 5 of the guide lists three methods for connecting to Nokia
   NetAct version 6.
   
   However, the second method listed (Using Interoperable Object
   Reference (IOR) files) is missing from the guide (although the
   poperties themselves are describe in the Properties and command
   line options topic).
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   The guide will be updated with the next release of this probe.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following subsection will be added on page 6 after the topic
   entitled Using a naming service.
   
   Using IOR files
   If using IOR files, set the EntryPointIrpFile property to the
   full path of the file containing the IOR of the EntryPoint IRP
   object, set the AlarmIrpName property to the name used to
   resolve the Alarm IRP in the Naming Service, and set the
   NotificationIrpName property to the name used to resolve the
   Notification IRP in the Naming Service.
