APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  we try to write a Webapplication with Smarteam Visual
   Components. Our First goal is to write a program where the
   user is able to login to Smarteam, create a new Smarteam
   Document and do a checkin of the new created Object.
   In the Smarteam Documentation we found the
   Smarteam_Visual_Components_Customisation_Guide. With the help
   of that documenation we started to work and played around
   with the Visual Components.
   We also found the Enovia Smarteam Visual Components API with
   some starting Example.
   Nevertheless we couldn't get this simple program to work due
   to Exceptions (which we cannot interpret) and due to
   insufficient documentation.
   Do you have a more complex "Program" which you can provide
   us? This example should cover the above points (login,
   session management, showing a profile card, create a object
   and check it in). Is there any further
   documentation for Visual Components?
   Please find Attached our simple Program which throws an
   Exception at login (wrong username or password - but we
   haven't seen any loginpage where we could fill in the
   username or password).
   One more Question to that Exception: Do we need to Design the
   User Interface (e.g. Login Page) at our own or is the user
   interface created automatically because of the Login Class?
