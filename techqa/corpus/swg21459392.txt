QUESTION
 The factory settings of Impact means it does not collect events with a Class field value of 10500. 
Why and how to stop this?



ANSWER
The general assumption is that you do not want to attempt enriching the default Impact generated events from SelfMonitoring. But one can disable this part of the Filter by ticking the "Get status events" radio button: 

 * 
 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21459392&amp;aid=1]


This will enable you to capture these events and respond to them through an appropriate Policy. As such one should only employ this option if one is using SelfMonitoring and one wishes to capture the SelfMonitoring generated events for some form of additional processing.
