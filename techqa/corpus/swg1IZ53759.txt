APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The existing javadoc for the CatEntrySearchListDataBean
   contained contratictory information. In one place it indicated
   that case sensitive search on attribute values could be
   performed by setting AttributeValueCaseSensitive parameter to
   'yes' (case sensitve search) or 'null' (case insensitive
   search). In another place (in the same javadoc) it says that
   case sensitive search on attribute values could be performed by
   setting AttributeValueCaseSensitive parameter to 'true' (case
   sensitve search) or 'false' (case insensitive search). In the
   existing code, though value of 'true' will result in a case
   sensitive search, the value of 'false' will not result in a case
   insensitive search.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   WebSphere Commerce users on v6.0 who specify a
   case-sensitive/insensitive attribute search.
   
   PROBLEM ABSTRACT:
   Update the CatEntrySearchListDataBean so that case sensitive
   searches on attribute values using the
   AttributeValueCaseSensitive parameter will work.
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT:
   Customer were not able to correctly specify whether the
   attribute search was case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
   
   RECOMMENDATION:
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CatEntrySearchListDataBean code and javadoc have now been
   updated to remove inconsistencies such that when
   AttributeValueCaseSensitive is set to "yes" it results in case
   sensitive search and when AttributeValueCaseSensitive is set to
   "no" it results in case insensitive search.
   
   Applying this APAR will ensure that the
   AttributeValueCaseSensitive specification works as expected.
