PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to trim the db2diag log file when it gets very large. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

If you have a lot of defined databases and applications, there can be a lot of database activity and this may lead to a large DB2 diagnostics log file. This in turn causes performance issues with the 'octigate' database. 

If you want to trim the large DB2 Diagnostics log and reset it to start afresh, do this command: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404017&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21404017&aid=1] 

This will reset the DB2 Diagnostics log and start afresh again. You can put this in a regular crontab with a 24-hour reset cycle or choose your own custom reset time period to trim the DB2 diagnostics log size.
