Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A BIP2241E: error may be logged when there are two or more copies of WMB/IIB on the same machine each attempting to use the appropriate version of WTX or ITX. 

SYMPTOM
BIP2241E: A Loadable Implementation Library (.lil, .jar, or .par) is not found for message flow node type 'DTXPlugInNode' error message in logs.


CAUSE
The mqsiprofile script will go to the ${MQSI_WORKPATH}/common/profiles directory to search for external scripts to execute, and will be confused if there are 2 or more WTX/ITX based scripts.

ENVIRONMENT
WMB/IIB integrated with WTX/ITX on the same Unix/Linux server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
BIP2241E: A Loadable Implementation Library (.lil, .jar, or .par) is not found for message flow node type 'DTXPlugInNode' error message in logs.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that only one WTX/ITX based script is in the ${MQSI_WORKPATH}/common/profiles directory when executing mqsiprofile.
