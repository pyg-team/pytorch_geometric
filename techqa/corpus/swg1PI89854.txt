APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Migrated to CICS TS 5.4 and started receiving.
   .
   DFHSO0123 Return code 406 received from function
   gsk_secure_socket_init  of System SSL. Reason: An I/O
   error occurred.
   .
   DFHWB0732 CWXN CICS Web attach processing encountered a sockets
   I/O error while receiving a client request.
   .
   The problem has been introduced by work done during 5.4
   development to make the CICS sockets domain 64-bit.  The CICS
   SSL socket receive callback routine got changed and now will
   return -1 for all exception cases.  Importantly this includes
   when a connection is closed.  CICS should be returning 0 in
   that case (as it has done on all previous releases) instead of
   -1.  We need to correct the connection closed behaviour for SSL
   connections.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Messages DFHSO0123 return code 406 and  *
   *                      DFHWB0732 were given, when client       *
   *                      immediately closes the SSL connection   *
   *                      without sending any data.               *
   ****************************************************************
   A TCPIPSERVICE is installed that specifies SSL(YES). DFHSOCK
   makes a call to receive SSL data. This returns
   sock_receive_buffer_n equal to 0 and sock_response equal to
   sock_exception because the client had immediately closed the SSL
   connection without sending any data.
   
   DFHSOSE handles the return to System SSL and sets the return
   value to -1. This causes System SSL to return GSK_ERR_IO (406),
   which CICS reports with a DFHSO0123 message.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DHFSOCK and DFHSOSE have been changed to correctly return
   the number of bytes received, 0 to indicate connection closed or
   -1 for an error.
