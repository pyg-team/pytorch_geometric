Mixing Authorized and Floating Licenses TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What will be the outcome when Floating and Authorized user type of licenses are generated on one server using the same machine name and host details on Rational License Key Center? 

CAUSE
The former Telelogic licensing has since transitioned to Intraware (Rational License Key Center)

ANSWER
The outcome will be a "NODELOCKED" license file and not a FLOATING. 

Always generate only Floating licenses for a server. Do not mix AUTHORIZED USER along with FLOATING licenses on new/existing server while generating from Rational License Key Center. You will be able to use only 1 user of each product generated, the rest of the quantity will stand invalid and can not be used. 

For example: If you mix 10 Rational Doors floating licenses and 1 Rational System Architect Authorized license, the license file generated will be valid for only 1 Rational Doors and 1 Rational System Architect license which will be authorized in nature.In the license file you will see "NODELOCKED" which means 1 AUTHORIZED USER file. 

By default the floating functionality of the 10 doors floating will be lost.
