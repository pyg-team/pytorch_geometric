APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running many many COBOL compiles which use the SQL option, user
   received CSV002I MSGCSV002I for IEANTRT.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Split up the number of compiles into a smaller batch.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of DB2 10 and DB2 11 for z/OS who  *
   *                 use the DB2 coprocessor                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Thousands of calls to the DB2           *
   *                      coprocessor from a single job           *
   *                      may cause the use count of requests     *
   *                      for module IEANTRT to exceed the        *
   *                      maximum limit                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Thousands of calls to the DB2 coprocessor from a single job
   can cause the use count of requests for module IEANTRT to
   exceed the maximum limit.  A message similar to the following
   may be issued, and processing will halt:
   
     CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE IEANTRT EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code is updated to better manage the usage of IEANTRT and
   other MVS name/token service routines.
