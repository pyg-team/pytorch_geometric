APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DEPLOY FAILURE MAY CAUSE MULTI-INSTANCE BROKER TO HANG
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Deployment failures may cause a multi-instance broker to hang.
   This would require the deletion and recreation of the broker.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker who use multi-instance
   Brokers.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A WebSphere Message Broker user who is using multi-instance
   Brokers may experience problems during execution.
   If the multi-instance Queue Manager stops then the Broker's
   execution groups are not shutdown and the multi-instance Broker
   may hang and need to be deleted and re-created if an error
   occurs during the deploy of a message flow.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the
   execution groups are shutdown when a multi-instance Queue
   Manager is stopped.
   WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that errors
   occurring during a message flow deploy are correctly handled
   and will not lead to a multi-instance broker needing to be
   deleted and re-created.
