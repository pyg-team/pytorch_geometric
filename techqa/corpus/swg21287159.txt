 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
In Notes 8.0.x, certain messages in MIME format print poorly. For example, when the message is printed, or when you look in print preview, you notice one or more of the following issues: 

 * the message will not have the correct header 
 * the logo icon is missing from the upper left corner of the message 
 * some header information is missing 
 * the whole message looks like plain text, not rich text or HTML 
 * there is a large gap between the header and body of the message

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This issue is fixed in 8.0.2.

Workaround #1
Disable the embedded browser, print the message,and then re-enable the embedded browser. (Go to File - Preferences - Basic Notes Configuration - Additional Options and select (check) "Disable embedded browser for MIME email").

Workaround #2
Print the document from the right-click menu in a view or folder such as the Inbox. This uses the Notes browser to render the document.
