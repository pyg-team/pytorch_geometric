Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
IBM BladeCenter Advanced Management Module (AMM) has addressed the following vulnerabilities in GNU C Library.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2018-6551 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6551]
DESCRIPTION: GNU glibc could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an integer overflow in the malloc implementation. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138610 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138610] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2018-6485 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6485]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the implementation of the posix_memalign in memalign functions. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138627 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138627] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2018-1000001 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000001]
DESCRIPTION: Glibc could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a buffer underflow in the __realpath() function in stdlib/canonicalize.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system and obtain privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 8.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137516 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/137516] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: CVE-2017-8804 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8804]
DESCRIPTION: glibc is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by improper handling of buffer deserialization in the xdr_bytes and xdr_string functions. By sending a specially-crafted UDP packet, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause virtual memory allocation, or memory consumption on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125760 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125760] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

CVEID: CVE-2017-12132 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12132]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by a flaw in the DNS stub resolver. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform off-path DNS spoofing attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129949 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/129949] for the current score
