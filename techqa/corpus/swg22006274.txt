Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Setting the Session Time Out for Atlas Policysuite application 

CAUSE
Atlas application require session time-out set

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Session time-out can be set in the following places: 

A. Set Session time-out from the WebSphere Administrative Console
B. Set Session time-out from Atlas application(Atlas-specific session time-out mechanism) 

A. Set Session time-out from the WebSphere Administrative Console :

- Login to WebSphere application server Administrative console by using Admin user
- In console, in left panel menu, navigate to Applications -> Application Types -> WebSphere Enterprise Applications -> PolicyAtlas
- Click on Session Management, in the session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. 
- Note: If the session time-out is disabled then you need to select 'Override Session Management' option


B. Set Session time-out from Atlas application(Atlas-specific session time-out mechanism):

- Session time-out in Atlas can be configured through web.xml under web.war.
- Expand the PolicyAtlas.ear, update the value within the web.xml file and re-deploy.
- The entry in the web.xml file will be as follows:

<session-config>

<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>

</session-config>

- Note : Where the "session-timeout" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes (Here 60 refers to 60 minutes).

- This setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the WebSphere Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file.
