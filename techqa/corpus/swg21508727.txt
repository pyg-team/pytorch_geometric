Title: IBM WebSEAL does not enforce inactive-timeout - United States

Text:
failover fail-over timeout time-out timeouts not working not enforced TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to setup inactive timeout, WebSEAL does not seem to be enforcing the time-out. What is the solution? 

CAUSE
Check the WebSEAL configuration file, if failover authentication is enabled and the failover cookie is being used, WebSEAL will not enforce the inactive-timeout setting. 

Here are the settings that are responsible for the behavior reported: 

[failover] 
#---------------------- 
# FAILOVER 
#---------------------- 

# Accept failover cookies 
# One of <http, https, both, none> 
failover-auth = both 


# Number of minutes that failover cookie contents are valid 
failover-cookie-lifetime = 60 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To enforce the inactive-timeout with failover authentication enabled, please set reauth-for-inactive=yes. 

 

[reauthentication] 
#---------------------- 
# REAUTHENTICATION 
#---------------------- 

# Prompt users to reauthenticate if their entry in the WebSEAL 
# credential cache has timed out due to inactivity 
# 
# If set to 'no', entries in the cache will be deleted when the 
# inactivity timeout is reached. 
# 
# If set to 'yes', entries in the cache will be retained until the 
# cache lifetime timeout is reached. If the inactivity timeout has 
# been reached and the client makes another request before the cache 
# lifetime timeout is reached, they will be prompted to reauthenticate. 
reauth-for-inactive = yes
