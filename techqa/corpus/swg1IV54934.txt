APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Maximum Log Size of a Windows Event Log is configured
   to a value equal or greater than 4GB, both Maximum Size and
   Maximum Size (Superseded) attributes in the Monitored Logs
   Report attribute group  are reported incorrectly. The 64 bit
   attribute (Maximum Size) is expected to report it correctly,
   but it does not.
   
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   
    This issue affects all Windows OS agent versions since 6.21 and
    all supported Windows operating system versions.
   
   Diagnostics:
    set KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:KNT ALL) (UNIT:KRA ALL) (UNIT:KNL ALL)
   
   Example:
    TBD
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low, single attribute incorrect

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Incorrect Maximum Size attribute in Monitored Logs Report
   attribute group.
   
   
   When the Maximum log size property of a Windows Event Log is
   configured to a value equal to or greater than 4GB the Windows
   OS Agent reports incorrect Maximum Size and Maximum Size
   (Superseded) attributes in the Monitored Logs Report attribute
   group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Internal interface changed to support 64-bit variables and fixed
    the value of Maximum Size attribute.  Maximum Size (Superseded)
    now reports Value Exceeds Maximum.
