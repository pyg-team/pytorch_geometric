APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An external Transaction Manager software product is managing
   global transactions including an IBM MQ queue manager via the XA
   protocols. The connection between the TM and MQ is via a TCP/IP
   client connection.
   
   There is a failure of the TM software or of the TCP/IP network
   connection. Before this, the MQ HConn using that connection has
   been associated with a transaction (via xa_start) and suspended
   (via xa_end with the TMSUSPEND flag). The HConn has been used to
   get or put a message within that transaction.
   
   After the failure of the TM software or the TCP/IP connection,
   the affected puts and gets remain not-committed and
   not-rolled-back until the queue manager ends. The messages
   cannot be retrieved without restarting the queue manager.
   
   But they should have been rolled-back and released automatically
   by the queue manager while processing the connection-close
   event.
   
   The affected transactions will appear (among all others for the
   queue manager) in the output of the MQ command dspmqtrn, when
   using the -a switch.
   
   FDC records with the following pattern can also appear. In this
   case they should not have been written.
   Probe Id :- AT040010
   Component :- atxClose
   Major Errorcode :- arcE_XAER_PROTO
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the queue manager to release the transactions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Systems incorporating an external Transaction Manager software
   product commanding the IBM MQ queue manager via the XA
   protocols, where the connection between the TM and MQ is via a
   TCP/IP client connection. To be at risk, the TM must be using
   the xa_end(TMSUSPEND) function. IBM MQ cannot advise in which
   scenarios an external software product will use this feature of
   the XA protocols.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   After the failure of the TM software or the TCP/IP connection,
   the SVRCONN channel program should have commanded the queue
   manager to rollback all suspended-associated work.
   
   Due to this, the error was reported when the SVRCONN channel
   program made a subsequent internal xa_close call to the queue
   manager. The queue manager found there was suspended-associated
   work, and so rejected this internal xa_close call, and the
   AT040010/atxClose/arcE_XAER_PROTO FDC is written.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After the failure of the TM software or the TCP/IP connection,
   the SVRCONN channel program now commands the queue manager to
   rollback all suspended-associated work, as it should do.
   
   The AT040010/atxClose/arcE_XAER_PROTO FDC is no longer written
   in this case.
   
   FDCs with that pattern can still validly be written by the queue
   manager in other cases, for example if the external TM makes an
   incorrect call to xa_close.
