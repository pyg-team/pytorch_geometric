   The command for creae the DBs are wrong
   "
   Create the CMNDB (CommonDB) and BPEDB (Business Process
   Choreographer), BPMDB (Process Server) and PDWDB (Performance
   Data Warehouse) databases. The following example command is
   used to create a database for Microsoft SQL Server:
   
   osql -b -d database_name -S hostname -U db_user_account -P
   db_user_password
   -Q "CREATE DATABASE database_name COLLATE
   SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"
   "
   the -d option is to connect to a exsisting database, how are we
   supposed to connect to the database when it has not yet been
   created.  The command above is trying to connect to and create
   a database at the same time in the same command.  Of course
   this is going to fail , you cant connect to a DB before
   creating it!
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use
   osql -b  -S hostname -U db_user_account -P db_user_password
   -Q "CREATE DATABASE database_name COLLATE
   SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"
   
   Or better yet
   osql -b  -S hostname -U db_user_account -P db_user_password
   -i full_path_to_input_file.sql
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The command for creating the DBs is wrong in InfoCenter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Closing APAR, RTC work items created for tracking.
