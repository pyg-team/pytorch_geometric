APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running EJBDeploy, the temp working directory created does
   not get cleaned out in AST/RAD 6.0 onwards.
   
   This has been identfied as a BUG and might be related to the
   following method ie AddShutdownhook
   
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html# [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#]
   addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Clean the directory manually. But in a multiproject/multi member
   teams this can cause confusion and needs to be addressed within
   the EJBDeploy call.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the command-line EJB Deploy     *
   *                 code generation tool in IBM WebSphere        *
   *                 Application Server V6.0 and V6.1             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If the -keep command-line flag is not   *
   *                      specified then the EJB Deployment       *
   *                      working directory is not deleted.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If the -keep command-line flag is specified for EJBDeploy then
   it will not delete the working directory upon completion of
   the code generation.  However, if -keep is not specified then
   it is suppose to delete the working directory but this does
   not occur as certain files are still locked by the JVM when
   the deletion occurs, preventing the working directory from
   being completely cleaned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If -keep is not specified then the ejbdeploy scripts
   (ejbdeploy.bat on Windows and ejbdeploy.sh on UNIX platforms)
   will now be responsible for deleting the working directory
   after the ejbdeploy JVM is terminated.  The fix for this APAR
   is currently scheduled for inclusion in the WebSphere
   Application Server v6.0.2.29 and v6.1.0.19 fix packs.  Please
