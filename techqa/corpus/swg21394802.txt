CAUSE
Database table PAGE_CUSTOMIZE table is missing.


ENVIRONMENT
DB2, Oracle



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Have customer logon to database with schema owner AMUSER - db2 connect to octigate. Issue command: DB2 list tables. You will not see the table PAGE_CUSTOMIZE 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error is related to the table PAGE_CUSTOMIZE missing which most likely occurred because 

updateDB was set to false when Fix Pack 4 or later was installed. 

The update DB sql script for different code levels can be found in 
MS_HOME/update/updateDb. Please run the sql script that is appropriate for your situation. 
For example, if you are using Oracle for the MS database and have Fix Pack 4 installed, 
run the sql script oracleSQL_6.1.0.4 which has the fix for the error seen.
