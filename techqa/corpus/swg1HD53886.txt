ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEMS WITH ACTIONS CREATED VIA LCA
   NAVIGATOR
   .
   ABSTRACT: Problems with Actions created via LCA
   Navigator.....
   Environment:
   Client OS and level: Win2K
   Server OS and level: AIX 5.3.0
   Database and level: DB2 8.2
   Scenario:
   I created the following objects: CO - Action -
   Affected Object
   If I release the CO and then create a new version,
   the system only asks me for copying the
   Attachments. It is not possible to copy the Affected
   Objects.
   In the LCA Navigator Documentation for Copy CO:
   'Each time you create a new version, change order
   presents a copy selector window that enables you
   to select which sub-objects to copy from the
   previous version to the new version.
   .
   Only the sub-objects that can be updated by the
   new version are available in the copy selector
   window. e.g. change teams, attachments, and
   related COs.
   Each new version also provides the capability to
   view the data (from previous versions without
   forcing you to copy these each time) e.g. action
   items, affected objects, and attachments. The
   change order must be in a released state before
   you can create a new version'.
   In addition I am not able to 'view the data from
   previous versions' as stated in the documentation
   above.
   Can you please tell me exactly, what is the
   expected functionality.
   .
   Please find attached the exact documentation of
   the LCA Navigator, which also includes the
   scenario, where are working with. The scenario,
   how to create an CO with an action including an
   affected item should be common knowledge and
   we are not describing this scenatio here from
   scratch.
   .
   Please find attached the scenario based on
   standard functionality of ENOVIA LCA Navigator.
   There are no specific error messages, which occur.
   Please refer to the PMR for the error description.
