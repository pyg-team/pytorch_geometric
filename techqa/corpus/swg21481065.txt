PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to run a SPLIT FILE on a string variable in SPSS 13.0.x and am receiving an error message either:

The selection variable exceeds the maximum for the target list

or

Error # 4757 in column 256. Text: (End of Command)
No more than 8 split file variables may be used by the SPLIT FILE command.
Note that long string variables account for multiple split file variables.
This command not executed.

What is going on and how may I run my SPLIT FILE? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error is caused by running a SPLIT FILE command on a string variable exceeding a width of 64 characters. You will either need to decrease the width of the variable or use the Automatic Recode (Transform->Automatic Recode) option to recode it into a numeric variable. You may then run the SPLIT FILE on the numeric variable
