LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of applets and web start applications that use CICS
   TG APIs.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The default security configuration for Java 7 running in a
   browser will change significantly in the January 2014 CPU
   (Oracle 7u51, IBM 7 SR6-FP1).
   The two two main changes to the default security settings are:
   1. All applets and web start applications must be signed with a
   certificate from a trusted authority (self-signed certificates
   will not be accepted).
   2. The &quot;Permissions&quot; attribute in the JAR Manifest
   must be set.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS TG has been changed. ctgclient.jar is signed and the
   &quot;Permissions&quot; attribute in the JAR Manifest is
   set.<br/><br/>
