QUESTION
 How do I use network tracing to troubleshoot FileNet P8 and Image Services (IS) issues? 

CAUSE
Network traces provide insight into the low level system processing (e.g., TCP/IP processing), as well as details of RPC calls and the responses delivered to those calls. Network traces captured in conjunction with other tool data, depending on the circumstances, may help identify or eliminate possible sources of a problem.

ANSWER
There are a variety of tools available to collect network traces. A sniffer may be attached to the network to collect the data required without impacting system performance, or alternatively, some platforms provide tools that generate the same type of output:


 *  AIX OS: iptrace 
 *  SUN OS: snoop 
 *  Windows: Network Monitor


There is also freeware from Wireshark (“Ethereal“) that can be used to capture traces. Such tools, however, may impact performance when large of amounts of data are being collected on busy systems. 

Network traces should be collected simultaneously from both the client and server. Filters should be configured to collect the most appropriate traffic, which would be defined by the specific circumstances. In general: 
 * Two sets of traces should be collected:

 * i.
 * 
 * 
 *  ii
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The purpose of collecting two types of traces is to:

 *  i.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  ii.
 * 

 * Be sure to verify that:

 *  i.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  ii.
 * 


Data to collect: The captured network traces, a description of the circumstances surrounding the traces, the timing of the data collected, and when/if an issue occurred. Also provide any current error and/or Application and System event logs. 

For more information: Refer to the specific tool documentation for details.
