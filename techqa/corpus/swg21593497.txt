WASV85RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Servlets annotated with @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy injection methods might be put into service, and those methods might be injected and called, even when those methods are not strictly well formed. 

SYMPTOM
In the following scenarios, the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy methods are used and the servlets are put into service, instead of returning a 404 error to the client:

1. @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy method must not declare to throw exceptions;
2. @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy method must not be static;
3. One object must not have two @PostConstruct or two @PreDestroy injections;
4. @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy must not be declared with passed in parameters;
5. @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy must not be declared final.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been fixed in 8.5.5 releases. You can either use the latest 8.5.5 releases, or change the servlets to strictly obey the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy method annotation rules in 8.5.0.x releases.
