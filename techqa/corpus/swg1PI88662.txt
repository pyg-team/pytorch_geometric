APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  when I create an active class(A) that has a composition
   relationship with another active class(B) I will often
   experience segmentation faults when I try to destroy class A.
   This often happens in unit testing when I frequently setup and
   teardown the class under test.  When I run valgrind on the
   component, I also see numerous memory issues from these linux
   configurations.
   
   I understand there are some timing issues with starting /
   stopping threads  what I d like to know is how to resolve these
   options without having to resort to arbitrary delays?
   Even when I don t see segmentation faults, I m seeing memory
   errors when run under valgrind.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The possible solution is to override this function in the model
   and add OXFTDelay(0) call, which doesn't delay anything but
   switches context to other ready threads.
   
   According to the user, using OXFTDelay with an argument > 0 does
   resolve the segfaults, but a value of 0 does not.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Active thread should take control to end dispatching of      *
   * events. It is not done for inner active part of active       *
   * composite object. As a result, queue semaphore stays locked  *
   * in Linux and causes crash.                                   *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Switching context added to OMThread::endDispatching function if
   it is called from different thread.
