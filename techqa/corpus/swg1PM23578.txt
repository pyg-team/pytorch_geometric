APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A 500 error occurs because the If-None-Match request header
   value is not being sent with double quotes by the client browser
   as per the RFC 2616 specification.
   
   A caching Proxy expects the ETag and If-None-Match header values
   to be in double quotes. Because the ETag header is being set by
   WCM without double quotes, the proxy server doesn't process the
   header internally (as it is considered invalid) and just
   forwards it to the client. In the next request the client sends
   the same value as the If-None-Match header back to the proxy
   which again considers it invalid and simply forwards the request
   to the server without treating it as a conditional
   header.
   
   The proxy now expects a 200 response for the request (because
   there were no conditional headers) but WCM processes the
   If-None-Match header without double quotes normally and sends a
   304 response. This causes the proxy to treat the response as
   invalid and return a 500 error to the client browser.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WCM now sets the ETag header with double quotes as per the RFC
   2616 specification.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR addresses the issue by ensuring valid ETag and
   If-None-Match header values. You may need to clear the client
   browser cache (to remove cached If-None-Match values) for this
   fix to take effect.
