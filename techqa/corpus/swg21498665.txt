QUESTION
 How is the Browser View, Direct Print and Direct Print with Attachments functionality enabled in the Maximo Version 7.5 release? 

ANSWER
Your users may require quick access to reports, via a minimum number of mouse clicks, and in certain scenarios be directly printed to the user’s default printer. This functionality is available in Maximo with the embedded reporting tool. 
Historically, this functionality has often been called Quick Link, Direct Print or Attach Docs Printing. This functionality is commonly referred to as Report Toolbar access, and is highly configurable and flexible. Its overall functionality is to enable users to print or view their reports with a minimal number of clicks.

Report toolbar access can be configured in three different ways. These are Browser View, Direct Print and Direct Print with Attachments. A single report can be configured for any one of these, or any combination of these options. 

This document will describe each of these three items in detail, including the prerequisites for the reports that utilize them. This document refers to the Maximo® Base Services Version 7.5 Releases.

Please note that none of the three toolbar access icons can be enabled for reports with specific user inputted parameters, known as parameterized reports. This occurs because the functionality is based on bypassing the request page for quick display of the reports. If reports have parameters, they must be input on a report’s request page – therefore, they can not be enabled for Browser View, Direct Print or Direct Print with Attachments.
