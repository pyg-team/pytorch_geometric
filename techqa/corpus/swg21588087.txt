issued by CN=rootcertificatename.domain.com, OU=Company Infrastructure, O=Company 

Name,L=City, 

ST=Sate, C=Country, EMAILADDRESS=certadmin@domain.com is not trusted;

Certificate chaining error


CAUSE
Certificate is not imported in the user java environment


ENVIRONMENT
Controller running via a gateway, which is configured for SSL (HTTPS) using a self-signed (non-commercial) encryption certificate.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Import the SSL rootcertificate (i.e. the certificate mentioned in the error message) into the JRE environment on the user computer (or where the java Controller feature is being accessed from). 

 

Steps: 

See separate IBM Technote #1495669.
