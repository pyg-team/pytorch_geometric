APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With ChlAuthEarlyAdopt, a client application attempting to
   authenticate with a bad username/password combination may
   receive a 2009 (MQRC_CONNECTION_BROKEN) error response, together
   with an unexpected AMQ9777 message in the queue manager log
   files.
   This unexpected error condition may also occur whilst using
   ChlAuthEarlyAdopt, when a user is blocked as a result of an
   Object Authority Manager (OAM) rule (for example, if '+connect'
   is not specified for the user).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM MQ with queue managers configured with the
   "ChlauthEarlyAdopt=y" setting.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   With ChlAuthEarlyAdopt, a logic error meant that the failed
   authentication error state was incorrectly being handled as a
   broken connection.
   
   In this case it would be expected to receive a 2035
   (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) error response, together with a more
   appropriate AMQ5534 message in the queue manager log files.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the event of an authentication error with ChlAuthEarlyAdopt,
   MQ has been corrected so a 2035 (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) error is
   returned and the AMQ9777 message is no longer reported in the
   queue manager log files.
