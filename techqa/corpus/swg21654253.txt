PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I incorporate the Residential Delivery Indicator (RDI) into the CASS processing stream? What does this functionality provide? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
USAC (CASS) offers the option to add additional functionality to your CASS processing stream. The United States Postal Service (USPS) offers an additional database for use called the Residential Delivery Indicator ( RDI). This Indicator identifies residential and commercial addresses. To obtain the RDI database you must contact the USPS directly and pay for it's use. Once obtained you can easily incorporate the functionality into the current CASS stream as follows; 

1. Rename the USPS 9-digit RDI file to rts.hs9 

2. Rename the USPS-11 file RDI file to rts.hsll 

3. Then place into the IBM CASS reference database directory
