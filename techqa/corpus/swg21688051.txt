 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM DB2 contains a vulnerability in which an ALTER TABLE statement may cause the DB2 server to terminate abnormally when AUTO_REVAL is set to IMMEDIATE . This could result in a DB2 server crash; if so, the server would need to be restarted. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-6159 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6159] 
DESCRIPTION:
IBM DB2 contains a disruption of service vulnerability. A remote, authenticated DB2 user could exploit this vulnerability when DB2 is configured with immediate auto revalidation (i.e. AUTO_REVAL configuration parameter is set to IMMEDIATE). The user would need valid security credentials to connect to the database and would need to execute specially crafted ALTER table statements (that require control privileges on the target table). Note: the AUTO_REVAL configuration parameter is set to DEFERRED by default.
