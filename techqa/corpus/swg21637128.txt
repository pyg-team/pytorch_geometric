Text:
Ruleset; lock; datacap studio TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a Datacap Studio a ruleset is found that can't be locked or modified. No error message occurs. 

CAUSE
If two instances of Datacap Studio are run, locking or unlocking a ruleset in one instance will not update the other instance.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Attempt to login to the application in Datacap Studio again. If the status changes, there is another instance of Datacap Studio being used.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Only run one instance of Datacap Studio at a time.


If a second instance of Datacap Studio cannot be located to shut down, it is possible to manually unlock the ruleset. 

 1. Close Datacap Studio. 
 2. Navigate to the \Datacap\(application)\dco_(application)\rules folder. 
 3. Delete the lock file for the task. The name will have the form (taskname).rul.lock.
