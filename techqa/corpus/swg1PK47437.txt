APAR STATUS

 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server does not
   sufficiently describe how the pluggable application client
   uses the Sun Java Development Kit (JDK).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects users who are using the    *
   *                 pluggable application client for WebSphere   *
   *                 Application Server Version 6.1.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In the product documentation for        *
   *                      WebSphere Application Server V6.1,      *
   *                      the "Application Client for WebSphere   *
   *                      Application Server" topic states that   *
   *                      the pluggable application client uses   *
   *                      the Sun Java Development Kit. The       *
   *                      statement needs additional details      *
   *                      for clarification.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The topic states that the pluggable application client works
   with the Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE). However, it does
   not mention that the Sun JRE must be the same version as the
   IBM version of the Sun JRE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Application Client for WebSphere Application Server"
   topic has been updated to state that the pluggable application
   client supports the Sun JRE that is directly downloaded from
   Sun Microsystems Web site. However, the Sun JRE must be the
   same version as the IBM version of the Sun JRE. The
   Application Client for WebSphere Application Server for
   Windows installs the ORB.properties file to configure the Sun
   JRE to use the IBM ORB implementation that is installed as
   part of the pluggable application client.
   
   Date that information will be available to customers:
   The modified documentation will be available in the next
   update to the information center, which is scheduled to occur
   on or before September 30, 2007.
