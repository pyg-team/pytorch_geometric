 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A domain group was added to sysadmin in MS SQL Server to have access to the Cognos Content Store. 

Later it was advised this procedure was against policies and advise to remove domain group and add particular users and/or restrict the access of these users. 

The network login has been successfully used as the service account for a while. 
But while running report error was thrown that datasources was missing. List of data sources was empty.

Changes were rolled back to add domain group to sysadmin in MS SQL Server. When Cognos service was started it failed with the following error : 

"CFG-ERR-0103 Unable to start IBM Cognos service.
Execution of the external process returns an error code value of -1" 


CAUSE
Content Store got corrupt due to switching of the users 

 OR 
check the dispatcher port. This may be in use.







RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Consult the Database Administrator to create a new database to be used as Content Store. Configure this new database as Content Store in Cognos Configuration and then start the Cognos service: 

 

 1. In the Explorer window, under Data Access, Content Manager, click Content Store. 
 2. In the Properties window, for the Database name property, type the name of the new database created for the Content Store. 
 3. Change the logon credentials to specify a valid user ID and password: 
 4. Click the Value box next to the User ID and password property and then click the edit button when it appears. 
 5. Type the appropriate values and click OK. 
 6. Confirm there are no hung processes and that the port is available.
