Title: IBM 'The expert modeller could not fit a model.' printed when automatic outlier detection added to successful ARIMA model - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using the Time Series Modeler (TSMODEL command) in SPSS/PASW Statistics, I was able to estimate an ARIMA(1,0,0) model with 11 time points and forecast the value for the 12th time point. However, if I added a request for automatic outlier detection to the same model, a warning box appeared with the message:

"Subcommand MODEL 1: Dependent series y: The expert modeler could not fit a model.
Model cannot be built.
No model could be built."

The procedure stopped without estimating or forecasting.

Why would a request for automatic outlier detection cause the modedl to fail? Is the failure related to the short series length? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A program defect was filed with SPSS Development to determine why the model failed under these circumstances and to request that a more informative warning be printed. It is not clear why the model failed when outlier detection was requested. 

The following fix was applied for Statistics 18.0.1: If automatic outlier detection is on and TSMODEL fails to estimate a model with a given structure, the procedure will now try to estimate the same model without outlier detection. A request has been added for a warning message that would alert the user that the model could not be fit with outlier detection and that there may be outliers in the data
