Title: IBM Web services resource injection fails intermittently when cdi-1.2 is enabled - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When cdi-1.2 is enabled, resource injection into a WebServices (jaxws-2.2) class might intermittently fail, if that class is contained within a CDI implicit bean archive. An implicit bean archive is an archive that does not contain a beans.xml file, but does contain one or more bean classes with a bean defining annotation, or one or more session beans. If the failure occurs, a warning message is displayed in the logs; for example: "WELD-000834: Unable to inject resource....". 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If CDI is not used, disable the implicit bean archive files for CDI. Set the system property, com.ibm.ws.cdi.enableImplicitBeanArchives, to false. 

 * If CDI is enabled, use explicit bean archives by adding the beans.xml file in META-INF directory for normal .jar files, and use the WEB-INF directory for .war files.
