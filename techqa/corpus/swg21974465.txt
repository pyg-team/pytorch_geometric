MBO fetch operation failed in the mboset with the SQL error code -805.
The record could not be retrieved from the database. See the log file

CAUSE
When following these steps, the action errors: 


1) Go to the Classifications application and bring up a classification.
2) Try to add an attribute to classification. The following error is displayed:
BMXAA4210E - Database error -805 
3) Check "Apply down hierarchy".


ENVIRONMENT
The problem was reproduced in SCCD 7.5.0.2, TPAE 7.5.0.4 and DB2 NT 9.7



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Confirm that the know Maximo defect IV65191 is resolved. 


APAR IV65191 CANNOT ADD ATTRIBUTE TO CLASSIFICATION
WHEN ATTRIBUTE ALREADY ADDED TO ASSET SPECIFICATIONS. 

Otherwise, it could be related to the DB2 configuration to handle largeSQL
statements in sections in 9.7. As per the DB2 Technote below, check how the CLIPkg is set in the db2cli.ini file.
