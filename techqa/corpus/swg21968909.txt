Title: IBM Search application not starting on new or secondary nodes - United States

Text:
search; connections; work managers; CNTR0020E; node; start TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
How to resolve an issue when the search application is starting on some nodes, but not others in a new deployment.

SYMPTOM
On the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, the Search application status reports "Partial Start". 

Checking the systemout.log, you see messages like the following after attempting to start the Search application on these nodes:

LocalExceptio E CNTR0020E: EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception during invocation of method "getBean" on bean "BeanId(Search#dboard.search.ejb.jar#Search
ServiceLocator, null)". Exception data: org.springframework.beans.factory.access.BootstrapException: Unable to initialize group definition. Group resource name [classpath*:spring/search/app/SearchBeanRefF

CAUSE
When IBM Connections is first installed, each node is automatically given a Work Manager for Search. However, you must create the Work Managers manually for any subsequent nodes created. The behavior described here indicates that additional Work Managers have not been created. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Once the Work Managers are created, the Search application should start on all affected Nodes. Instructions on how to do this are available here, in the IBM Connections documentation:
