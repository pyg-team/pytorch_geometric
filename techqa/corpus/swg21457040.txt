RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem resolution varies based on the root cause. 


1. Licence agreement was not accepted


If you are upgrading the agent, go back, type "GO OMA" and stop the agent with option 3. 
When agent is stopped, rerun the RSTLICPGM command. 
On the step shown below, you need to accept the agreement by pressing F14: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457040&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457040&aid=1]



2. Previous version of Candle monitoring agent installed:

You must delete the previous Candle monitoring agent (if one is installed) before you can install the Monitoring Agent for i5/OS. 

Determine if the licensed programs 0KA4430, 0KA4440, or 0KA4610 are installed by entering the following command: 

GO LICPGM 

then select the option 10 (Display installed licensed programs). 

If a previous version of the Candle agent is installed, return back to the previous page and select the option 12: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457040&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21457040&aid=2]

When the agent is deleted, try to install the agent again using RSTLICPGM.
