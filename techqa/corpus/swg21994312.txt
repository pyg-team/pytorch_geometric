Title: IBM "Error occurred when deleting temporary VFP files: ODBC Error (2)" when using non-English (for example Spanish) Oracle client - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User performs a database optimise. After a few minutes, user receives an error. 

SYMPTOM
Error occurred when deleting temporary VFP files: ODBC Error (2)


CAUSE
There are other potential causes of this (or similar) errors. 

 * TIP: See separate IBM Technote #1365329 for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is that the Oracle client registry key is not named with the default English naming convention.  * Typically this is because a non-English Oracle client version is installed on Controller application server.


More Information: 
Controller creates ODBC connections 'on-the-fly' and assumes the default English naming convention.  * Unfortunately, this fails if the application server has a non-English build.


For example, if the operating system is in Spanish then the default label (for Oracle 11G) is 'Oracle en OraClient11g_home1' (not 'Oracle in OraClient11g_home1')  * This causes the Controller optimisations to fail.

ENVIRONMENT
Controller application server has non-English (e.g. Spanish) version of Oracle client installed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modify a registry key on the Controller application server, so that the value is the English translation. 

 
Steps: 

 1. Logon to the Controller application server 
 2. Click "START - RUN" and type: REGEDIT 
 3. Navigate through the registry, and locate the 32-bit version of the key "...\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI".

 * TIP: this is here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI 


4. Locate the entry for the Oracle ODBC  * TIP: For Spanish Oracle 11G client, by default this is: Oracle en OraClient11g_home1 


5. Rename the key to the default English equivalent.  * For example, for the Oracle 11G client, this is: Oracle in OraClient11g_home1
