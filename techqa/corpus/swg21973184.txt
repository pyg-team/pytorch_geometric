RPT; schedule; encryption; 256 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to start an IBM Rational Performance Tester schedule result in error

"Error occurred during connection to server ...". 

SYMPTOM
The full error reads as follows.


Error occurred during connection to server <server name>. Explanation message: 'Cannot support SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA with currently installed providers'. Since the request is the primary request for the current page all secondary requests will be skipped and the next page will be attempted. 


You see this error in the error log and the messages in the test log. The schedule completes and issues results. The workbench can run a schedule error free through the built-in agent.


CAUSE
The agent does not support strong encryption. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy the policy JAR files, local_policy and US_export_policy.jar, into the JRE security folder. In Windows the path reads as follows.


C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP\AgentController\jdk\jre\lib\security
