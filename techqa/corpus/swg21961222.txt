Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Getting the below error when you try to install ITM on Window OS 

"D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" includes blanks. Due to your system settings the installation path cannot include blanks, please specify location with no spaces. 

SYMPTOM
When you try to install ITM on " C:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" it woks fine but when we try to install it on "D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" we get the below error:


"D:\Program Files\IBM\ITM" includes blanks. Due to your system settings the installation path cannot include blanks, please specify location with no spaces.

If you take out the spaces and use D:\ProgramFiles\IBM\ITM, the install will continue. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Couple of ways to fix this... 

 

1. Remove the space in the directory path and install the ITM on a directory without spaces. 

Example : D:\IBM\ITM 

 

2. Check the NTFS 8.3 name creation and enable the 8.3 naming creation to install the ITM on a directory path with spaces.

check the value on the below registry location 


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation

In case NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation is set to (2), this means the following: NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.

You can check the 8.3 name creation using this command for the volumes that are impacted.

For example, if the %TEMP% folder is located on c:\, but you are installing on d:\, then you should run these commands: 


fsutil 8dot3name query c:
fsutil 8dot3name query d:

You will get an output like this:
The volume state is: 0 (8dot3 name creation is enabled).
The registry state is: 2 (Per volume setting - the default). 


Value and Meaning

0 NTFS creates short file names. This setting enables applications that cannot process long file names and computers that use different code pages to find the files.
1 NTFS does not create short file names. Although this setting increases file performance, applications that cannot process long file names, and computers that use different code pages, might not be able to find the files.
2 NTFS sets the 8.3 naming convention creation on a per volume basis.
3 NTFS disables 8dot3 name creation on all volumes except the system volume.
