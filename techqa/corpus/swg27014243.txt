ABSTRACT
 Over the past few years, z/OS has phased out the concept of one byte console ids and has moved towards the use of four byte ids. In parallel, CICS has adopted the same concept to become compliant. These changes have generated many PMRs and questions to be raised to both CICS and z/OS. This session will give you the opportunity to answer any and all questions you may still have and give you a better understanding of the implementation from both a CICS and z/OS view. This presentation was created at the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) 3.2 level, but most of the information still applies; however things like offsets might have changed. 

CONTENT
Open Mic sessions are conducted in a question and answer format. The table below provides a time index (minutes:seconds) to the recording and describes the questions or topics discussed. You can fast forward to any question using the time index, a table containing the panel of experts is also included.

Open Mic session 
16 December 2008 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EST 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:30 General introduction 02:11 Technical introduction 04:54 Why has the Master Console concept been eliminated within z/OS? 07:45 How can CICS be configured to handle undefined consoles (within CICS)? 10:46 Please explain the differences of *EVERY and *FIRST options coded within the USERID parameter of the Terminal definition. 12:11 If a Console is not defined to CICS and Console Autoinstall is not configured, what happens and how can I resolve it? 13:34 I am only aware of the Console name being used in CICS which appears to map to a TSO userid. Does CICS ever really use the new 4 byte id? 14:43 From dumps, I have seen reference to a console named INTERNAL but I don't have a TSO userid of INTERNAL. Where does this come from? 16:20 Is there a way to display Consoles and their associated names and ids within z/OS? 17:56 If I use autoinstall, do I need to worry about this change to console support, or will CICS automatically handle it? 19:00 Is it true that z/OS 1.8 and above no longer support a master console with a console ID of 00? 21:00 Is it true that we no longer need to define a console called "Internal"? 23:09 With regard to security, is there a way to tell if an User ID is attached to a terminal with the autoinstall of a console? 27:55 Closing remarks 28:50 End of Call 
Panel of experts: Scott McClure Senior Software Engineer, CICS David Yackel Senior Technical Staff Member, z/OS Mark Todd Software Engineer, CICS
