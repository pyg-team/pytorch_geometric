Title: IBM DataPower Web Service Proxy Local Endpoint Handler disappears when updates are made on the remote WSDL - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WSP Local Endpoint Handler seems to disappear or gets un-configured on the WebSphere DataPower WebGUI after certain updates are made on the remote WSDL 

SYMPTOM
After certain updates are made on the remote WSDL, the WSP Local Endpoint Handler seems to disappear or get un-configured on WebGUI.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the WSDL cannot compile, the endpoint handler will not be displayed on the WebGUI; however, it should still be there in the configuration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check at CLI outputs after executing the show wsm-endpoint command and the objects should be there. If the WSDL is then fixed and refreshed again, the endpoint handler should reappear on the WebGUI.
