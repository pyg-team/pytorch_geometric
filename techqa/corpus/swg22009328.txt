embedded Websphere Application Server version 7.0.x Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in IBM® Java SDK affects WebSphere Application Server July 2017 CPU [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007002] 
The Websphere security bulletin above provides a link to the required iFix to remediate the vulnerability. However, the iFix requires either eWAS 7.0.0.31 or higher installed. 

TIP does not support upgrading Websphere fixpack independently. TIP 2.2.0.15 or TIP 2.2.0.17 or TIP 2.2.0.19 must be applied which will upgrade eWAS to 7.0.0.31 and above. Once TIP FP has been applied, the Websphere iFix can be applied as described in the Websphere bulletin. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Please refer to WAS iFix as described above
