Title: IBM WebService Proxy endpoint URIs ending with the form "[?.](xsd|ns)\d+" are used internally by IBM DataPower Gateways appliances. - United States

Text:
DataPower; WSP; WebService Proxy; internal; URI; WSDL; schema TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WSDL or schema data cannot be requested via the web browser when the WSP local endpoint URI ends with a question mark or a dot followed by either "xsd" or "ns", and followed by one or more digits.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Following are examples of WSP local endpoint URIs that cannot be used: 

 *  http://.../somename.ns1 
 *  http://.../somename.xsd1 
 *  http://.../somename?ns1 
 *  http://.../somename?xsd1 


This is working as designed in that this syntax is used internally by the DataPower appliance firmware.
