ABSTRACT
 You need help finding information for the CRT agent. What kind of information do you need? 

CONTENT

Provides real end-user client monitoring for Microsoft Windows desktop applications. It is installed separately on client desktop systems. 

Client Response Time provides the following features:

_ Measures and collects application transaction response time on Windows system clients from the end-user perspective. For example, you can use Client Response Time to monitor Lotus® Notes® response times, ensuring that Lotus Notes responds quickly to support demands for corporate productivity.

_ Gathers data for Windows system clients from real end-users for reporting on Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

_ Monitors virtually any Windows system application with a graphical user interface, when you create custom behavior files with the ETEWatch® Customizer.

_ Reports the details of client, network, and server response times.

_ Supports all ETEWatch behavior files and Response Time CAT behavior files.

_ Supports applications running on Citrix and Terminal servers.

_ Custom Application Response Measurement (ARM) monitoring for Client Response Time. ARM is an application programming interface (API) that is used to monitor the availability and performance of business transactions within and across diverse applications and systems.

_ Real end-user response time and availability monitoring for custom ARM applications by using the Generic ARM component of Client Response Time.

Note: ITCAM for Transactions V7.3 fix packs are the final releases to include Client Response Time. Client Response Time is deprecated starting in ITCAM for Transactions V7.4.
