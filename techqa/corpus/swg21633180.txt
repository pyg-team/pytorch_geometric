Title: IBM Rulerunner restart script for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
rulerunner restart script TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a way to monitor the Rulerunner service and restart it immediately if it fails rather than wait for the next scheduled restart? 

CAUSE
The Rulerunner service has a number of mechanisms built into it to recover from a failure. One of them is to have a scheduled restart every few hours. In a high volume operation, it may not be acceptable for the service to be down until the next scheduled restart.

ANSWER
 

 1. Create a command script with the following lines:
    C:\WINDOWS\system32\sc.exe \\RULERUNNER1 query "Datacap Rulerunner Service" | FIND "STATE" | FIND "STOPPED"
    IF NOT errorlevel 1 C:\WINDOWS\system32\sc.exe \\RULERUNNER1 start "Datacap Rulerunner Service" 
 2. If there are multiple Rulerunner Servers, add another two lines to the script for each one. 
 3. Create a Scheduled Task on the machine that will monitor the Rulerunner Service. This could be the Rulerunner Server itself, or another machine might be used to perform the monitoring task.
