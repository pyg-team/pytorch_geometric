PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Formatting CMOD V8.5.x.x and 9.0.x.x Server traces on Windows platform 

SYMPTOM
CMOD Server trace output is unreadable


CAUSE
In CMOD V8.5.0.0 and later, the trace file is written in binary. To convert the trace file from its binary format, use the ARSTFMT command found in the bin directory of your OnDemand server V8.5 and later installation.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open command prompt - navigate to the CMOD\9.0\bin directory and issue ARSTFMT as follows:

arstfmt -i C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file -o C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file\name.txt




where the C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file is the unreadable trace file and C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\path\to\file\name.txt is the name of the formatted trace file.
