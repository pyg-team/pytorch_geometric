ERROR DESCRIPTION

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Content Collector always retrieved information about mailbox
   from the Exchange server. Requesting this information from an
   Exchange 2007 server requires "View Information Store Status"
   permission. If you used an account without administrative
   rights, retrieving information about mailbox limits failed and
   the following message was written to the Content Collector
   Email Connector log file:
   
   could not obtain mailbox table. MAPI error code:
   'MAPI_E_NO_ACCESS'
   
   Subsequent calls to open a mailbox succeeded if the mailbox was
   located on the same Exchange server as the mailbox of the
   account that was running the Email Connector service. However,
   if the mailbox was located on a different Exchange server,
   processing failed and the following message was written to the
   Content Collector Email Connector log file:
   
   AFUM0009E: An error occurred: The Messaging Application
   Programming Interface (MAPI) function
   'IMAPISession::OpenMsgStore (private)' failed with return
   code 'MAPI_E_FAILONEPROVIDER'.
   
   The problem occurs because Microsoft Exchange 2007 caches
   information about failed access and does not allow any further
   calls if a call failed, even if subsequent calls require other
   privileges than the failed call.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, the Email Connector only retrieves
   information about mailbox limits from the Exchange server if
   "Open mailbox with privileged access" is selected on the
   Connection tab of the Email Connector configuration. Note that
   after applying the fix, you must restart the Microsoft Exchange
   Information Store service on the affected Exchange Servers to
   clear the cache.
