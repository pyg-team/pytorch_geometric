ABSTRACT
 A list of the installation instructions and fixes for IBM Security QRadar 7.1 MR2 Patch 8 (7.1.0.962104). 

CONTENT
If your deployment is installed with QRadar 7.1, you can install fix pack 7.1.0-QRADAR-QRSIEM-962104. 

 


Before you begin 

Ensure that you take the following precautions: 

 * Back up your data before you begin any software upgrade. For more information about backup and recovery, see the IBM Security QRadar Administration Guide. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/security/products/qradar/documents/71MR2/QRadar/EN/QRadar_71MR2_AdminGuide.pdf] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038118] 
 * To avoid access errors in your log file, close all open QRadar sessions. 
 * The fix pack for QRadar cannot be installed on a managed host that is at a different software version from the Console. All appliances in the deployment must be at the same software revision to patch the entire deployment. 
 * Verify that all changes are deployed on your appliances. The patch cannot install on appliances that have changes that are not deployed. 


About this task Fix packs are cumulative software updates to fix known software issues in your QRadar deployment. QRadar fix packs are installed by using an SFS file. The fix pack can update any appliance that is attached to the QRadar Console that is at the same software version as the Console.


Procedure 

 1. Download the fix pack 7.1.0-QRADAR-QRSIEM-962104 from the IBM Fix Central website: https://ibm.biz/BdE4vR [https://ibm.biz/BdE4vR] (IBM shortened link to the download this Fix Pack) 
 2. Using SSH, log in to your system as the root user. 
 3. Copy the fix pack to the /tmp directory on the QRadar Console. 
    Note: If space in the /tmp directory is limited, copy the fix pack to another location that has sufficient space. 
 4. To create the /media/updates directory, type the following command: mkdir -p /media/updates 
 5. Change to the directory where you copied the patch file. For example, cd /tmp 
 6. To mount the patch file to the /media/updates directory, type the following command:
    mount -o loop -t squashfs 710_QRadar_patchupdate-7.1.0.962104.sfs /media/updates/ 
 7. To run the patch installer, type the following command:
    /media/updates/installer 
    The first time that you run the fix pack, there might be a delay before the fix pack installation menu is displayed. 
 8. Using the patch installer, select all. 
    
    The all option updates the software on all systems in your deployment. In HA deployments, primary HA appliances are patched and replicate the patch update to the secondary HA appliance. 
    
    If you do not select the all option, you must copy the update to each appliance in your deployment and install the fix pack. If you manually install fix packs in your deployment, you must update your appliances in the following order:
    
    1. Console
    2. Event Processors
    3. Event Collectors
    4. Flow Processors
    5. Flow Collectors
    
    If your Secure Shell (SSH) session is disconnected while the upgrade is in progress, the upgrade continues. When you reopen your SSH session and rerun the installer, the patch installation resumes.
    
    
 9. After the install completes, administrators and users should clear their browser cache before logging in to the Console. 



Results 

A summary of the fix pack installation advises you of any managed host that were not updated. If the fix pack fails to update a managed host, you can copy the fix pack to the host and run the installation locally.
