ANSWER
Tivoli Storage Manager API Warnings 

 * Starting with TSM Version 5.3.0, a writable log file is required for backup/restore. The DSMI_LOG environment variable or the dsm.sys file errorlogname option must be set to a path that the user of the application can write to. If the user performing the backup/restore does not have write permissions to the log file, the process will fail. The TSM API return code for this situation is 106 (Access to the specified file or directory is denied).


API Warnings for Windows  * When running the client as described in the Tivoli Field Guide "Tivoli Storage Manager Recovery Techniques Using Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)" you will receive the error message: ANS1464S Cannot load ICC encryption library. Because the scenarios described in the field guide are not run from a fully installed TSM client, the registry entry indicating the location of the ICC encryption library is not created. Since the recovery scenarios described in the field guide do not involve TSM encrypted files, you can bypass this error by modifying your client options file and specifying the option ENCRYPTIONTYPE DES56. This prevents the client from attempting to load the ICC encryption library. 

 * If you are migrating from the V5.3.2 or lower API client, and you also use the TSM Backup-Archive client scheduler service or CAD service, you must ensure that the V5.3.3 or higher Backup-Archive client is also installed. This requirement is due to an incompatibility in a dll module shared by the API and the Backup-Archive clients.
