APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  User sees ADMA8019E error when deploying application.
   Support was able to install to a single server fine.  Not a
   cluster.  Steps to recreate:
    1) Create a cluster, I just had one cluster member
    2) Create a resource using the cluster scope (this also seems
   to work   if you create using the cell scope too).  Note this is
   CMP (use the plant DB settings as an example
    3) Install the ear, at step 4 change the jndi mappings for the
   resource to the cluster resource.
    4) Press next
    Now you will see the error message about the jdbc not at the
   correct scope.  This should not happen.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Websphere Application Server users who try   *
   *                 to deploy applications using the             *
   *                 administrative console                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During application deployment in the    *
   *                      step where Resource references in the   *
   *                      application are mapped to resource      *
   *                      bindings ADMA8019E is issued.           *
   *                                                              *
   *                      Eventhough the resource binding was     *
   *                      correctly defined, when the target of   *
   *                      deployment  included clusters or        *
   *                      webservers, a validation warning        *
   *                      message is thrown by the                *
   *                      administrative console.                 *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope.
   Resources are within the deployment target scope if they are
   defined at the cell, node, server, or application level when
   the deployment target is a server, or at the cell, cluster,
   or application level when the deployment target is a cluster.
   Assign resources that are within the deployment target scope of
   the application or confirm that these resource assignments are
   correct as specified.
   
   The problem was occuring because the resources available in tne
   environment were not being picked up if the target was a
   cluster/webserver.
   Code changes were done to include these scopes while
   validating resources.
   
   The APAR addresses resources of type
   1)DataSource
   2)Mail.Session
   3)URLProvider
   4)QueueConnectionFactory
   5)TopicConnectionFactory
   6)JMSCOnnectionFactory
   7)Queue
   8)Topic
   9)J2CResourceAdapter
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code changes for the APAR have been integrated to 6.0.2.3
   for WebSphere Distributed customers.  For WebSphere z/OS
   customers, the fix is integrated in 6.0.2.2 and beyond.
