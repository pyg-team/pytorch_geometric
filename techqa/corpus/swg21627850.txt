 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a way to determine the version of Operational Decision Manager product and fixes that are installed? 

ANSWER
Starting with version 7.5, the Operational Decision Manager (ODM) products are installed using IBM Installation Manager (IIM). You can use IIM to display the versions of your installed products. 

With IIM, you can choose one of the two methods for displaying the product version: You can use the GUI or you can use the command line. 


To display your product installation version by using the GUI approach: 

1. Launch the IBM Installation Manager. 
2. Click File > View Installed Packages. 

A window opens. The window displays the product components, fix-packs, and the iFixes that are installed. 


You can use a command line for Windows or Linux to display your product installation version:

Linux: 

./imcl listInstalledPackages -long 

Windows: 

imcl.exe listInstalledPackages -long 

The above command displays the versions of all the products that are installed through IIM including the install paths.

You can use a command line for Window and Linux to display your installed product features:

Linux: 

./imcl listInstalledPackages -features -long 

Windows: 

imcl.exe listInstalledPackages -features -long 

 

The "imcl" executable is typically found in the"/eclipse/tools" directory of IBM Installation Manager install directory. 

 

The returned information includes a longer description of the packages and the features that are included in the repository. 

 

Note 1: If you encounter the error "CRIMC1018E ERROR: Administrator privileges are required" when attempting to run the above commands, ensure that the user has administrative privileges. This error is documented in this link [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.messages.IMic/CRIMC1018E.html].



Note 2: In order to find out the version of Decision Center and Decision Server consoles and Rule Designer, you should check the "About" menu.
