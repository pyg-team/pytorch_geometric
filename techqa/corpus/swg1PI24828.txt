APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Security AppScan Standard 9.0.0.1, if the scan results
   contain a particular issue, in this case JavaScript Hijacking,
   when user tries to export scan result to a XML file, the
   following error will be displayed:
   'AppScan successfully created an XML file, but some data could
   not included...'
   Also, when clicking on the particular issue on Issues tab view,
   AppScan Standard will raise an error and terminates.
   
   Workaround:
   Set problematic issues as non-vulnerable.
   Specifically in this case - to exclude the JavaScript Hijacking
   from the scan by setting it to non-vulnerable variant.
