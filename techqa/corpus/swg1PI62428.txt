   ****************************************************************
   When a signon fails message DFHSN1102 is issued which indicates
   that the signon failed at netname for that userid. The problem
   is that when RACF is called doing a RACROUTE VERIFYX to verify
   the password, only the userid and password are included. Other
   information, such as netname, is not sent and so the RACF SMF 80
   record which is recording that invalid password attempt, does
   not include the netname.
   This is the port of entry and is required for auditing reasons.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS modules DFHUSAD, DFHXSPW and DFHXSSB have been changed to
   ensure that a port of entry is included on the RACROUTE VERIFYX
   call, so that the CICS netname can be included in the SMF 80
   record for a password failure.
