*Note: This error will most commonly occur when running the portal-post-upgrade configuration. However, this error can also occur when running either the wp-add-la-property or add-wcm-la-attributes configuration tasks, utilized to add a new property to a property extension database.


CAUSE
The problem occurs because it appears that the prompt for the login attributes are not getting through. This failure could happen when if you are running the migration task remotely and not attending to the screen, such that x11 packets are not being forwarded.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct the problem, use these steps: 

1. Edit the sas.client.props file, which is located in the following directory: 

 * 
 * 


2. Within that file, find the following property:  * 
 * 


By default, it is set to prompt. You need to change it to properties. 3. Also within that file, two lines below the loginSource, set the WebSphere Application Server adminuserid and password: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Be sure to use the full DN for the user. 

4. Then rerun the portal-post-upgrade task.
