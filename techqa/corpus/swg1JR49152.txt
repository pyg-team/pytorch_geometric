LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the personalized BPC Explorer view this view
   disappears, when for query parameters special characters like
   '<'or '>' are used.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   The personalized BPC Explorer view is stored as XML. When the
   query parameter value contains special characters that need to
   be escaped in XML this causes  invalid XML, as these characters
   are not escaped so far. As result the personalized BPC Explorer
   view disappears.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Within the stored XML the values for query parameters were not
   escaped, so that, in case of special characters in the value,
   invalid XML was generated.
   With this interim fix special characters will be escaped
   correctly so that valid XMl will be generated. This iFix will
   update the BPC Explorer.
