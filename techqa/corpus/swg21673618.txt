QUESTION
 My BINDDN contains space characters. What syntax should I use to configure LDAP authentication on my IBM PureData System for Analytics appliance? 

CAUSE
Spaces can cause issues with openldap if they are not escaped properly.

ANSWER
To avoid issues, enclose the entire BINDDN with single quotes, and enclose the Common Name (CN), Organizational Unit (OU) or Domain Component (DC) containing a space character with double quotes. 

Example:
BINDDN 'cn=commonname,ou="space test",DC=adroot,DC=company,DC=com'
