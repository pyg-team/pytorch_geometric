APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Multiple SSL closures at the same time might cause the appliance
   not to respond temporarily to any traffic. For example, all
   transactions and user interaction might stall for several
   seconds.
   
   When this issue occurs:
   
   1. A message similar to this appears in the log:
   
   [A-SERVICE][ssl][error] sslproxy(SSL-PROXY):
   tid(377228278)[1.2.3.4]: Timed out while waiting to finish
   sending of partially sent SSL closure alert
   
   2. There is a gap in the logs of several seconds with no
   messages logged, followed by a flurry of activity as the
   appliance is trying to "catch up".
