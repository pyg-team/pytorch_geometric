 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Linux users created with the Information Server Installation are failing on executing custom, non-product developed scripts.

"source .bashrc" command results in error :

"-sh: source: .bashrc : file not found"


CAUSE
Users created with Information Server are created with "bourne shell" type for compatibility reasons.
This is a pure Linux shell issue when invoking bash scripts "Bourne Again Shell".

ANSWER
In order to invoke bash shell scripts, invoke previously a "bash" shell with command "bash" or force the script to use it using a "Shebang" as this is the usage in shell scripting. 

Example :
#!/bin/bash 

At the beginning of the script.
