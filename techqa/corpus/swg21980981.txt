Title: IBM nzbackup failed for large data backup upon TSM, but it was successful for small data backup - United States

Text:
TSM nzbackup backup connection TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 nzbackup failed when it took long time, with error as follow in backup log

"Connector exited with error: 'ANS1017E (RC-50) Session rejected: TCP/IP connection failure" 

CAUSE
TSM timeout parameter is too short to wait for nzbackup to push data

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Request customer to increase timeout parameters as follow in TSM side 

 - CommTimeout
- IdleTimeout

* description of parameters
The COMMTIMEOUT option specifies how long the server waits for an
expected client message during an operation that causes a database
update. If the length of time exceeds this time-out, the server ends
the session with the client. You may want to increase the time-out
value to prevent clients from timing out. Clients may time out if there
is a heavy network load in your environment or they are backing up
large files.

The IDLETIMEOUT option specifies the amount of time, in minutes, that a
client session can be idle before the server cancels the session. You
may want to increase the time-out value to prevent clients from timing
out if there is a heavy network load in your environment. Note,
however, that a large number of idle sessions could prevent other users
from connecting to the server.
