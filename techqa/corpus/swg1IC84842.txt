APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Tivoli Storage Manager Manuals need to better document the
   requirements for collection of Processor Value Unit (PVU)
   information when the Tivoli Storage Manager B/A Client is on
   Linux platform.
   
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager Server v.6.3.x
   
   
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low
   
   
   
   Additional Keywords:
   TSM PVU linux CIT client
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the topic "Role of processor value units in assessing license
   requirements"
   
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/topic/com.ibm.its
   m.srv.doc/c_srv_pvu_overview.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/topic/com.ibm.itsm.srv.doc/c_srv_pvu_overview.html]
   
   for Step 2, consider the following if you are running in a Linux
   environment:
   
   "Tip: If a client node is running on a Linux operating system,
   Common Inventory Technology is not installed automatically.
   If you plan to obtain PVU information from a client node running
   on a Linux operating system, install Common Inventory Technology
   on the client node.
   
   For details, see "Install the UNIX and Linux backup-archive
   clients"

   in Step 7, consider the following if you are running in a Linux
   environment:
   
   "Tip: If you fail to obtain PVU information from a client node
   that is running on a Linux operating system,
   ensure that Common Inventory Technology is installed on that
   client node.
   After installing Common Inventory Technology, obtain a new PVU
   estimate."

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the Tivoli Storage Manager Administrator's Guide for Linux,
   in the topic "Role of processor value units in assessing
   license requirements," the following note was added:
   
   "Tip: If a client node is running on a Linux operating system,
   Common Inventory Technology is not installed automatically. If
   you plan to obtain PVU information from a client node that is
   running on a Linux operating system, install Common Inventory
   Technology on the client node. For details, see 'Install the
   UNIX and Linux backup-archive clients.'"
   
   In the topic "Estimating processor value units," the following
   note was added:
   
   "Tip: If you fail to obtain PVU information from a client node
   that is running on a Linux operating system, ensure that
   Common Inventory Technology is installed on that client node.
   After installing Common Inventory Technology, obtain a new PVU
   estimate."
   
   
   Affected platforms: Linux.
