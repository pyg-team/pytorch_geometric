PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is closed as RET for insufficient documentation.
   This problem is described as follows:
     1. We received the large data set from the customer which
        caused the ABENDB37 on receive command of the TSO, when
        trying to send the data set using the ISPF on VM.
     2. ISPF support(L2 & L3), along with L2 IEBCOPY used the same
        data set, submitted by the customer using VM and sent it
        to the appropriate TSO userid.  We were able to receive
        the data set successfully with the TSO receive command.
     3. We were not able to recreate the problem nor determine root
        cause with the provided data set.
   We will need the information built and sent by VM ISPF before
   it was received and processed by TSO. TSO will need the dump
   of the ABENDB37 to determine the reason for the failure.
   TSO level/2 will need to anlyze the dump of the ABENDB37 first
   prior to ISPF L2 for problem determination.
