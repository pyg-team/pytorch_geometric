Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My License Manager is configured to generate a usage log file. How do I use this file to analyze license usage of my concurrent/network clients? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following provides a process for converting a License Manager usage log file to a SPSS Statistics data file that can be used for analysis. 

It is not necessary for the files to be located in 'C:\LM_LOG'. 

However, the 'Log_File_To_Statistics_Data.sps' file assumes this is the location.

If a location other than 'C:\LM_LOG' is used, change the location of the 'slm_log.txt' file indicated in the following syntax command in the 'Log_File_To_Statistics_Data.sps' file:

/FILE="C:\LM_LOG\slm_log.txt"


 1.  Create the following directory: C:\LM_LOG 
 2.  Save attached syntax file 'Log_File_To_Statistics_Data.sps' (below) to C:\LM_LOG. 
 3.  Acquire location and name of License Manager usage log file (example: slm_log.txt). 
 4.  Copy the License Manager usage log file to log file conversion directory C:\LM_LOG. 
 5.  IF usage log file is not named 'slm_log.txt' change the file name to 'slm_log.txt' 
 6.  IF the location of the 
 7.  Open SPSS Statistics. 
 8.  Open SPSS Statistics syntax file 'Log_File_To_Statistics_Data.sps' in SPSS Statistics. 
 9.  Select the 'Run' menu. 
 10. Select the 'All' menu entry. 
 11. The data from the License Manager usage log will converted to a Statistics data file allowing data analysis of License Manager usage. 
 12. Select 'Value Labels' under the 'View' menu to see the value labels.

Date 
This variable indicates the day of month the license transaction occurred. 

Year

ProdVer 
This variable indicates the product version. 
Product version information is displayed in 'vX0' or 'vXX0' format where X represents the one-digit version number and XX represents the two-digit version number. 

Examples: 

A value of 'v40' would indicate version 4 of the product indicated in the 'Feature Code' (FCode) variable. 
A value of 'v240' would indicate version 24 of the product indicated in the 'Feature Code (FCode) variable. 

TranType 
This variable indicates the type of license transaction that occurred. The possible transaction values are 'issued' 'returned','denied', 'checkout' and 'checkin'. A value of 'denied' indicates a licensing request was made for a product version of feature for which no more licenses were available at the time of the request. The values 'checkout' and 'checkin' indicate commuter licenses checked out and checked in. 

LicInUse 
This variable indicates the number of licenses that were in use when after the license transaction (issued/denied/returned). 

TimeInUse 
This variable indicates the length of time, in seconds, that a license was in use. 

UserName 
This variable indicates the network user name associated the license transaction. 

HostName 
This variable indicates the network identifier of the client host machine associated with the license transaction. 

LMVer
