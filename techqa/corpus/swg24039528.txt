CHANGE HISTORY
 Version 9.0.2 includes a variety of fixes and performance enhancements, as well as the following new features: 


Improved stability and memory management 
The DAST engine process was separated from AppScan's main process. Together with additional memory management and recovery enhancements, this has improved AppScan's stability and robustness, and enables it to cope with bigger and more complex applications. 

Starting URL is tested during configuration 
When you enter a Starting URL (either in the Wizard or the Scan Configuration dialog box), AppScan attempts to connect to the URL and indicates whether or not the attempt is successful. This enables you to troubleshoot connection issues, or an incorrect URL, before you start the scan. If the problem can be corrected with a configuration change, AppScan suggests what change is needed and links to the appropriate view in the Configuration dialog box. 

Improved login recorder 
The redesigned login recorder validates your login sequence as you record your login, to help ensure the recording provides AppScan with the information it needs. Offers improved "in-session pattern" identification, and suggestions on how to improve the login recording where it is not sufficient. 

Improved Blind SQL Injection validation 
More accurate identification of Blind SQL Injection vulnerability, with fewer false positive results, has been achieved by now sending tests in single-thread mode when the possibility of vulnerability is identified.

Improved malware detection 
Improved detection of links to possible malware or other unwanted external links. 

Improved error page detection 
Better identification of custom error pages during automatic scanning, improving scan accuracy. 

Unsigned extensions are no longer loaded by default 
Official IBM extensions are now signed. When AppScan opens, it now verifies that enabled extensions are signed, and does not load unsigned ones. In Extension Manager, a new Trust button appears next to enabled extensions that are unsigned, allowing you to manually set them as "trusted" (see Extension Manager). 

DISA STIG Regulatory Compliance Report 
The report now sorts results by category, so you can easily access results in any particular category. The separate DISA STIG Category 1 Report has been removed.

Deprecated in 9.0.2:
Support for interactive installation of the glass box agent for Java using the command line is deprecated as of this version and the capability will be removed in the next major release.
