Title: IBM Installing the SAP server components for IBM InfoSphere Pack for SAP Applications version 8.0.0.3 - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I install the SAP server components for IBM InfoSphere Pack for SAP Applications version 8.0.0.3? 

CAUSE
The components are updated relative to versions 8.0.0.0 (technote 1969048 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969048]), 8.0.0.1 (technote 1991756 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991756]) and 8002 (technote 2000882 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22000882]). A new set of SAP transports are delivered. The new version 8.0.0.3 objects override the original objects delivered in version 8.0.0.0 - 8.0.0.2

ANSWER
Note the older Pack versions (7.0 or 7.1) are not compatible with the new SAP objects delivered by these transports, as they use different names. Previous 8.0 versions (8.0.0.0, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2) can be used with these objects, but it's strongly recommended to only use version 8.0.0.3 for this purpose. 

Version 8.0.0.3 restores inter-version transport compatibility, which was affected in version 8.0.0.2 (technote 2002083 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002083]): the objects are now able to co-exist on the same SAP Server with the objects of Pack version 7.0.0.0 and 7.1.0.0, allowing the older versions to be used concurrently with the new version when connecting to the same SAP Server.

Installation procedure
In addition to installing the Client and Server components of the Pack on the Information Server tiers, you also need to install the following components on your SAP system. The components are delivered as SAP transport request files, available in the Windows installation media, folder ISPackForSAP\RFC.

Step 1: Uploading the transport request files 

To import the transport request files, you must first copy them to a directory on the SAP system. 

Procedure 
 1. Log on to the SAP system as a system administrator. 
 2. Copy the transport files provided on the installation medium to the /usr/sap/trans/cofiles and /usr/sap/trans/data folders respectively on the SAP system. The original location of the transport files depends on the SAP version: SAP version Path on installation media for Windows ERP 6.0 up to and including EHP6, Unicode ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/ERP6/EHP6 ERP 6.0 EHP7 - EHP8, Unicode
    S/4HANA, on-premise edition 1511, 1610 ISPackForSAP/RFC/unicode/ERP6/EHP7-EHP8 


Step 2: Importing the transport request files 

The SAP administrator can import the transport request files by using one of the following methods: 

Option 1. Importing the transport request files by using the Transport Management System 

Procedure 
 1.  Log on to the SAP system using the SAP GUI as the SAP administrator. 
 2.  Create the development class (package) ZETL with the transport route definition for your environment. You can use transaction SE80 to do this. 
 3.  Enter the transaction STMS. 
 4.  Click Overview > Imports. 
 5.  Double-click the current SID in the Queue column. 
 6.  Click Extras > Other Requests > Add. 
 7.  Select the transport request ID for your SAP system configuration (see the table below) and click Continue. 
 8.  Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the other transport requests. 
 9.  Select the transport request in the import queue and click Request > Import. 
 10. Enter the Client number. 
 11. On the Options tab, set the options Overwrite Originals and Ignore Invalid Component Version (if available) - see screenshot below. 
 12. You may also set these options to make it easier to re-import the transports at a later time: Leave Transports Requests in Queue for Later Import and Import Transport Requests Again. 
 13. Click Continue. 
 14. Repeat steps 9 - 13 for each transport request. 
 15. Verify that the function module and authorization roles were imported successfully by using any appropriate transactions such as SE80 and SU01.


Option 2: Importing the transport request files at the operating system level 

Procedure 
 1. Log on to the SAP system using the SAP GUI as the SAP administrator. 
 2. Create the development class (package) ZETL with the transport route definition for your environment. You can use transaction SE80 to do this. 
 3. Log on to the SAP system as a system administrator. 
 4. Add the appropriate requests to the import buffer by running the following command:
    tp addtobuffer <transport request> <SID>
    For example:
    tp addtobuffer IB1K903958 DD1 
 5. Import the transport requests by running the following command:
    tp import <transport request> <SID> client=<NNN> U1238
    where <NNN> is the client number. For example:
    tp import IB1K903958 DD1 client=800 U1238
    Note: the addition U1238 indicates to set the options shown at steps 11, 12 in Option 1; the numbers indicate the corresponding option order number in the SAP GUI (see screenshot below), which may vary by system, therefore this addition may need to be adjusted by your SAP administrator. 
 6. Verify that the function module and authorization roles were imported successfully by using any appropriate transactions such as SE80 and SU01.

Downgrading the SAP server components 
To downgrade the SAP components from Pack version 8.0.0.3 to lower versions (like 8.0.0.2 or earlier) follow this procedure:  1. Import the transports corresponding to the downgrade version (refer to the above section to import the transports, following exactly the transport import options) 
 2. Delete the structure ZETLSTR_V8_X and tables ZETLTRSF_V8_X, ZETLTRSFX_V8_X manually to completely remove version 8003 components


Procedure to delete structures and tables in SAP:  1. Log on to the SAP system using the SAP Logon GUI application as an SAP administrator user 
 2. Go to transaction code SE11. Provide the name of table or structure. Then click on delete button in menu to delete, confirming any prompts.
