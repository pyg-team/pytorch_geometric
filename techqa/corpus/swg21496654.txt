PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITM events with CRITICAL severity are seen in the OMNIbus Event desktop with severity of Indeterminate. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ITM integration component comes with a updated rules file tivoli_eif.rules to replace the default one that comes with the EIF probe. Please refer to the ITM Installation and Setup Guide under "Setting up event forwarding to Netcool/OMNIbus" for more details on configuring the EIF probe.

Restart the probe after updating the rules file for the changes to take effect.
