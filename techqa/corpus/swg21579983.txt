PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere® Message Broker generates a warning that the WebSphere® Transformation Extender (WTX) dtxwmqi.lil file cannot be loaded. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review Message Broker syslog file and search for a message similar to: 


user:warn|warning WebSphere Broker v6109[2142450]: (DEFAULT_WMB61_BRK)[1]BIP2284W: The user plug-in node LIL library 'dtxwmqi.lil' in directory '/opt/IBM/wtx/wmqi' cannot be loaded because another version of the same user plug-in node has already been loaded from a different directory. : MSGBPMM2_BRK.ff1d21a9-2a01-0000-0080-e993bdb7eee5: /build/S610_P/src/DataFlowEngine/ImbMain.cpp: 985: ImbMain::start: :


 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have multiple Execution Groups that include WTX Nodes, then this is only a warning. The Message Flows will still function properly. 

This warning indicates that multiple Execution Groups contain WTX Nodes and another Execution Group has already loaded the required dtxwmqi.lil file 

Note that the version of Message Broker and the path to the WTX dtxwmqi.lil file will vary based on your installation and versions installed.
