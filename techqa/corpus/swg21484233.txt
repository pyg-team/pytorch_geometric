2. Select SPSS Platform Server (PES 3.0) or PASW Platform Server (PASW 4.0) from the list of available services.

3. Set the Startup Type to Automatic. This allows the repository to start when the system boots.

3. Click Stop to halt the service.
Note: It may take several minutes for the server and its components to completely stop.



To start JBOSS in Console Mode:

1. Go to the root of the PES or PASW C&DS installation directory.
