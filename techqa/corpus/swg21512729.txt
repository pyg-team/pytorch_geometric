Title: IBM Can we remove world-writable permissions - global write permission - United States

Text:
World writeable TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Setup a recurring process to remove world-writable from the files and directories: chmod o-w. We are not planning to delete any files. Would this impact functionality ? 

ANSWER
The question is whether or not it is safe to remove world-writable for these files and directories. Some of them are dynamic and will be re-created with world-writable after reboot. For these we would like to remove world-writable on a recurring basis. 

/export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS Directory-Only /export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS/log Directory-Only /export/opt/IBM/tivoli/tip/derby/TTSS/seg0 Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc/wscanhw Directory-Only /opt/tivoli/cit/cache_data Directory-Only /tmp/javasharedresources Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT/logs Directory-Only /var/.com.zerog.registry.xml File /var/ibm/common/acsi/resourceBundleLocation Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos Directory-Only /usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos/* File /usr/ibm/tivoli Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common Directory-Only /usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT Directory-Only 
Answer: 

DB2 is OK confirmed by DB2 support 
# Revoke world-writable from recurring DB2 log files 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/export/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/sqllib/db2dump/stmmlog/stmm.*.log 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/tklmdb2/NODE0000/TKLMDB/.SQLCRT.FLG 
/bin/chmod o-w 
/opt/IBM/home/tklmdb2/tklmdb2/NODE0000/TKLMDB/*/.SQLCRT.FLG 

Tested removing world-writable permissions on DB2 and it is OK. 

None of these files are TKLM specific. 

Some of these directories do not belong to TIP. 

CIT Files TKLM V2 doesn't have them: 
/opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc Directory-Only 
/opt/tivoli/cit/bin/etc/wscanhw Directory-Only 
/opt/tivoli/cit/cache_data Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/tivoli/common/CIT/logs Directory-Only 

Changed the permissions on those files. Everything looked OK: create a master keystore. create an LTO device. create a key, backup and restore, and apply a fixpack. 

Non-DE 
/tmp/javasharedresources Directory-Only 
/var/.com.zerog.registry.xml File Can be deleted 
DE related files 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs Directory-Only 
/var/ibm/common/acsi/resourceBundleLocation Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos Directory-Only 
/usr/ibm/common/acsi/repos/persistSVCRepos/* File 
** Remove world writable permissions from DE directories. This will not impact functionality. 

It is OK to change the global write permission on above directories and files.
