APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Multiple responsive toolkit coach date pickers on the same page
   causes the last date picker to grab focus, regardless of what
   else is on the page.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Each date picker fires the focus event and tries to set the
   focus onto itself. When multiple inline date pickers are on the
   same page, the last date picker that loads last retains the
   focus. The focus was added for accessibility and was intended
   for the OnClick mode, where the date picker loads in another
   window.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that removes the focus event for inline date picker.
