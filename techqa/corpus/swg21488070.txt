Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with Statistics 18.0.3 or version 19.0.0 and created some tables in the viewer which I would like to export into an existing Excel 2003 workbook containing formulas. However, when I run my OUTPUT EXPORT syntax command to overwrite my existing Excel file I receive the error below:

Error message: 'Cannot create this file. Please verfiy the correct file name was given.'

The formula I use is not complex, it is a IF formula like in this example: if(A2>A3;1;0). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available. The issue is resolved in IBM SPSS Statistics 20.


As a workaround for earlier releases please download the following zip file from Apache.org:
http://archive.apache.org/dist/poi/release/bin/poi-bin-3.0.1-FINAL-20070705.zip [http://archive.apache.org/dist/poi/release/bin/poi-bin-3.0.1-FINAL-20070705.zip]

Log in as Administrator on the computer where you have the export issue. 
In the zip file you will find a jar file named poi-3.0.1-FINAL-20070705.jar. Extract it to a temporary folder on your computer and rename it to poi-3.0.1.jar. 
Close all Statistics 18.0.3 or 19.0.0 instances and navigate to the installation directory of Statistics 18.0.3.
Rename the existing file poi-3.0.1.jar to poi-3.0.1.orig and copy the other poi-3.0.1.jar file from your temporary directory into the Statistics 18.0.3 installation directory.
Start Statistics 18.0.3 and perform your export into an existing Excel workbook with formula again, it will work without any issues.
