Title: IBM SEAS cannot connect to SI after upgrading SI to version 5.2.6.3 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading SI to verssion 5.2.6.3 the SEAS custom exit that connects to SI on baseport+1 gets a handshake failure. 

SYMPTOM
In the seas.log file you will see this error: 

ERROR com.sterlingcommerce.component.authentication.impl.SIUserAuthExit - Could not connect to https://localhost:30001/ws/interop/InteropHttpServlet: [https://localhost:30001/ws/interop/InteropHttpServlet:] Received fatal alert: handshake_failure


CAUSE
Sterling Integrator version 5.2.6.3 now defaults to TLSv1.2 for the baseport+1 port. Prior to this version the default was TLSv1. SEAS still defaults to TLSv1.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the SI security.properties back to TLSv1. 


Change the SSL/TLS versions configured in SI which will be used for the baseport+1 at the SI properties:
