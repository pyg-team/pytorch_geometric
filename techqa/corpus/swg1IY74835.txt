APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to open Dead Letter Queue in Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal, the user received a 2035-Not_Authorized error.  This
   error only occurred to user ids with trailing 0s, such as ABC00.
   The 0s were truncated before being sent to the MQ agent.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Work Around: Avoid using user ids with trailing 0s.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When trying to perform secured operations in Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal, the user receives a 2035-Not_Authorized error.  This
   error only occurs to user ids with trailing 0s, such as ABC00.
   The 0s were truncated before being sent to the MQ agent.
   This problem can occur with any application using the
   encryptedLogonUserId symbol to pass a userid to a secured
   function.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Logic was changed to bracket user ids with blanks before
   scrambline to prevent trailing and leading zeros from being
   dropped from userids as they are passed from client to server.
   The problem is fixed in cnp195 fixpack 5 and ITM6.1 fixpack 1.
