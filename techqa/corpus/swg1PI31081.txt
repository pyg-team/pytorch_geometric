PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of File Manager DB2 component      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 1. Various usability issues specific to *
   *                      the File Manager DB2 template editor.   *
   *                      2. Provide an option to immediately     *
   *                      discard unsaved changes to a template   *
   *                      when the CANCEL command is issued.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   The usability issues/enhancements are listed below:
   1. On an 80-character display only, the field width
   for entering data values is 27 characters, which may be
   inadequate for some data values.
   The field width is increased to 41-54 characters.
   2. On an 80-character display only, the field width for DB2
   column names is 35 characters, which exceeds the maximum allowed
   for a DB2 column name (30 characters).  The display width is
   changed to 8-30 characters.
   3. In File Manager Base and DB2 components,
   provide an option to enable the cancel key - when pressed
   within the template editor with changes pending
    - to exit directly, rather than displaying a confirmation
    pop-up panel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  File Manager DB2 component has been enhanced to improve the
   usability of the template editor.
