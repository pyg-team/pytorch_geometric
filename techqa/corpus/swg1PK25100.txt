 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the version 6.1 of the Update Installer (UPDI)
   to update WebSphere 6.0.2.x with a Fix Pack that includes
   modifySetupCmdLineForRemoveUSER_INSTALL_ROOTCheck.ant,
   the update process returns a status of PARTIALSUCCESS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use version 6.0.x of the UpdateInstaller to install the
   fix pack rather than than version 6.1.x of the
   UpdateInstaller.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users updating a version 6.0.2.x Websphere   *
   *                 Application Server using Update Installer    *
   *                 Version 6.1.                                 *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When using Update Installer (UPDI)      *
   *                      V6.1, to update WebSphere 6.0.2.x an    *
   *                      underlying ANT script fails.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update Installer V6.0.x can be used rather   *
   *                 than V6.1 or a fixpack including an          *
   *                 updated version of this file can             *
   *                 be used.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   When using Update Installer(UPDI)V6.1 with fixpacks containing
   APAR PK10233, the update is not successful due to
   an incompatibility with an underlying ANT script, and
   the version of ANT used with UPDI V6.1.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The updated ANT script is now compatible with both version 6.0
   and version 6.1 of the Update Installer.
   This fix is targetted for fixpack 6.0.2.11.
