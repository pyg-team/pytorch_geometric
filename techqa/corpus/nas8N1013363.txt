PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document discusses message CWBDB0040 being displayed when attempting a data transfer to/from the IBM i and how to resolve the problem. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem 

It is possible that an attempt to run a Data Transfer to or from the IBM i may fail with the following message: 

SQL system error has occurred.
Code: CWBDB0040: The Database Access catalog information server returned an error.

It was found that the QZDAPKG system SQL package in QGPL was unusable. 

Resolution

The way to recover is to delete the QZDAPKG SQL package.

When you are ready to shut down the database server (this is something you may not be able to do during business hours), run the following commands to delete the QZDAPKG SQL package and to restart all jobs:

ENDHOSTSVR *DATABASE
ENDPJ QUSRWRK QZDASOINIT *IMMED
ENDPJ QUSRWRK QZDASSINIT *IMMED
ENDPJ QSERVER QZDAINIT *IMMED
DLTSQLPKG QGPL/QZDAPKG
