QUESTION
After enabling Domino Domain Monitoring (DDM), what are the additional server tasks can I expect to start running on my BM® Lotus® Domino®? 

ANSWER
The following server tasks will run as needed when specific events or DDM probes are enabled. 

RMEval (Resource Model Evaluation) will run automatically when server operating system probes are enabled. 




ISPY(runjava) will run automatically.



To see what enabled probe(s) might be causing ISPY to run automatically, issue the following command at the Domino server console:



sh sched -ddm 

 

The console output will report what probe is enabled and what is using the ISPY task.
