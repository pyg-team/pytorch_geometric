Title: IBM Unable to configure Guardium S-TAP due to error 'ini: The string parameter hunt is missing in section TAP.' - United States

Text:
Guardium; S-TAP; stap; string mssing; hunt; NULL; GUARD-01; configuration TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to configure S-TAP from a S-TAP control view in the GUI the following error is thrown on the DB server and visible in the S-TAP event log:
'GUARD-01: Cant read inifile /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_tap.
ini: The string parameter hunt is missing in section TAP. Reverting to /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_tap.ini.bak' 

SYMPTOM
When submitting configuration changes to the S-TAP the changes appear to have submitted correctly. However, once the S-TAP configuration window is refreshed the configurations go back to the original state. 

To confirm this is the issue effecting the S-TAP check the S-TAP Events by clicking the "i" icon in the S-TAP control:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21691001&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21691001&aid=1]

If the following error 'GUARD-01: Cant read inifile /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_tap.ini: The string parameter hunt is missing in section TAP. Reverting to /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_tap.ini.bak" shows in the S-TAP Events then you will need to use the resolution below. 

This issue will also effect guardapi S-TAP configuration changes in the same way. Configuration changes will not be stored.


CAUSE
The S-TAP relies on a configuration that can no longer be supplied from the Guardium GUI. This is due to the S-TAP being an older version than the appliance. 
The S-TAP should be on a similar build number to the Guardium appliance and the same Guardium version.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem the S-TAP must be updated to the latest version or the same version as the appliance. Below are the instructions to do so:
