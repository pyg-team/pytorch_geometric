QUESTION
 How can you set a trace level for a silent or GUI installation of a TWS v9.x Master Domain Manager (MDM), Backup Manager (BKM), Dynamic Domain Manager (DDM), or Dynamic Workload Console (DWC) that uses Installation Manager (IM)? 

CAUSE
When an installation failure occurs it is sometimes difficult to follow the default log files.

ANSWER
The trace level can be set for a Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) 9.x MDM, BKM, DDM, or DWC fresh installation or Fix Pack installation if Installation Manager (IM) has already been installed. 

Procedure: 

1. Login as root. 

2. cd /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs 

3. vi log.properties 

Add one line to the file: 

 com.ibm.tws=DEBUG 

4. Launch the installation.

For a silent installation, the extra logging will write to stdout. 

For a GUI installation the extra detail will be written to the latest file in this directory: /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs/
