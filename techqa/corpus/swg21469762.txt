ITCAM; J2EE; WAS; 64-bit Linux; GUI Installer TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Version 6.1 ITCAM for J2EE and ITCAM for WebSphere installer bundles and uses a 32-bit JRE to start GUI installer. On a 64-bit Linux OS, sometimes, the X11 libraries required by 32-bit JRE are not present so the GUI installer fails to start. 

SYMPTOM
After issuing setup_DC_lin.bin from DC installation directory, you may get following error message: 

"The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag."



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Perform silent installation. 

2. You can use 64-bit JDK/JRE to start GUI installer if 64-bit JDK/JRE is already installed on your machine, switch to DC installation directory and issue:

setup_DC_lin.bin -is:javahome $JDK_HOME

Note that $JDK_HOME is 64-bit JDK installation directory 

 

3. If 64-bit JDK/JRE is not present on your machine, follow steps below to downlaod and use 64-bit JDK/JRE to start GUI installer:

1) Download 64-bit IBM Java 1.4.2 JDK for your processor type at:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html]

2) Install 64-bit IBM Java 1.4.2 JDK to your machine, for example,

rpm -ivh IBMJava2-AMD64-142-SDK-1.4.2-13.8.x86_64.rpm

3) Switch to DC installation directory and issue:

setup_DC_lin.bin -is:javahome $JDK_HOME

For example,

setup_DC_lin.bin -is:javahome /opt/IBMJava2-amd64-142
