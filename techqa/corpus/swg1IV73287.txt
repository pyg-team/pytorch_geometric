APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR covers changes to the WebSphere MQ Queue Manager to
   disallow the use of CipherSpecs which
   specify cryptographic algorithms or protocols that are now
   considered to be
   broken or weak.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This affects users of WebSphere MQ 7.0.1, 7.1 and 7.5 who are
   using SSL/TLS security on queue manager channels.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In line with industry security guidelines and research,
   WebSphere MQ now considers the following CipherSpecs to be weak:
   
   RC4_SHA_US
   RC4_MD5_US
   TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US
   DES_SHA_EXPORT1024
   RC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024
   RC4_MD5_EXPORT
   RC2_MD5_EXPORT
   DES_SHA_EXPORT
   TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   NULL_SHA
   NULL_MD5
   FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CipherSpecs identified in the list above will no longer be
   permitted by default when initiating MQ channels.
   
   Attempting to start a channel instance using one of these
   CipherSpecs will result in AMQ9635, AMQ9773 (7.0.1 only) or
   AMQ9788 (7.1 and 7.5 only) messages in the queue manager's error
   log.
   
   
   If a return to the previous behavior is required, the
   CipherSpecs may be re-enabled within the SSL stanza of the
   qm.ini file as follows:
   
   SSL:
      AllowWeakCipherSpec=Yes
   
   
   
   Alternatively, these CipherSpecs may be re-enabled by setting or
   exporting the following environment variable to any value:
   
   AMQ_SSL_WEAK_CIPHER_ENABLE
   
   The variable should be set/exported within the environment used
   to start the queue manager. Defining this environment variable
   enables the CipherSpecs regardless of the value specified in the
   qm.ini file.
