Text:
5724V09ORTR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On Unix platform the ITCAM Extended Oracle agent instance fails to start with error KCIIN0201E. 

SYMPTOM
The Extended Oracle agent instance has been configured but fails to start, error "KCIIN0201E Specified product is not configured... " is reported.

$ITMHOME/bin/itmcmd agent -o inst1 start rz 
------Standard Error------- 
CandleAgent : installer level 623 / 100. 
CandleAgent : running sol283 jre. 
------Standard Output------- 
Processing. Please wait... 
Starting Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database Extended ... 
KCIIN0201E Specified product is not configured... 


CAUSE
The file $ITMHOME/config/.ConfigData/krzenv is missing entries for the instance.

ENVIRONMENT
Unix

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1) Verify that configuration directory ($ITMHOME/config) has following configuration files for the instance. 
<host>_rz_<inst>.cfg and rz_<inst>.config 




Also check that the the user starting the agent has permission to read these files. 


2) Open the $ITMHOME/config/.ConfigData/krzenv file and check if entries for the instance name exist. 
For example entries such as the following for instance name inst1 (There are many such entries for each agent instance) :
inst1|INSTANCE|inst1
inst1|INSTANCE_host1_inst1

If such entries are not present for the instance name, then the resolution of this technote should be applied.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Reconfigure the agent to add the instance entries to the $ITMHOME/config/.ConfigData/krzenv file and then restart the agent. 

$ITMHOME/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1 rz 

OR
2) If another Extended Oracle agent instance is starting successfully from the same ITM home, you can manually copy the entries for this instance to create entries for the missing instance. 

Back up the $ITMHOME/config/.ConfigData/krzenv file before editing. Check for editing errors such as incorrectly typed instance name in the added entries. 

Restart the agent instance.
