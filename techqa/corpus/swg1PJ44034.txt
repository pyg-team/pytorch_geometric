APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Create a new Workflow Event Action named "Workflow Event Action"
   (ACCE > Object Store > Events, Actions, Processes > Event Action
   - New) if one does not exist.
   Close the tab for the Event Action that you just created.
   Create a new Event Action and name it "Workflow Event Action
   Dup" > Next then check the Workflow checkbox > Next > Finish.
   Open the Event Action and change Display Name to "Workflow Event
   Action" > Save > Close.
   
   Actual behavior:  ACCE allows you to rename an Event Action to
   the same name as another Event Action.
   Expected behavior: ACCE should not allow you to rename an Event
   Action to a duplicate name.   FEM in 5.2.0 does not allow this
   action.
   
   ACCE will hang on the Event Subscription workflow tab if any
   Event Action name is not unique.
