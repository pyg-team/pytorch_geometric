 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After migration from DB2 Information Integrator for Content V8.3 to V8.4, the IBM CommonStore for SAP server does not start and shows the following exception in the console window of archpro:

Caught unexpected exception in agent: com/ibm/mm/sdk/common/dkDatastore (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)

How can I avoid this startup problem? 

CAUSE
IBM CommonStore for SAP V8.3 uses version 1.4.2 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The Content Manager connector for DB2 Information Integrator for Content V8.4 that provides the DB2 Content Manager library server API for the IBM CommonStore for SAP Content Manager agent uses version 1.5 of the JRE.
This mismatch of JRE versions causes the startup problem.


ANSWER
Both the IBM CommonStore for SAP V8.3 Content Manager agent and the DB2 Information Integrator for Content V8.4 Content Manager connector need to use the same JRE version. 

 1. Open the IBM CommonStore for SAP server profile (default: archint.ini) in the instance directory of your installation. 
 2. Add the following general keyword and the complete path to the Java binary of the DB2 Information Integrator for Content Version 8.4 installation, where java_binary_path is the path.
    
    JAVARUNTIME 'java_binary_path'
    
    This is an example for Windows: JAVARUNTIME 'c:\Program Files\IBM\db2cmv8\java\jre\bin\java' 
    
 3. Restart your IBM CommonStore for SAP server instance.
