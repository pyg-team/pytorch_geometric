Title: IBM The orchestration invokes the web service but receiving the following error 'Unable to send the SOAP request' with Cast Iron - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The orchestration invokes the web service but receiving the following error 'Unable to send the SOAP request' 

CAUSE
The error message can be received because the Cast Iron orchestration did not get the acknowledgement from the Web server. The web service Invoke is considered complete once the Invoke activity receives the acknowledgement from the server. If it does not get the acknowledgement, the activity errors with a "time out exception"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the 'Connection time out value' for the 'Invoke service' activity. Invoke the web service using a third party tool to assess the time-out value.
