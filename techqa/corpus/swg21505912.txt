PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The NET USE command, net use * \\targetcomputer\admin$ /user:domain\user password, can be used to tell you what kind of error the Client Deploy Tool is running into with the computers. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The NET USE command, net use * \\targetcomputer\admin$ /user:domain\user password, can be used to tell you what kind of error the Client Deploy Tool is running into with the computers. 

In the Client Deploy Tool if you get a message saying "Offline" typically with NET USE you get the following error: 

Error: System error 53 has occurred. The network path was not found. 
Meaning: Machine cannot be contacted.

In the Client Deploy Tool if you get a message saying "Connection Failed" with NET USE you get one of the following:

Error: System error 53 has occurred. The network path was not found. 
Meaning: ADMIN$ share not available.

Error: System error 1219 has occurred. Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again.
Meaning: If the machine used to run the Client Deployment Tool already has a connection to remote machine ADMIN$ share, using a different credential, this error will occur.

Error: System error 1311 has occurred. There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. 
Meaning: Domain server not available for authentication.

Error: System error 1326 has occurred. Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password. 
Meaning: Incorrect admin username or password.

If you receive " Access is Denied" with net use you will get the following error:

Error: System error 5 has occurred. Access is denied. 
Meaning: Username/password correct, but account does not have permission to ADMIN$ share.

Error: No network provider accepted the given network path. 
Meaning:the client or the server could not be resolved during the client deploy tool process.

Check to be sure the RPC service is running.

Check DNS and FQDN resolution. If DNS is broken so that the netbios name or the FQDN do not resolve, or resolve to different IP addresses than expected, the client deploy tool will not work. You may be able to troubleshoot this by trying to

From the client: 
ping the client deploy tool server by netbios name
ping the client deploy tool server by FQDN

From the deploy tool server: 
ping the client by netbios name
ping the client by FQDN 

The destination computer in each of the ping tests should resolve to both the expected computer and the expected IP address.

What can also work is try to install the client by using the IP address. If using an IP address works, it is likely the issue is DNS related. 

Some common Network Path Errors and some sample solutions.
"Network path not found" in a domain network 1
"Network path not found" in a domain network 2
"Network path not found" in a workgroup network - error 53
No network provider accepted the given network path

"Network path not found" in a domain network 1

SYMPTOMS: When trying to join a W2K/XP to a Windows 2000 domain by using he NetBIOS domain name, you are successful but not the FQDN and you may receive one of the following error messages:1) The following error occurred attempting to join domain "example.com": The network location cannot be reached. For information about network troubleshooting, see Windows Help. 2) Network path not found. 

RESOLUTION: This issue may occur if the TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service is not running on the client computer. To start the TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service, go to MMS>Services, double-click TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service. 

"Network path not found" in a domain network 2

Symptom: some w2k/xp can't join the domain randomly. The DNS server is multihomed server.

Resolution: You can find some computer browser errors on the DNS server. Disable one of two NICs will work.

"Network path not found" in a workgroup network - error 53

RESOLUTIONS: 
1) Make sure that File and Printer Sharing is enabled on on the shared computer. 
2) Make sure that shared machine has something shared. 
3) Make sure that you have created the same workgroup and logon the same username if you try to access w2k/xp network. 
4) Make sure that you have enabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP if this is a mixed OS network.
