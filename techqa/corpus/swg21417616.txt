QUESTION
 How do you improve performance of IBM Rational Development Platform products including Rational Software Architect, Rational Software Modeler and Rational Method Composer? 

ANSWER
Consult the following articles on Tips that affect performance: 

Rational Application Developer Performance Tips [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/05/517_radtip/] March 2006

In addition you may try the following tips:

Note: These instructions are tailored for the Rational Software Architect product but are similar for all other Rational Development Platform products.


 1. Recreate the workspace:  * Delete or rename the file .metadata inside the workspace folder. 
     * Restart Rational Software Architect, import your projects to the fresh workspace and test to see if the performance improved. 
     * You may also create a new workspace for that project only and import your project to it. 
       
       
    
    
 2. If the workspace used is on a network drive, create a new workspace folder locally, open and use it to check if the performance improves. 
    
    
 3. Run Rational Software Architect with -clean.
    Append -clean option to the end of the path of the application shortcut Target. Remember to remove the option or the shortcut once the test is done.
    
    Note: When running the application with -clean, it will be slow to start and may take a few minutes for the splash screen to end. 
    
    
 4. Look for the eclipse.ini file inside Rational Software Architect install folder such as:
    
    C:\Program...\IBM\SDP75
    
    Backup the file.  * Open the file in notepad.
       
     * If the -Xmx value is less than 1024, modify the -Xmx value to (something similar to) -Xmx 1024m
       
       You may set the -Xmx to a higher value depending on the amount of physical memory (RAM) on your computer. 
       
       However, if the value is too high the application will throw a starting of JVM Exit Code = 1 error in which case you need to lower the value till the application starts without errors. 
       
       
    
    
 5. Check the box for "Show Heap Status"
    In Rational Software Architect for example, there will be a garbage can icon that shows on the bottom right of the application. Click on the icon to delete garbage.
    
    
 6. Manually clean the java cache:
    
    Delete the java cache:

 * Go to the folder: 
   C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Application Data\javasharedresources 
 * Windows 7: 


C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Application Data\Application Data\javasharedresources 
Note: To see the folder, you may have to modify the Organize>Folder and search options>View> uncheck the "Hide protected operating system files".Manually clean the java cache: 
 *  Delete the file inside that folder The file has a name similar to C240D2A32P_IBMSDP_username_G06
   
   The file will be recreated when you reopen Rational Software Architect.

 * 2. If the above steps do not help, provide IBM technical support with the following: 
 *  The .log file from .metadata directory of the workspace folder. A zip of the: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\Installation Manager
