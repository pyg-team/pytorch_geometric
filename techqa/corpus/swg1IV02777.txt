APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
     Windows ONLY . Multiple MSSQL agents installed. May also be
   error if multiple DB2 agents are installed and template is
   used to reconfig  one of the instances.
     Was able to reproduce on ITM 6.2.2 FP2
   and
     ITM 6.2.1 FP4.
   Problem Description:
     When reconfiguring from a template and choosing an instance to
   Edit
     after the edit completes both agent instances are change to
   Auto
     startup no matter what the original settings. This occurs
   during a
     reconfig using the template as the object, selecting the
   instance
     then selecting Edit.
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Choose machine with multiple MSSQL instances installed.
     2. Install MSSQL agent.
     3. Configure both agents from the template.
     4. Use MTEMS to change the startup on one of the agent
   instances from
        Auto to Manual.
     5. Use MTEMS to select the template, right click, select one
   of the
        instances and press edit. You don't have to change
   anything,
        press ok and both agents change their Startup to Auto. The
   one
        that was originally Manual should remain Manual. The one
   that
        was selected should also remain Manual if it was Manual
   before
        the edit.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After the Startup changes, the instance or instances can be
   selected and their startup changed back to Manual.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) agent instances when edited through
   the Template may loose their startup type (Manual or Auto).
   
   When using the Template to Edit values for a Microsoft SQL
   Server (MSSQL) agent instance the startup type will
   automatically be reset to Auto ignoring any setting that a
   customer previously set.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Before the Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) agent configuration exit
   is called the service startup type is captured and saved.  After
   the exit returns and the agent service is rebuilt the original
   value is restored.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
    | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0008
    | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  To work around this problem after the value is overlayed, select
   the agent instance and then set the new startup value in the
   dialog box that is presented.
