APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: The error message reported when JVM fails to load
   a file with .so extension is less descriptive, such as:
   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:
   ClientGatewayMain (A file or directory in the path name does not
   exist.)
   Whereas the error message when JVM fails to load a file with .a
   extension is much more accurate and helpful, such as:
   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:
   ClientGatewayMain (  0509-022 Cannot load module
   ./libClientGatewayMain.a.
   0509-150 Dependent module libACE.so could not be loaded.
   0509-022 Cannot load module libACE.so.
   0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does
   not exist.
   0509-022 Cannot load module ./libClientGatewayMain.a.
   0509-150 Dependent module ./libClientGatewayMain.a could not be
   loaded.)
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Currently there is a difference between the error messages
   reported, when JVM fails to load a .so version of a library and
   a .a version of the same library. If the file has .a extension
   then the error message is much more accurate and helpful
   compared to when the file has .so extension.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR14
   6.0.1 SR6
   7.0.0 SR5
   .
   The JVM has been updated to report a better error description,
   which will help customers to identify why JVM failed to load a
   certain native library on AIX. Following is the error reported
   when JVM fails to load a library with .so extension because it
   is not able to find a dependent module:
   JVMJ9TI001E Agent library agent could not be opened (   0509-022
   Cannot load module ./libagent.so.
           0509-150   Dependent module dummy.exp could not be
   loaded.
           0509-022 Cannot load module dummy.exp.
           0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path
   name does not exist.
           0509-022 Cannot load module ./libagent.so.
           0509-150   Dependent module ./libagent.so could not be
   loaded.)
   JVMJ9VM015W Initialization error for library j9jvmti27(-3):
   JVMJ9VM009E J9VMDllMain failed
