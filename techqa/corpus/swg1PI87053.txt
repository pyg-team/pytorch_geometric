ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You've installed maintenance to RSU/1701.  You start to receive
   RACF message:
   ICH408I USER(  ) GROUP(NOTERM  ) NAME(  )
     LOGON/JOB INITIATION - NOT AUTHORIZED TO TERMINAL CONSOLE1
   
   DFHCE3541  APPLID Security interface error (00000030). Sign-on
   is terminated.
   
   You also see DFHSN1108  APPLID Signon at console CONSOLE1 by
   user USERID has failed.
   
   The trace shows:
   XS FE04 XSSB  *EXC* FUNCTION(INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA)
   RESPONSE(EXCEPTION) REASON(UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE)
   SAF_RESPONSE(8) SAF_REASON(0)
   ESM_RESPONSE(30) ESM_REASON(0) PASSWORD_FAILURES(0)
   
   The problem occurs after the installation of CICS APARs PI62428 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI62428]
   and PI64443 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI64443].
   
   PI62428 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI62428] added POE onto the RACROUTE REQUEST=VERIFYX call made
   by  DFHXSSB to verify the password.  It did not add the SESSION
   parameter to specify the type of the entry port.  The VERIFYX
   call was only ever used when the IRRSPW00 call failed.  In this
   case the pasword is valid so IRRSPW00 would work and the
   VERIFYX call would never get issued. The subsequent VERIFY
   ENVIR=CREATE passes both POE and SESSION and so
   the signon would succeed.
   
   
   PI64443 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI64443] changed DFHXSSB to use the updated version of the
   IRRSPW00 and to set the fast fail option.  This causes the
   first IRRSPW00 call to fail immediately (because there isn't a
   cache entry) and for CICS to use the VERIFYX call to perform
   the valid signon.  This VERIFYX call fails because it passes
   POE but does not pass SESSION and the supplied
   port of entry is a console and not the default of a
   TSO/terminal session.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS signon error accompanied with      *
   *                      messages DFHCE3541 and ICH408I.         *
   ****************************************************************
   A user attempts to signon to CICS at a console.  This user only
   has access via certain consoles and has no access to CICS from
   a regular terminal. The console signon will fail if the user
   currently has a non-zero password failure count.
                                                                  .
   The failure occurs because the POE parameter to the RACROUTE
   REQUEST=VERIFYX call made by DFHXSSB is not accompanied by the
   SESSION parameter.  This causes the external security manager
   manager to use the default SESSION value which is a standard
   TSO terminal session.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS security code has been amended to pass a SESSION parameter
   on the RACROUTE=VERIFYX call from within DFHXSSB.
