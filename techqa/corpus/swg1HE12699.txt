APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Server 1: (cm8demo)
   - ICC 4.0.1 FP2
   - CM 8.5 FP5
   - Domino 9.0.1 FP7
   
   ICC is installed regularily with embedded Web Application
   Server.
   This Web Application on this server is used for searching,
   previewing
   and restoring emails by users.
   
   Server 2 (iccew)
   - WAS 8.5.0.0, 64 bit
   - CM 8.5 FP5
   
   In the above ICC installation with external WAS on a separate
   server,
   client is facing the issue of HE12623 on that external server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround as of now
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ICC Passes the wrong schema name when connecting to the Content
   Manager repository.
   The problem occurs only when Content Manager(CM) repository is
   used, and the custom schema is used i.e. the schema name of CM
   is different from the username. For example, ICMADMINT instead
   of ICMADMIN.
   
   ICC ignores the custom schema name value from ral.properties
   file and passes the username as a schema name. This causes the
   connection failure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1.5 Interim Fix 002
   (4.0.1.5-IBM-ICC-IF002), ICC will pick the appropriate schema
   name value from ral.properties.
