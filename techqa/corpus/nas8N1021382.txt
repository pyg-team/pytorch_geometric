ABSTRACT
 After applying the latest R720 cumulative PTF package, C6127720, PTFs cannot be ordered from the IBM i system using SNDPTFORD, problems cannot be reported, nor will the Electronic Service Agent 
( ESA ) inventory and Performance Management ( PM Agent ) data be sent. 

CONTENT
After applying the latest R720 cumulative PTF package, C6127720, PTFs cannot be ordered from the IBM i system using SNDPTFORD, problems cannot be reported, nor will the Electronic Service Agent 
( ESA ) inventory and Performance Management ( PM Agent ) data be sent. 

SNDPTFORD, SNDSRVRQS and problem reporting will fail with message CPF8C24: Error occurred while processing request. 

For inventory and PM Agent data, message WSWS3713E: Connection to the remote host 129.42.160.51:443 failed.Received the following error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid trust file name of null, is found in the ESA audit log and in the /QIBM/UserData/OS400/UniversalConnection/ecc.stdout file.

The issue is caused by a combination of PTFs SI55346 and SI59129.

Removing PTF SI59129 or applying PTF SI61011 resolves the issue.
For more information, refer to APAR SE64999 / PTF SI61011 [http://www-912.ibm.com/a_dir/as4ptf.nsf/a18db68aae4a7d81862566ba005d145c/5a4908805b8fd1c286257fcc00688f30?OpenDocument&Highlight=2,SI61011]. 
PTF SI61011 supersedes SI55346 and SI56820.

If removing SI59129, pre-requisite PTF SI58784 must be removed too: 
RMVPTF LICPGM(5770SS1) SELECT(SI58784)
RMVPTF LICPGM(5770SS1) SELECT(SI59129)
**NOTE: This will cause the cumulative, SF99720, to show as NOT INSTALLED under WRKPTFGRP.

Once PTF SI61011 is applied, PTFs SI58784 and SI59129 can be reapplied. Applying SI58784 will also apply SI59129:
APYPTF LICPGM(5770SS1) SELECT(SI58784) APYREQ(*YES)

SI61011 is now in the HIPER Group PTF, level 66. This issue will not occur if the latest HIPER group is installed with the cumulative.
