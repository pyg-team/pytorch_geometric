ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity: 3
   Compid: 5725U05UI
   
   APM V8.1.3
   APM Dashboard
   
   Problem Description:
   The problem is caused due to the attribute details page not
   resetting its state before launching into another context. This
   means, if the attribute details page errors out before loading
   its data, then the user will see the data from the previously
   selected agent. This assumption of having data also causes the
   UI to hang on a loading state even though the data query came
   back empty.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Go click on attribute details tab for an agent that is
   properly displaying data
   2. Notice the data is correct for the attribute Viewer
   3. Now switch over to an agent that has been disconnect
   4. Notice that the data displayed for the disconnected agent is
   from the previously selected agent
   
   1. Go click on attribute details tab for a disconnected agent
   2. Notice that nothing will display
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As long as users are aware of which agents they are attempting
   to display data for, this defect should not affect thier work
   flow.
