ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During migration from V8.X to V9.5 the following Database
   Configuration parameters are incorrectly changed to 'AUTOMATIC':
   STMTHEAP
   NUM_IOCLEANERS
   NUM_IOSERVERS
   DFT_PREFETCH_SZ
   MAXAPPLS
   AVG_APPLS
   
   
   This includes migration through 'db2 migrate database <database
   name>' as well as a migration that occurs from a restore from a
   v8.X backup into v9.5.
