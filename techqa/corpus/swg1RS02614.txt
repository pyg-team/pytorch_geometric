LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The cobol xom config file generated from an ODM 8.0 RuleDesigner
   (resources/cobol/CobolXomConfig.xml) includes an attribute
   "marshallerName" which overrides the default name of the
   generated marshaller jar for the cobol xom.This attribute was
   not included in the new cobol xom config file since ODM 8.6.
   This APAR is about re-include the "marshallerName" attribute in
   order to offer the possiblity to configure the filename of the
   generated marshaller.jar.

 *  The code is fixed.
