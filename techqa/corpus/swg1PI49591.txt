ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You installed IBM SPSS Statistics 23 Fixpack 2 Client on for
   example a
   Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10.5) under Japanese System Locale system
   as network
   installation with network license pointing to an existing
   Sentinel License Manager installation (Concurrent Licensing
   Tools 9.5.x)
   The installation went fine. You would like to check out a
   commuter dialog and click on Start - All Programs - SPSS
   Statistics 23 - SPSS Statistics 23 Commuter Utility
   However, although are available licenses are displayed you only
   see garbled Japanese characters on all buttons of the commuter
   Utility dialog.
   The functionality is not affected: You can click on the buttons
   and will be able to check out and check in a commuter license
   but the garbled characters are not readable on Japanese OS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please
   refer to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support. An Interim Fix was
   developed for customers who need the fix prior to the next
   upcoming Fix Pack.
   
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI49591
   and technote # 1971033
   about Interim Fix 004 for Statistics 23.0 FP2 Mac OS X
   platforms.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers. They are normally sent only
   to customers who have reported one of the corrected problems,
   and who require an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not
   address customer enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted testing of specific
   fixes, not full regression testing. If the fix is not urgently
   required, you may prefer to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack
   Release, which will be fully regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
