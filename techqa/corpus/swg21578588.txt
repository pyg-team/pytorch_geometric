Title: IBM FindFingerprint action aborts with error Error finding dclgview.exe! in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture. - United States

Text:
FindFingerprint TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FindFingerprint action aborts with error message "Error finding dclgview.exe!" in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture. 

SYMPTOM
The task or RRS log may contain a message similar or identical to the following: 

Script error in event FormRun : Error finding dclgview.exe!. Aborting.


CAUSE
This error message may be reported in older versions of the IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture software when the FindFingerprint actions runs in an application which contains thousands of fingerprints.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 7.1 SP1 or earlier releases, reduce the number of fingerprints stored in the application and this will limit the number of fingerprints which must be loaded into memory on a given batch. 

 

Please note: This issue is resolved in more recently released versions of the IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture software, where fingerprints consume less memory with an updated CCO.dll. Additionally, with the fingerprint service included in later releases, fingerprints do not have to be loaded for every batch.
