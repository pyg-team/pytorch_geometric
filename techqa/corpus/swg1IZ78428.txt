APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After successfully installing the ITNM-IP 3.8 (GA) data server,
   I installed the ITNM-IP 3.8 web console components on an
   existing TIP server which contains TBSM 4.2 FP1. The installer
   said it was successful. After logging into the TIP console , I
   noticed the following:
   
   * No ITNM-IP related pages or views available
   * No ITNM-IP related roles available
   * Some preexisting navigation items were missing and corrupted
   (e.g.
   Entities)
   I also noted that the porletEntities.xml file was corrupted and
   missing many items compared to the original backup file.
