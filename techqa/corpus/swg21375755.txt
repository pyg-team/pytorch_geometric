Installing Rational Method Composer 7.5 
 1. Extract the six (6) installation files in the first row of the table from C1PG3ML.zip to C1PG8ML.zip in the same directory. 
    In this way you get a single disk1 directory.
    
    A common mistake is to extract each file in a separate directory with the same name as 
    the archive file. This action causes the installation to fail.
    
 2. Open the disk1 directory and start launchpad.exe.
    
 3. Follow the steps of the wizard procedure until the installation finalizes.
