Title: IBM Error: The Client software could not initialize with SPSS Server at . - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I launch SPSS, I get a dialog box titled SPSS for Windows that pops up and reads:

The Client software could not initialize with SPSS Server at.
French: Le logiciel client n'a pas pu s'initialiser sur l'ordinateur local. 

My only option is to click the OK button, at which time the SPSS Server Login screen comes up and the only choice I see in there is Local Computer. I can either click OK or Cancel. Clicking Cancel aborts everything while clicking OK leaves me with an SPSS process running on my system, but the program still doesn't launch. This didn't used to happen. What is going on? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please verify you do not still have the Statistics Demo or Evaluation version installed simultaneously on your machine along with the full version of Statistics Base. 

If running Statistics on Windows Vista, please do the following to avert the problem: 

1. Right click the SPSS shortcut in the SPSS for Windows Program group or the Statistics shortcut in the SPSSInc Program group and choose "Properties" from the context menu. 
2. Select the "Compatibility" tab. 
3. Within the "Privilege Level" section, check the "Run the program as an administrator" and click OK. 

If the above does not apply, this is the result of either a missing or corrupted file named 'statisticsd.conf' from version 17 or 'spssd.conf' from versions prior to 17. This file is registry.txt for pre-11.5 SPSS versions. This problem can be fixed by either reinstalling Statistics or obtaining a new copy of that file which is attached to this resolution. If you use the attached file on the resolution be sure to choose either the Window_Resolution26567.zip file or the MAC_Resolution26567.zip depending upon whether you are on Windows or MAC. Download the appropriate .zip file to your desktop, unzip it and choose the file in the folder corresponding to the version of Statistics that you are using. Copy the spssd.conf file or the statisticsd.conf file into the Statistics installation directory and replace the existing file in that directory. 

For Mac, please download the file that is specific to your Statistics version.

*On Mac, this file needs to be copied to /Applications/SPSS or to /Applications/SPSSInc.
Open a Command Terminal Window and move statisticsd.conf to it. For example, 
mv /Users/Username/Desktop/statisticsd.conf /Applications/SPSSInc/SPSSStatistics17/SPSSStatistics17.0.app/Contents/Bin

OR 

a. Browse to the SPSSStatistics17.0 app bundle in the Finder 
b. Control-click on the app bundle, then select "Show Package Contents" 
c. Drill down to Contents/Bin
d. Drag the statisticsd.conf from it's saved location to the Bin folder
