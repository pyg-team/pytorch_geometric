PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 MustGather documents aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs).

Collecting MustGather data early, even before opening the PMR, helps IBM® WebSphere® Transformation Extender (WTX) Support quickly determine if:
1. Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery).
2. There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved.
3. There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity.
4. Locating root cause can speed development of a code fix.
