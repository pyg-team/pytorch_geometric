Title: IBM Migrate Management Central from using Java 6 to Java 8 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 With support for Java 6 scheduled to end starting 2018, these PTFs allow MGTC to use Java 8 instead. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For V7R1 and V7R2 systems, Java 6 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 11 and JV1 option 12) are the only versions Management Central supports by default. 

With support for Java 6 scheduled to end starting 2018, these PTFs allow to change MGTC to use 
Java 8 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 16 and JV1 option 17) instead. 

V7R3 systems already use Java 8 32-bit and 64-bit by default.


Note: Java 8 32-bit and 64 bit (JV1 option 16 and JV1 option 17) are required to be on system prior to apply the PTFs. 
Information about how to obtain the options could be found at following document:
N1020692: Support of Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.0 on the IBM i OS [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020692]

After apply the PTFs, MGTC restart is required to reflect the change.
