Title: IBM Cannot import a TeamWorks/WebSphere Lombardi Edition export if it contains multiple toolkit snapshots - United States

Text:
Cannot import TeamWorks/WebSphere Lombardi Edition export ; multiple toolkit snapshots FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 If you attempt to perform an import of an export that has dependencies on 2 or more toolkits, the import process goes into a loop such that the user is taken back to the upload screen after clicking Next. 

CONTENT
This issue occurs for Process Applications and Toolkits and when the import is performed using the Web Browser or Authoring Environment. A hot fix has been developed to address this problem. This hot fix requires the WebSphere Lombardi Edition 7.2.0 original release and should be applied to the Process Center only.

When you encounter this error, your WebSphere Lombardi Edition installation is unaffected because it is a client side error and no updates occur on the server as a result of this failure. 

Download the interim fix from Fix Central by clicking on the following link:

The package includes two README files; WLE-7.2.0-IC73090-Install-Win.txt, providing installation instructions for Windows platforms, and WLE-7.2.0-IC73090-Install-Unix.txt, providing installation instructions for UNIX-based platforms. The install of this interim fix is automated using scripts. Only one WAR file, which is named repository.war, is being updated in the Process Center. 

This fix is related to browser activity and some browsers may cache old Process Center data. Therefore, force a browser refresh with Ctrl+F5.
