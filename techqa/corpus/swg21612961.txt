Title: IBM Recommended values for OS "ulimit" feature - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote contains recommendations for operating system ulimit values on AIX, Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems when used with MDM Standard Edition. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Master Data Engine is a high performance application and uses large amounts of RAM and TCP connections to provide optimal performance. On larger installations, the memory, file and connection requirements can exceed the default ulimit (user limits) setting of the operating system.
IBM recommends that customers configure all ulimit values related to memory (stack and heap) and the number of open file descriptors (nofile) per process to "unlimited" or the maximum allowable size, for the user account under which the Engine will be running. The supported operating systems of IBM® AIX®, Linux, or Solaris have different options for setting the memory, stack, and open file settings (for example, through user creation or within a user .profile or .login file). 

For Linux, change the number of open file descriptors (nofile) to at least 65535 - a value of unlimited would be preferable.

For complete details, see the vendor-specific documentation for ulimit settings.
