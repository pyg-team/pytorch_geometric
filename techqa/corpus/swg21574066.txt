QUESTION
 Is it possible to migrate Rational Robot scripts to Rational Functional Tester (RFT) or Rational Performance Tester (RPT)? 

ANSWER
There isn't a direct migration path for Rational Robot scripts to RFT or RPT, the actions currently performed in Rational Robot will have to be recorded in either RPT or RFT.
ARM instrumentation of RFT and RPT is completely different to the method used in Rational Robot.

When a Robot script is auto-instrumented, ARM code is physically added to the scripts. If the user chooses to, they can manually add the ARM calls and logic can be added to manage the way errors and verification point failures are handled. For example, ending the script run with an ARM_FAILED when a VP fails.

ARM instrumentation for RFT and RPT scripts does not directly alter the recorded scripts and it is not possible to manually add ARM instrumentation.

RFT and RPT manage Response Times and Verification Points in different ways.

Rational Performance Tester - RPT

Use RPT to monitor HTTP or HTTPS web applications, SAP, Siebel, or Citrix applications for performance.

RPT does not need to be installed on playback agents.

Playbacks run in the background.

By default, Response Time Breakdown is enabled for all pages and objects in the recording.

Instead of using Start and Stop timers, users can group items together to create nested response time measurements.

Prior to RPT 8.2 which is supported by ITCAMfT 7.3, if a Verification Point failed the script would continue to run to the end unless manual changes are made to the recording to alter this behaviour. With RPT 8.2 it is possible to easily specify a number of different actions when a VP fails. For example, Stop script execution or skip to next primary page.

Rational Functional Tester - RFT

Use RFT to monitor applications not covered by RPT for functional testing, regression testing, GUI testing, and data-driven testing. 

Like Robot, RFT has to be installed on playback agents and relies on desktop interaction to visibly run playbacks one at a time.

Users can add start and stop timers during script development.

When played back on an agent, ARM Start and Stop calls are made corresponding to the RFT timers.

For nested timers to work correctly you need to use ITCAMfT 7.3 with RFT 8.2.0.2. + IF01 or higher

If a Verification Point fails the script will continue to run to the end unless manual changes are made to the recording to alter this behaviour.

RFT does not have the same type of automated error-handling now found in RPT 8.2 but there is an option to add conditional logic:
