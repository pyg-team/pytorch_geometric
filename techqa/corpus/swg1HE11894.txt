APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a data source preservation or collection plan template is
   created prior to Atlas 6.0.1 with questions of the boolean type
   there are situations where the underlying XML template created
   will be missing the <booleanParameter><defaultValue>. When that
   occurs errors will be encountered when creating a preseravtion
   or collection plan based on that data source template.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Recreate the data source template with Atlas 6.0.1 or beyond.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Creating a  preservation or collection plan includes associating
    the plan with a plan template and data source.   A Policy Atlas
    upgraded to V6.0.1 may not be able to reference plan templates
   created with V4.5.  The "system error" can occur when creating
   or saving a plan that references an old template.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue is resolved and a plan can be created in Atlas V6 or
   above and associated with a template created with Policy Atlas
   V4.5.
   The fix is now available to download from Fix Central in fix
   pack 6.0.1.6
