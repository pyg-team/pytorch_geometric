Title: IBM How to control the redo log generation in WPC's oracle database? - United States

Redo logs Database Oracle TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We found that the redo log generation size in WPC's Oracle database is very 
high and is caused by the following queries: 

SELECT * FROM tsch_sch_schedule 
WHERE sch_next_running_time =(select MIN(sch_next_running_time) 
from tsch_sch_schedule where sch_next_running_time < SYSDATE 
and sch_enabled != 'D' and not exists (select 1 from scp where 
scp_job_id = sch_job_id 
and scp_param_name = 'RUN_ON_SVC' and scp_param_value != :1)) 
and sch_enabled != 'D' and not exists (select 1 from scp where 
scp_job_id = sch_job_id 
and scp_param_name = 'RUN_ON_SVC' and scp_param_value!= :2) FOR UPDATE
=============================================================== 
UPDATE /*+ index(tutl_lck_lock iutl_lck_0) */ tutl_lck_lock SET 
lck_thread_id = :1, lck_jvm_id = :2 WHERE lck_type = :3 
AND lck_thread_id = :4 AND lck_jvm_id = :5 
=============================================================== 
UPDATE tutl_jhb_jvm_heartbeat 
SET jhb_heartbeat = TO_DATE(:1, 'DD-MON-RRRR HH24:MI:SS') 
WHERE jhb_jvm_id = :2 

What can be done to keep the redo log generation to be minimal? 

CAUSE
Redo logs are transaction logs for the Oracle database for recovery purposes. It will record all the changes to the WPC database. And since lock, heartbeat and scheduler related database tables and queries are designed to constantly check and update the database, this behavior increases redo log generation.

ANSWER
As redo logs are the transaction logs used for recovery; the redo log size cannot be restricted by tuning the queries. The only way to control the log size is to increase the frequency of your backup schedule for archiving these logs so that more space is available for new log generation. 

Disaster Recovery operations will have improved performance if backup images are used and redo logs are smaller.
