CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7

The IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition provided for download with Tivoli Storage Productivity Center, which can be installed separately, is vulnerable to all CVEs as noted by the IBM Java SDK security bulletin. Review the following security bulletins and evaluate your own code to determine if you are vulnerable. 
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985393 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985393] and
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21997194 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21997194]


AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.8 through 5.2.13
Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.2.0 through 5.2.7.1
Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.0 through 5.1.1.13

The versions listed above apply to all licensed offerings of IBM Spectrum Control and Tivoli Storage Productivity Center, including IBM Smart Cloud Virtual Storage Center Storage Analytics Engine.


REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to apply an appropriate Tivoli Storage Productivity Center (IBM Spectrum Control) fix maintenance for each named product and should be implemented as soon as practicable. Starting with 5.2.8, Tivoli Storage Productivity Center has been renamed to IBM Spectrum Control. 

If you have downloaded and installed IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Version 6 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 25 or earlier from an older version of Tivoli Storage Productivity Center, you should download the updated version after applying the fix pack and reinstall IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Version 6 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 30 or later. 

Do not use the IBM JRE 1.6.0 or IBM SDK 1.6.0 links provided with the affected Tivoli Storage Productivity Center versions. If you upgrade to IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.13 or higher, there is no new version to download and apply as the Java WebStart GUI that previously used it is no longer provided. 

Note: It is always recommended to have a current backup before applying any update procedure.
