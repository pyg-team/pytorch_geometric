QUESTION
 Why does the ITCAM HT agent crash immediately after starting? 

CAUSE
This is usually caused due to an incorrect JAVA Path in the KHTENV file.

ANSWER
Sometimes when you install other agents (such as the TT agents), the KWJ_JAVA_HOME parm in the KHTENV file gets overwritten with another JRE. 

To fix this problem, look for the KHTENV file (usually in the %ITM_HOME%\conf\TMAITM6 dir in Windows or $ITM_HOME\config dir in Unix/Linux) and make a backup of the file first. 

Then edit the file and look for the KWJ_JAVA_HOME parm. It should point to a valid JRE. 

For Windows, do something like this:
* cd %ITM_HOME%\conf\TMAITM6\ 
- make a backup of KHTENV first 
- edit the KHTENV file, and scroll down to KWJ_JAVA_HOME parm 
- change the KWJ_JAVA_HOME parm to point to your JRE, for example: 
KWJ_JAVA_HOME=C:\IBM\ITM\java\java60\jre 
(or KWJ_JAVA_HOME=C:\Progra~1\IBM\Java142\Jre) 
- save file 
* restart the HT agent from the MTEMS or the command-line.
