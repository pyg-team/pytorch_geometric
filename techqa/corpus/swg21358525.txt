 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Can I use IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.3 and 8.4 maps with IBM WebSphere DataPower Gateway Appliance firmware? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To use WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX ) maps with the IBM WebSphere DataPower Gateway Appliance, you will need to use the product levels as described in this table. 

Please refer to the appropriate information center for specific information about supported functionality for WTX fixpacks with their specified DataPower firmware. 

DataPower Firmware WTX Software Fixpacks Knowledge Center 7.2.0 8.4.1.3 and later N/A 7.1.0 8.4.0.5 and later N/A 7.0.0 8.4.0.2 and later

IMPORTANT: Before deploying a project to DataPower, it is CRITICAL to know that the version of WTX runtime used by the DataPower Fixpack. 
The best practice is using same version of WTX runtime and Design Studio to compile the maps. 
Failure to do so may cause errors due to the mismatch. 

In the table below, not all the fixpacks are listed, but only the ones that have a WTX runtime change. For example, 6.0.0.4 is not shown in the table below. This means that there is no WTX runtime change in 6.0.0.4, and 6.0.0.4 contains WTX runtime v8.4.0.4. 


DataPower Firmware Contains WTX Runtime 6.0.0.0 8.4.0.3 6.0.0.2 8.4.0.3 6.0.0.3 8.4.0.4 6.0.0.5 8.4.0.4 6.0.1.0 8.4.0.4 6.0.1.1 8.4.0.4 6.0.1.8 8.4.0.5 7.0.0.0 8.4.0.4 7.0.0.5 8.4.0.5 7.1.0.0 8.4.0.5 7.2.0.0 8.4.1.3 


Review DataPower Knowledge Collection: How to upgrade the firmware on an IBM WebSphere DataPower Gateway Appliance [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015333] for information on downloading and installing IBM DataPower Gateway Appliance firmware. 

Important Notes:
 * Use the Interoperability Test Service.
   
 * Please contact IBM support if you have a question on what version of WTX is used by a specific DataPower firmware release.
   
 * If the WTX map is compiled on a newer version and tried to run on on an older version runtime, a version mismatch may occur and you may see errors like these in the system logs:
   
   dpa runtime error 
   map failedrc (-27), Loading
