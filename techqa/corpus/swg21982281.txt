QUESTION
What Sametime 9.0.1 offerings are supported with Citrix? 

ANSWER
The following Citrix client features are supported in Sametime, except for Audio and Video features provided by the Sametime WebPlayer: 

 * Citrix XenApp 4.5, 5.0, 6.5, and 7.6 
 * Citrix XenDesktop 5.6 and 7.6


Note: Citrix XenApp 6.0 is not supported at all. 

The following Sametime features are supported in the Citrix clients: 

Sametime Connect Client 
Automatic location awareness on the Sametime Connect Client 9.0.1 is not currently supported. Users can set their geographic location manually. 

Users might be prompted to "grant access" when closing the Sametime Connect client using the File > Exit command. If this happens, the user must grant access to fully log out from the Sametime Community Server; otherwise the user remains logged in after closing the Sametime Connect client. 

Microsoft Office Integration 
Microsoft Office, Outlook, and SharePoint integrations are generally supported. 
However, we have identified issues with awareness changes that remain unresolved. 

Sametime Web Meetings 
The Sametime Web Meetings 9.0.1 client is generally supported. 
Application sharing works when the browser is published as part of the server desktop, which allows the user to share applications published as part of the same environment as the browser. Application sharing does not work when the browser is published as an application, because there are no other applications to share in the virtual desktop environment. 

The Sametime WebPlayer is not supported on Citrix clients. 

Sametime Web Chat Client 
The Sametime Web Chat 9.0.1 client is generally supported. 
Screen capture works when the browser is published as part of the server desktop, because it provides an actual screen to capture. Screen capture will not work when the browser is published as an application. 

The Sametime WebPlayer is not supported on the Citrix clients. 

Sametime Instant Share 
Instant Share is supported only on the Sametime Connect 9.0 and 9.0.1 clients. 

Sametime A/V and Telephony in Connect Client 
Audio, video, and telephony features are supported in optimized mode when the Sametime Connect client is published as an application. Clients can receive audio and video streams directly from the Media Control Unit without using the Citrix Server as a relay.
