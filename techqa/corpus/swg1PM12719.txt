   ****************************************************************
   After continuous loading of the conversion parts (CSQAALST,
   CSQACLST and CSQAMLST) the contents directory entry (CDE) use
   count, indicating the number of requests issued for a module,
   exceeds the maximum use count that the system allows and
   CSQV002I is issued. The maximum count is 32767.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQBCRMH has been changed to clean up the conversion parts
   when the message handle is freed.
