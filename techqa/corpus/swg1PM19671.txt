APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: Heavy applications (mostly on WAS application
   servers) ran for days causes the JIT buffers to increase the
   consumption of native memory leading to an eventual native OOM.
   Though there is no standard way of telling there are too many
   JIT buffers, normal applications with anything more than 20 JIT
   buffers can be thought of affected with the issue.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   None.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Heavy applications (mostly on WAS application servers, only on
   zOS) ran for days causes the JIT buffers to increase the
   consumption of native memory leading to an eventual native OOM.
   Though there is no standard way of telling there are too many
   JIT buffers, normal applications with anything more than 20 JIT
   buffers can be thought of affected with the issue. The leak was
   seen to grow upto 75 MB when the native memory usage was around
   200 MB.
   The problem is fixed in SR13-FP6. After upgrading to this
   version, it is also required to export this JIT compiler option
   for the fix to take effect:
   JITC_COMPILEOPT=JIT_FRAGMENTATION_FIX
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   1.4.2 SR13 FP6
   .
   JIT causes fragmentation in the JVM subpool on heavy
   applications with peculiar JIT compilation patterns (for
   example, reduced MMI threshold). The problem is fixed in JIT.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20100821 or later
