APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  below are the steps I took to replicate:
   maxdemo 7118 with TAMIT 7.2.2 and Service Provider 7112
   
   1 create a new asset called NEW
   enter BR240 in the location field
   enter PUMP100 in the item field
   change status to OPERATING
   2 create a new asset called ASS1
   enter BR240 in the location field
   enter PUMP100 in the item field
   change status to OPERATING
   3 create a new asset called ASS2, attach ASS1 in the parent
   field
   enter PUMP100 in the item field
   change status to OPERATING, tick "Roll New Status to All Child
   Assets" checkbox
   4 create a new asset called ASS3, enter ASS2 in the parent field
   enter PUMP100 in the item field
   change status to OPERATING, tick "Roll New Status to All Child
   Assets" checkbox
   5. change status of ASS3 to DECOMMISSIONED
   "Roll New Status to All Child Assets" checkbox is ticked and
   greyed out
   6. bring up ASS2, click MOVE/MODIFY icon on the toolbar, enter
   NEW
   in the TO PARENT field
   click OK
   get error: "BMXAA0090E - Asset ASS3 is not a valid asset, or its
   status is not an operating status."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  workaround is to change status of ass3 to operating, then move
   ass2 and then change it back to decommissioned
   
   But workaround is unacceptable to our client:
   Business impact ( BusImpact )
   
   Unable to conform to approved business practices.  Personnel
   have to
   change the status from decommissioned to operating, perform the
   move,
   and then correct the status to decommissioned.  Not best
   practices, e.
   g., no change requests issued/approved.
