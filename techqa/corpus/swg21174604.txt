Title: IBM Sample configuring static ports to enable RMI communication through a firewall (security enabled) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to connect from an EJBâ„¢ on one server to an EJB on a second server through a firewall, the connections fail unless the ports are known and open in the firewall. 

CAUSE
A firewall between the client and server(s) is blocking RMI (Remote Method Invocation)/ORB (Object Request Broker) communication.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure the ORB on the AppServer(s) and NodeAgent(s) to use static (well-known) ports so that these ports can then be open in the firewall configuration. The following ports are those which need to be opened in the firewall in order to allow successful ORB communication between client and server(s): 

Client:
com.ibm.CORBA.ListenerPort (this should be set to a static value and needs to be open in the case when the server has to make a callback. Or if the port is dynamic, then com.ibm.CORBA.enableClientCallbacks must be set to true. https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/172456/how-to-prevent-the-orb-in-websphere-application-se.html [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/172456/how-to-prevent-the-orb-in-websphere-application-se.html]).

EJB server ports on AppServer node (open these ports for each EJB server/cluster member):
BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS
ORB_LISTENER_ADDRESS
(depending on SSL config, one or both of these):
CSIV2_SSL_SERVERAUTH_LISTENER_ADDRESS
CSIV2_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_LISTENER_ADDRESS

NodeAgent ports on AppServer node (open these ports for each NA node which has a server/cluster member):
BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS
ORB_LISTENER_ADDRESS
(depending on SSL config, one or both of these):
CSIV2_SSL_SERVERAUTH_LISTENER_ADDRESS
CSIV2_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_LISTENER_ADDRESS
