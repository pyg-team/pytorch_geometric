APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Atlas, it's possible that numbers reported for "# Custodians
   in Collection/All" are different than "Total Persons" on
   the People Master List.
   
   This will typically occur on matters that have had a user
   added then removed to facilitate a change in email address.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Matter collections view shows a different number of total
   custodians from the number of persons in the Master list view.
   The error occurs when persons change their email addresses which
    IBM Atlas Suite interprets as different persons in the system.
