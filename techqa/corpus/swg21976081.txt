Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Db2advis returns the following two lines of disk space related information. What does it mean?
...
total disk space needed for initial set [ 0.159] MB
total disk space constrained to [ 69.215] MB
...


ANSWER
Here is an example output of db2advis.
...
execution started at timestamp 2010-03-16-14.25.57.562000
Using the default table space name USERSPACE1
found [47] SQL statements from the input file
excluding statement [0] from the workload.
excluding statement [1] from the workload.
excluding statement [19] from the workload.
excluding statement [39] from the workload.
Recommending indexes...
Recommending MQTs...
Recommending Multi-Dimensional Clusterings...
Found 19 user defined views in the catalog table
Found [17] candidate MQTs
Getting cost of workload with MQTs
total disk space needed for initial set [ 0.159] MB
total disk space constrained to [ 69.215] MB
...

db2advis will recommend indexes and MQTs etc. The indexes and MQTs etc. will use disk space. "total disk space needed for initial set" is the estimated disk space used by the recommended indexes and MQTs etc. "Initial set" means this is preliminary recommendation. The set will be refined later.

"total disk space constrained to" is the maximum allowed space for the recommended indexes and MQTs etc. db2advis will try to recommend a set of indexes and MQTs etc so that the total space used doesn't exceed this constrain.

Note:
This behavior might be changed without notice in the future.
