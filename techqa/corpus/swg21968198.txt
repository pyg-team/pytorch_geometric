QUESTION
Does the IBM Notes Browser Plugin work in Google Chrome?

ANSWER
Unfortunately, the IBM Notes Browser Plugin (NBP) does not work in Google Chrome. The NBP is only supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox as of the moment. An enhancement request to add Google Chrome to the list of supported browsers was submitted to product development under SPR RJDT9QUJV6. 

In case the NOTES_PLUGIN_DEFAULT_BROWSER parameter is not set in the notes.ini and the system default browser is Chrome, the NBP will launch in Internet Explorer.
