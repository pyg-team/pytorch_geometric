ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I've been talking with Mark Braksator regarding the Covenant
   Health
   issue with deleting a user account.  He believes that it's
   caused by
   some code that calls the wrong API, and that API triggers the ID
   Policy
   to fire.  He advised me to go through support to enter a
   DevTrack for
   it.  Please do that so we can get it in the queue.
   .
   I also called Larry and let him know the details.  He's not
   overly
   concerned about the delete account firing the ID Policy, but
   he's going
   to keep an eye on it and let us know if it does become a higher
   priority
   issue.  But he would like it fixed, obviously, so please
   communicate the
   DevTrack to him (or whatever your normal procedure is in these
   cases).
