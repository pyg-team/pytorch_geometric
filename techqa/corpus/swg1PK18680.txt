     Default Depends on the database. Most are 10. Informix Version
     7.3, 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 without latest fix must be 0. A default

   ****************************************************************
   The article entitled, "WebSphere Application Server data
   source properties," does not document the fact that
   Informix Dynamic Server Version 9.4 databases must run the
   latest fix to support the statement caching property for
   data sources.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If your data sources access Informix Dynamic Server Version
   9.4 and do not run the latest fix, you must set the Statement
   Cache Size data source property to a value of zero. This
   setting disables the statement caching function. For more
   information on the latest fix, see the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/data/informix/ids/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/data/informix/ids/]
   
   The updated documentation will be available in the next
   refresh of the information center on or before March 31, 2006.
