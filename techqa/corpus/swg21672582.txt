Title: IBM Tracing the events TBSM is reading from OMNIbus - United States

Text:
tbsm event select read process service log debug TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I see which events TBSM is reading? 

CAUSE
TBSM uses the SQL defined in OMNIbusEventReader to select events from OMNIbus to be passed on for processing for the TBSM Service Model. So, how can you see which events are being read.

ANSWER
With normal trace levels the TBSM_tbsmomnibuseventreader.log will report how many events are selected each time events are read from OMNIbus (by default every 3 seconds). However, to see which events are actually selected, you need to enable the debug setting. 

To enable the debug setting, do the following: 

Add the property: impact.eventreader.debug=true to the file: $TBSM_HOME/etc/TBSM_server.props 

After doing this, and restarting the data server, you will see additional lines in the log, like:
... New Event -> Serial: xxxxxx StateChange: yyyyyyyyyyy
Where xxxxx will be the value of the event Serial field, and yyyyyyyyyy will be the value of the StateChange field.
