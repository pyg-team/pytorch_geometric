APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you restrict the webadmin interface on V10 to TLSV1.2
   only, then the toolkit cannot connect to the broker.
   
   You cannot select the TLSV1.2 via the remote connection
   wizard.  This apar will provide a drop-down list of protocols
   from which to select.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add the following to a .broker file:
   
    sslIncludeProtocols="TLSv1.2"
   
   and then use that .broker file to create a remote connection to
   the broker.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Toolkit V10 with remote SSL
   connections to a node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64 platform, Windows on x86-64 platform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   There is no way of setting the SSL protocol when connecting to a
   remote node.   If the
   node has a a higher level of protocol then the connection will
   fail.
   You can create a .broker file and set the protocol in there but
   you cannot do this via
   the remote connection wizard.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The remote connection will set the SSL protocol correctly when
   connecting.
