Title: IBM Cannot install IBM WebSphere Test Environment and other tools with extend Eclipse 3.2.x - United States

Text:
eclipse extend; extending Eclipse; jvm; IBM JVM; cannot install WTE; RAD; RSA; eclipse.ini; 1255356 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During installation of Rational® Application Developer (RAD) or Rational Software Architect (RSA) version 7.0.x, IBM® Installation Manager version 1.x (IM) checks for the version of Java™ Virtual Machine (JVM™) that extended Eclipse® uses and if the JVM version is not from IBM, IM does not allow you to install the WebSphere® Test Environment (WTE) and other tools. 

CAUSE
JVM version installed on client is not from IBM.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps to resolve this problem:


 1. Edit eclipse.ini of the Eclipse you are extending to use a specific JVM. 
    Note: Installation Manager comes with an IBM JVM.
    
    For example:
    
    -vm c:\IBM\IM\eclipse\jre\bin\java.exe
    -debug
    -console
    -vmargs
    -Xms40m
    -Xmx256m
    
 2. Reinstall RAD (or RSA). 
 3. At the features selection window in RAD, the checkboxes of WTE and other tools are enabled.
    


For additional information about minimum JDK requirements for installing Rational Application Developer version 7 over an existing Eclipse 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, see technote 1254410 linked under the Related information section. Also, RAD and RSA 7.0.0+ only support Eclipse 3.2.x.
