Title: IBM Hyphen in file name with COBOL for AIX - United States

Text:
1181287; dash; hyphen; code; Cobol; AIX TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In IBM COBOL for AIX, how do I use a file name that contains a dash? For example:
$ export MYFILE=/DIR2/my-file.txt
My COBOL program is trying to read or write file.txt instead of my-file.txt 

CAUSE
The hyphen separates the file's type from its name.

ANSWER
This is unsupported. There is no way to code an environment variable or the SELECT ASSIGN USING clause to pass a hyphen as part of the file name. When COBOL's internal parser receives the string, it looks for a hyphen. In this example, the "my" is a comment and file.txt is the file's name. This is documented in the Programming guide. Suppose you coded 


$ export MYFILE=/DIR2/vsam-FILE2.XYZ


Then FILE2.XYZ would be treated as a VSAM file.
