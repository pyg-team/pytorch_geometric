Title: IBM Error com.spss.rosetta.component.survey data.core.model.data exception when opening 38,000 record file into Text Analysis for Surveys - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to open a rather large (nearly 40,000 cases) .xlsx file into Text Analysis for Surveys using the Excel (*.xls, *.xlsx) Data Source. Doing so results in the following error message: 

com.spss.rosetta.component.survey data.core.model.DataException 

I click OK on this error and am presented with a second message: 

No variables found in the dataset!

I click OK on this message and am presented with the Variables screen where I can ordinarily select the variables for my analysis but in this case it is blank. I can choose nothing and the Back button is my only available other option. How can I bring my .xlsx file into Text Analysis for Surveys? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development. We appologize for your inconvenience. As a workaround, you can use ODBC to bring the file into Text Analysis for Surveys.
