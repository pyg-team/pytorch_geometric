[3/3/16 12:02:39:865 EST] 00000121 ServletWrappe E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service SRVE0068E: An exception was 
thrown by one of the service methods of the servlet

Exception created : [java.lang.NullPointerException 
at psdi.webclient.system.controller.ComponentInstance.needsRender(ComponentInstance.java:764) 
at com.ibm._jsp._resultsetportlet._jspService(_resultsetportlet.java:1981) 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are some reasons for these kind of exceptions that we have seen. You may need to check in your environment to see if one of them fits to the current scenario. 

The most common root cause of such errors is that one or multiple Result Sets have a wrong query definition, or the query definition is missing at all. 

Are the users using the same Start Center template? If yes, the problem may be the queries been used. 

Could you please check the queries that the portlets are using? What happens if you run the queries in the database? 

There have been a couple of issues found with having special characters in the title of and of the portlets in the startcenter; namely, ( ) % or '. 

You can check those portlet titles. Also, many pie charts and bar charts in just one Start Center for users, or specific Start Center templates having issues due to corrupted data in the database could affect it. 

Make sure you are running Maximo with the latest IFIX packages applied.
