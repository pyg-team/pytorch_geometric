APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following errors are displayed in the performance data log:
   2013-04-25 18:00:30.048+0400 HWNPM4302E New performance data is
   not yet available for the device. Statistics with timestamps
   later than 04/25/2013 17:56:37:000 MSK) could not be found.
   2013-04-25 18:00:30.063+0400 HWNPM2052E No performance data was
   collected from device SVC-2145-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-IBM
   (0000000123456789) for the current collection interval due to an
   error. The previous polling interval with data was at
   (17:56:37,null).
   
   The performance data collection for SVC or V7000 is not possible
   even if both TPC server and storage subsystem are running in the
   same Time Zone.
   The error comes from the way the storage subsystem and JVM are
   treating the time zones.
   The problem occurs when the machines are running in a
   country/time zone which has stopped/started to use the Daylight
   Saving Time (DST).
   The IBM java embedded in TPC doesn't contain the last Time Zone
   changes.
   
   For example:
   Europe/Moscow (GMT+3) and Asia/Novosibirsk (GMT+7) were using
   DST in the past.
   - Europe/Moscow (GMT+3) - The JVM add +1h to the current time.
   - Asia/Novosibirsk (GMT+7) - The JVM reduce -1h to the current
   time.
   
   Affected Releases:
   All TPC versions
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the IBM Time Zone Update Utility for Java to update the java
   embedded in TPC.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following entry will be added to all TPC 5.1.x limitations
   and known issues technotes.  It will also be included in future
   troubleshooting documentation.
   
   Changing to or from daylight savings time can prevent
   performance data collection (IC92943)
   
   Changing to or from daylight savings time can prevent Tivoli
   Storage Productivity Center from collecting performance data on
   storage systems.  This is caused by the JVM and the storage
   subsystems handling the time changes differently.  To resolve
   this, use the IBM Time Zone Update Utility for Java
   https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/dst/jtzu.html. [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/dst/jtzu.html.]
