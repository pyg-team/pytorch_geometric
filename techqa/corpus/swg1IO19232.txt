APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  when a client tries to open a TLS 1.2 connection, the connection
   fails with the message
   
   Error - open_ssl_connection(): gsk_attribute_set_buffer(
   ...GSK_TLSV12_CIPHER_SPECS_EX - ciphers...)
   rc=701 GSK_ATTRIBUTE_INVALID_ID-Invalid attribute identifier
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TLS 1.2 support was added in TDS 6.3.0.17 or later via APAR
   IO17186 as described in technote 1610440: IBM Tivoli Directory
   Server support for NIST SP 800-131A
   
      http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610440 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610440]
   
   In order to use TLS 1.2 you must update TDS to 6.3.0.17 or later
   with GSKit 8.0.14.24 or later.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Supported TLS and SSL versions should be documented in technote
   1584390, but this technote was not updated to reflect the TLS
   1.2 support added in 6.3.0.17.
   
      http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584390 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21584390]
   
   Additionally, while the TDS 6.3.0.17 and later README's have a
   special notice calling attention to the requirements for NIST SP
   800-131A, nowhere does it explicitly state that this feature is
   required for TLS 1.2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Technote 1584390: Supported TLS and SSL versions will be updated
   to include changes added after 6.3.0.17. And future TDS 6.3
   README's will be updated to explicitly state the requirements
   for TLS 1.2 support.
