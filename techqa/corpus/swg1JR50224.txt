APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - The problem is related to the select stock control and occurs
   in the authoring environment
   - Here, the deletion of all list members including the value
   which has been selected is not working properly in "Run
   Service"-mode
   - In "Run Service"-mode the selection field remains to be
   filled with the selected value although the list has no members
   anymore
   - Even using "listClearAllSelected()" before removing all
   members does not resolve the issue
   - "Debug Service"-mode provides a working scenario where all
   members as well as the selected value are removed properly
