Title: IBM Atlas database PSSAPL account keeps being locked after running custom BIRT reports. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Atlas database PSSAPL account keeps being locked after running custom BIRT reports which results in the Atlas application being unavailable until the database account is unlocked by a DBA. 

CAUSE
The custom BIRT reports include hardcoded datasource information in the <data-sources> section of the .rptdesign files.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove all hardcoded database information from the <data-sources> section in each of the custom BIRT report .rptdesign files. The custom reports when deployed should make use of the same data source that is configured for the Atlas Reports application. This by default is the AtlasReportsDS.


Here is an example from one of the out-of-the-box BIRT reports for the Atlas application. 
<data-sources>
<oda-data-source extensionID="org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc" name="AtlasReportsDS" id="6"
extends="AtlasReportsLibrary.AtlasReportsDS"/>
</data-sources>
Then make sure that any data set in the report makes use of the data source by ensuring the following data set property has a value of "AtlasReportsDS".
<property name="dataSource">AtlasReportsDS</property>
