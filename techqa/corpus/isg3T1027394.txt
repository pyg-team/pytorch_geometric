WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
1.1 Log on to each management host in the cluster and download the commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin.tar.gz package from the following location:

http://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/fileupload/binaries/commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin.tar.gz [http://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/fileupload/binaries/commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin.tar.gz]

1.2 Stop the following services:

> egosh service stop WEBGUI REST ascd plc purger

1.3 For backup purposes, move the following files, which will be replaced by new files:

> mkdir -p /tmp/cf121backup/

> mkdir -p /tmp/cf131backup/

Make note of the file owner, group, and permissions for the following files:
>ls -la $EGO_TOP/gui/3.5/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar
>ls -la $EGO_TOP/perf/3.5/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar
>ls -la $EGO_TOP/ascd/2.2.0/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar
>ls -la $EGO_TOP/wlp/usr/servers/rest/apps/3.5/deploymentrest/WEB-INF/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar

> mv $EGO_TOP/gui/3.5/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar /tmp/cf131backup

> mv $EGO_TOP/perf/3.5/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar /tmp/cf121backup/

> rm $EGO_TOP/ascd/2.2.0/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar

> rm $EGO_TOP/wlp/usr/servers/rest/apps/3.5/deploymentrest/WEB-INF/lib/commons-fileupload-*.jar

1.4 On each management host, decompress the commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin.tar.gz package and copy the following files to your cluster directory:

> tar zxf commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin.tar.gz

> cp commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin/commons-fileupload-1.3.3.jar $EGO_TOP/gui/3.5/lib/

> cp commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin/commons-fileupload-1.3.3.jar $EGO_TOP/perf/3.5/lib/

> cp commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin/commons-fileupload-1.3.3.jar $EGO_TOP/ascd/2.2.0/lib/

> cp commons-fileupload-1.3.3-bin/commons-fileupload-1.3.3.jar $EGO_TOP/wlp/usr/servers/rest/apps/3.5/deploymentrest/WEB-INF/lib/

If needed, restore the original file permissions with:
> chmod ### [file]

If needed, restore the original file owner and group with:
> chown [user]:[group] [file]

1.5 On each management host, clean up the GUI work directories:

> rm -rf $EGO_TOP/gui/work/*

> rm -rf $EGO_TOP/gui/workarea/*

NOTE: If you configured theWLP_OUTPUT_DIRparameter andAPPEND_HOSTNAME_TO_WLP_OUTPUT_DIRis set to true in the $EGO_CONFDIR/wlp.conf file, you must clean up the $WLP_OUTPUT_DIR/webgui_hostname/gui/workarea/ directory.

1.6 Launch a web browser and clear your browser cache.

1.7 Start the following services:

> egosh service start WEBGUI REST ascd plc purger
