QUESTION
 How IBM TRIRIGA localized data will be treated by Reports? 

CAUSE
Need to know how IBM TRIRIGA reports will treat localized data.

ANSWER
Similar to record runtime, reporting engine is also enhanced to display localized values depending upon userâ€™s language.

Fields which are not marked as localized are queried from the main table (T_ - internal value).

Localized values are supported in most standard reporting use cases, such as: Report manager, Query sections in a form, Portal sections.

Localized values are not supported in some cases such as: Query Task in Workflow, Query used in Formula evaluation, Business Connect.

A new flag called Localize is available for system filters to determine if the report needs to filter against the language of the user who is running the report.
