Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer has some issues when external users try to logon/authenticate in Cognos from a different Domain using OS signon. Is there any specific port that needs to be opened ?


SYMPTOM
N/A
The standard Windows authentication dialog box is displayed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
User/Computer login and authentication
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/445 and UDP/445; Microsoft-DS for Server Message Block (SMB) over IP traffic
* TCP/88 and UDP/88; Kerberos authentication
* UDP/389; Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) ping
* TCP/53 and UDP/53; Domain Name Service (DNS)

File access
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/445 and UDP/445; SMB over IP traffic

Establishing an explicit trust between Active Directory (AD) domains
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/445 and UDP/445; SMB over IP traffic
* TCP/389 and TCP/636; LDAP, where 636 is for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
* UDP/389; LDAP ping
* TCP/88 and UDP/88; Kerberos authentication
* TCP/53 and UDP/53; DNS

Validating and authenticating a trust
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/445 and UDP/445; SMB over IP traffic
* TCP/389 and TCP/636; LDAP
* UDP/389; LDAP ping
* TCP/88 and UDP/88; Kerberos authentication
* TCP/53 and UDP/53; DNS
* TCP/135 and UDP/135; Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoint mapper
* a range of RPC ports, which should be restricted when firewalling

AD replication, mutual authentication and Domain Controller (DC) location
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/135 and UDP/135; RPC endpoint mapper
* RPC service port for AD access; you must lock to a fixed port when firewalling
* RPC service port for AD replication; you must lock to a fixed port when firewalling
* TCP/88 and UDP/88; Kerberos authentication
* TCP/389 and TCP/636; LDAP
* UDP/389; LDAP ping
* TCP/3268 and TCP/3269; Global Catalog (GC) LDAP, where 3269 is for SSL
* TCP/445 and UDP/445; SMB over IP traffic
* TCP/53 and UDP/53; DNS
* UDP/123; Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Non-AD ports that are also required
The following protocols and ports are required:

* TCP/137 and UDP/137; Network Basic Input-Output System (NetBIOS) name service
* UDP/138; NetBIOS datagram service
* TCP/139; NetBIOS session service
