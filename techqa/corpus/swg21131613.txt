PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Below are instructions on how to install IBM® Rational Suite® version 2002.05.20 in silent mode. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is recommended to uninstall any previous version of Rational Suite that might be installed on the client system prior starting the silent installation. The enclosed document, techuninstall.doc, gives a list of registry keys and directories that should be manually deleted after using the Add / Remove Programs function, to totally remove the product. 


Make sure the system meets the minimum requirements. Please check the supported Hardware and Software platforms on the readme notes. 
Version 2002.05.20 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/rational/docs/v2002_r2/rs_readme.html]
Version 2002.05.00 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/rational/docs/v2002/rn/rs_readme.html] 
Version 2001a.04.00 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/rational/docs/documentation/release/v2001A/rs_readme.htm] 


To perform the installation you must: 

Have local administrator privileges Check that no other applications are running Disable any Anti-virus Turn off any desktop environments that run on top of Microsoft Windows

The silent installation is done in three steps: 

1. Record an installation session and create a response.ini file. 

2. Optionally, specify your license servers and/or add any post-installation command to the response.ini file. 

3. Perform the silent installation on a client system. 






1. Record an installation 

B. Create a shared network directory.
For example: RTLCSuite2002, with a subdirectory called Disk1 and a subdirectory of Disk1 called Disk2. 

Copy the contains of the Rational Solutions for Windows CD1 into the Disk1 directory and copy the files from the CD2 into the Disk2 folder. 

C. Run rssetup.exe from the command line, using the -autocapture switch to record a response.ini file.
For example:

\\RTLCServer\RTLCSuite2002\Disk1\setup\rssetup -autocapture


D. Run a manual Setup to record your response.ini file: 

5. Select the product to install. 
For example: Rational Suite Enterprise 

6. Leave the default installation path

C:\Program Files\Rational\RSSetup


7. Select the installation type of Custom so that you are able to select the features to be installed. 

8. When the setup program asks if you want to complete the installation click Cancel. By clicking Cancel no actual installation occurs on this system but your responses to the setup programs prompts have been recorded to the response.ini and is now save in the:

C:\Program Files\Rational\RSSetup.




9. Specify the license servers - Add a post-installation command. 

J. Run a post.bat file.
Open the response.ini file in a text editor and add the following post-installation command lines to the end of the file:

[PostInstallCmd]
Command=\\server\SharedLocation\post.bat


For example:

Command=\\RTLCServer\RTLCSuite2002\Disk1\post.bat


The post.bat can execute any commands.
Make sure the post.bat is saved in the shared network directory, for example: 
RTLCSuite2002\Disk1 

K. Specify a license server.
Open the response.ini file in a text editor and add the following post-installation command lines to the end of the file:

[PostInstallCmd]
Command=licadmin -f\\server\SharedLocation\server.txt


For example:

Command=licadmin -f\\RTLCServer\RTLCSuite2002\Disk1\server.txt


-f is the filename parameter for the License Key Administrator and server.txt is a text file. 

Note: This text file contains the name of the license server host name in the following form: Server:group-license-server where group-license-server is the name of the license server system.
For example:

Server:RTLCLicenseServer


L. Specify a second license server.
Add the following post-installation command lines to the end of the response.ini file:

[PostInstallCmd]
Command= licadmin -f\\server\SharedLocation\server.txt


The server.txt will contain both license server host names in the form:

Server:port@host
AlternateServer:port@host

For example:

Server:27000@RTLCLicenseServer
AlternateServer:27000@ RTLCLicenseServer2


M. Save the modified response.ini file to the shared network directory created earlier.
For example: 

RTLCSuite2002\Disk1


Note: The response.ini can be renamed to a more meaningful name as SuiteEnterprise2002.ini for example.

The first two steps of the silent installation are finished. At this point, all the files such as the response.ini, post.bat, server.txt are located in the shared network directory created at the beginning, RTLCSuite2002\disk1.



14. Install the product in silent mode on a client machine
Run the following command:

\\RTLCServer\RTLCSuite2002\Disk1\setup\rssetup.exe -silent -response:\\RTLCServer\RTLCSuite2002\Disk1\response.ini

To complete the installation, a reboot is required. 

The installation of Rational Suite must overwrite some system DLLs which are currently in use. 
Note: You can automate the reboot by enabling the Windows Automatic Logon as described in technote #1128426 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21128426]. The install.bat file, part of the enclosed .zip file shows an example of this functionality. 

 

Troubleshooting Tips:
If an error message about the tag.dat file appears, make sure that the following steps where performed: 

1. A directory called disk1 has been created. (this will be your parent directory) 

2. A copy of disk 1 has been placed in the disk1 parent directory of the local system or network share. 

3. A sub-directory has been created inside the parent directory and is called disk2 

4. A copy of disk 2 has been placed in the disk2 sub-directory 


If the post commands are not executed, check if the post.bat gets called by the response.ini. 


An easy way to do so is to replace the contains of the post.bat with a net send command, for example: 

net send username "calling post.bat"


If the file doesn't get called: 

check that the path specified in the response.ini is correct make sure there is no communication issue between the server and client machines. If the file gets called, check the commands written in the post.bat file.

An example of SuiteEnterprise2002.ini, post.bat, server.txt, install.bat are included in 147842006_SilentInstallFiles.zip attached to this technote.
