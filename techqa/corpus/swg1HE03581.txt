APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   (Problem is data specific)
   The stl data was saved in DMU Kinematics with applying
   wrapping and grain size as 0.2mm, zero offset value, when
   opened in Digitized Shape Editor and cleaned with Mesh
   cleaner.
   When try to create Automatic Surface in Quick Surface
   Reconstruction workbench update error showing message
   ???Automatic surface computation failed: No Result??? is thrown.
   
   .
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   Surface should be created by Automatic Surface command
   without giving update error message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  empty
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   Surface should be created by Automatic Surface command
   without giving update error message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   Additional Closure Information:
   .
   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   Unable to create Automatic surface and Update error appear.
   .
   RESTRICTION EXPLANATION:
   Automatic Surfaces command has been developed mainly for free
   form shapes and not mechanical shapes presenting sharp edges.
   With BR data, the mesh resulting from the swept volume
   command presents sharp edges.
   However Automatic Surface does not work well on mechanical
   part with sharp edges and therefore error message appear
   while creating Automatic surface.
   .
   By-Pass:
   1. Clean the mesh to delete the duplicated triangles
   2. Split it in two parts
   3. Use the automatic surface with the regular stream lines
   option
