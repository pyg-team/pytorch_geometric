PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having issues using the IBM REST API that is provided with the IBM Business Process Manager products. You would like to know what information you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Business Process Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support, it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 For example, you might be experiencing a problem when you try to access an API using the REST API tester or you might have issues with claiming or working on a task from IBM Process Portal. 

SETTING THE TRACE STRING
Set the trace string on the AppTarget cluster to *=info:com.ibm.bpm.wle.query.
*=all:com.ibm.bpm.wle.util.*=all:com.ibm.bpm.rest.*=all 

Note:Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction time outs and errors. Disable this trace after collecting the requested information.

To set the tracing and generate a new set of logs and traces, complete the following steps for the servers or cluster that show the issue: 

 1. Complete the following steps in the Integrated Solutions Console:  1. Click ​Troubleshooting​ ​>​ ​Log and Trace​ and select the server for which you want to change the settings. ​Note: AppTarget is the main process server Java™ virtual machine (JVM).
        
        
     2. ClickChange Log Detail Levels​.
        
        
     3. Select the ​configuration tab to set the tracing. This change takes effect after the next server restart and a completely new set of log files can be collected. Optionally, select the runtime​ tab to dynamically set the tracing. The runtime tab does not require a restart.
        
        
     4. Enter the trace string and clickOK.
        
        
     5. Stop the server if you selected the configuration tab.
        
        
    
    
 2. Archive and delete the current logs, traces, and FFDC files from the following directories:  * install_root/profiles/profile_name/logs/server_name 
     * install_root/profiles/profile_name/logs/ffdc
       
       
       Note: The install_root, profile_name, and server_namevariables are specific to your environment.
       
       
    
    
 3. Start the server and check thetrace.logfile to make sure that the correct tracing is set.
    
    
    Note:Ensure that you have set the Maximum trace file size (recommendation: 20MB) as well as the number of historical trace files (recommendation: 20) to an appropriate value. You can find those values atServers > Application Servers >server_name> Diagnostic Trace Service. 
    
    
 4. Reproduce the problem and write down the timestamp. Check thetrace.logfile to ensure that the time of the issue is covered in the file. Gather the complete server log files and the ffdc directory. Archive (.zip file) all log files and send them to IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852].
    
    
 5. Delete the trace string from the Log Detail Level for your server. When you remove and save settings in the Runtime tab, this process stops the log tracing.
    
    
 6. Send the response of the API call for calls made to the REST API from the REST API Tester, This information is displayed in the REST API tester in the right pane along with the complete XML code for the response.
