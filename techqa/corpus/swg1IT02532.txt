LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MessageSight v1.0.x and
   v1.1.0.0 appliance, who have created additional users on their
   appliance with a "Type" of "WebUI".
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   There was an error in the configuration preservation routines of
   the firmware upgrade processes. An attempt was being made to
   copy a sparse file as a regular file. The creation of additional
   users of the appliance (of type "WebUI") resulted in the sparse
   file in question reporting a very large size on disk. The caused
   the copy, and then the upgrade as a whole, to fail because it
   was incorrectly determined that there was not enough free space
   to preserve the user configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MessageSight firmware upgrade processes and routines
   have been updated to ensure that the sparse file in question
   does not cause the firmware upgrade operation to fail.
