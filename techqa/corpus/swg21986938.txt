 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to import a X.509 Certificate that has a Common Name (CN) Field length of more than 64 characters, you are getting an import exception. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You might want to try modifying TrustpointAll.jar in <installdirectory>/jdk/jre/lib/ext. Here are the steps.
(Please make a backup copy of the original TrustpointAll.jar) 

 1. Copy TrustpointAll.jar to an empty directory 
 2. jar -xf TrustpointAll.jar to extract jar content 
 3. Go to com\trustpoint\config\pkix\pkix1explicit
    (create that directory in the directory structure) 
 4. Create the file DNLength.cfg
    Put this line into the file:
    CommonName.length.max = 128 
 5. Save the file DNLength.cfg 
 6. update the jar file
    jar uf TrustpointAll.jar com/trustpoint/config/pkix/pkix1explicit/DNLength.cfg 
 7. Copy TrustpointAll.jar to <install directory>/jdk/jre/lib/ext
    Note. You should make a backup copy of TrustpointAll.jar but not save the backup copy in <install directory>/jdk/jre/lib/ext. 
 8. Restart ISBI
