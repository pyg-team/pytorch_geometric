Couldn't create user preferences directory. User preferences are unusable. 

SYMPTOM

Message: RecordType,0: Nov 3, 2011 10:44:56 AM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences$2 run 
Message: RecordType,0: WARNING: Couldn't create user preferences directory. User preferences are unusable. 
Message: RecordType,0: Nov 3, 2011 10:44:56 AM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences$2 run 
Message: RecordType,0: WARNING: java.io.IOException: No such file or directory

CAUSE
The DataStage user does not have proper permission to user home directory.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The DataStage user must have access to user $HOME directory. This is a java requirement. Java needs to write some preferences in the .java subdirectory under the directory specified as $HOME. $HOME can be found in the Environment variable settings log entry of the detailed job log. 


Please make sure the user has proper permission to the $HOME/.java directory.
