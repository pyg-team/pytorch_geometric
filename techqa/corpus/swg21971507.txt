Title: IBM Why is the data in my ARS0080I message in Content Manager OnDemand not showing the updated field values? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I've defined my application group to allow a field in the "Field Information" tab to be "Updateable". When I change the data in that field using the OnDemand Client, the before and after values of that changed data are not recorded in the ARS0080I message in the OnDemand System Log as the "Messages and Codes" Guide says they will be. Why might this be? 

CAUSE
It could be that you do not have the field checked for logging, or you have too many fields checked in your application group definition.

ANSWER
Bring up the application group in question in the OnDemand Administrator. Click on the "Field Information" tab. Confirm that the updateable field you would like to see in the ARS0080I message has a check mark next to the "Log" setting, as shown below: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21971507&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21971507&aid=1] 

Now, when the data is changed, the Message Number 80 in the OnDemand System Log will appear with the before value of this field in the "OrigFlds" field and the after value of this field in the "UpdFlds" field, as shown below: 


80 Application Group Document Update: Name(DOCEXP2) Agid(5025) OrigFlds(2015-11-23) UpdFlds(2015-11-24) 

Note that if you have more than one field with the "Log" checkbox checked, then only the data values for the first one will be written to the OrigFlds and UpdFlds contents.
