Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM Decision Optimization Center (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Decision Optimization Center 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, might allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation might allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Decision Optimization Center: v3.8 and earlier

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The recommended solution is to download and install IBM Java SDK version 6 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 3 with fixes for CVE-2015-0138 (FREAK) and CVE-2015-2808 (Bar Mitzvah) as soon as practicable. 

 * Before installing a newer version of IBM Java SDK, ensure that you:  * Close any open programs that you have running; 
    * Rename the initial directory of the IBM Java SDK (for example: with .old at the end),
   
   
 * Download and install IBM Java SDK version 6 Service Refresh 16 Fix Pack 3 or later from Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+ILOG+Optimization+Decision+Manager&release=All&platform=All&function=all] 
 * Check the build number with the command "java -version". The fix is correctly installed if the build number is equal to pwa6460sr16fp3ifix-20150407_01(SR16 FP3+IV70681+IV71888).


You must verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
