CAUSE
Part of the setup is to copy the .app file from the TM Server to the workstation where the Taskmaster Webclient Upload service is installed.

and the both .app files do not have all the necessary information for the Taskmaster Webclient Upload service to run properly


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
All the .app files must have the same dc2run.<user> name and value in the Custom Values tab. Use Taskmaster Application Manager to check this value. The recommended way is to modify the .app file on the TM Server, then copy it to the workstation(s) where the Taskmaster Webclient Upload service is installed.
