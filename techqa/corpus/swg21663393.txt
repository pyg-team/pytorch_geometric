Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The customer is getting an error logging in after being logged out while using the Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center (DC) console
. 

SYMPTOM
The customer gets the following error message when logging in after a time-out of the console session: 

 * 
 * Error 500
   javax.servlet.Servletexception:javax.servlet.servletexception: 
   unsepecified service: null
   


The log shows a stack with a SocketTimeoutException, whose root cause is an AsyncTimeoutException. 
CAUSE
This occurs when the Decision Center Session Management section settings are configured differently from having: 

 * "Override session management" checked. 
 * "security integration" unchecked.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify in the WAS administrative console that your Decision Center settings are those above. 

See the WAS documentation at "Reference > Settings > Session management settings [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/uprs_rsession_manager.html]" for more information.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the Decision Center settings to the ODM default in the WAS admin console under Session Management and restart the application: 

 * "Override session management" checked. 
 * "security integration" unchecked.
