QUESTION
 Is there a way to use the CQPerlExt.pm library on a remote server without installing ClearQuest? 

CAUSE
Sometimes users wants to build APIs that will use the CQPerlExt.pm Perl module in a machine that will point to a ClearQuest Server.

ANSWER
No. You must install ClearQuest to install the CQPerlExt.pm perl module. 

ClearQuest API needs to be able to talk to the ClearQuest Core which is part of the ClearQuest install. Even if you try to copy a subset of files from a ClearQuest install, it will still fail because the hook cannot connect with the core to execute it is action.
