QUESTION
 How can you find the WebSphere Portal process id? 

ANSWER
You can use one of the options below to find the process id for WebSphere Portal. 

SystemOut.log 

In the SystemOut.log file, search for the last occurrence of "Start Display Current Environment". The process id is displayed in the next line message.

This example (operating system Solaris 10) shows a process id 612:

************ Start Display Current Environment ************
WebSphere Platform 6.1 [ND 6.1.0.15 cf150808.12] running with process name ibm_cell\ibm_node\WebSphere_Portal and process id 612
Host Operating System is SunOS, version 5.10
Java version = 1.5.0_15, Java Compiler = null, Java VM name = Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
was.install.root = /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer
user.install.root = /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile
Java Home = /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre
ws.ext.dirs = ...
Classpath = ...
Java Library path = ...
************* End Display Current Environment *************

startServer.log

In the startServer.log file, search for the last occurrence of "ADMU3000I". The process id is displayed in the same message.

This example shows a process id 612:

[9/4/08 17:24:30:520 EDT] 0000000a AdminTool A ADMU3000I: Server WebSphere_Portal open for e-business; process id is 612

WebSphere_Portal.pid

In the same directory as startServer.log, the file WebSphere_Portal.pid also contains the current process id.
