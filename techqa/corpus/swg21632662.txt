QUESTION
 Need to install ITM for working with Maximo. How can IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) for Maximo agent can be installed? 

CAUSE
Need to monitor Maximo Asset Management solution using ITM.

ANSWER
Tivoli Monitoring is a product that is independent of Maximo Asset Management. However, by using Tivoli Monitoring and the Monitoring Agent for Maximo, you can monitor aspects of your Maximo Asset Management infrastructure and applications. The aspects that you can monitor include server memory statistics, cron tasks, user connections, database connections, installed products and licenses, cron tasks, and other system information.

You can monitor systems on other operating systems but the software for IBM Tivoli Monitoring itself must be installed on a Windows server. 

For Maximo 7.x only If you are on version 7.1.1.6 or higher in the 7.x stream you will be able to use ITM Maximo agent.

ITM for Maximo agent will be installed in a distributed configuration where Maximo are administered through remote deployment and you will need to rebuild and redeploy the Maximo EAR files in order for the Maximo agent to communicate with WebSphere. The ITM machine will contain the remote agent which monitors Maximo application and a specific JVM per each instance created for the agent. You may have multiple instances of Maximo agent on a ITM Windows-based machine. 

Once you have installed ITM successfully, extract the Maximo agent to a temporary folder (<TEMPORARY SUBDIRECTORY>). After extracting the agent archive to a temporary location, open a command prompt window and navigate to this directory:

<TEMPORARY SUBDIRECTORY>\ITM Agent for Maximo\agentbuilder\install\agents\maximo

Ensure that CANDLE_HOME is set. For example:

set CANDLE_HOME=<Your IBM ITM root folder> (e.g. C:\IBM\ITM). 

Then run the following command:

installIraAgent.bat <Your IBM ITM root folder>) 

The command will indicate success or failure.

The ITM Maximo agent will support TEP (Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server) and TEMS (Tivoli Enterprise Management Server). You will need to install the Support Files for them. The support files for the Maximo agent are available for all ITM supported platforms. For installing the Support Files, on the TEPS and TEMS machine, extract the agent archive to a temp location (<TEMPORARY SUBDIRECTORY>). After extracting the agent archive to a temporary location, open a command prompt window and navigate to this directory :

<TEMPORARY SUBDIRECTORY>\ITM Agent for Maximo\agentbuilder\install\agents\maximo

Ensure that CANDLE_HOME is set. For example:

set CANDLE_HOME=<Your IBM ITM root folder> (e.g. C:\IBM\ITM). 

Ensure as well that the PATH environment variable include <CANDLE_HOME>/<arch>/ms/bin path. 

To install TEMS support, run the following command:

installIraAgentTEMS.bat <Your IBM ITM root folder> 

Then recycle the TEMS machine.
.
To install TEPS support, run the following command:

installIraAgentTEPS.bat <Your IBM ITM root folder>

Then recycle the TEPS machine.

Now that the installation is finished, proceed with the configuration of ITM for Maximo Agent product.
