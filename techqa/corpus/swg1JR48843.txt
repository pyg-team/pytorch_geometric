ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a rule of an item is deleted during the step dedicated to
   rule management in the workflow and then the workflow is
   cancelled (the user chose to cancel his modification by not
   validating the step), a defect occurs when the corresponding
   item is put again in a workflow.
   
   The defect is the following, the rule that has been deleted is
   not visible in the rule list of the item and thus cannot be
   edited. This is due to a desynchronization of Operational
   Decision Management (ODM) branches.
   
   To reproduce this issue the following steps can be used:
   
   - Check out an item with rules in a workflow allowing to edit
   rules, then open the step allowing to edit the rules and chose
   a rule to delete
   In Decision Center (ODM), the merge tool indicates that the
   'Main' and 'Dev' branches are synchronized, which is normal.
   - In InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaborative Edition
   (MDM CE), delete the rule by clicking on the Delete button.
   The Rule is deleted.
   - In Decision Center (ODM), the merge tool now indicates that
   there is a difference between the 'Main' and 'Dev' branches.
   That is normal.
   - In MDM CE, choose to go on the Fixit step by clicking on the
   corresponding button
   - Then, click on the Fixit link to go into the corresponding
   step
   - Click on 'Check-in' to put the item out of the workflow
   - Then edit the item to see its rule list
   The two initial rules are visible and that is normal because
   the deletion has not been committed.
   -  In Decision Center (ODM), the merge tool now indicates that
   there is a difference between the 'Main' and 'Dev' branches.
   That is normal.
   -  In MDM CE, check out the item again in order to be able to
   change its rules.
   => Only one rule appears. That indicating the defect.
   All the initial rules (of the 'Main' branch) should appear.
   In Decision Center (ODM), the merge tool now indicates that
   there is a difference between the 'Main' and 'Dev' branches.
   
   At this step, both branches should be exactly the same.
   The list of rules on both branches should be exactly the same
   than the initial list of rules on 'Main' branch.
   
   In other words, 'Main' branch should have been replicated on
   'Dev' branch.
