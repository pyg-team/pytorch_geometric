APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When certain users attempt to view an interview from their My
   Holds page, the questions come up but there is also a message
   that says "You cannot access this page because you do not have
   the required permissions. Contact your Atlas System
   Administrator". Under this message are the "Submit Response" and
    "Save as Draft" buttons. When they submit a response, the
   response does get recorded.
   
   In IE, the page shows up fine. The issue appears only with
   Firefox and Chrome.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the link in the email to respond, or use IE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *    When a user who does not have read permission for matters
   views an interview from the My Holds page, the interview page
   loads along with an incorrect error message, "You cannot access
   this page because you do not have the required permissions". If
   the user answers the interview and clicks Submit, the response
   is correctly recorded and saved. This issue happens only on
   Firefox and Chrome browsers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.7.
