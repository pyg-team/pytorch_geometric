APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently JDBC drivers must be located either in the
   shared-classes directory, or in a jarsURL set on the JDBC
   configurable service. This means that an application developer
   must have administrative access to the filesystem in order to
   enable a JDBC driver on a system.
   
   This APAR introduces a new property on the JDBC configurable
   service names useDeployedJars. When set to true this allows the
   JDBC manager to use the EgSharedClassLoader to access JDBC
   drivers which include access to both deployed jars and jars in
   the shared classloader / jarsURL.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus version 10 or higher using
   JDBC.
   
   
   Platforms affected:

   the shared classloader / jarsURL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds the property "usedDeployedJars" to the
   JDBCProvider configurable service definition. If this is set to
   true then the classloader containing deployed classes will be
   searched when attempting to load the JDBC client jars.
