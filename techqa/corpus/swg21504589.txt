 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does Inspector show a linkage type of Autolink-SS and not Autolink-MS? There is a record that is linking into an Entity as a result of a Member from a different source and does not score high enough with another record from the same source. 

ANSWER
If there are any members in the Entity from the same source you will get an Autolink-SS even if the target Member linking is from a different source because a same source link exists within the Entity.
