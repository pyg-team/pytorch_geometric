APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows
   
   Problem Description:  During startup of the agent it makes three
   separate calls for a 'Global' snapshot to determine the counters
   needed to monitor.   These 'Global' calls are very expensive
   Windows operations that take a long time to process.  To speed
   up this startup the code should only request snapshots of the
   counters it needs.  This reduces the amount of data that has to
   be retrieved and processed.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:  On a heavy loaded system,
   start the agent and monitor the CPU spike and length that is
   occuring for the kntcma process.  This CPU spike is the
   processing of the 'Global' snapshots.
