Title: IBM Exceeding length limitation in fields of active processes causes SQLCODE=-302 or ORA-12899 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you model an ACTIVITY in a business process in WebSphere Integration Developer, length limitations apply to the DisplayName, Name, Description, and Documentation properties fields. You might receive SQLCODE=-302 or ORA-12899 exceptions. 

SYMPTOM
The following length limitations apply to the DisplayName, Name, Description, and Documentation properties fields: 

 * DisplayName: 64 bytes 
 * Name: 220 bytes 
 * Description: 254 bytes 
 * Documentation is 4096 bytes
   


In the following scenario, an exception is issued when these conditions are met:  *  The database code set is UTF-8. Double-byte character set (DBCS) characters are used for one or more of the DisplayName, Name, Description, and Documentation properties. When the characters are converted, their length exceeds the limitations. 


The following exceptions are seen: 

Business Process Choreographer database (BPEDB ) is DB2 
------Start of DE processing------ = Yxxxxx GMT, 
key = com.ibm.db2.jcc.a.in
com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJccPreparedStatement.pmiExecuteUpdate 807
Exception = com.ibm.db2.jcc.a.in
Source = com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJccPreparedStatement.pmiExecuteUpdate
probeid = 807
Stack Dump = com.ibm.db2.jcc.a.in: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-302,
SQLSTATE=22001, SQLERRMC=null, DRIVER=3.52.95 


BPEDB is Oracle 
------Start of DE processing------ = ...., key 
= java.sql.SQLException com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcPreparedStateme
nt.pmiExecuteUpdate 807
Exception = java.sql.SQLException
Source = com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcPreparedStatement.pmiExecuteUp
date 
probeid = 807
Stack Dump = java.sql.SQLException: ORA-12899: Value too large for column "%s"."%s"."%s" (actual: %d, maximum: %d) 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebSphere Process Server has a length limitation for these property fields. The length limitations are in the database schema, which must not be changed. If the schema is changed, Business Process Choreographer might not work correctly. This problem applies to all database systems. 

To resolve the problem, set the DisplayName, Name, Description, and Documentation fields in WebSphere Integration Developer to a length that is less than the limit.
