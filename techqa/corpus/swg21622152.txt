QUESTION
 Tivoli EIF probe : Why does the probe stall? 

CAUSE
The Tivoli EIF probe will use all available resources and needs to be tuned to manage these resources for the specific platform and load characteristics

ANSWER
The Tivoli EIF probe can sometimes stall under excessive load. This can be managed using a number of methods, and avoided through spreading the load over multiple Tivoli EIF probe servers. 

Typically try using the following property settings:
EIFHeartBeatInterval: 30
EIFHeartBeatFailures: 2
and check that the probe user has a sufficiently high ulimit setting for the number of open files allowed.

Please refer to Support's Guide to the Tivoli EIF Probe for further guidance.
