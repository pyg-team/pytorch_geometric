APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When clicking on the solutions console OK button under the
   following path causes error.
   
   Global security > Federated repositories >Myldap
   
   CWWIM5020E Could not connect to the
   ldap://myldapserver.domain.com:389 repository using properties:
   ...Exception
   occurred: javax.naming.AuthenticationException.
   
   Since the bind password is pre-populated incorrectly in the
   VMM  page, the 'LDAP test query' page also gets pre-populated
   with the incorrect password and no query is successful.

   *                  who access the 'LDAP Test Query' page after *
   *                  configuring a federated repository on the   *

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The 'Bind password' is pre-populated in *
   *                      the LDAP page with the same value used  *
   *                      in                                      *
   *                      the VMM page and it's causing errors.   *

   ****************************************************************
   If the user clicks the Apply/Ok button under the following
   path, an authentication exception is thrown.
   Global security > Federated repositories >Myldap
   This occurs because the 'Bind password' field is being pre-
   populated with the string "*******". When changes are applied,
   the obfuscated password is passed in as the value for the
   password parameter causing an authentication error. Since the
   'LDAP test query' page pre-populates the 'Bind password' field
   the same way the VMM page does, the queries are also failing.
   To provide another level of security and to avoid issues with
   the password, we have made the 'Bind password' a required field
   in the 'LDAP test query' page. It will no longer be pre-
   populated. The VMM panel password issue was fixed under
   PI72154 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI72154].
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To provide another level of security and to avoid issues with
   the password, we have made the 'Bind password' a required field
   in the 'LDAP test query' page. It will no longer be pre-
   populated and the user must know the correct bind password in
   order to run a query. The VMM panel password issue was fixed
   under PI72154 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI72154].
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 7.0.0.43, 8.0.0.13, 8.5.5.12, and 9.0.0.3.  Please
