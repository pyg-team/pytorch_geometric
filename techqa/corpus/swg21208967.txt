Title: IBM Workflow utility fmczutil could not be loaded - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following error occurs when fmczutil is started:
# fmczutil
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program fmczutil because of the following errors:
0509-022 Cannot load module /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libfmckernl.a(share.o). 

CAUSE
Some symbolic links are missing in the installation directory /usr/lpp/fmc/lib (AIX) or /opt/fmc/lib (HP-UX, Solaris)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
With WebSphere® MQ Workflow 3.6 on AIX the error message looks like this: 

# fmczutil
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program fmczutil because of the following errors:
0509-022 Cannot load module /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libfmckernl.a(share.o).
0509-150 Dependent module libicuuc32.a could not be loaded.
0509-022 Cannot load module libicuuc32.a.
0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
0509-022 Cannot load module fmczutil.
0509-150 Dependent module /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libfmckernl.a(share.o) could not be loaded.
0509-022 Cannot load module .

The most likely reason for this situation is that the post-installation step "fmczinsx -o env" has not been called or that it encountered an error during its execution. Look at the logfile /var/fmc/fmczinsx.log (or /tmp/fmczinsx.log.tmp.<pid> ) to check this. When "fmczinsx -o env" was executed correctly, the following messages must appear in the log file:

FMC00160 16:41:21 Created a link in /usr/lpp/fmc/lib: libicudata32.a -> libicudata32.0.a
FMC00160 16:41:21 Created a link in /usr/lpp/fmc/lib: libicuuc32.a -> libicuuc32.0.a
FMC00160 16:41:21 Created a link in /usr/lpp/fmc/lib: libxml4c55.a -> libxml4c55.1.a
FMC00160 16:41:21 Created a link in /usr/lpp/fmc/lib: libXML4CMessages55.a -> libXML4CMessages55.1.a



With WebSphere® MQ Workflow 3.5 on AIX an error message like this one can occur:

# fmczutil
Could not load program fmczutil:
Could not load module /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libfmckernl.a(share.o).
Dependent module libicuuc24.a could not be loaded.
Could not load module libicuuc24.a.
Error was: No such file or directory

The most likely reason for this error is an incomplete installation, where some symbolic links are missing. On AIX, this can happen in a client-only installation. The solution on AIX is to additionally install the fileset fmc.server, or to manually provide the missing file names with the following statements:

ln -s /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libicuuc24.so /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libicuuc24.a
ln -s /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libicudata24.so /usr/lpp/fmc/lib/libicudata24.a
