Rational Agent Controller, Version 8.2.2 can be used to profile applications running in: 

 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V7.0 (including service releases), or other Java 1.6 applications. 
 * IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 (including service releases), or other Java 1.5 applications. 
 *  IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.0 (including service releases), or other Java 1.4 applications. Note: Profiling applications running on WebSphere Application Server, V6.0 (or other Java 1.4 applications) is only supported for Windows and Linux operating systems. For profiling on WebSphere Application Server version 6.0 (or other Java 1.4 applications) with other supported operating systems, use Rational Agent Controller version 7.x [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013420].
   
   


If you are profiling applications with the following products, you should use Rational Agent Controller v8.2.2 to get the latest defect fixes:  * Rational Application Developer v7.5.5.1 
 * Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software v7.5.5.1


You do not need to install Rational Agent Controller if the WebSphere Application Server is installed on the same computer as your development product. However, to remotely profile your applications, you must install Rational Agent Controller on the same computer as the WebSphere Application Server where you published your applications.
