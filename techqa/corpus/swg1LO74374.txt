   ------------------
   
   This issue is reproduced only when the Internet password is
   different with the Notes ID password.
   (When user open an encrypt message, user is required to input
   Notes ID password)
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Import Notes ID to iNotes Mail Db
   2. Set this user's internet password that is different with the
   Notes ID password
   3. Set to open preview pain on Inbox
   4. Receive a encrypt message
   5. Double clicking very quickly on this encrypt message(double
   clicking before displaying in preview pain)
   6. IE script error and iNotes console error are displayed
   
   This issue is not reproduced when
   - not using preview pain
   - Internet password and Notes ID password are the same
