ABENDS5C6 00D1032A rba CSQJ113E archive offload CSQJR003 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your WebSphere MQ (WMQ) queue manager abends with : 

IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED: 
DUMPID=002 REQUESTED BY JOB (MV1PMSTR) 
DUMP TITLE=MV1P,ABN=5C6-00D1032A,U=user ,C=component.release.RLMC-CS 
QJLGR ,M=CSQJRE01,LOC=CSQJL002.CSQJR003+0820

Reason 00D1032A means that a LOG READ failed, because the BSDS does not map a specified RBA into any active or archive data set. 

CAUSE
The active data set that contains the specified RBA is no longer available. Archiving was not turned on; CSQ6LOPG had set OFFLOAD(NO). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Alter the logging parameters in CSQ6LOPG; specify OFFLOAD(YES). 

 Follow the directions in "Tailor your system parameter module [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fzs10540_.htm]" to turn on archiving. If you do not archive, you can not guarantee that data will be recovered in the event of a system or transaction error. 

 

Note that for levels of the product at or above WebSphere MQ V6 this may also be resolved by : 

 * setting OFFLOAD=YES, or 
 * increasing the size of your active log datasets to hold several minutes of persistent data (during peak workloads) - refer to MP16 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24007421] or, 
 * increasing the number of active logs so that three checkpoints can take place before a unit of work can roll-off the active logs.
