Title: IBM Missing Image in PDF reports but HTML reports show the same image in Cognos Analytics - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a report in HTML format, report shows the custom images being used in the report. However, PDF version of the same report does not show the same images. 

SYMPTOM
Due to Single Sign On (SSO) being used and applied to the images directory where the used images were stored, the permissions didn't exist for all users running the report to access the images. 


Therefore, during the rendering phase in report generation, file system level authentication fails and hence disallowing the access to the images in the directory.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are several possible ways to resolve this issue:

Allow anonymous access to the directory where the images are located
Allow anonymous access to the virtual folder referenced by the web server

Steps for IIS 7 and above:

1. Open IIS Manager and navigate to the Browse to the image folder location or virtual folder you want to manage. 

2. In Features View, double-click Authentication.

3. On the Authentication page, select Anonymous Authentication.

4. In the Actions pane, click Enable to use Anonymous authentication with the default settings.

See your webserver documentation for all other vendors.

Modify the access control list at file system level (or file security/permissions in Windows) to provide the list of users who will be running the reports as well as user accounts that will be used to start the report server component of Cognos 

Ensure these users (or group(s) they belong to) are listed as having at least read access to these images.
