   instances.

      e.g Change the data value of one of the instance available in
       following path in registry key.
          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SQL
   Server
       \\Instance Names\\SQL
   2.Double click on SQL template in the IBM Monitoring GUI
   3.Check the list of server instances in "configure Database
   Agent"
   dialog entries
