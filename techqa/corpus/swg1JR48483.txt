ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Assume  a variable is made available for search by checking
   "available in search" box in a snapshot and subsequently if it
   is made unavailable in the next snapshot by unchecking the box.
   One might expect in the process portal the variable will no
   longer be shown as part of dropdown menu of "busniess data" but
   in reality it does show and it is working as designed.
   
   
   This is working as designed.  In 7.5, the "Available for Search"
    business data across ALL snapshots is available in the search
   dialog.
   
   Starting in 7.5.1.1, it is possible to limit the business data
   fields to only the fields that are used in actual instances.
   You can turn this on in 7.5.1.1+ by setting
   <use-business-aliases-for-process-instances> to true in
   99Local.xml/100Custom.xml.
   
   
   
   The use of tag <use-business-aliases-for-process-instances> is
   only applicable to v7.x release on 7.5.1.1 and higher.  It is
   not applicable to v8.x release.  In v8+, the search definition
   functionality was moved to Saved Search Admin in Process Admin
   console.  Saved Search Admin only displays business data fields
   that are used in actual instances (not configurable).  We can
   use the same doc APAR to document the Saved Search Admin
   behavior in v8+.
   
   In summary, in 7.5.1.1 and higher, for previously used business
   data fields to not show up, customer would have to purge the old
   BPD instances that used the fields.
