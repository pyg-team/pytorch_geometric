QUESTION
 How do you view Specification and Implementation files of external source code in IBM Rational Rhapsody post Reverse Engineering? 

CAUSE
You have a Specification and Implementation file with the same name and after reverse engineering these files into Rational Rhapsody you would like to view both the files in the model

ANSWER
Reverse engineering process is capable of reverse engineering Specification and Implementation files with the same name into Rational Rhapsody but will display the file as a single element in the model

However the Implementation and Specification files of the element can be viewed in the model as Source Artifacts

To enable Source Artifacts view in the model:


 1. Open the model in Rational Rhapsody
    
    
 2. Select the package containing the reverse engineered files
    
    
 3. Navigate to View > Browser Display Options > Show Source Artifacts to display the source artifacts in the model
