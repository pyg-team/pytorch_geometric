APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS Configuration Manager issues message 'Request failed' if
   the server authentication fails.
   Additional symptoms:
     When keying in option
        2 CICS Resources
   under the CICS Configuration Manager - Primary Menu,
        "Request Failed"
   appears in the upper right corner.
   .
   After pressing <PF1>, the following message appears:
        The socket request failed with the following:
        Return Code 255, Reason Code 255, Task No. 0.
   A CICS trace has the following error:
        XS FE04 XSSB  *EXC*
          FUNCTION(INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA)
          RESPONSE(EXCEPTION)
          REASON(UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE)
          SAF_RESPONSE(8)
          SAF_REASON(0)
          ESM_RESPONSE(30)
          ESM_REASON(0)
   .
     In module DFHXSSB,
   CICS has a table of SAF_RESPONSE and ESM_RESPONSE codes
   that it recgongizes and will handle.
     It does not have SAF(8) ESM(30) as a supported combination.
   The manual
      External Security Interface (RACROUTE)
        Macro Reference for MVS
   indicates that combination (8/30) means that
   the user is not authorised for that 'port of entry'.
   .
     'Port of Entry' refers to the Terminal, JES Input or Console
   by which the user originally contacted the MVS system.
     The VTAM NETNAME used when access is made over IP
   from the CICS CM user interface to the CICS CM server region.
   is "*DEFAULT".
     But, if all accounts are limited to a specific VTAM NETNAME
   that they are allowed to use, this won't match.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Allow all users access to the system
   from "*DEFAULT" as a VTAM NETNAME.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of CICS Configuration Manager.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Client shows invalid error message      *
   *                      'Request failed' for a rejected         *
   *                      aithentication request.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If the external security manager (ESM), such as RACF, rejects a
   request from the CICS CM ISPF client due to invalid user ID or
   password, the client dispalys the correct message "Authorization
   failed". However, if the ESM rejects the request for other
   reasons, the client displays the misleading message "Request
   failed", with invalid return code, reason code and task number
   fields.
   These other reasons include rejection due to application
   protection, terminal protection, security categories, security
   labels or security levels.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  If the ESM rejects a request from the CICS CM ISPF client for
   any reason, the client will now display the correct message
   "Authorization failed".
