QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM HTTP Server 7, 8, and 8.5 for Host On-Demand V12 and above on z/OS? 

CAUSE
Host On-Demand (HOD) is supported on the IBM HTTP Server (IHS) powered by Apache and is not documented in the Knowledge Center for Host On-Demand V12. This technote addresses the configuration for the IBM HTTP Server V7, V8, and V8.5 (powered by Apache 2.2) only, not V9 (powered by Apache 2.4).

ANSWER
This configuration is for Host On-Demand Version 12 and above only. 

Add the following configuration statements to the httpd.conf file for the IBM HTTP Server to support the downloading of Host On-Demand clients on z/OS. 

These statements assume the default install location /usr/lpp/HOD/hostondemand and the alias of hod. 

Modify the statements if installed in a different path or using a different alias. Add them towards the end of the httpd.conf file. 


<Location /hod/ > 
CharsetSourceEnc ISO8859-1
CharsetDefault ISO8859-1
</Location> 

Alias /hod/ "/usr/lpp/HOD/hostondemand/HOD/"
<Directory "/usr/lpp/HOD/hostondemand/HOD/">
Options MultiViews -Includes FollowSymLinks 
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

Add these AddType statements. 

AddType application/x-java-jnlp-file .jnlp 
AddType multipart/x-zip .jar 

If you want to configure a user-defined publish directory for your customized html pages, add the following statements prior to the <Location /> statement above. 

<Location /publish/ > 
CharsetSourceEnc ISO8859-1
CharsetDefault ISO8859-1
</Location> 
Alias /publish/ "/usr/lpp/userpublish/" 

After making any changes to the httpd.conf file, you will need to stop and restart the server. 

Before the clients access the Host On-Demand server to download the client, you might need to clear the browser cache, Java cache, and remove any client on the machine.
