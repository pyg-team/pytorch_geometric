APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity: 2
   Approver: Hua Ming Zhong
   Compid: 5724B96SO
   
   Environment:
   All supported windows and non-windows OS versions
   Sybase server ASE versions 15.0, 15.7, 16.0
   ITCAM for Applications Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server
   v06.20.01.00
   
   Problem Description:
   Sybase agent logs an error for DBCCON cursor when the sa_role is
   not granted.
   The cursor uses Sybase trace flag 8399, which require sa_role
   for successful execution.
   In investigation we found that "Sybase trace flag 8399" is not
   required to be set.
   Removing code setting this flag should avoid errors in log file.
   
   Detailed Re-creation Procedure:
   1. Install sybase agent on windows or non-windows platform.
   2. Configure sybase agent with the IBM Tivoli Monitoring user
   with non sa_role.
   3. Observe the collector logs for the error: Interval collection
   failed for cursor DBCCON.
   
   
   Related Files and Output:
   Interval collection failed for DBCCON cursor with below error in
   collector logs

   role(s) to execute this command/procedure: 'sa_role' . Please
   contact a user with the appropriate role for help.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable the DBCCON cursor. Agent level 3 has tested the change
   and there is no impact to the agent's normal behavior. Comment
   out the relevant lines in koycoll.ctl by preceding them with
   double semi-colons.
   Example:
   ;;cursor DBCCON;
   ;; interval 64000;
   ;; once;
   ;; math decimal 0 INT01 0;
   ;; insert_select
   ;; dbcc traceon(8399);
   
   ;;INSERT INTO DBCCON
   ;; (INT01)
   ;; VALUES
   ;; (:INT!INT01);
   
   Restart the agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Sybase agent logs an error for DBCCON cursor when the sa_role is
    not granted.
   The cursor uses Sybase trace flag 8399, which require sa_role
   for successful execution.
   In investigation we found that "Sybase trace flag 8399" is not
   required to be set.
   Removing code setting this flag should avoid errors in log file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Made the required code change to fix the unwanted flag.
