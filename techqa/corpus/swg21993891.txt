PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users are unable to hear the audio tests on a Windows computer. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For testing we would recommend using either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox for the audio assessments. Unfortunately, our audio based assessments are not compatible with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge (Windows 10). 

***Please Note***
If using Windows 10, users need to type "Internet Explorer" in the search box at the bottom left-hand corner of your screen, ensuring that they have selected the blue “e” icon with gold halo.

Below are the troubleshooting steps that should assist users with the Audio for their test:
