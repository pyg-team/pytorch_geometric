Title: IBM Increase the Heap size for DVS testing in Rule Studio - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I increase the heap size of the JVM used to run Decision Validation Services (DVS) tests in Rule Studio? 

CAUSE
When running DVS tests from Rule Studio against a local Scenario Service Provider (SSP) service, the environment is subject to the memory limitations of the running Eclipse JVM. 

You may encounter the following error: 

ilog.rules.dvs.util.IlrDVSLogger error
SEVERE: scenario provider or scenario execution threw exception !
adding an error to the report java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space


ANSWER
Use Java options, -Xms (initial heap size) and -Xmx (maximum heap size), to increase the heap size of the JVM used to launch the DVS test. 

As you will be changing the default heap configuration of the JVM, we recommend that you designate a separate JRE for the DVS tests to avoid modifying the workspace default JVM options, which may impact other run configurations. 

Follow the steps below: 

 1. In the DVS run configuration, under the JRE tab, select Alternate JRE. Click Installed JREs

 2. Select a jdk of your choice and click Duplicate
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427125&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427125&aid=2]
    
    
 3. Set Default VM arguments: use Java options, -Xms and -Xmx, to tune the JVM heap size. Name the new JRE. Click Finish. 
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427125&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427125&aid=3]
    
    
 4. Click OK in the Preferences window. 
 5.  In the Run Configuration window, select the newly added JRE. Click Apply and Run.
