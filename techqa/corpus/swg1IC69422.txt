ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware: 3.8.0
   
   Description:
   After running a test case with MQ FSH, there are many TCP
   connections in the close-wait state. There are also many
   connections to the MQ-QM. The transactions using these
   connections will not complete. That may prevent
   creation of any new connections if the total limit has been
   reached.

   wait. This happens when MQ FSH has put queue and some error
   happens in MQ URLOpener, which using same MQ QM as MQ FSH.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Enhance error handling code in MQ FSH to avoid connection leak.
   This fix will be available in 3.7.2.13, 3.7.3.12, 3.8.0.6,
