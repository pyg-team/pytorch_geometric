ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deployment Manager: When you try to search for assets of class
   "Event", the query in FileNet Deployment Manager never
   terminates.
   
      Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Create a search for Events in ACCE
   2. Run FDM and create new Manifest in an environment
   3. In the Add Assets for this Manifest, locate the search
   context.
   4. Copy / paste the search SQL from ACCE into FDM
   5. Run this search
   
      Actual Results:
   FDM hangs and never returns any results.  You have to cancel out
   of the search.
   
      Expected Results:
   FDM would ignore any audit events that were returned in the
   search result, with a warning in the log about an unsupported
   object type in the search result.  The search result would be
   zero objects found.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers using Content Engine 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 and prior *
   * searching for assets to add to an export manifest in FDM.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * FileNet Deployment Manager export manifest search operation  *
   * will not function correctly when the search only retrieves   *
   * objects, such as audit event instances, that are not         *
   * supported for export.  The search would loop and never       *
   * terminate.                                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.1.4-P8CPE-FP004 or later.                     *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.4-P8CPE-FP004 and later.  This FileNet Deployment
   Manager export manifest search problem was resolved by modifying
   the code to check whether search had completed without returning
   any selectable objects.
