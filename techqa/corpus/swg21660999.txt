Title: IBM ncp_p_monitor fails to start after Fix Pack installation - United States

Text:
Failed to start the HTTP service; ncp_p_monitor; Failed to read the HTTPD configuration file; V40456 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ncp_p_monitor fails to start after applying Netcool/OMNIbus 7.4 Fix Pack 2. 

SYMPTOM
The ncp_p_monitor fails with the following error messages: 

2013-10-30T09:49:11: Error: E-NHT-102-094: Failed to read the HTTPD
configuration file 'D:\IBM\Tivoli\Netcool/etc/libnhttpd.json'. (2:No
such file or directory).
2013-10-30T09:49:11: Error: E-UNK-000-000: Failed to start the HTTP
service. (2:No such file or directory)
2013-10-30T09:49:11: Warning: W-RIV-002-128: [5712t] CMonitorProbe.cc
(718) Failed to create session to the Object Server: general failure
2013-10-30T09:49:11: Fatal: F-RIV-002-208: [5712t] CMonitorProbe.cc
(567) Exit function called Unable to connect to OBJ_A ObjectServer,
exiting ...



CAUSE
 

After applying FP2, there is a fix for APAR IV40456, where a new json file is added to the library in the location $NCHOME/omnibus/etc/libnhttpd.json.

By default, ncp_p_monitor checks the location $NCHOME/etc. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must add the following property to the ncp_p_monitor properties file "nco_p_ncpmonitor.props" : 

 
NHttpd.ConfigFile: "%NCHOME%\\omnibus\\etc\\libnhttpd.json" 

After this, restart the monitor.
