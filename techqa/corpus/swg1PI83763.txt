APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A LINK request from one program to another passes a COMMAREA
   address of x'40404040'.  CICS attempts to read this address in
   order to copy back a reply from the program, resulting in
   an expected abend0c4.  This is then followed by:
   
   DFHPG0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset
   X'4908' in module DFHPGLE.
   
   CICS recovery routine makes another attempt to run the
   copy_back_commarea logic in DFHPGLE.  This takes an identical
   abend0c4 which results in the PGLE recovery routine to exit and
   percolate without completely unstacking the PLCB. This leads to:
   DFHPG0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at
   offset x'A512' in module DFHPGIS.
   
   The trace domain table entry becomes corrupt while DFHPGHM was
   in control. The DFHTR domain table entry no longer points at
   the TR anchor block. Program checks occur in all attempts to
   write a trace entry.  Recursive abends occur requiring restart
   of the CICS region.
   
   DFHDU0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset
   x'0C06' in module DFHDUDT.
   DFHDU0001 An abend (code 0C6/AKEA) has occurred at offset
   x'0C06' in module DFHDUDT.
   
   This APAR will update the DFHPGLE recovery routine.

   ****************************************************************
   An application program issues an EXEC CICS LINK to a second
   program, passing it a COMMAREA. The commarea address is in
   read only storage, outside the DSA.
   CICS copies the commarea into storage that can be read and
   written to by the receiving program, and on completion of
   that program attempts to copy the commarea back to its
   original location, resulting in a 0C4.
   The DFHPGLE recovery routine is driven, and makes a further
   attempt to copy back the commarea, resulting in another S0C4.
   This terminates the pglerec recovery routine, leaving the
   PLCB chain in a corrupt state.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHPGLE has been changed so that only one attempt is made
   to copy back the commarea.
