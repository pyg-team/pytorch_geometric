Title: IBM Using ICC to add IBM Lotus Notes mailbox folder structure into IBM FileNet P8 object store - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I append the folder and sub-folder structure from a Lotus Notes user mailbox into a FileNet P8 object store using IBM Content Collector (ICC)? 

CAUSE
As documented in the 'Email system metadata properties' section in ICC Infocenter (linked below), using ICC "P8 File Document in Folder" task, the option <Email,Folder> is not always available. 

ANSWER
The folder name will only be extracted if a folder 'include' or 'exclude' has been specified, as that forces ICC to take a less efficient approach in processing the mailbox and traversing the folders instead of just performing a database search. 

To append the folder and sub-folder structure, specify a non-existent folder 'exclude' (e.g. /thisFolderWillNeverExist/ ) in the collector task.

Also, because a document may exist in a Notes view, the view name will be extracted if a document is not found in any folder.
