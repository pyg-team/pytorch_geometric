   * EQUIVALENT ABSTRACT:
   MQM400 MQV5 DSPMQMQ _ CHGMQMQ DISPLAY DIFFERENT EVENT VALUES
   *
   While using the DSPMQMQ command to view the values for the
   performance events fields, the enduser noticed that the
   values were different from the CHGMQMQ command. Below is
   an example of the correct data displayed by the DSPMQMQ command:
   DSPMQMQ SYSTEM.ADMIN.PERFM.EVENT plus F4=prompt :-
   Queue full events enabled  . . :   *YES
   Queue high events enabled  . . :   *NO
   Queue low events enabled . . . :   *NO
   CHGMQMQ displays all values as *YES.
   CHGMQMQ is writing correct values for changed fields
   but displaying inverted values for HIGHEVT and LOWEVT.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While using the DSPMQMQ command to view the values for the
   performance events fields, the enduser noticed that the
   values were different from the CHGMQMQ command. Below is
   an example of the correct data displayed by the DSPMQMQ command:
   DSPMQMQ SYSTEM.ADMIN.PERFM.EVENT plus F4=prompt :-
   Queue full events enabled  . . :   *YES
   Queue high events enabled  . . :   *NO
   Queue low events enabled . . . :   *NO
   CHGMQMQ displays all values as *YES.
   CHGMQMQ is writing correct values for changed fields
   but displaying inverted values for HIGHEVT and LOWEVT.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Commands CHGMQMQ, CPYMQMQ and CRTMQMQ will display the correct
   prompt override values for parameters HIGHEVT and LOWEVT.
