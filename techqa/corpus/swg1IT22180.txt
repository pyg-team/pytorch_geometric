APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DISPLAY CHSTATUS(CHANNEL_NAME) shows an '*' for the MCAUSER
   instead of the correct userid to which it is set.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The USERSRC() value on the rule can be changed to USERSRC(MAP)
   (which is the default value) and then set the MCAUSER parameter
   on the rule to the same value as the CLNTUSER().  For example,
   instead of setting the rule with the command:
   
   SET CHLAUTH('My.Channel.SVC') TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('User123')
        USERSRC(CHANNEL) CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED) ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   you use the following command instead :
   
   SET CHLAUTH('My.Channel.SVC') TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('User123')
   MCAUSER('User123') CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED) ACTION(REPLACE)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere MQ V8 and IBM MQ V9 who
   use multiplexed channels together with the queue manager setting
   ChlauthEarlyAdopt=y.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The DISPLAY CHSTATUS(CHANNEL_NAME) shows an '*' for the MCAUSER
   instead of the correct userid to which it is set.
   A race condition occurs in channel initialisation
   caused at a point where the channel status is progressing
   through a sequence of states. Normally, the MCAUSER in the
   channel status is temporarily set to the user defined on  the
   channel (e.g. NOACCESS), then later updated to the correct
   (adopted) user id (e.g. User123).
   
   We see the problematic case when multiple conversations are
   starting concurrently.  There is a timing window when a
   conversation has set MCAUSER status to the  temporary user
   (NOACCESS) and another conversation begins.  When this
   happens, MQ compares the conversation userid with the
   userid in channel status, realizes they are different and
   incorrectly sets the overall MCAUSER for the channel status
   to "*".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ channel code has been modified to ensure the MCAUSER
   in the channel status is updated correctly when this timing
   condition
   arises.
