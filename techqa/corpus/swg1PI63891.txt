APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario where users access controls are changed whilst they
   have a DOORS session running and the change requires a DOORS
   refresh to be implemented.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create  userA
   2. Login as user A and create a project or folder and create a
   module under it.
   3. Close the module but user A userA keeps the module displayed
   in the right pane and folder selected in the left pane.
   4. Login as other admin user.
   5. Open the Project/FOLDER property and unselect "inherit from
   parent" option.
       Add userA with R access to the project/folder .
   6. As userA open the module in exclusive edit mode in  the same
   DOORS session. UserA can open with exclusive edit mode, even
   though the user does not write permission any more.
   userA can edit attributes and successfully save the changes.
   
   
   If userA selects F5 and performs a refresh the access controls
   should be updated and the next time userA tries to open the
   module they receive message: "You have insufficient access
   rights to open this module for edit" Options to open read only
   or cancel.
