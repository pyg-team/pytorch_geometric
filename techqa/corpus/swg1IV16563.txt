APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The documentation for setting up ssl with the SAM 5620 probe is
   lacking.  The email probe should be used as a guideline as to
   what this doc should look like for setting up ssl
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the doc for the email probe as it has more complete
   information on setting up ssl.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the Probe for Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM JMS       *
   * wishing to connect to the server using SSL.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * There is currently insufficent information regarding         *
   * connecting to the Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM server using SSL.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The existing *Configuring SSL* topic Will be replaced with   *
   * the following topic:                                         *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * *Configuring the SSL connection*                             *
   * ================================                             *
   * The Probe for Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM can use SSL to secure  *
   * a remote connection                                          *
   * to the 5620 SAM server.                                      *
   * For general details of JMS connections over SSL guidelines,  *
   * see                                                          *
   * https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JMSOverSSL?_sscc=t.         *
   *                                                              *
   * *Creating the keystore file*                                 *
   * -----------------------------                                *
   * A Java keystore file is required for this HTTPS connection,  *
   * access to which is                                           *
   * specified using the CertificateStore and                     *
   * CertificateStorePassword properties. The                     *
   * keystore file can be created using the Java keytool command. *
   * The following                                                *
   * example keytool commands create a suitable keystore file and *
   * lists the trusted CA                                         *
   * certificates it contains:                                    *
   *                                                              *
   * keytool -genkey -alias sslclientcert -keyalg RSA -keystore   *
   * alcatelsam.jks -keysize 2048                                 *
   * keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias sslclientcert -file     *
   * alcatelclient.cert -keystore alcatelsam.jks                  *
   * keytool -list -v -keystore alcateload.jks                    *
   *                                                              *
   * These commands perform the following operations:             *
   * 1. Extracts the root CA and provider certificate from the    *
   * EMS server's Java                                            *
   * keystore to create the client Java keystore.                 *
   *                                                              *
   * 2. Imports the required root CA and Issuing CA certificates  *
   * into the probe's Java                                        *
   * keystore alcatelsam.jks to ensure the certificate is         *
   * trusted.                                                     *
   *                                                              *
   * 3. Lists the trusted CA certificates in the probe's Java     *
   * keystore.                                                    *
   *                                                              *
   * To set a password for the probe's Java keystore, use the     *
   * following command:                                           *
   * keytool -storepasswd -new new_storepass -keystore            *
   * alcatelsam.jks                                               *
   * Setting the probe properties for SSL connections             *
   *                                                              *
   * To enable the probe to use the SSL connection, you must set  *
   * the UseSSL property                                          *
   * to true and you must configure the HTTPPort property to use  *
   * the Alcatel SAM                                              *
   * HTTPS port. The default Alcatel SAM HTTPS port is 8443.      *
   *                                                              *
   * You must also configure the following probe properties:      *
   * - CertificateStoreType - this property specifies the type of *
   * certificate obtained from the keystore; in this example, it  *
   * is JKS.                                                      *
   * - CertificateStore - this property specifies the path of the *
   * probe's Java keystore that you created.                      *
   * - CertificateStorePassword - this property specifies the     *
   * password that you set for the Java keystore.                 *
   * - TrustStore - this should be the same value as that set for *
   * the CertificateStore property.                               *
   * - TrustStorePassword - this should be the same value as that *
   * set for the CertificateStorePassword property.               *
   *                                                              *
   * For full details of these properties, see Properties and     *
   * command line options.                                        *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * *Example SSL configuration property settings*                *
   * ---------------------------------------------                *
   * The following example shows SSL configuration settings from  *
   * the properties file of                                       *
   * an example Probe for Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM:                *
   * Host : "198.162.20.21"                                       *
   * HTTPPort : 8443                                              *
   * UseSSL : "true"                                              *
   * CertificateStoreType : "JKS"                                 *
   * CertificateStore :                                           *
   * "/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/probes/keystore/alcatelsam. *
   * jks"                                                         *
   * CertificateStorePassword : "ECEDBJAGBJFHGD"                  *
   * TrustStore :                                                 *
   * "/opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/omnibus/probes/keystore/alcatelsam. *
   * jks"                                                         *
