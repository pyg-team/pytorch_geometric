PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Process Designer under a Romanian locale preference setting, a few of the strings in the UI are in English. 

CAUSE
Although Process Designer has been translated into Romanian, the underlying code consumed by Process Designer has not. Most of the content will be shown in Romanian, however, a few of the labels and messages will be in English.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is a permanent limitation that these strings are shown in English.
