ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Chair of a meeting reschedules a meeting multiple times,
   however the
   rescheduled documents are not linked when the invitee has the
   Preferences set
   to "Remove meeting notices from my Inbox after I process them"
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   1- User A sends invitation to UserB, and UserB gets it in the
   Inbox
   2- User B has Preferences set to "Display the following meeting
   notices in my
   Inbox" set to "All except responses" and "Remove meeting notices
   from my Inbox
   after I process them"
       checked off
   3- UserA reschedules the meeting before UserA accepts the
   meeting
   4- UserB takes no action and UserA reschedules the meeting using
   "Owner
   Action>>Reschedule"
   5- UserB receives reschedule notification in the inbox
   6- UserA reschedules the same meeting again and UserB gets 2nd
   reschedule
   notification
   7- UserA reschedules a 3rd time, and UserB gets the 3rd
   notification
   8- UserB opens the earliest rescheduled meeting and gets message
   "You have not
   accepted the meeting invitation but there is a reschedule.
   Would you like to
   open the reschedule
         now?" UserB clicks "Yes" and it opens the most recent
   entry automatically
   for acceptance
   9- UserB accepts the most recent one, and the most recent one
   disappears but
   the two previous,  remain in the Inbox.
   
   - Did another test but this time had UserB accept the meeting
   first then had
   UserA rescheduled. UserA accepts the 1st reschedule and it
   processes and
   removes it from Inbox
   - Rescheduled the last invite a 2nd time with no UserB action,
   reschedule a 3rd
   time and then had UserB act on it to accept the most recent
   reschedule and only
   the one acted on was removed from the Inbox
   
   
   - Further testing showed that if UserB opens the oldest
   rescheduled document
   (instead of the most recent one), UserB will get a message "This
   meeting has
   been rescheduled. Would you like to open the reschedule now" and
   selecting
   "yes" opens the most recent schedule, and if accepted will
   remove the most
   recent rescheduled from the Inbox.
   
     Selecting "No" opens the original scheduled meeting with NO
   option to accept
   the meeting, just to decline, etc
   
   Looks like there is no way to remove the remaining documents
   that come into the
   inbox.  Just the one that is acted on.  The meetings need to be
   processed in
   order, otherwise the users will need to manually remove the ones
   that were
   skipped. Ideally they should all be removed from the Inbox once
   one of them is
   acted upon - Enhancement Request
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the remaining documents manually
