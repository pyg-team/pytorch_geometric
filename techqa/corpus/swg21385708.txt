Title: IBM Install of MQ maintenance on HP-UX reports errors with software dependencies - United States

Text:
swinstall -s $PWD/hp-Uxxxx.v11 MQSERIES fix pack fixpack fixpacks TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are installing a WebSphere MQ fix pack on a HP-UX system. You see errors from the command:
swinstall -s $PWD/hp-Uxxxx.v11 MQSERIES 

SYMPTOM
The following errors appear: 

 * Beginning Analysis and Execution 
* Session selections have been saved in the file 
"/root/.sw/sessions/swinstall.last". 
ERROR: "hostname:/": The software dependencies for 11 products or 
filesets cannot be resolved. 
* The analysis phase failed for "<SYSTEM_NAME>:/". 
ERROR: "hostname:/": 11 filesets were determined to be skipped in 
the analysis phase. 
* The execution phase failed for "<SYSTEM_NAME>:/". 
* Analysis and Execution had errors. 
ERROR: More information may be found in the agent logfile using the 
command "swjob -a log superior-0219 @ <SYSTEM_NAME>:/". 


CAUSE
In this case, using the command "swinstall -s $PWD/hp-Uxxxx.v11 MQSERIES" tries to update all parts of MQ, but the Client and Language Filesets were never installed. When the swinstall command was run, swinstall tried and failed to update the Client Filesets.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the command: 

/usr/sbin/swlist -R MQSERIES 

This will show you all Filesets installed. Verify that all base level Filesets have been upgraded. You should see the Base level Filesets and latest Fix Packs as well. This is how it looks. Note that all the installed base level Filesets have been updated.
