APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TSM Client schedule backup will fail with the following errors
   if AUTHENTICATION is turned off for one or more previous
   scheduled backups:
   
   06/28/02   00:54:37 Node Name: NODE1
   06/28/02   00:54:37 Command will be retried in 20 minutes.
   06/28/02   01:14:37 Retrying scheduled event: SCHED1
   06/28/02   01:14:37 Node Name: NODE1
   06/28/02   01:14:37 ANS1029E Communications have been dropped.
     ...or the following...
   06/28/2002 18:08:40 TCP/IP accepted connection from server.
   06/28/2002 18:08:40 Querying server for next scheduled event.
   06/28/2002 18:08:40 Node Name: NODE1
   06/28/2002 18:08:40 Please enter password for user id "NODE1":
    Please enter password for user id "NODE1": ANS1029E
    Communications have been dropped.
   06/28/2002 18:24:40 Scheduler has been stopped.
   
     The dsmerror.log will report the following errors:
   
   sessOpen: Error 137 from signon authentication.
   sessOpen: Error 137 from signon authentication.
   ANS1029E Communications have been dropped.
   
     When a schedule is run with authentication off on the TSM
   Server, the password is no longer held in memory because it is
   not needed.  Then when authentication is turned on again, there
   is no password in memory to authenticate with, and the password
   file is not reread.
   
     This affects all client platforms, and all versions.
   
   Initial Impact: MEDIUM
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not turn AUTHENTICATION OFF and ON while client schedulers
   may run their schedules.
