ABSTRACT
 In the IBM Rational Developer for System z Host Configuration Guide (SC23-7658-11), the section titled (Optional) Integrated debugger provides information on the installation and configuration of the Rational Developer for System z Integrated Debugger; however, when installed on a system that also has IBM Debug tool installed, some additional considerations apply. 

CONTENT
 In the Rational Developer for System z Host Configuration Guide (SC23-7658-11), the section titled (Optional) Integrated debugger provides information on the installation and configuration of the Rational Developer for System z Integrated Debugger.
When installed on a system that also has IBM Debug tool installed, some additional considerations apply.


Under the heading Integrated debugger parmlib updates, it states:

“Language Environment (LE) must be able to invoke the Integrated Debugger.
Therefore, the FEK.SFEKAUTH library must be placed either in LINKLIST, or in
STEPLIB of the application to be debugged. See “LINKLIST definitions in
PROGxx” on page 20 for details.

Note: When using LINKLIST, ensure that FEK.SFEKAUTH is located before the
libraries of other LE-based debuggers holding the CEEEVDBG or CEEEV006 load
modules. For example, IBM Debug Tool for z/OS uses hlq.SEQA* libraries”

Multiple LE-based debuggers can not be listed in LINKLIST. Only one LE-based debugger holding the CEEEVDBG or CEEEV006 load modules can be listed in LINKLIST. The users of the 'other' debugger will need to STEPLIB to its debugger load modules. An example of an 'other' debugger is IBM Debug Tool for z/OS which uses a hlq.SEQAMOD library. 


Under the heading Integrated debugger CICS updates, it states:

“To debug CICS transactions, the Integrated Debugger requires the following CICS
updates.
• CICS JCL update:
◦ Define the FEK,SFEKAUTH load library in the region’s DFHRPL DD statement if the library is not in LINKLIST.
◦ For z/OS 1.13 and higher, define the SYS1.SIEAMIGE load library in the region’s STEPLIB DD statement if the library is not in LINKLIST. See the z/OS Binder API information in “Integrated debugger parmlib updates” on page 121 for more details.”

Note that only one LE-based debugger holding the CEEEVDBG or CEEEV006 load modules can be in DFHRPL, and only that debugger can be used in the CICS region. Also, as with SFEKAUTH, SYS1.SIEAMIGE also needs to be in DFHRPL.

• “CICS CSD updates:
◦ Define the debugger to a CICS region, as documented in the AQECSD sample CSD update job. AQECSD is located in FEK.#CUST.JCL, unless you specified a different location when you customized and submitted job FEK.SFEKSAMP(FEKSETUP). See “Customization setup” on page 15 for more details.”


Note that only one LE-based debugger's CSD can be installed into a CICS region, and only that debugger can be used in the CICS region. 


An example of an 'other' debugger is IBM Debug Tool for z/OS which uses hlq.SEQASAMP(EQACSD).
