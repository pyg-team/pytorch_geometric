ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNM GUI installation fails when 'smadmin' password has special
   characters for e.g. 'net#cool'
   Steps to replicate:
   a) Install Installation Manager - successful.
   b) Install WAS , DASH & TCR - successful (password chosen for
   'smadmin' was 'net#cool').
   c) Install WebGUI (I picked both FP4 GA + FP9 at same time) -
   successful.
   d) Install ITNMGUI (GA + FP3) - Failure.
   e) Change password of 'smadmin' from 'net#cool' to 'netcool'
   f) Re-try Install of ITNMGUI (GA + FP3)  - Successful.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the password of 'smadmin' without any special characters
   (for e.g. 'netcool') and re-do the installation and it should
   be successful.
