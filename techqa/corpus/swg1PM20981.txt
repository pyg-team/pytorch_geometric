APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting in 7.1.x, the 'Start HTTP Server' and 'Stop HTTP
   Server' shortcuts under IBM HTTP Server V6.1 on 64-bit machines
   are broken. This affects both CQ and CC as they both come with
   IHS.
   
   For example, for Start HTTP Server shorcut (apache.exe)
   properties shows:
   Target: 'C:\Program
   Files(x86\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS,\)\bin\apache.exe' -w -n
   'IBM HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC' -k start
   
   Start in: 'C:Program
   Files(x86/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS,\)\bin'
   
   This has been reproducible with latest fix pack, 7.1.1.3.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Use a Windows 64-bit machine, with CQ or CC 7.1.x that has
   IHS installed.
   2. Under Start menu ? All Programs ? IBM HTTP Server V6.1 ? Run
   the Start or Stop HTTP server shortcuts. You will get a 'missing
   shortcut' error. The shortcuts are broken.
   
   Workaround:
   Fix the shortcuts so it points to the correct directories:
   For example, this is the fix for Start HTTP Server:
   Target: 'C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS\bin\Apache.exe' -w -n  'IBM
   HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC' -k start
   
   Start in: 'C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS\bin'
   
   For example, this is the fix for Stop HTTP Server:
   Target: 'C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS\bin\Apache.exe' -w -n  'IBM
   HTTP Server 6.1 - RationalSDLC' -k stop
   
   Start in: 'C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\RationalSDLC\common\IHS\bin'
