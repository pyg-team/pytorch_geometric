V6.2.1 Fix Pack 3 Enterprise Download [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24035689] Component Tracking Number Description Console JR42977 When FTP/SFTP user details are changed and saved, WPG expects the FTP/SFTP server to be running. 
When the FTP/SFTP server is down appropriate message will be displayed on WPG Console JR43264 While creating a new destination by default "Server verification" option should be in disable mode JR44003 Partial binary file processed by WPG due to small file unchanged interval in File Directory receiver. Fix provided to allow the file unchanged interval field to accept bigger value JR44395 Input field is too short to provide JMS Provider Url on console at System Administration --> DocmgrAdministration --> event engine --> external events 
Now maximum limit of characters to be entered is 250 chars earlier it was 50 characters JR45337 LDAP enabled users were redirected to error page instead of login page after session time out. This issue is being fixed JR46405 SFTP destination edit page always resets field "Use Unique Filename" checked. This issue has been corrected JR46650 SFTP receiver poll interval field is enhanced to take value up to 8 digits. SFTP receivers/destinations JR44443 In some cases , even if SFTP Destination is configured with "Use Unique File Name" not checked, the file is delivered with a doc ID used as unique name. Such behavior is corrected JR43555 In SFTP destination configuration, some passwords were being used incorrectly by runtime to make connection with SSH server. This behavior has been corrected, JR44090 In some cases SFTP destination was successfully delivering file to the server, however the console was showing the transaction as failed with event: 
BCG250011 - First Delivery Attempt Failed for message <vuid> due to 'com.ibm.bcg.bcgdk.common.exception.BCGException: Unable to 
send files to server due to exception No such file', on Destination 'XYZ¨' 
Such behavior has been corrected. JR44464 If file on SFTP server gets consumed as soon as WPG SFTP sender post . stat command fails to run and WPG console shows delivery failed with event 250011.Such behavior is corrected. JR45183 This fix introduces a new parameter called "Enable Rekey" on SFTP receiver configuration page, to enable/disable "Rekeying" between SFTP Server and Client.
From WPG 6.2.1 fixpack 3 and onwards, WPG SFTP client (i.e. SFTP receiver) sends Rekey command to SFTP server if connection is kept idle for long time. If SFTP client connects to a 
SFTP server which does not support "Rekey" command, user may face some hung situation while polling files from server. For such SFTP servers, users may disable rekeying on this particular 
WPG SFTP receiver.
Note: When fix will be applied, value of this new parameter for all existing SFTP receivers will be populated with default value True (i.e. the "Enable Rekey" option is checked). 
It is advisable to always have the Rekey enabled, you may disable it only when SFTP server does not support Rekeying. Security JR43952 From this FixPack onwards WPG complies with guidelines defined by NIST Special Publications 800-131a . For more details refer to link [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039556] JR47724 The critical issues reported by Rational Application Scan and Static Scan tool are fixed in this FixPack Integrated FTP Server JR43136 SQLCODE=-805 error was reported when I-FTP AND I-SFTP server were running for a long time. This issue has been fixed JR43536 Inegrated FTP server is enhanced to make the below Listener properties visible on WPG console.
bcg.ftp.config.listeners.clientauth.address
bcg.ftp.config.listeners.clientauth.data-connection.passive.address
bcg.ftp.config.listeners.default.data-connection.passive.external-address
bcg.config.ftpserver.FTPInstallHostIp Integrated SFTP Server JR47323 WPG not taking into consideration the time zone offset while validating the SFTP certificate during SFTP server start. This issue is fixed ebMS JR44653 When sending ebMS messages over HTTPS IPV6 destination, the HTTP header was malformed. This has been fixed. JR44972 In an ebMS flow, Content-ID field of the SOAP header contains hostname information. Fix provided to have an option to exclude the hostname from the Content-ID field. 
This can be done by going to System Administration - DocMgr Administration - Process Admin - ebMS and setting the "bcg.ebXML.excludeHostnameFromContentID" property to true. Alerts JR43014 SQL error “com.ibm.bcg.alertEng.AlertDB dbError AlertDB.getDocumentInfo - Error: java.sql.SQLException: Numeric Overflow" seen when generating alerts for large file transfer. This issue has been fixed. JR43598 From this FixPack onwards event alerts are enhanced to include eventid along with event details. Certificate management JR43320 When a certificate is uploaded/deleted, the FTP management server had to be restarted for changes to get reflected. 
In this fix, the certificate upload/delete changes get reflected without restarting the FTP management server. Install/UPDI JR44169 When installing any fix or fixpack on WPG using UPDI in silent install mode with command-line options , i.e. specifying all install parameters in the update.bat/.sh command 
line (without using response file), WPG UPDI was not working properly .Such behavior is corrected. JR46064 bcgChangeDmgrHostname.bat/sh fails to execute in WAS 7 migrated environment. This issue has been fixed. JR44591 Update installer used to fail while installing/Uninstalling any fix or fixpack on WPG running on security enabled WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.x , if user uninstalls WebSphere Application Server 6.1.0.x on same machine. This has been corrected. Archiver JR43394 WPG Archiver is enhanced to archive records related to web mailbox function JR44275 WPG Archiver failing intermittently on Windows/DB2 with the exception AR_EXPORT failed. JR46752 Archiver appears to be in running state for long with SQL Exceptions in the logs while executing DELETE FROM LG_ACTIVITY JR46778 Archiver status shows successful even if the archiver fails to delete records from all the required tables. EDI JR44566 EDI enveloper failure when using transaction mask with group control number and a sequence number RNIF JR43470 "BCG240500 - ROSETTANET STATE ENGINE ERROR" event was getting generated while performing RNIF or AS flows because there were uncommitted transactions. This has been fixed Runtime/AS2 JR43243 WPG is unable to unpackage the MDN from partner and generates event “BCG240409 - AS Unpackaging Failed” This issue has been fixed. Runtime JR45736 Document manager restart was required to reflect the certificate set change at partner connection level. This issue is fixed JR45779 During RNIF process retry, if StaleConnection exception occurs then additional retries were not made. This issue is being fixed JR44352 Receiver incorrectly sends 0 bytes source file to DocMgr for processing Partner Migration JR44091 WPG Partner Migration Utility failing with error "com.ibm.icu.util.SimpleTimeZone is not present on the local classpath" to import certificates when installed with WAS 6.1.0.43 or later and WAS 7.0.0.23 or later Events JR44735 File name was missing in the event description for event BCG620006. This has been rectified Integrated FTP/SFTP JRE JR46069 Integrated FTP/SFTP JRE is updated as per Oracle Critical Patch Update June 2013
