APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to install Netcool/OMNIbus on Linux x86 the
   following errors may be encountered.
   
   GUI Mode
   
   In the final panel:-
   "The installation of OMNIbus is finished, but some serious
   errors occurred during the install. Please refer the log file
   /home/nick/IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-00.log  for further details"
   
   Console Mode
   
   In the console:-
   "The installation of OMNIbus is complete, but some errors
   occurred during the install.
      Please see the installation log for details."
   
   Silent Mode
   
   In the OMNIbus_InstallLog.log left in $NCHOME:-
   "Deployement Plan execution general failure:: Check log files
   for further informations."
   
   If another Tivoli product which uses Autonomic Deployment Engine
   (DE) 1.3.x is installed this is probably due to a problem in
   upgrading to DE 1.4. To confirm that this issue has been
   encountered check $HOME/IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-00.log for "".
   
   > grep java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException
   IA-Netcool-OMNIbus-??.log
   2010-02-04 16:51:26.084+00:00 :  STDOUT :
   org.apache.derby.client.am.SqlException: DERBY SQL error:
   SQLCODE: -1, SQLSTATE: XJ040, SQLERRMC: Failed to start database
   'TouchPointRegistryDB', see the next exception for
   details.::SQLSTATE: XJ001Java exception: ':
   java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException'.
   
   Products that use DE 1.3.x include TBSM versions 4.2 and 4.2.1.
   
   This issue only affects the Netcool/OMNIbus installer released
   13 November 2009  for Linux on x86 systems. Other platforms are
   not affected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This problem can be avoided by running the Netcool/OMNIbus
   installer twice: once to upgrade DE and once to installer
   Netcool/OMNIbus. This can be carried out using either the GUI or
   console modes. This is only required if an earlier version of DE
   is installed.
   
   GUI Mode
   
   Start the Netcool/OMNIbus installer.
   Proceed through the installer to the "Choose Install Set" panel
   where you are asked to choose between "Typical" and "Custom".
   Press "Cancel" at this point and confirm that you want to exit
   the installer.
   Restart the Netcool/OMNIbus installer.
   Complete the installation as normal.
   
   Consol Mode
   
   Start the Netcool/OMNIbus installer in console mode.
   Proceed through the installer to the "Select Installation
   Directory" prompt.
   Press Control-C.
   Use "ls -ltrd /tmp/install.dir.*" to find the temporary files
   created by the installer. Use "rm -rf /tmp/<directory name>" to
   remove the files.
   Restart the Netcool/OMNIbus installer
   Complete the installation as normal.
   
   Fixing a failed install
   
   If you have run the installer through to the Netcool/OMNIbus
   installation directly after the DE upgrade, the error described
   above will be encountered. At this stage DE has been upgraded
   but the Netcool/OMNIbus installation has failed. It will not be
   possible to install Netcool/OMNIbus in the directory you first
   specified. However you can re-run the installer and specify a
   different location for Netcool/OMNIbus. There is no need to stop
   and restart the installer.
   
   If you were upgrading from a pre 7.3.0 installation, the
   original installation has already been moved (the directory name
   will have had .1 or .2 etc, added to it). When asked whether you
   want to migrate configuration from a previous installation
   answer "Yes" and give the location of the moved installation.
