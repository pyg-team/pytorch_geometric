Title: IBM Upgrading Portal fails with a 'SRVE0255E: A WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle localhost:XmlAccessPort has not been defined.' exception - United States

Text:

PROBLEM
 

Reviewing the ConfigTrace.log we see the following exception: 

action-deploy-portlets-admin-wp.webdav.portaladmin:
[xmlaccess] EJPXB0006I: Connecting to URL
"http localhost : <XmlAccessPort>/wps/config/"

WebGroup/Virtual Host to handle /wps/config/ has not been defined.

Reviewing the wkplc_comp.properties file:

# XmlAccessHost: The name of the local WebSphere Portal host
# Note: Should not be necessary to modify
XmlAccessHost=localhost
# XmlAccessPort: The port used by the XMLAccess configuration task to
connect the XMLAccess server
# Note: This property may not be used to reconfigure the XmlAccessPort
port.
# The value is set by the basic configuration task of WebSphere
Portal .
XmlAccessPort=10040


CAUSE
When reviewing the Virtual Hosts > default host > Host Aliases in the WAS admin console, the XmlAccessPort defined in the error message was not mapped to the appropriate host name value defined in XmlAccessHost.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, you can either: 

1. Modify the Host Aliases so that the Host Name uses the value '*'. 

2. Update the XmlAccessHost attribute in wkplc_comp.properties so that it uses the same Host Name already defined for the XmlAccessPort under WAS' Host Aliases.
