PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Case Manager configuration tool tasks fail with 414 Request-URI Too Large errors when configuring a Case Manager system 

SYMPTOM
After you run Case Manager configuration tool tasks and check the Case Manager configuration tool log, such as IBM_Case_Manager_5.2.1_CMCT0.log, to validate the successful completion of the task, you see errors similar to the following: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

These errors are most likely to happen when trying to register Case Manager components in IBM Content Navigator, such as in the following tasks:  *  Register the IBM Case Manager Services Plug-in Register the IBM case Manager Administration Client Plug-in Register Project Area Register Target Environment 


CAUSE
 The IBM Content Navigator server is accessed via an IBM HTTP Server (IHS).
The length of the URLs generated by the Case Manager configuration tools exceeds the capacity of the IHS server.


ENVIRONMENT
Case Manager 5.2.0 and up accessed via IHS or reverse proxy server that has a URL character limit (such as with some SSO servers).



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Configure the IHS server to handle longer URLs than the default settings. 

 1. In the httpd.conf file of the IHS server, define the following two directives:  * LimitRequestFieldSize 16384 
     * LimitRequestLine 16384
    
    
 2. Regenerate the http plug-in on the IHS server.
