QUESTION
 How do you configure a runtime license with IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT)? 

CAUSE
You have installed RPT and need to add a license key to enable more features.
Features include the following.



 * Virtual tester (VT)
   
   
 * SOA extension
   
   
 * Citrix extension
   
   
 * SAP extension
   
   
 * Siebel extension
   
   

With a standard RPT installation, you can run up to five virtual testers (VTs) in an HTTP schedule. If you need more than five VTs or to test protocols other than HTTP, you need to install a runtime license key. Runtime licenses are only available as floating keys. The following document provides you with further details on licensing.

ANSWER
Set up the following components.




 1. Set up the IBM License Server to distribute your floating licenses,
    
    Typically, the license server's location is a central server as part of the company infrastructure. Alternatively, you can install the license server on your RPT computer. 
    
    
    
 2. Verify whether the IBM Rational License Key Administrator runs on your client computer and points to your license server. 
    
    You must install the License Key Administrator on your IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) workbench computer. The License Key Administrator is a client component to the license server. The IBM Rational Performance Tester Agent does not need any connection to the license server. The RPT workbench fulfils all license mechanisms.
    
    
    
    ON THE LICENSE SERVER
    
    
 3. Double-click the saved license UPD file to trigger an automatic import of the new licenses.
    
    
 4. Click OK to restart your license server when prompted.
    
    
 5. The new licenses are now distributed. 
    
    
 6. Start the license tools. This action is to verify that they are properly distributed with the license tools (lmtools.exe) provided as part of your License Server installation. 
    
    Open the Server Status tab; then, click Perform Status Enquiry.
    
    
    


ON THE WORKBENCH COMPUTER 

 1. Open the license key administrator. 
    
    
 2. Point to your license server host. Then, add your license server IP address or computer name.
    The default port is 27000.
    
    
 3. Click Show Licenses to verify you can successfully access the licenses distributed by your license server.
    
    
    
    
    


NOTES 

 * Both the IBM License Server and the IBM License Key Administrator come as part of your Passport Advantage [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm] download access.
   
   
 * Also, make sure to get all appropriate license keys from your License Key Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/tointraware.html] access. Downloaded keys for your license server host computer. From that operation, you obtain a.UPD license file. Store this file to a temporary location on your license server machine.
   
   
 * Ask your license server administrator to install the missing runtime license keys for you.
