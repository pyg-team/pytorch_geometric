Where xxxxx is an ipaddress or hostname. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error may be caused by a few different scenarios. 

 1. The specified ipaddress or hostname, is not for the system that has Monitoring and Reporting installed (the system that contains the WAREHOUS database). This can be changed by editing the data source for the report. and updating the ipaddress/hostname in the JDBC URL. 
 2. If the ipaddress or hostname is used, it may not be able to be pinged from the system where the admin center is located. From the Windows command prompt, issue: ping <ipaddress or hostname>  * If the ping command fails, it will need to be resolved.
    
    
 3. The port may be blocked by a firewall, antivirus, policy, etc. To test, from command line, issue:  * 
     * 
     * For example: xxx.xxx.xx.xxx 50000 
     * If that command fails with error message, the issue will need to be resolved.
    
    



Items #2 and #3 are networking issues external to the Tivoli Storage Manager application, these will need to be investigated and resolved by the local network support resources.
