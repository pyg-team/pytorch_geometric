 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am installing the Sentinel RMS License manager from the SPSS CD. The installation is successful, but when I attempt to license with "spssactivator <authcode>", I recieve the following errors:

Failed to add license to local license server:
Generic error indicating the feature has not been added. Make sure the license is for this machine.

I am using the authorization code, not a license code, and the license has been generated on the SPSS license server with the correct lock code. What could the problem be? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please check to make sure the Sentinel RMS License Manager is running in your Windows Services. If you cannot find the Sentinel RMS License Manager Service under services, please make sure you have installed the correct License Manager Package. The correct install should be located on D:\Sentinel\LicenseManager\Windows\setup.exe. Where D: is your CD ROM drive
