QUESTION
 Why I am not able to connect two column oriented tables by foreign key? 

ANSWER
 

Constraints are not enforced in dashDB, so it does not support foreign keys that require enforcement. For informational purposes a "not enforced" foreign key constraint can be added. The key word "NOT ENFORCED" at the end of the Alter statement will transform the constraint to an informational constraint. 
Constraints are not enforced in dashDB, so since standard foreign keys require enforcement creating them is not supported. Informational constraints are supported and a "not enforced" informational foreign key constraint can be added. RELATED INFORMATION
