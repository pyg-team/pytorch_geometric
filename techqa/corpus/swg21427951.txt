QUESTION
 How does the "TIMEOUT" feature in a FLEXlm options file affect IBM Rational PurifyPlus tools and its usage during inactivity? 

ANSWER
The TIMEOUT feature ideally puts a license back into the pool for reuse after a certain period of inactivity is reached at the client. The period of inactivity can be specified in milliseconds against the TIMEOUT feature in the options file. 

For PurifyPlus suite of tools, the TIMEOUT does not affect the functionality of the tool in any way even if there had been a period of inactivity longer than what is specified in the options file. 

 

For example, if the TIMEOUT is set for 1800 ms (which is half an hour), the PurifyPlus license is checked back in automatically and made available in the pool for other users to use. If the inactive user tries using the tools (Rational Purify, Rational Quantify or Rational PureCoverage) even after the timeout has happened, the user will be able to use the tool without any licensing issues. 

In other words, the usage of the tool after the timeout does not send a license request again to the license server.
