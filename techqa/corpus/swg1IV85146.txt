APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Details:
   
   An Anywhere user was about to open a WO by tapping it but it
   gave the following error:
   
   No Valid Data Error Returned.
   
   The  user is logged with same username as another engineer at
   the same time, for purpose of testing Anywhere in UAT. Both
   engineers are using same user name so it might be the case that
   WO is completed by the first engineer and the other engineer is
   still able to view it.
   
   The error went away when the engineer experiencing the error
   message, refreshed the query base.
   
   Steps to replicate:
   
   1. Login to Anywhere Work Execution application
   
   2. Login with same username from another device
   
   3. The last user attempts to open an existing WO and receives
   the error:
   
   No Valid Data Error Returned.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Any user with a slow system could hit this.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * If I attempt to add data to a work order that is being       *
   * removed from the list, I could receive an error that says    *
   * "No Valid Error".  The work order might be removed from the  *
   * list because someone else has completed it while you were    *
   * working on it. This error happens because the work order     *
   * that I'm trying to modify no longer appears in my list so I  *
   * cannot modify it.  You can refresh the querybase to get past *
   * the error, but the data you were trying to add to the        *
   * workorder would be lost.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to the latest fixpack to receive this fix.           *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We needed additional code to catch when this happens, and
   successfully try and send the data to the Maximo server, even if
   the workorder has already been removed from my list.
