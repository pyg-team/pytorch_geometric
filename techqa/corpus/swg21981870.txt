PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After fresh install of WAS 8.5.5.9 with JazzSM 1.1.2.1/DASH 3.1.2.1, the "Console Settings" is missing entries and other expected icons are missing from the DASH main page. 

SYMPTOM
After successful installation of JazzSM 1.1.2.1/DASH 3.1.2.1 with WebSphere 8.5.5.9, some of the icons in the main DASH window are missing on the left.


CAUSE
It was recently discovered that some .jar files were not included in WebSphere 8.5.5.9, that were available in previous WebSphere releases, and are required for several functions in DASH.

ENVIRONMENT
JazzSM 1.1.2.1 / DASH 3.1.2.1 WAS 8.5.5.9

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After you login to DASH and select "Console Settings", the displayed window, which should have several lines, is blank:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&amp;aid=1]

Also, in this case there wasn't any icons in the upper left portion of the main DASH window.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The missing jar files are included in DASH 3.1.2.1 Cumulative Patch 5, which you can download from this site:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=2]
If you have any questions as to whether DASH 3.1.2.1 Cumulative Patch 5 has been installed, please run this command:

<JazzSM_HOME>/ui/bin/consolecli Version if patch 5 has been installed, it will have output showing the patch number shown in the red square in the screen shot:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21981870&aid=3]

If installing on a UNIX server, you will see several of these messages, they indicate that the jar files are not currently on the server, but the Patch install will finish successfully.
