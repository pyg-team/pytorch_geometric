PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Application Server Security is enabled in WebSphere, one userid is logged into the WebSphere console, and another userid logs into Maximo, the WAS console logs out (and vice versa). 

SYMPTOM
The following may appear in the SystemOut.log:

[11/5/15 20:36:58:971 EST] 0000010b WASSessionCor E SessionContext checkSecurity SESN0008E: A user authenticated as user:maxdomain.mysite.com:636/CN=Wilson\, James,OU=Maximo User Accounts,OU=Operations,OU=AZORES,DC=mysite,DC=com has attempted to access a session owned by user:maxdomain.mysite.net:636/CN=maximoad,OU=Service Accounts,OU=OPS,DC=mysite,DC=com. 

Note the userids in bold are not the same.


CAUSE
When you have WebSphere Application Server Security turned on, and are working in the WebSphere Administrative Console and open a new tab or browser window to log into Maximo that is using Application Server Security, the sessions may 'interfere" with each other. The WAS console interface is an application, as is Maximo. The workstation browser uses a single session cookie for all connections to that server. In this case, when logging into the new Maximo session, it immediately tries to authenticate the WAS console session with the same credentials.

The same is also true if you open a second Maximo instance that also uses Application Server Security hosted on the same WAS server even if you are logging in as the same user as the first Maximo instance.

If the sessions do not "interfere" with each other, you may find that when you log out of Maximo, it will automatically log you out of WebSphere console, even though you used different credentials. The reason is the same: the browser uses a single session cookie for all connections to that server.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the Maximo user does not have Administrator privileges in WebSphere, it will not be able to log in to the WAS console, and a message such as Login failed. Check the user ID and password and try again will appear in the WebSphere browser session. If the operation order is reversed, when the Maximo session tries to re-authenticate, it will display a log out message such as To completely sign out, you must close your browser or You cannot log in at this time. Contact the system administrator. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Be aware that this can happen. 

You can use a feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or later called -nomerge. See http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21596864 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21596864] for more information on browser behavior with multiple sessions connecting to the same server.(Not all versions of Internet Explorer are supported on all versions of Maximo Asset Management and Control Desk.)
