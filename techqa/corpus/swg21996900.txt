Text:
Upgrading IBM Content Navigator TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When upgrading ICN from v2.0.3 FP5 to FP8, do we need to re-create the

ECMClientDS datasource, create a new DB2_ONE_SCRIPT.sql script and run that script on

the Content Navigator database? What changes in the DB2_ONE_SCRIPT.sql? 

ANSWER
 DB2_ONE_SCRIPT does not need to be run when upgrading IBM Content Navigator(ICN) from 2.0.3.5 to 2.0.3.8. We need to run the ConfigureJDBCECM task (data source and database
task) and deselect the checkbox option for "Run the script on your database",
so that the ONE script will not be run.
