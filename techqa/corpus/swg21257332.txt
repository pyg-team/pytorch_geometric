 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 The V8.4 releases of IBM DB2® Content Manager and IBM DB2 Document Manager Enterprise Edition provide support for the new Ecma Office Open XML file formats introduced with the 2007 Microsoft® Office System applications, including Word 2007. 

CONTENT
With the release of the 2007 Microsoft Office System ("Office 2007"), new Office XML file formats were introduced that are not compatible with older DB2 Content Manager products.
Files that use the new Office 2007 XML file formats are created using new file name extensions (for example, ".docx" or ".dotx"), and can be manipulated using the 2007 Microsoft Office applications such as Word 2007. 

In addition, support for the new Office 2007 XML file formats can be enabled in older Microsoft Office applications (Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and associated viewers) with the installation of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 file formats.

Support is available with DB2 Content Manager V8.4

Both DB2 Content Manager Enterprise Edition V8.4 and DB2 Content Manager for z/OS V8.4 include support for the new Office XML document formats and file name extensions. With V8,4 support is available to:


 * View, manipulate, and annotate Office XML documents within the Client for Windows, ODMA client for Windows, eClient viewer applet or custom solutions built using the Java viewer toolkit. 
 * Add MIME type definitions to tell your application how to handle the new XML file formats when objects are retrieved from the resource manager. 
   (Refer to support article 288972 "CM V8.4 Clients Support for Office Open XML File Format")


As well, DB2 Content Manager Enterprise Edition V8.4 includes support for:  * Index and perform text search for documents created using the new formats. 
 * Perform content manager server-side document conversion with access to document manipulation and document annotation services.


For users of DB2 Content Manager V8.3, the new Office XML document formats and file name extensions are not supported; continue to use only the binary file formats supported in earlier versions of Microsoft Office applications. 

Support is not available in DB2 Document Manager V8.3 or V8.4 
DB2 Document Manager (V8.3 or V8.4) currently does not provide support for the new XML file formats - restrictions include:  * Related file detection (compound document links) for new Office XML documents when working with DB2 Content Manager and DB2 Document Manager 
 * Viewing the new file formats in the Document Manager viewer 
 * Related file detection within the Document Manager Office application integration 
 * Full text indexing and search of these documents in Document Manager
   

For users of DB2 Document Manager (V8.3 and V8.4) at this time, continue to use only the binary file formats supported in earlier versions of Microsoft Office applications. RELATED INFORMATION
