JazzSM user adding TCR ITM roles smadmin permission privilege TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can a new user be added in a Tivoli Common Reporting for Tivoli Storage Manager installation? 

CAUSE
In some cases it may necessary to add different users to manage the Monitoring and Reporting suite for Tivoli Storage Manager.

ANSWER
By default the JazzSM for Service Management is installed with the default administrator "smadmin".
This user belongs to a role having full permissions and may not be appropriate to access both Chart View and Administration panels. 

It can be useful instead to add users without the administrator role, but who are able to create/view charts and access the Tivoli Common reporting console. 

This can be achieved in the following way: 

1. Open the JazzSM interface via the browser:

https://<ITM hostname or IP address>:16311/ibm/console 

 

and login using the "smadmin" user credentials. 

 

2. Once logged in, click on the "Console Settings" icon in the bottom left side and choose "WebSphere Administrative Console" :
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&amp;aid=1]



3. In the new web page click the button "Launch WebSphere administrative console":
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&amp;aid=2] 



4. A new web page is opened. Expand on the left side "Users and Groups" and click on "Manage Users".
On the right panel, the list of existing users will be displayed:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=3]



5. Click on "Create..." button and insert all the necessary information for creating the user.
Once done the new user will be listed in the main page of the WebSphere Administrative Console:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=4]
6. Go back to the IBM Dashboard for JazzSM and click again on the "Console Settings" icon in the bottom left side and choose "User Roles":
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&amp;aid=5]



7. In the right panel, click on the button "search" for obtaining the list of the available users. Then click on the user to which the roles must be granted:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696449&aid=6]



8. A new page will all the available roles will be displayed. Assign to the chosen user, all roles except the "administrator" role.



9. Click Save and logout



10. Login to the JazzSM dashboard with the new user just created. 
The roles assigned are enough to manage chart and creating reports inside the Tivoli Common Reporting.
