APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to establish a TCP connection with a destination
   server, and the server doesn't respond to SSL handshake,
   DataPower might not time out.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are all Datapower configurations that set up
   connections to remote hosts using any SSL-wrapped protocol, for
   example when using HTTPS to connect to the backend.
   
   The SSL connection establishment may intermittently fail
   early in SSL handshake, hanging the entire transaction.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 6.0.0.16, 6.0.1.12, 7.0.0.9, 7.1.0.6 and
   7.2.0.0
