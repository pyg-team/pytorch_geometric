   to incorrect mapping to servers in which a untargeted server is

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is closed as there is another APAR JR29800 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR29800] which
   addresses the same issue. When a WebServer is involved as part
   of deploymentTarget, while deploying SCAModule and WebModule
   to respective servers, WebSphere Process Server users might see
   deploymnet failures which is going to be addressed by this iFix.
