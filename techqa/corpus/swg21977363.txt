Title: IBM APM V8 MQ monitoring agent shows offline on dashboard - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere MQ monitoring agent is running, but is showing up as offline in the agent widget. 

SYMPTOM
A running WebSphere MQ agent shows "The agent is offline" in the dashboard.


CAUSE
The MQ agent was reconfigured to a different 'Agent Name' setting as per instructions in the link below. 

http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLNR_8.1.3/com.ibm.pm.doc/install/mq_config_set_unique_msn.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLNR_8.1.2/com.ibm.pm.doc/install/mq_config_set_unique_msn.htm]

This changed the Managed System Name (MSN) of the agent, which is constructed as follows:
monitoredqueuemanagername:agentname:MQ 

The application is still referring to the old agent MSN, which is now offline.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On the dashboard, edit application(s) where the old agent is included. Remove old MSN for the agent, and add new MSN of running agent to the application(s). 

e.g. remove QMGR1:oldAgtName:MQ and add QMGR1:newAgtName:MQ 

The agent should now display data in the application widgets.
