QUESTION
 Can I call a third party utility (.exe program) within Cast Iron orchestration to perform Encryption/Decryption of data ? 

ANSWER
Cast Iron does not provide a facility to call any utility (.exe program) directly. Another options is to use web-service. If you have web-service which allows you to call .exe program, then you can invoke such web-service from Cast Iron.
