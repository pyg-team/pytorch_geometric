Title: IBM Some characters incorrectly converted (to using Windows-1252 encoding), after using "Import External Structures" to import information - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer is trying to import accounts (into Controller) via a CSV file.

The CSV file has been encoded with a character set (for example 'Windows-1250 code page') which allows non-standard (non-English) characters to be stored.
- for example, there may be Slovenian characters (inside this text file) which relate to the account names.

However, after importing the structures the account names look slightly incorrect.
- Specifically, some of the non-standard (non-English) characters have been translated into different characters. 

SYMPTOM
Example: 

Customer populates a CSV file with some accounts which they wish to import (into Controller). The account names have special 'non-English' characters. 

 * Therefore, the CSV file has been encoded with 'Windows-1250 code page' character set, which allows account names to contain 'special' Slovenian characters (inside this text file). 
 * Specifically, some names contain the character 'č [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C]' or 'Č [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C]' (sometimes known as a 'caron', also known as háček in Czech and mäkčeň in Slovak). Visually, this looks like a 'c' with what appears an upside-down hat on top.


User then imports these structures (accounts) into their system, via the menu item "Transfer - External Structures - Import". 

 * User chooses the Structure ("Account Structure") and the Import Specification 
 * User browses to the CSV file, and runs the import.


Afterwards, the user clicks 'Maintain - Account Structure - Define' and looks at the new accounts. 

 * Unfortunately some of the characters (in the name/description of the accounts) are wrong. 
 * Specifically the characters 'č' and 'Č [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8C]' have been replaced with 'è [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88]' and 'È [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88]' ('e' with a French grave accent)


In other words, these 1250 characters have been replaced with their corresponding 1252 character set equivalents.
