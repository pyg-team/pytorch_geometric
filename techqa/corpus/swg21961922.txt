Title: IBM The Tivoli Enterprise Portal client cannot download a needed jnlp file - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The TEP client cannot download needed files from the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS) 

SYMPTOM
When starting the TEP client an error such as this is seen:
Unable to load http://tepshost:15200/kit.jar.jnlp 

The name of the jnlp file can be different but this typically indicates that there is a problem getting that file from the TEPS server back to the TEP client. 


CAUSE
One possible reason for this problem is that the host shortname is not resolving correctly. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
First determine if the TEP client can connect to the TEPS server and which hostname (short hostname, fully qualified hostname, IP address) is able to connect. 


You can check this by using telnet from the TEP client machine to the TEPS server machine using port 15200, for example:
telnet teps_server 15200

telnet teps_server_long_name 15200 

telnet ip_address_of_teps_server 15200 

If the short name fails but the long name or IP address works then you can change the codebase line in the *.jnlp files using the procedure below. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First locate and make a backup of the component.jnlpt file 

Unix:
/opt/IBM/ITM/config/component.jnlpt

Windows:
c:\IBM\ITM\config\component.jnlpt


1) Edit the component.jnlpt file 
locate the codebase line which should look something like this: 
codebase="http://$HOST$:$PORT$/"
replace $HOST$ with the host fully qualified hostname or IP address: 
codebase="http://teps_FQDN:$PORT$/"

2) After changing the component.jnlpt file, reconfigure the CW component:
Unix:
./itmcmd config -A cw 

Windows:
Open the MTEMS (Stop light icon on the windows desktop) 
Right click the "Tivoli Enterprise Portal - Browser" component and select "reconfigure" 
Click OK on the screen that comes up 

3) After reconfiguring in step 2, clear your Java cache. 
Start -> control panel -> IBM control panel for Java (or just Java if using Oracle Java) 
On the General tab click Settings 
Click delete files
Check all 3 checkboxes and say ok 

4) Try to connect again.
