VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-1932 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1932]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise could allow a remote attacker to obtain information that identifies the proxy server software being used.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102970 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102970] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 
AFFECTED VERSIONS: The following IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions are affected: 

Version 8.5 Full Profile Version 8 Version 7 Version 7 IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise on WebSphere Application Server Version 7 and Version 8 

Remediation/Fixes: The recommended solution is to apply the Fix Pack or PTF for each named product as soon as practical. 

Fix: 
Apply an Interim Fix [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039403], Fix Pack or PTF [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980] containing this APAR PI38403, as noted below: 

Note: 
By default, the ODR and proxy server will ignore the http.compliance.via custom property and not set the HTTP Via header. A new custom property is being introduced that if set to false will allow the http.compliance.via setting to be honored. The custom property, http.ignore.compliance.via can be set on an ODR or Proxy server. 

In the Administrative console, expand Servers>Server Types > On Demand Routers > server_name to open the configuration tab for the server. 
Expand On Demand Router settings, click On Demand Router Properties 
Under Additional properties, click Custom properties > new.
