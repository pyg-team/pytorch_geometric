Title: IBM WSDL retrieved from the Web Service Proxy using ?wsdl URI differs from the original WSDL - United States

QUESTION
 Why does the WSDL retrieved from the Web Service Proxy using ?wsdl URI differ from the original WSDL? 

CAUSE
If you follow the instructions in the DataPower documentation, you can enable the HTTP GET and HEAD methods on the Front Side Handler for your Web Service Proxy, and you may expose a WSDL from within a Web Service Proxy with the ?wsdl URI. For example:



http://host:port/URI?wsdl



However, the retrieved WSDL may be different from the original WSDL that was uploaded to the Web Service Proxy (or the WSDL that the Web Service Proxy retrieves from a remote location).

ANSWER
Since DataPower firmware 3.6.1, the WSDL DataPower publishes using ?wsdl is completely re-factored from the original in order to represent the way that the Web Service gateway is configured. Given the significant flexibility of the configuration available in the DataPower Web Service Proxy, this is required to produce a WSDL that is accurate and compliant.
