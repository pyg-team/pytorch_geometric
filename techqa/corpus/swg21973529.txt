QUESTION
 What level of ISKLM is required to support TLS 1.2 ciphers? 

ANSWER
ISKLM Fix Pack 3 APAR OA43953 includes APAR OA43971 which introduces these updates:

"ISKLM update to support NIST 800-131a

1. Change the source of randomness to SHA2DRBG
2. Support TLS 1.2"

However FP3 incorrectly did not include the fixes for FP2, which it should have done.
Therefore upgrade to Fix Pack 4, with APAR OA47191, PTF UA77892 (which includes the fixes for FP2 and FP3) to provide TLS 1.2 support in ISKLM for z/OS:

If you wish to use AES_256 cipher suites also remember to copy the correct unrestricted policy files for your version of Java. 
As per the following information here on the cipher suites supported by IBMJSSE2:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.1.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.71.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.1.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.71.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html]

"Cipher suites that use AES_256 require installation of the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files." [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=jcesdk]

Similar information is also in the IPUG:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB2KG_1.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.isklm.doc_11/top_EKMipug_copy_unresrticted_policy_files.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB2KG_1.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.isklm.doc_11/top_EKMipug_copy_unresrticted_policy_files.html]

This is required because ISKLM supports any cipher suites supported by IBMJSSE2.








How do I ensure that ISKLM chooses a cipher suite which is applicable to TLS 1.2 only? 

To ensure that ISKLM chooses a cipher suite which is applicable to TLS 1.2 change: 
TransportListener.ssl.protocols=SSL_TLS 
to 
TransportListener.ssl.protocols=TLSv1.2 

and optionally you can change: 
TransportListener.ssl.ciphersuites=JSSE_ALL 

to specify the specific TLS 1.2 ciphersuites that you wish ISKLM to use, separated by commas and all on one line. The example below is split across lines to fit on the screen: 

TransportListener.ssl.ciphersuites=SSL_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384, 
SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256,SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 

Of course, you will need to ensure that the hardware devices which connect to ISKLM for z/OS support at least one of the ciphersuites that you configure here otherwise the TLS handshake will fail.
