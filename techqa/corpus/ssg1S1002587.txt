4. Connect the internal battery connector. Each end of the keyed connector has two wires: one red (+) and one black (âˆ’). Align the connector so that the two red wires are joined together and the two black wires are joined together. Note: A small amount of arcing may occur when connecting the batteries. This is normal and does not damage the unit or present any safety concern.
