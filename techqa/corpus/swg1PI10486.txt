APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are upgrading from CICS VR V4.2 to CICS VR V5.1 and running
   a V5.1 BATCHBACK command using an UNDO logstream created by
   CICS VR V4.2.  The BATCHBACK fails with message:
   
   DWW1728W Expected UNDO END log record not found on log stream
   
   The end of jobstep UNDO record type in CICSVR V4.2 has a value
   of x'87'.  In CICS VR V5.1 the end of job step UNDO record
   value is x'8D'.
   
   CICS VR V5.1 needs to be able to coexist with CICS VR V4.x in a
   sysplex environment as batch logging jobs need to run on
   multiple LPARs where the CICS VR server may be at different
   versions.
   
   RFE 42974 requested CICS VR provide coexistence support to
   allow BATCHBACK to process an UNDO logstream produced by either
   a CICS VR V4 or V5 server by the DWWBACK utlity running CICS VR
   V4 or V5.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure batch jobs use the same CICS VR server version for
   logging and backout processing.
