Title: IBM Unexpected Token DXL errors and projects / folders Missing in Rational DOORS Database - United States

Text:
DOORS; project; folder; corrupt; corruption; empty; DXL; error; token; unexpected TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I login to my Rational DOORS client I get DXL errors and then once the Rational DOORS database explorer displays, I don't see any of my projects or folders. 

SYMPTOM
When I login to my Rational DOORS client I get the following DXL errors:
-R-E- DXL: <config/dbExplorerGlobals.inc:527> An unexpected error has 
occurred: Unexpected Token 
Backtrace: 
<config/baseWindowCallbacks.inc:62> 
<config/baseWindowCallbacks.inc:105> 
<wizard/tip/tipwiz:444> 
And then once the Rational DOORS database explorer displays, I don't see any of my projects or folders.

CAUSE
It is possible that the index files that contain information about the root level database projects and folders has been corrupt.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You will need to open a PMR with the Rational DOORS support team and send the below listed files for further review. 


On the Rational DOORS database server, in the $SERVERDATA\v6data folder, please locate the following files: 

 * module.ixc 
 * module.ixb 
 * project.ixc 
 * project.ixb


Once located, please deliver them to IBM Rational Client Support via the PMR process.
