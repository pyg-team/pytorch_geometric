GETTING HELP IN THE QRADAR FORUMS

QRadar Support monitors an official forum for customer questions. Customers who want to ask questions about features, QRadar functionality, or have general questions for any QRadar product can use our forums. The forums are a great place to get feedback from not only QRadar Support, but also other administrators and users who work with QRadar daily. 

In the month of September, we are going to start migrating from our existing customer forum to a newer forum platform. The existing content will still be in place for our W3 QRadar forums, however, we want users and administrators to start using the new forum and testing out the new features. 

 

 * dw Answers: What you need to know

   The dw Answers forums are tag driven. Up to 8 tags can be added to a single forum question. The QRADAR tag must be used in every forum post. Searches can be done for the term QRadar, this will also pick up tags. To get help, you can always use @username to get the attention of a support representative. Example, @jonathan.pechta (IBM) Follow tags such as QRADAR, RISK MANAGER, FORENSICS, SCANNERS to be alerted to posts on topics that interest you.

SOCIAL TECHNOTES

When you access support content such as tech notes or APARs, you might see a new "Community questions and discussion" feature at the bottom of these documents, is our new Social Technote addon. Social technotes allow any reader to engage the author, support representatives, or forum users by asking a question of the content, which creates a forum post for experts to review and answer. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612861&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612861&aid=7] 
We encourage deeper social engagement across IBMers and clients alike, enabling this feature supports open discussions and allows us to use our social capabilities to deliver and discover solutions in a community-based format.
