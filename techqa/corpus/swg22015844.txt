Title: IBM Content Collector for SAP (ICCSAP) qualification with IBM Datacap 9.1.x - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Datacap has major DB structure changes in 9.1.1 and higher versions in comparison to the older versions. When the user upgrades IBM Datacap, new DB schema changes are updated to the default shipped applications and not on the custom applications, such as IBM Content Collector for SAP Applicationsâ€™ custom Datacap application. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Datacap provides DB scripts for DB2, SQL, and Oracle databases. The user needs to create and run corresponding DB script on the selected database. It creates new DB schema, which is compatible with new Datacap changes. The user needs to migrate IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications MS Access DBs to the selected external DB (for example, SQL Server) and configure with Datacap. This solution to the issue is for IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications custom application. The user can proceed with all supported databases. For example, SQL Server, DB2, and Oracle.
