APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Clarifications are needed in the manuals for the sequence of
   security exit calls in a channel instance sharing conversations.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users with security exits defined in client channels that will
   use sharing conversations.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When a client channel instance is shared by more than one
   conversation, the pattern of calls to the security exit is
   restricted on the second and subsequent conversations.
   
   These restrictions should be documented in the WebSphere MQ
   product manuals.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following description will be added to the
   Intercommunication manual on the page that describes Channel
   security exit programs.
   
   When a client channel instance is shared by more than one
   conversation, the pattern of calls to the security exit is
   restricted on the second and subsequent conversations.
   
   For the first conversation, the pattern is the same as if the
   channel were not sharing conversations.  For the second and
   subsequent conversations, the security exit is never called with
   MQXR_INIT, MQXR_INIT_SEC, or MQXR_SEC_MSG.  It is called with
   MQXR_SEC_PARMS.
   
   In a channel that is sharing conversations, MQXR_TERM is called
   only for the last conversation running.
   
   Each conversation has the opportunity in the MQXR_SEC_PARMS
   invocation of the exit to alter the MQCD; on the
   server-connection end of the channel this can be useful to vary,
   for example, the MCAUserIdentifier or LongMCAUserIdPtr values
   before the connection is made to the queue manager.
