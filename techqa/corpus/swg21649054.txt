QUESTION
 What can be done to increase the IBM Cognos Financial Statement Reporting performance under Citrix? 

CAUSE
FSR ( 6.6.1.0 up to 6.6.1.1 HotFix 8 ) is running slowly under Citrix.

ANSWER
Most of the suggestions below are general suggestions and not related to Citrix/VMs, as FSR does not have any specific settings or tweaks that would improve performance in this scenario:

1. The Citrix version matters, as old versions can cause performance issues. We have obtained the best results on Citrix 6.5;
2. Install FixPack 2 for FSR 6.6.1;
3. Use Office 2010;
4. Upgrade all objects to the 2010 format;
5. Make sure the Citrix box has enough resources to handle all processes and connections.
