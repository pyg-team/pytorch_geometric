APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS CHANGE TO ACCOMODATE OEM VENDOR'S CODE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A change was introduced in Oracle Java 7 Update 51 that
   requires a Permissions attribute in the JAR manfest of Java Web
   Start applications and web-based applets when the security
   level is set to "High" in the Java Control Panel.  The
   Worklight Mobile Browser Simulator does not include such
   attributes in it's JAR manifest, and will be blocked in the
   browser if the user's Java security level is set to "High".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, the security level in the Java Control Panel
   can be reduced to "Medium", which will permit the Mobile
   Browser Simulator to run.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * 7 u51 guidelines.                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
