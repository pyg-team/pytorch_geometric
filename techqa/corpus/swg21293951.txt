Title: IBM Sametime users unable to authenticate with Domino canonical name against an LDAP directory - United States

PROBLEM
Lotus® Sametime® users are unable to authenticate with a Domino® canonical name against an LDAP directory.

CAUSE
When Sametime is being authenticated against LDAP it is unable to resolve Domino canonical names. For example, the user name cn=user1/o=lotus will be unable to authenticate to Sametime because that value does not exist in the LDAP Person document.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following steps to resolve this issue:



 1. Add cn=user1,o=lotus as a value of an attribute in the LDAP Person documents for each user.
    
    
 2. Enable the following parameter in sametime.ini (under the [Directory] section):
    ST_DB_LDAP_ALLOW_SEARCH_ON_DN=1



ST_DB_LDAP_ALLOW_SEARCH_ON_DN=1:  * 



Additional information for Sametime servers upgraded from a pre-7.5 version to version 7.5.x: 

In Sametime releases 7.5.x and above, Sametime will take cn=user1/o=lotus and change it to cn=user1,o=lotus (note the change of / to ,). Therefore, the name containing the comma must exist in the LDAP directory, and be included in the search filters in the LDAPServer document of the stconfig.nsf. In versions prior to 7.5, Sametime did not convert the slash to a comma. 

If you are unable to make the changes suggested above, contact IBM Support to obtain a fix for this issue. For further information on the fix, reference technote #1291914, After upgrade to Sametime 7.5.1 users unable to login with Domino canonical name against a Domino LDAP directory [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=477&uid=swg21291914]. 

This problem has been fixed in Sametime 8.0.2.
