APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   The UNIX OS agent on AIX needs to allocate shared memory to
   collect SPMI metrics through its aixdp_daemon subprocess. This
   memory is not released when it shuts down, however the same
   memory is reused when it starts up again, so this is not a
   memory leak.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This issue affects all the UNIX OS agent versions since 6.23
   FP1, but only on the AIX platform.
   
   Diagnostics:
   ipcs -mp|grep 0x78 and look for the PID of aixdp_daemon before
   and after the OS agent gets stopped.
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium, situations based on this attribute might send false
   alerts

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the shared memory segments using the ipcrm -m command
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  AIX shared memory not released by the Monitoring Agent for UNIX
   OS.
   
   Two segments in the AIX shared memory are not released by the
   Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS when it stops.  These segments are
   allocated during initialization of the SPMI interface by the
   child process aixdp_daemon and not released at shutdown time.
   However they are reused when the agent starts up again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SPMI termination call added during agent shutdown.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
