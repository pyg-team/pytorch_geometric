APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You define your CICS regions with CSYSDEF records in the CPSM
   data repository. Fields 'Time zone', 'Time zone offset' and
   'Daylight saving time in effect' (fields TMEZONE, TMEZONEO and
   DAYLGHTSV respectively) are all set to INHERIT, so that they
   inherit the settings assigned to the CMAS to which the CICS
   system is connected.
   .
   You find that CPSM functions such as !!SAMOPS alerts based on
   Time Periods do not trigger accurately, as the CICS region has
   not properly inherited the time zone fields from the connecting
   CMAS.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:    In the CSYSDEF records defining your *
   *                      CICS regions in the CPSM data reposi-   *
   *                      tory, fields 'Time zone', 'Time zone    *
   *                      offset' and 'Daylight saving time in    *
   *                      effect' (attributes TMEZONE, TMEZONEO   *
   *                      and DAYLGHTSV respectively) are all set *
   *                      to INHERIT, so that they inherit the    *
   *                      real values from the CMAS to which the  *
   *                      CICS regions connect.                   *
   *                         You find that CPSM functions based   *
   *                      on Time Period Definitions (PERIODEFs), *
   *                      such as !!SAMOPS alerts, do not trigger *
   *                      accurately, as the CICS region has not  *
   *                      inherited the time zone attributes from *
   *                      the connecting CMAS properly.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:    After applying the PTF that resolves this *
   *                 APAR, all CMASes must be recycled to pick up *
   *                 the new code.  Note that regions do not need *
   *                 to be brought down and restarted at the same *
   *                 time.                                        *
   ****************************************************************
      If any of the time zone definition fields 'Time zone', 'Time
   zone offset', or 'Daylight saving time in effect', in the CICS
   System Definition (CSYSDEF) resource are set to "Inherit", then
   the real time zone values will be copied from the CMAS to which
   the MAS connects at MAS start time, or when the values of the
   time zone attributes of the CMAS are changed by an API program,
   or through the EYUSTARTCMAS WUI view or CICS Explorer.  However
   if the value of the MAS field 'Real time analysis status' is
   updated, for example from RTASTATUS=NO to RTASTATUS=SAM, then
   changes to the CMAS's time zone attributes or the plex's sec-
   urity processing options will not be inherited by the MAS until
   the MAS agent restarts, either by recycling the CICS region or
   by stopping and restarting the MAS agent manually using the COSH
   and COLM transactions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *     Module EYU0TSRS (TSRS - Refresh CICS System Descriptor) was
   updated to retain the inheritance status of security and time
   zone attributes when called to refresh the CICS System Descrip-
   tor (CSDB) to reflect a change of the MAS's RTASTATUS attribute.
   Module EYU0TISC (TISC - Create CICS System Object) was modified
   to set the time zone inheritance flag in the CSDB from the CMAS
   if any of the time zone attributes of the CSYSDEF resource are
   set to "Inherit".
