QUESTION
 In which log does the output from the Messagebox Extended Rule function appear? (SCI47425) 

ANSWER
The output from the Messagebox Extended Rule function will appear in the Application Server log (that is, Jboss log, noApp log). 

The messagebox function enables you to display a text message on the console of the application server. This function can serve as a debugging tool. 

Syntax 
messagebox("message",0)
where: message = message string 

messagebox(#fieldname,0);
where: fieldname = name of the field in the map, displays a message with the string value 

Note: You must include the zero in the syntax (as noted above) for this function to work properly. 

It is suggested that a literal string always be written out before a field or variable to provide a visual reference in the log file indicating what the value is. 

Example:
MessageBox("** This is field TribalFrog ** ",0);
MessageBox (#TribalFrog,0);
