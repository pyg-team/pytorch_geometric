Title: IBM Receive WASX7209I and ADMA5026E errors when enabling starter store enhancements - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to enable starter store enhancements, you see the following error in the enablement logs:

WASX7209I: Connected to process "dmgr" on node <Node Name>

Also, you see the following error in the wsadmin.traceout log file.

ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName 

SYMPTOM
You receive errors in the enablestore-enhancements_timestamp.log and the wsadmin.traceout log file. 

The error in WC_installdir/instances/instance_name/logs/enablestore-enhancements_timestamp.log is similar to the following example:

WASX7209I: Connected to process "dmgr" on node <CellManagerName>
using SOAP connector; The type of process is: DeploymentManager 
failed: com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingException: 
javax.management.MBeanException: Exception thrown in RequiredModelMBean 
while trying to invoke operation generate 

BUILD FAILED 

/apps/wc70/commerceserver/components/common/xml/enableFeature.xml:82
The following error occurred while executing this line: 
/apps/wc70/commerceserver/components/common/xml/enableFeature.xml:153


The error in the wsadmin.trace file is similar to the following example:

WC_profiledir/logs/wsadmin.traceout: 


com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException: ADMA5026E: No 
valid target is specified in ObjectName 
WebSphere:cell=<cellname>,node=<Node Name>,server=<commerce webserver name>
Webserver for module Solr.war+WEB-INF/web.xml. 
" follows: 
com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException: 
javax.management.MBeanException: Exception thrown in RequiredModelMBean 
while trying to invoke operation setApplicationInfo 
at com.ibm.ws.scripting.AppManagementProxy.setApplicationInfo(AppManagement 
Proxy.java:325)


CAUSE
The correct cell, node and server name were not provided when the wsadmin command was called to deploy the feature pack installation files. The enablement script uses the createInstance.properties configuration files to provide the input parameters when calling wsadmin. The createInstance.properties file is located:

WC_installdir/instances/instance_name/properties/createInstance.properties


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Issue the following wsadmin commands to find the correct cell, node and server name. Make sure there are no typos in the values you have specified in the createInstance.properties file or Administrative Console: 


<WAS_ND_ROOT>/bin/ ./wsadmin.sh
wsadmin>$AdminConfig list Cell
wsadmin>$AdminConfig list Node
wsadmin>$AdminConfig list Server

2)Once you have verified and corrected this variables you can save createInstance.properties and try to run the enablement once again.
