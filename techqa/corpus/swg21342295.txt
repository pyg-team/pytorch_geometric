CAUSE

The Transaction log for the 'content store' database is full (or cannot be extended because the SQL server's disk is full)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Depending on the circumstances, you may have to either:

(a) Ask the I.T. department's SQL DBA to shrink the transaction log

Or 

(b) Free up disk space on the SQL server's hard drive (which stores the transaction log).
