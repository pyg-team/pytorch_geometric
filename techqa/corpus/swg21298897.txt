PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You created a Web Service Proxy (WS Proxy) based on a .wsdl file and want to refresh when there are changes in the .wsdl file. The file is located on the DataPower appliance under the "local" directory. You created a WSDL Cache Policy to specify the local .wsdl file for the URL Match expression, but the web service proxy state is not being refreshed when there are changes in the file. 

SYMPTOM
The WSDL Cache Policy is not refreshing from a WSDL in the local:/// directory.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In a WS Proxy, you can refresh WSDL from an URL using WSDL Cache policy. However, if the WSDL is hosted on the DataPower appliance, such as in local:///, rather than on an external URL, the WSDL Cache Policy does not apply. 

For instance, changes made to local:///test.wsdl are not picked up by WS Proxy although there is a WSDL Cache policy setting the URL Match expression to local:///test.wsdl. 

This issue was reported to Quality Engineering but it was determined that the DataPower device is working as designed. The device will not poll WSDL files on the local store.

The WSDL Cache policy works with WSDL files hosted on an external URL.

To refresh a WSDL in the local:/// directory, disable and re-enable the service.
