 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does ICC support automatic conversion of Input Files to PDF prior to being ingested into the Content Management repository? 

CAUSE
The customer has requirement to convert all input files to PDF and then archive into the repository

ANSWER
This feature is not supported out of the box. 

Customization is required to support this requirement. If you have a PDF conversion tool with a command line interface or a COM API, you can use the ICC Script Connector to implement this. ICC ships with a Script Connector sample, the User Exit task, that can be used to run commands within a task route, using metadata from the task route as input parameters.
