Title: IBM Environment variable DTX_CHDIR not working as expected using ITX V9.0.0. - United States

WTX ITX DTX_CHDIR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Environment variable DTX_CHDIR not working as expected using ITX V9.0.0. 

SYMPTOM
Environment variable DTX_CHDIR not working as expected using ITX V9.0.0.


CAUSE
This has been identified as a product defect under APAR PI62284.

ENVIRONMENT
Running a IBM Transformation Extender Map using the ITX Launcher and the map uses the EXIT function.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In releases prior to ITX V9.0.0, WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) changed from the directory of the currently running process to the map directory before it ran a map.




ITX V9.0.0 does not change to the map directory before it runs a map. ITX V9.0.0 resolves relative paths by appending the relative path to the directory of the currently running process. 

It is documented that environment variable DTX_CHDIR can be set to restore the pre ITX V9.0.0 behaviour so that affected relative paths resolve relative to the map directory. 

However, using the environment variable DTX_CHDIR, the Launcher still does not change the current directory to the map directory as expected before it executes maps. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is recommended not to use the DTX_CHDIR environment variable. 


Instead please use the ITX GETDIRECTORY() function as part of your rule in your ITX map to always reference a full path.
