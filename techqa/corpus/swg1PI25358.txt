APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Unified Task List (UTL) portlet when retrieves the Process
   Definition from a IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) server
   tries to check if there are any linked process. Then tries to
   parse those sub-processes. If these have other sub-processes
   defined, UTL is not able anymore to find the right Process
   Definition related to the Task Name that the user selected from
   the UTL Task List.
   This change ensures that a deep-first inspection of the entire
   BPM application is done until is able to find the Task Name
   needed. If all the processes are parsed and no corresponding
   task name is found, then a "Task Handling Not Found" exception
   is raised.
