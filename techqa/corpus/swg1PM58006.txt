APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to execute ejbDeploy with a DB2 V10 for z/OS backend
   and targeting WebSphere Application Server v7 fail for all
   versions lower than v7.0.0.23.
   
   Problem:
   
   1. You configure an EJB 2.1 project with a DB2 V10 for z/OS
   backend and you target WebSphere Application Server V7.0.0.x
   with x ? 23.
   
   2. You execute ejbDeploy from the command line of the WebSphere
   Application Server V7.0.0.x.
   
   Results:
   
   The command fails with an error like the following (in versions
   greater than V7.0.0.15):
   
   The mapping for backend DB2UDBOS390_V10_1 is invalid.
   The database software is not supported.
   More details are available in the file
   META-INF/backends/DB2UDBOS390_V10_1/SQLModelMigration.log.
   
   and fails with different errors in previous FixPacks.
   
   Expected result:
   
   The product documentation should document that ejbDeploy with
   DB2 V10 for z/OS targeting WebSphere Application Server v7.0.0.x
   is only supported starting from WebSphere Application Server
   V7.0.0.23.
   
   Local fix:
   
   There is no known workaround at this time.

   ****************************************************************
   The WebSphere Application Server ejbDeploy documentation
   does not indicate that a backend of type DB2 V10 for z/OS is
   not supported in WebSphere Application Server version
   7.0.0.x with x ? 23.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The documentation has been updated to indicate that
   WebSphere Application Server v7.0 ejbDeploy starting
   supporting backends of type DB2 V10 for z/OS as of
   v7.0.0.23.
