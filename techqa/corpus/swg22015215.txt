Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on November 02, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM InfoSphere Information Server. IBM InfoSphere Information Server has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078] for the current score
