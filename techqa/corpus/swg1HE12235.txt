ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If custodians are removed from a hold notice, but not released
   they are still considered to be on hold. If the hold notice is
   modified and the new version of the hold notice is published,
   the application displays the correct hold information in the
   Master List page but does not show those custodians as being on
   hold in Who Is On Hold report and Map Person pages.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Check the hold obligation from [matter] > Master List page for
   removed custodians
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   Master List page but does not show those custodians as being on
   hold in Who Is On Hold report and Map Person pages.
