Title: IBM How to deploy .dsar ruleset archive using the res-deploy Ant task in ODM - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I use res-deploy Ant task to deploy a ruleset archive for the decision engine ruleset (.dsar file), I get the error:
[res-deploy] [ERROR] ilog.rules.res.tools.http.IlrDeployRuleAppException: The RuleApp archive is not valid. 
[res-deploy] ilog.rules.res.model.archive.IlrArchiveException: The RuleApp archive is not valid. 


How do I deploy a .dsar ruleset file using an Ant task? 


CAUSE
This is expected behavior since the res-deploy Ant task deploys RuleApp archives, not ruleset archives. See the documentation at 
Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Decision Server Rules > Deploying business rules > Deploying rulesets > Deploying and exporting RuleApps [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.deploying%2Ftopics%2Ftsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html]




ANSWER
 

Create a RuleApp archive which contains the ruleset .dsar archive, and use res-deploy Ant task to deploy the RuleApp archive instead of the ruleset archive.
