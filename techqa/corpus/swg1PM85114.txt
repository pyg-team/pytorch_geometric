PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Virtual          *
   *                  Enterprise using on demand router custom    *
   *                  logs                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The on demand router (ODR) does not     *
   *                      count existing custom log files         *
   *                      (created in previous runs) towards a    *
   *                      history limit.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The on demand router (ODR) does not scan the log directory for
   pre-existing custom logs. Old history files remain in the
   directory between restarts. Old logs accumulate, and can use
   the available storage.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ODR custom logging code was modified to resolve this
   issue:
   The custom property 'http.log.history.backup.list' must be set
   to 'true', and the ODR counts existing custom log files
   towards a history limit, and rolls them over with any new log
   files, when history limit is reached.
   
   To configure the 'http.log.history.backup.list' custom
   property, in the administrative console go to:
   On demand routers > {odr name} > On demand router settings  >
   Custom properties
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in fix pack 7.0.0.3.
