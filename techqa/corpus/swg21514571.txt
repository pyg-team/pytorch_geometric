QUESTION
 How to install IBM InfoSphere Guardium Installation Manager (GIM) to manage STAPs 

ANSWER

IBM InfoSphere Guardium Installation Manager (GIM) simplifies the task of managing the IBM InfoSphere Guardium remote modules such as S-TAP, K-TAP and CAS. 

GIM is comprised of two parts - GIM Server and GIM Client. The server component is installed as part of an IBM InfoSphere Guardium appliance or Central Management installation and performs such duties as registering GIM clients, providing a list of available updates that are ready for download and installed on client servers, transferring software updates to the client server, and updating the installation status of clients. 

The GIM client application must be installed manually for the first time on all the database server machines. It performs duties such as registering to the GIM server, initiate a request to check for software updates, installing the new software, updating module parameters, and uninstalling modules. 

GIM's UI can be accessed from the GUI of the appliance and provides the user the ability to install, uninstall, upgrade IBM InfoSphere Guardium bundles and modules as well as provide feedback about database servers, installed modules, and statuses. Equivalent CLI commands also exist.

Port Used by GIM

Please refer to this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21973188] for ports required by GIM and other components of Guardum.

Installing GIM 

GIM consists of 2 modules: GIM client and GIM server. GIM Client is a set of perl scripts running on each DB Server. GIM server is a Java servlet installed as part of the IBM InfoSphere Guardium appliance installation and does not require any special installation procedure.

Installing GIM on a Unix Database Server

Place GIM client installer on the database server in a convenient directory. While a particular location is not required, it is better to designate a location for all Guardium related media for easier access. The installer is a file in the following format:

guard-bundle-module-version_name_sw_revision-os-os_version-os_vendor-processor.gim.sh.

For example: guard-bundle-GIM-doberman_r2841_1-aix-5.3-aix-powerpc.gim.sh 

The installation of GIM is straightforward and requires the following arguments:




Description Argument Value Comments The install location of GIM --dir Directory name Required The name/IP of the collector --sqlguardip The name/IP of the collector Required IP of the TAP host --tapip Real IP of the STAP host. Required Location where perl is installed --perl directory path to perl binary Optional: Required if perl is installed in a directory other than in /usr/bin. If the full path to perl is /usr/local/uxutils/perl, the value to this parameter is /usr/local/uxutils 
Examples 
 * Default Perl: ./guard-bundle-GIM-doberman_r2841_1-aix-5.3-aix-powerpc.gim.sh -- --dir /usr/local/gim --sqlguardip sqlgrd_coll1 --tapip 1.23.45.678 
 * Non-default Perl: ./guard-bundle-GIM-doberman_r2841_1-aix-5.3-aix-powerpc.gim.sh -- --dir /usr/local/gim --sqlguardip sqlgrd_coll1 --tapip 1.23.45.678 --perl /usr/local/uxutils


Verify that GIM is running by executing the following command:

ps -ef | grep gim

Verify that the GIM has successfully connected to the collector by logging to collector GUI by navigating to:

Administration Console / Module Installation / Process Monitoring

and verify that GIM and "Supervisor" for the STAP IP are green. If it is not green, verify that there were no installation errors and that the port used by GIM as specified earlier in this article is open and available for use by GIM 

Uninstalling GIM on a Unix Database Server

Uninstall GIM by executing <gim install dir>/modules/GIM/current/uninstall.pl.

For example: /usr/local/guardium/modules/GIM/current/uninstall.pl

Installing GIM on a Windows Database Server

To install GIM client (on the database server) the following steps must be followed: 
 1. Place GIM client installer on the database server in a convenient directory. 
 2. Run the setup.exe file to begin wizard install the GIM client 
 3. Follow the direction of the installation wizard. 


Perl for GIM on Windows 

The GIM client requires perl version 5.8.x or 5.10.x. The installer contains a suitable perl package. RELATED INFORMATION
