QUESTION
 Can you add more IP addresses to an existing network in OpenStack IceHouse using IBM Cloud Orchestrator? 

CAUSE
You have a network with neutron flat network and your IP allocation pool for a particular defined network starts from 9.xxx.xxx.4 to 9.xxx.xxx.6. 
You wish to add a new range to the same network from 9.xxx.xxx.8 to 9.xxx.xxx.12.

You reviewed the neutron subnet-update [http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html#neutronclient_subcommand_subnet-update] command and it requests a json or xml file for the update. 

There is no documentation available to see the format of this json or xml to be used to update.


ANSWER
There is no supported way to add more IP addresses to an existing network in OpenStack IceHouse [https://www.openstack.org/software/icehouse/]. 

 

 * There is no way to edit the allocation pools that are already part of a subnet in IceHouse. 
 * You are not able to amend, add, reduce or in any other way modify, this is due to OpenStack IceHouse making allocation pools read-only after initialization. 


There are no plans to fix this issue in IceHouse. 

This issue has been fixed in OpenStack Juno [https://www.openstack.org/software/juno/].
