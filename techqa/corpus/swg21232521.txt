Title: IBM Creating a Windows service for DB2 Content Manager resource manager in WebSphere Application Server Version 6 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The IBM速 DB2速 Content Manager server installation deploys resource manager Web application. The default is to install that web application into its own WebSphere速 Application Server, named icmrm by default. That server can be started by running [app_server_root]\bin\startServer [server_name]. This note describes how to install that WebSphere Application Server as a Windows速 service when using WebSphere Application Server V6. 

ANSWER
An alternative to starting a WebSphere Application Server with "[app_server_root]\bin\startServer" is to add a Windows service.
WebSphere installation documentation describes defining a service when using WAS V5. For V6, the -profilePath option must be specified.


 1. cd app_server_root\bin 
 2. wasservice -add icmrm -serverName server_name -profilePath "profile_root"
    where  * server_name is the application server's name. The DB2 Content Manager server installation defaults the server name to icmrm. 
     * profile_root is the fully-qualified path of the profile in which the server was installed. The DB2 Content Manager server installation defaults to the default profile, in which case the profile_root is app_server_root\profiles\default
    
    
 3. Verify that the service is in Control Panel --> Services as "IBM WebSphere Application Server V6 - icmrm" 
 4. You can modify the startup type either in Services, or specify 
    '-startType automatic | manual | disabled' on the above wasservice command.


Uninstalling DB2 Content Manager will not uninstall the service. You can remove the service definition with:  1. cd app_server_root\bin 
 2. WASService.exe -remove icmrm


Example of adding icmrm server in the default profile as a service 

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\bin>wasservice -add icmrm -serverName icmrm -profilePath "c:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\default" 
Adding Service: icmrm 
Config Root: c:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\default\config 
Server Name: icmrm 
Profile Path: c:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\default 
Was Home: C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\ 
Start Args: 
Restart: 1 
IBM WebSphere Application Server V6 - icmrm service successfully added.
