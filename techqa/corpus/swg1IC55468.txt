ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPC overloaded modelled faults are not distinguished by
   the Mediation Flow Component. A BPC flow can set a Fault Name
   field amongst other details for a thrown fault, however a
   Mediation Flow Component is only able to distinguish between
   modelled faults using their BO Type.
   
   If two different modelled faults have the same BO Type, the
   modelled fault that is selected is not consistent, even if
   the BPC module has given them different Fault Names.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  If you experience this issue there is a workaround by using
   different Business Objects for each of the modelled faults.
   This allows the mediation to select the correct one. To
   implement this workaround you should perform the following:
   
   1) Create new  Business Objects in the library for each
   modelled fault. For example, Fault1 and Fault2 that both have
   the same structure as the previous common BO.
   
   2) Change the 'Type' fields of the modelled faults in the
   interface to use these new Business Objects instead of the
   common Business Object.
   
   3)In the BPC flow replace the use of the common Business
   Object with one of the new Business Objects as appropriate.
   Every instance of the common Business Object will need be to
   changed.
   
   When the flow is run, the BPC process will throw a different
   Business Object for the different faults, which can then be
   matched to the correct modelled fault flow in the mediation.
   
   NOTE: APAR JR28228 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR28228] allows the BPC faults with common Business
   Objects to be distinguished when using an SCA binding, however
   the above workaround is still required when using a Mediation
   Flow Component.
