   ****************************************************************
   When IBM BPM uses a DB2 for z/OS
   database with the decimal=comma
   setting,
   bootstrapProcessServerData.sh fails
   with the following
   BadSqlGrammarException error message:
   org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarE
   xception: PreparedStatementCallback;
   bad SQL grammar [insert into
   LSW_ACL_ENTRY(acl_entry_id,group_id,po_
   type,po_id,mask)
   values(1,3,5000,?,127)]; nested
   exception is
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlSyntaxErrorExcept
   ion: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-104,
   SQLSTATE=42601,
   SQLERRMC=,5000;MICROSECONDS

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 is available that updates the
   SQL so that the error is eliminated and the
   bootstrapProcessServerData.sh script runs cleanly against a
   DB2 for z/OS database with decimal=comma configured.
