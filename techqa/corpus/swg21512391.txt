Title: IBM What is the best way to use SYSMIS and / or MISSING function in a DO IF syntax command? - United States

DO IF syntax sysmis missing values not correct spss TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I do have a variable X in my file with some system missing values. I do want to create a new variable Y which is 1 when a case in X is value 0 and Y should be 2 for cases that are non equal zero in X. For system missing values I would like to have the value 99 in the new variable Y and would like to define it as user missing value. I tried it with the syntax below.

However, when I look at the result the values of Y are all fine but not for the system missing values. They are still SYSMIS and not 99, why is this?

DATA LIST / x (F2.0). 
BEGIN DATA 
0 
0 

2 
1 
1 
5 
END DATA. 
EXECUTE. 


DO IF (X EQ 0). 
COMPUTE Y=1. 
ELSE IF (X NE 0). 
COMPUTE Y=2. 
ELSE IF SYSMIS(X).
COMPUTE Y = 99. 
END IF. 
MISSING VALUES Y (99). 
EXECUTE. 

ANSWER
If you would like to compute something for system or user defined missing values in a DO IF structure it is by design of the flow control within that command to define the statement for SYSMIS or MISSING values at the top of the DO IF command and not in an ELSE IF or ELSE following the DO IF.
Please change your command so that it looks like the one below and will get the 99 value in the new variable Y.
An enhancement request was submitted to IBM SPSS Development to include more examples in the help pages for handling missing/sysmis values within DO IF syntax.

DATA LIST / x (F2.0). 
BEGIN DATA 
0 
0 

2 
1 
1 
5 
END DATA. 
EXECUTE. 


DO IF SYSMIS(X).
COMPUTE Y = 99.
ELSE IF (X EQ 0). 
COMPUTE Y=1. 
ELSE IF (X NE 0). 
COMPUTE Y=2. 
END IF. 
MISSING VALUES Y (99). 
EXECUTE.
