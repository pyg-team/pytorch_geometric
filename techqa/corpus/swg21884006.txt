QUESTION
 How to send a non-file object like a program object (save file) using the CDSND command 

CAUSE
The ultimate goal is to transfer the objects contained within a library to a remote system. The issue is transferring the non-file objects.

ANSWER
In order to send a program between two i5/OS systems, the program must first be put into a Save File. 

The CDSND command would include FMSYSOPTS('TYPE(OBJ)') TOSYSOPTS('TYPE(OBJ). 

 NOTE: Code in the TDISP parameter RPL in case the savefile already exists on the receiving side.
