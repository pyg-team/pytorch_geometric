Title: IBM Clearing Information Server DataStage logs for jobs that run 24x7 - United States

Text:
WISD ISD TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have a Services job that runs continuously (24x7). Since the logs auto-purge function waits until the job stops to clear the log, how do I clear the log since the job never stops? 

ANSWER
Auto-purge is triggered on the completion of a job so an always-on job will never trigger auto-purge. 

ISD/WISD jobs can be configured to have a maximum-lifetime so that the always-on job will be periodically stopped and a new instance started which will trigger auto-purge.
