Title: IBM Unable to locate component, MSVCR71.dll - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I start IBM SPSS Text Analytics for Syrveys I receive two messages. The first error message window is titled "- Unable To Locate Component" and states that "This application has failed to start because MSVCR71.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem". 

The second message advises "launcher error 0005 Java VM not found."

I have tried to reinstall several times but the error persists. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem is often due to a missing or corrupt file. 

Check the "Windows\system32\" folder to confirm that the MSVCR711.dll exists, if it does rename it to something like MSVCR711.dll.old the copy a the MSVCR711.dll file from the folloing location "C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Text
Analytics for Surveys\4\jre\bin". This folder may vary if you have not installed IBM SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys in the default folder.
