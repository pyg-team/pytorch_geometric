QUESTION
When trying to connect to a Domino server, the following errors display: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


If you ping the server or IP address, you see that basic connectivity is present over TCP/IP. In one particular case, the Domino server's TCP/IP address had just been changed and even under these circumstances, the new TCP/IP address resolved correctly. 

It appears as if Notes is caching old and obsolete IP addresses. 
ANSWER
You can work around this issue as follows:

1. Create a new Location document in the local names.nsf. (Steps to create a Location document [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKTWP_9.0.1/com.ibm.notes901.help.doc/locacc_loc_manual_c.html?lang=en]). This forces Notes to not use the cached "last known good address" which is kept even with a reboot. 

2. Create a formula agent to clear the fields in the Location document, per the steps listed here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKTWP_9.0.1/com.ibm.notes901.help.doc/agt_create_agent_t.html?lang=en]. Set the formula's action to the following: 


 *

 * 
 * 


NOTE: For testing purposes, you can insert the following parameter in the notes.ini file: dont_use_remembered_addresses=1 

This parameter is read by the Notes client ONLY during startup. Its purpose is to test server searches. The parameter does not clear the address cache and is not designed to do so. It causes Notes to not load remembered paths stored in the cache. Use this for testing purposes only since it is not a permanent solution to these errors. RELATED INFORMATION
