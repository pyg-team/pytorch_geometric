APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS Explorer V5.2.0 is unable to connect to a a CICSPlex SM or
   single CICS region (SMSS) running CICS Transaction Server for
   z/OS V5.3. CICS Explorer is backwards compatible with earlier
   CICS releases, but not forward compatible with newer CICS
   releases. Attempts to connect CICS Explorer V5.2 to a CICS TS
   V5.3 server produce message IZE0106E Connect failed with
   "Unsupported CICS release"
   This APAR adds support for CICS Explorer V5.2 to make a CMCI
   connection to a CICS TS V5.3 server.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  CICS Explorer V5.2 can connect to CICS regions running CICS TS
   V5.2 or earlier. It is not able to connect to a a CICSPlex SM or
   single CICS region (SMSS) running CICS Transaction Server for
   z/OS V5.3. Any attempt to do so receives message:
   IZE0106E Connect failed with "Unsupported CICS release"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS Explorer V5.2 has been enhanced so that it can create a
   CMCI connection to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.3.
   Connections to CICSPlex SM or to single CICS regions (SMSS) are
   supported.
   When connected to a CICS TS V5.3 system, CICS Explorer V5.2 will
   function as if the CICS system were at V5.2 or lower. CICS
   Explorer V5.2 cannot be used to manage resources added at CICS
   TS V5.3.
   This fix will be made available in Version 5.2.0.7 of the CICS
   Explorer.
