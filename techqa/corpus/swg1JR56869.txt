ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you start several cluster members on the same machine at
   the same time, you might see the following ADME0005E error in
   the <profile_root>/logs/<serverName>/SystemOut.log file:
   
   [10/5/16 14:26:33:103 KST] 0000010d NotificationD E
   ADME0005E: The following notification listener was removed
   because it did not handle a notification within 300000ms:
   ListenerInfo: [listener=com.ibm.bpm.crconfig.component.
   BPMContextRootConfigComponent@10d2b8bb;ntfyInfo=NotificationInfo
   :[name=WebSphere:name=Discovery,process=De1.AppClusterMember1,
   platform=common,node=Node1,version=8.5.5.10,type=Discovery,
   mbeanIdentifier=Discovery,cell=PCCell,spec=1.0;filter=null];
   handback=null]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM BPM context root service initializes synchronously in
   the notification listener. When many applications are installed,
   the initialization takes longer than the 5 minutes, during which
   time a notification listener must finish its work. As a result,
   the ADME0005E error is recorded.
