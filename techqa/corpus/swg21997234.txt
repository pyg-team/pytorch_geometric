ANSWER
To get past this issue execute the following steps:
• Running JazzSM 1.1.2.1 full install on the server, fails while installing Registry Services. However DB2, IIM and WebSphere get installed before the installation failure.
• Run the following commands as db2 instance owner:
db2 start
db2 connect to FRSDB
db2 catalog database FRSDB as TSMAL001 at node TSMNODE1
db2 list db directory
db2 catalog db FRSDB on /home/smadmin1
db2 upgrade db FRSDB
• Uninstall WebSphere through IM only (if it is already installed)
• Clean up and Delete JazzSM and WebSphere directories under /opt/IBM.
• Run JazzSM installation through IM and select all the packages except schema installation for the Registry Services.
The existing FRSDB will be used while installation.
Ensure umask is set to 0022 and start the installation using IIM. Installation fails is umask is set to anything else.

NOTE: Registry service along with Admin and Security services have been deprecated post 1.1.2.1 and can't be installed in JazzSM 1.1.3.0. If you are not using these service please do not install them to avoid an overhead on your servers.
