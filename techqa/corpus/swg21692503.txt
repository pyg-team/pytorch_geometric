Title: IBM The JNI layer causes unexpected BAPI adapter class loading error messages to get reported in Broker log files. - United States

Text:
BIP7050E: Failed to locate Java class com.ibm.websphere.dtx.m4r3bapi.; BAPI; JBAPI: JALE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running the WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Java based adapter (JBAPI or JALE) under IBM Integration Bus (IIB), a large number of class load errors are logged by IIB (Message Broker). The message can be misleading if the BAPI class load actually succeeded. 

SYMPTOM
 BIP7050E: Failed to locate Java class com.ibm.websphere.dtx.m4r3bapi. A large number of this class load failure message would get logged which can be misleading.


CAUSE
The failed to load java class message occurs because WTX performs BAPI class loading with two attempts. If com.ibm.websphere.dtx.m4r3bapi fails, then it tries com.ibm.websphere.dtx.m4r3bapi.MAdapterImpl. The first attempt is there due to a special class of WTX adapters, which does not apply to the WTX BAPI adapter. Therefore, whenever a BAPI class needs to be loaded, it is expected that the above message will be logged by the Broker system. The way to know if the BAPI class load actually succeeded is to examine the WTX JNI trace, the BAPI trace, the WTX run log, and/or the Broker verbose class loading trace. 

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Transformation Extender and IBM Integration Bus (formerly Message Broker).

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A large number of BIP7050E: Failed to locate Java class com.ibm.websphere.dtx.m4r3bapi. errors are observed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please request APAR: PI22407 to reduce the number of logged messages.
