APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The regression with the pvr.widget.PropertyTable widget in
   IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3 Fix Pack 8 causes a problem with
   the datacap plugin as described below.
   In the line item on the verification screen in datacap
   navigator, when you scroll down to the last line and click on
   any field, it automatically scrolls back to the first line ie.
   the outline goes around the top box . The issue seems to happen
   with all the fields on all the line items, specially the last
   line.
   This happens with V2.0.3 FP8 but not V2.0.3 FP5.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Downgrade to ICN V2.0.3 FP5.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a user is editing a property table with several row
   entries and the user selects a cell in a row other than the
   first row, the focus will go to the first row but still be in
   the same column as the original selection.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue has been addressed in IBM Content Navigator V2.0.3
   Fix Pack 8 LA005
