IMPORTANT: As of APAR IT13446, MD5 signatures are no longer compatible with Java, installing this firmware will make it incompatible with any WebSphere eXtreme Scale clients or other XC10 appliances that are running with an MD5 certificate. 

If any XC10 appliances in your collective are configured with a certificate with an MD5 signature, then those certificates must be replaced on all XC10 appliances before applying this firmware upgrade. In addition, all client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate prior to restarting the collective. If this is not done the clients and appliances in the collective will fail to connect with each other. 

Planning will be required for this firmware upgrade since the firmware on all of the appliances in the XC10 collective must be upgraded and all of the client truststores properly configured prior to restarting the collective. Client Upgrade [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991] 8.6.0.8 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019704&amp;aid=1] Refer to the Version 8.6 table in the Recommended Fixes page for WebSphere eXtreme Scale [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018991].
