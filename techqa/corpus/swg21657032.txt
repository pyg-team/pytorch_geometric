Title: IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender map may hang when the file system runs out of space on UNIX platforms - United States

Text:
UNIX; hang; out of space TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the file system runs out of space on UNIX platforms, WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) map may hang. The issue may occur when running WTX Launcher or running WTX on an integration product such as WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (WESB), WebSphere Message Broker (WMB), etc. 

CAUSE
The failure to write to the file is not detected if the file system runs out of space on UNIX platforms. A WTX map may hang, run in an infinite loop, trying to write to the output or backup file. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please contact IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender support to request a patch for APAR PM98039. The fix will be included in next release.
