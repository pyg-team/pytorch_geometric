Title: IBM How to execute Metric Maintenance tasks from the command line or script - United States

Text:
batch shell TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to launch Metric Maintenance tasks through the command-line and/or script. 

CAUSE
Earlier versions of IBM Cognos Metrics Manager included *.bat/*.sh files for each task in the Services Control menu, which could be run from the command line or as part of a script. In Cognos 8, the Services Control menu has been replaced by the Metric Maintenance menu, and these tasks do not have corresponding *.bat/*.sh files to run outside of the user interface.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Execute Metric Maintenance tasks using TRIGGER.bat

Steps:  1.  Log into Cognos Connection as an administrator.
 2.  Create a new job in Cognos Connection to run the desired Metric Maintenance task(s).
 3.  Click on the Schedule icon (under the action column) next to the job link in Cognos Connection.
 4.  Under Frequency, click on By Trigger.
 5.  Specify a Start and End time (during this time , if you run the Trigger.bat file, it will be executed).
 6.  Define a name for the trigger.
 7.  Open a DOS command window on the server machine
 8.  Navigate to <install path>/webapps/utilities/trigger
 9.  Run the Trigger.bat (Windows) or Trigger.sh (UNIX) file as follows: Trigger.* <Gateway URL> <username> <password> <Namespace ID> <comma separated trigger list>. For example (Windows):
     
     Trigger.bat /Cognos8/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi"" >http://<server>/Cognos8/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi Administrator Password! "Local NT ID" trigger1
     
 10. If the trigger has been fired successfully you will get the following message in the DOS window:
     "Trigger: <trigger name> fired successfully
