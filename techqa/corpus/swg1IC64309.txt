APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The 'port' and 'host' fields of a .bindings file created by a
   file system JNDI initial context may get out of sync with the
   'connection list' if the file was created pre v7.0.1.
   
   If a 'connection list' is modified by a V7.0.1 client, the
   'connection list' value will be saved into JNDI, but the 'host'
   and 'port' fields will not be updated in the .bindings file.
   This means that an older client looking up the connection
   factory will still read the unmodified 'host' and 'port fields.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users who modify their file system Java
   Message Service (JMS) initial context using a v7.0.1 client and
   use the same initial context with clients at a lower level (v6,
   v7.0.0)
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The connectionNameList property on an MQConnectionFactory was
   introduced at v7.0.1.0 for use with the client reconnection
   capabilities.  Clients at earlier versions of the product (v6.x,
   v7.0.0.x) use the host and port fields to specify a single host
   to connect to, rather than a list of them.  When the
   connectionNameList was updated by a v7.0.1.0 client, the host
   and port fields were not being updated and so earlier clients
   would not have access to the modified connection details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In order to fix this issue, when the connectionNameList is
   updated, the first entry in the list is copied to the host and
   port fields.
   
   Please be aware that if an earlier client (v6.x or v7.0.0.x)
   subsequently updates any of the values for the connection
   factory, all entries in the connectionNameList will be
   overwritten with the single new host/port value.
