APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After increasing the configured database memory size, the DB2
   memory manager may not always allocate the underlying OS memory
   permitted as part of the increase, resulting in intermittent out
   of memory errors.
   
   When dynamically increasing the database memory configuration
   size, either through an update to the DATABASE_MEMORY
   configuration parameter or an underlying area (eg.
   SHEAPTHRES_SHR), DB2 does not immediately allocate a
   corresponding amount of OS memory.  Rather, the memory is
   allocated as required and needed for operations (even operations
   such as a bufferpool increase will use any free existing
   allocated memory before allocating any additional OS memory
   needed).
   
   This "deferred allocation" behaviour is intentional.  However,
   there are some allocation paths, typically for small allocation
   requirements, where the DB2 memory manager may only try to reuse
   existing allocated memory, ignoring the possibility of
   allocating new OS memory areas as permitted by the configuration
   increase.  This can result in a wide variety of out of memory
   messages (SQL0973, SQL0955, etc.).
   
   The out of memory messages typically occur under an increased
   fixed database memory limit or under a fixed instance memory
   limit, where the automatic database memory size has
   unnecessarily increased and exhausted instance memory.  The
   unnecessary increase is due to allocating new OS memory under a
   further database memory increase (rather than allocate new OS
   memory under the increase that already occurred).
   
   The easiest case to confirm is where a small allocation request
   fails even though there is an abundance of "unreserved" memory.
   For example, the db2diag.log entry for sqloMemLogPoolConditions
   shows the following failure to allocate 16000 bytes, yet the
   shared sort heap has only used 192GB out of 614GB configured,
   and there is 109GB of unreserved left in the set.  There is no
   obvious reason for the failure.
   
   Out of memory failure for Shared Sort Heap (SHEAPTHRES_SHR) on
   node 0.
   Requested block size           : 16000 bytes.
   Physical heap size             : 192185696256 bytes.
   Configured heap size           : 614400000000 bytes.
   Unreserved memory used by heap : 0 bytes.
   Unreserved memory left in set  : 109930479616 bytes.
   
   The immediate fix is to recycle the database.  During
   activation, DB2 preallocates all OS memory based on the database
   memory configured size, and the problem paths are avoided.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Recycle the database (force all applications, deactivate
   database)
