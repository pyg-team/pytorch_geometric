PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The output from the klctl.sh dbtest command shows that the Managing Server code fails to connect to the ITCAM database (e.g. octigate) successfully. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following command tells you if the Managing Server (MS) code is configured properly to access the ITCAM database. 



$MS_HOME/bin/klctl.sh dbtest 


If the connection is not successful, go to $MS_HOME/bin/setenv.sh and make sure that the JDBC user id and password are correct. 


JDBC_USER=amuser or whatever id you used for the schema owner JDBC_PASSWORD=xxxxxx where xxxxxx is JDBC_USER's password 


If you change either setting, you will have to recycle the MS to pick up the changes.


Note 


The password should be encrypted in setenv.sh. Please use the amctypto.sh script to encrypt the current password before updating the JDBC_PASSWORD.
