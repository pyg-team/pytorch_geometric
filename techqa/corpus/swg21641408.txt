Title: IBM OutOfMemoryException with workbench - United States

Text:
hung crash import hub configuration deploy hub configuration TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I was working with the MDS workbench and got exceptions similar to the ones below:

An out of memory error has occurred. Consult the "Running Eclipse" section of the read me file for information on preventing this kind of error in the future.
OR
Unhandled event loop exception 
PermGen space
OR
Unhandled event loop exception
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

Why am I getting these errors and how can I prevent them? 

CAUSE
Workbench executes programs containing JAVA bytecode by creating a Java Virtual Machine or a JVM. As with all JVMs, these run using memory consisting primarily of the following two types: heap (Java and native) and non-heap memory.

Java heap is used for creating java objects, native heap for native code like C or C++, and non-heap memory includes a method area shared among all threads and internal processing. If the workbench runs out of any of these type of memory, then it will error out with exceptions like the one printed above.

ANSWER
To prevent out of memory exceptions, we need to provide adequate memory such that the workbench runs smoothly. This memory allocation is done in the workbench.ini file which will be in your workbench installation directory. Following are the sample contents of the workbench.ini file:
-vm 
_jvm\bin\javaw.exe
-vmargs
-Xms128m
-Xmx512m
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties

If you are running out of java heap, then locate this ini file increase the -Xmx size to a higher value, say 1024m for 1 GB heap. Similarly, if you are running our of PermGen space, increase the XX:MaxPermSize to a higher value. These are run time values allocated during start-up, so restart your workbench for these changes to take effect.

Note: The above explanation assumes that the code being run does not have memory leaks; if it does, then please correct the code to eliminate the leak before increasing the available memory.
