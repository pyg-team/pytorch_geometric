PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Replacement Self-Describing Agent support is provided with
   a certificate that will not expire until June 5, 2021.
   
   The Self-Describing Agent deliverables included
   in this APAR are equivalent to the application
   support files shipped in the associated Fix Pack:
   
   5.5.0-TIV-KGW-FP0002.tar.gz
   5.5.0-TIV-KGW-FP0002.zip
   
   After installing this PTF, you must reload the RTE
   where an OMEGAMON for CICS TG on z/OS agent is running
   and then restart the agent.
   
   If you are NOT using the Self-Defining Agent (SDA) feature,
   this PTF must be installed in conjunction with fix pack
   5.5.0-TIV-KGW-FP0002 which must be applied to the TEPS
   environment and, if the hub TEMS is running on a non-z/OS
   platform it must be applied to the hub TEMS.
   However, if you are using SDA, this is not necessary.
   
   The SDA feature does not update the application support used
   by the TEP Desktop Client. To update the TEP Desktop Client's
   application support to the level delivered by this
   PTF, you must also install fix pack 5.5.0-TIV-KGW-FP0002.
