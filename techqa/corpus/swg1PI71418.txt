APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Developer for System z v9.0.1, debugger crashes for
   a COBOL program containing a FILLER field with accented
   characters when the string value ends at column 72.
   Here is an example of the FILLER field:
   
          01 WS-LISTX.
             03 FILLER              PIC X(0052) VALUE
                    '01instala&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o
   '.
   '.
   
   The same problem can be seen in RDz 9.1.1+ service packs.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Reduce the length of the FILLER value string to end before
   column 72
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When debugging code that contains national language characters
   with the Integrated Debugger, the source appears corrupted in
   the debug session, or a source not found error may appear.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The listing was not correctly being converted to UTF8 from the
   host encoding prior to being displayed in the editor.  This
   issue is now fixed.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
   IBM Rational Developer for System z V9.0.1.6 Fix Pack which
   is available from the Recommended Fixes support download page:
