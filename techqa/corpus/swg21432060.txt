QUESTION
What is the meaning of "ObjectServer file definitions" in the output from nco_confpack -list ?

CAUSE
According to the product documentation you can use nco_confpack utility to import and export a number of ObjectServer objects, (see Related Information link below for further information). These objects include: 

•Triggers 
•Trigger groups
•Procedures 
•User-defined signals
•Menus
•Tools
•Prompts
•Classes 
•Conversions
•Column visuals
•Colors
•Users
•Groups 
•Roles
•Tables 
•Indexes
•Views
•Restriction filters
•ObjectServer file definitions

But when we run confpack -list from our command like, it does not shows any ObjectServer file definitions (the last item in the above list). It only has the following output:
....
ObjectServer NCOMS Auto AdvCorr_LPC_RC
ObjectServer NCOMS Class AAA Generic(62000) 
ObjectServer NCOMS ColVisual Acknowledged 
ObjectServer NCOMS Color 0
ObjectServer NCOMS ConversionSet Acknowledged 
ObjectServer NCOMS Group Probe
ObjectServer NCOMS Index serial 
ObjectServer NCOMS Menu AlertsMenu
ObjectServer NCOMS Procedure send_email 
ObjectServer NCOMS Role SecurityAdmin 
ObjectServer NCOMS SQLFile trigger_stats_report 
ObjectServer NCOMS Signal stats_reset 
ObjectServer NCOMS Table alerts.status
ObjectServer NCOMS Tool Telnet Tool 
ObjectServer NCOMS User test
ObjectServer NCOMS View master.groups 
....
....



ANSWER
The list item "Objectserver file definitions" refers to objects such as the following:- 

 
Objectserver NCOMS Auto profiler_report Objectserver NCOMS Auto trigger_stats_report... 

You will not see a physical line like this in the output;

"Objectserver NCOMS Auto Objectserver_file_definitions"

Profiler_report and trigger_stats_report are both to Objectserver file definitions. These files provide a way to log or report information about Objectserver events.
