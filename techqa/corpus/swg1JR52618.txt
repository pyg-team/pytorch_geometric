APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the datetime input format is set to a date only without
   time portion, the input of a date attribute does not adhere to
   the format.
   
   For example:
   
   Datetime Output Format in MY SETTINGS is set to dd-MMM-yyyy and
   the Datetime Input Format is set to MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss, when a
   user attempts to input a value for a date attribute, the time
   portion is missing.  The date attribute input entry field
   should adhere to the Datetime input format
