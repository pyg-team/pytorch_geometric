APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is using a substitute variable :description
   in a communication template.
   
   When the customer sends an e-mail from an SR using the
   communication template, the e-mail subject is truncated
   and e-mail message body is garbled in case that
   SR.DESCRIPTION includes a carriage return code.
   
   There is a similar APAR IV03298 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV03298].
   Although it should have been fixed in MAM 7.1.1.10,
   the e-mail subject is still truncated with the following
   scenario in MAM 7.1.1.13 environment.
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   1) From "Go To"-"System Configuration"-"Platform
   Configuration"-"Communication Template", create a
   new template with the following values.
   
   --------------------------------------------------
   Template     :  PMR46653
   Description  :  Comm Temp for PMR 46653
   Applies To   :  SR
   Accessible   :  ALL
   Send From    :  maxadmin@localdomain
   Subject      :  TEST :description
   Message      :
   ******************* English **********************
   << Assignment / Approval >> Service Request
   (USR1004080) was allocated to the workgroup
   to which you belonged.
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   2) On "Recipients" tab, click "New Row" in "E-mail Address"
   section and specify the following values.
   
   E-mail : maxadmin@localdomain
   To?    : checked
   
   3) Then activate the communication template.
   
   4) From "Go To"-"System Configuration"-"Platform
   Configuration"-"Application Designer", open SR application.
   
   5) On canvas, select "Service Request" tab and add a new
   multiline textbox there specifying SR.DESCRIPTION in
   "Attribute" field.
   
   6) From "Go To"-"Service Desk"-"Service Requests", create
   a new SR specifying the following value in the multiline
   textbox added in the previous step 5).
   
   a
   a
   
   7) Select "Create"-"Communication" from "Select Action"
   menu.
   
   8) On "Create Communication" window, specify a communication
   template "PMR46653" in "Template" field and click "Send".
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   Checking the e-mail sent from Maximo, I can see that
   e-mail subject is truncated like below.
   
   TEST a
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   The customer expects that the e-mail subject should be
   like below.
   
   TEST a a
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   Besides the e-mail subject is truncated, the e-mail message
   could be also garbled depending on whether the mail server
   can understand where the message body begins and the result
   could change according to what kind of mail server is used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Try not to include a carriage return in summary field of SR.
