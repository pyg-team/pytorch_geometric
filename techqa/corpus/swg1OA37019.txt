APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An ABEND S0C4 can occur when OMEGAMON XE for CICS v420 when
   monitoring the CICS T.S. v4.1 and v4.2.  This will occur after
   applying PTF UK63439 for CICS.  This PTF introduces a new field
   in the DFHTFALA DSECT that requires the OMEGAMON XE for CICS
   code to be re-assembled to match the new CICS DSECT.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All OMEGAMON XE for CICS on z/OS users.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS module DFHALP can abend S0C4 when  *
   *                      using OMEGAMON to kill an AID in a      *
   *                      CICS/TS 3.2 region.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   After CICS/TS 3.2 APAR PM08688/PTF UK62680, OMEGAMON uses an
   incorrect parameter list when killing an AID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  OMEGAMON was changed to use the parameter list supplied in
   CICS/TS 3.2 APAR PM08688 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM08688].
   
   After this maintenance is applied, the change will take effect
   when an OMEG RECYCLE is issued in the CICS region or when the
   CICS region is recycled.
   
   NOTE: CICS module DFHALP can now abend S0C4 when using
   OMEGAMON to kill an AID in a CICS/TS 3.2 region without
   APAR PM08688/PTF UK62680, so that CICS PTF should be applied.
