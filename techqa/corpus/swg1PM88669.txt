   ****************************************************************
   In multi-cell star topology configurations, the service overlay
   network (P2P/SON) components bootstrap process can
   significantly slow the receipt of on demand configuration
   (ODC) data residing in linked remote cells. The delay in
   receiving ODC data can result in ODR processes incorrectly
   returning 404 error codes for some requests immediately
   after start-up.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The bootstrap process used by P2P/SON has been altered; the
   window which caused the delay in ODC data propagation is
   alleviated.
   
   This fix will be included in the next available fix pack for
   IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise.
