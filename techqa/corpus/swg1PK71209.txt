APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the subscriber server is not able to access the
   itemdispatcher url provided by the syndicator, then the items
   which fail to syndicate will not be resent during the next
   syndication attempt.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected Users: All Users
   
   Problem:
   
   If the subscriber server is not able to access the
   itemdispatcher url provided by the syndicator, then the items
   which fail to syndicate will not be resent during the next
   syndication attempt.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis:
   
   The message which indicates that there was an error which
   processing an individual item is sent to the itemDispatcher URL.
   If this URL is not working, then this message will not be
   received by the syndicator.
   
   Solution:
   
   Messages about individual item failures would be sent to the
   syndicator url rather than the itemdispatcher url.
