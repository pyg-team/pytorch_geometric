APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The error occurs in the task sequence
   
   action-install-wcm-hidden-authoring-->install-wcm-hidden-autho
   
   ring-page-->action-set-wcm-authoring-permissions
   
   
   
   It appears that the extraneous depends="init" on the
   
   action-install-wcm-hidden-authoring   task is causing the
   
   problem.  The init task is already
   
   called by default in ConfigEngine so it shouldn't be necessary
   
   to call it again.  I suspect that the  init call may be pulling
   additional path properties into
   
   the environment causing the error in the GetProperties.jacl
   
   script
   
   #load $propFileName as property file in the Properties object
   
   
   
   $fileprop load $fileStream
   
   
   
   The $fileStream loads from wp_portal.properties and the paths
   
   are all correctly escaped with double backslash
   
   env.WAS_PATH=C\:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\AppServer\\lib\\native\\win\\x
   
   
   
   86_64;........;c\:\\rbfg\\uuj\\uuj1;C\:\\Program
   
   Files\\Universal\\USap\\bin\\;
   
   
   
   I ran a second install and as soon as the prereq.wcm_cfg.xml
   
   file was installed, I edited the file , removed the
   
   depends="init" and saved the file.
   
   The install then completed successfully.
   
   
   
   In order to fix this properly we would need an iFix containing
   
   the updated prereq.wcm_cfg.xml , that would be installed by IM
   
   as part of the 8001 install.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  remove directory path with /u
