APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  End users do not expect that the results from their search
   could come from object stores that they have no access to. They
   are therefore confused by the error message "User does not
   have access to the Object Store" when they try to  open the
   returned documents.
   Additional Info:
   Even though documents from other object stores are retuned in
   the search results, attempts to open them will correctly
   return an error message "User does not have access to the
   Object Store". This is confusing for end users as there is
   nothing to indicate that the search results come from different
   object stores.
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Use P8 4.0 system with two object stores
   2. Logon to Workplace XT as admin user and note that both
   object stores are shown.
   3. Still logged on as admin user, go to Tools -> Admin -> Site
   Preferences and limit access to one of the object stores to
   "Application Engine Administrators" only. Logoff
   4. Logon as an ordinary user and note that the restricted
   object store (step 3) is no longer visible.
   5. Click on "Search" (magnifier icon) and select simple
   search.
   6. Enter the title of a document that is known to be in the
   object store that this user does not have access to.
   7. Run the search and note that documents from the limited
   object store will be returned.
   Actual Results:
   Objects from the object store the user does not have access to
   are returned in the search.
   Expected Results:
   That only objects from object stores the user does have access
   to would be returned.
