3. Request the latest patch or hot fix read me file to confirm if the issue has not previously been addressed.

4. Provide a document outlining steps to reproduce the issue with screen shots to better illustrate the scenario.

5. Attempt to confirm that the issue can only be reproduced in Utilities and is not related to Maximo core functionality.

6. Capture the application-specific logging. 

 * Configure the appropriate and application-specific logging parameters within the Maximo Logging application. For most cases, and for initial troubleshooting, the Debug Level can be set to INFO.  * Create an Application Logger for the module in which the issue is present:
      ex. PLUSDCUEST (for CU Estimating(T&D)) 
    * Create sql Loggers for as many subcomponents of the application that are suspected to be causative to the issue:
      ex. PLUSDCUESTIMATE.PLUSDESTDETAIL (for CU Estimating Details Info)
   
   
 * Capture the logging for the time period when the issue presents itself
