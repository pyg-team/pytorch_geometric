APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The PureApplication System raised a critical event:
   
   CWZIP6105E System management is offline
   
   which is categorized as a "Call Home" event.  A
   corresponding Call Home problem was not generated for the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The event was generated by a database call from a trap that did
   not contain parent data. Attempting to get that parent data
   caused a problem preventing the Call Home from executing. The
   code has been updated to check if the system database is
   available before attempting to access it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.2.2.0.
