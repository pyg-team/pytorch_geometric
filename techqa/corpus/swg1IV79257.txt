APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Summarization and Pruning agent fails to write historical
   data into DB2 summarized UNIX OS Agent "Disk" tables after an
   upgrade to 6.30 FP5. This occurs because the existing tables
   are defined in the 4K DB2 tablespace and the addition of new
   Disk attributes to the 6.30 FP5 "Disk" attribute group makes
   these tables exceed such limit.
   
   
   Problem:
    The Summarization and Pruning agent fails to write historical
   data into DB2 summarized UNIX OS Agent "Disk" tables after an
   upgrade to 6.30 FP5. This occurs because the existing tables
   are defined in the 4K DB2 tablespace and the addition of new
   Disk attributes to the 6.30 FP5 "Disk" attribute group makes
   these tables exceed such limit.
   
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
    This issue may affect the following versions, only if
   historical collection takes place on a DB2 warehouse: 6.30 FP5,
   6.30 FP4 since IF2, 6.30 FP3 since IF3, 6.23 FP3 since IF10
   
   Diagnostics:
    The following error messages shows up in the Summarization and
   Pruning RAS1 log at the default tracing level:
   
     == 11574124 t=work1 SQL IN ERROR :
       statement name     : Disk_H.Alt1
       SQL                : ALTER TABLE "ITMUSER"."Disk_H" ADD
       "Mount_Point_U" VARCHAR (768) template SQL       :
     == 11574125 t=work1 SQLException occured. SQL State = 54010 ,
   SQL Error Code = -670
     == 11574126 t=work1 com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlException: The
   statement failed because the row size of the resulting table
   would have exceeded the row size limit. Limit: "4005". Table
   space: "USERSPACE1".. SQLCODE=-670, SQLSTATE=54010,
   DRIVER=4.19.26
   
   
   Initial Impact:
    Medium, can no longer retrieve data from summarized historical
   Unix Disk tables after an upgrade.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Failure collecting historical data for the "Disk" attribute
   group after upgrade to 6.30 FP5
   
   
   After the upgrade to 6.30 FP5 the Summarization and Pruning
   Agent starts failing to add new rows to the hourly, daily,
   weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly summarized tables for the
   "Disk" attribute group in a DB2 Data Warehouse.  This is because
   of new columns added to these tables' definitions that make
   their size cross the DB2 legacy 4Kb limit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  New DB2 sql scripts are provided as part of the UNIX OS Agent
   support files on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server to move
   these tables into the 8Kb tablespace.
   
   
   Install Actions:
   There are a set of new SQL scripts named kux_63migr_Disk_*.sql
   which will be located on the portal sever.  These files need
   to be copied to the Warehouse server and run using the steps
   documented in the Procedure section for the "System"
   summarized tables in the Appendix A "Upgrading your warehouse
   for primary key and tablespace changes" of the UNIX OS Agent
   Reference Guide.
   
   If the files are not found on the portal server, they can be
   obtained via the technote:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964406 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964406]
   
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0003*
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0004*
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0005*
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0006*
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_UNIX-IF0007*
   
   
   *The files are copied to the portal server when the application
   support is updated via the Application Support Installer (ASI)
   interface.  If the application support is updated via the Self
   Describing Agent (SDA) the files can be obtained from the
   technote referenced above.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Download and run the required DB2 sql scripts
   from the following technote:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964406 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964406]
