Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in the IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-7679 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7679]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a buffer overread in mod_mime. By sending a specially crafted Content-Type response header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read one byte past the end of a buffer.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127420] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-7668 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7668]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a buffer overread in the ap_find_token() function. By sending a specially crafted sequence of request headers, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127419] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3167 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3167]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() function by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication requirements.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127416] for the current score
