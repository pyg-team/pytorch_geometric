Title: IBM Adabas file read question   - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We use Classic Federation to access Adabas data base records. 

How and what commands are issued to ADABAS by the Classic Federation product to retrieve the records from ADABAS? 

ANSWER
Basically, if there is a WHERE clause which CF can relate to the Adabas descriptors then CF will issue an Adabas S1 type command to establish a "found set of ISNs" and then use Adabas L1 type commands to retrieve the entries in that found set.
If the WHERE clause is of the form ISN_COL=value then CF will issue an L1 type command to retrieve the specifically identified record(s) by ISN. The L1 commands are "read by ISN" commands, but they are only used to resolve the descriptor processed or ISN containing WHERE clause, never to overtly read the entire file contents. 

For a small file it might be possible to set up a WHERE clause which would resolve to all of the records in the file, but this may not be simple (WHERE SOME_NUM_COL >= 0 will not work) and is not recommended for large files.

If there is no WHERE clause, or CF cannot properly resolve the WHERE clause using the available Adabas descriptors, then Adabas L2 type commands (read physical) will be used to retrieve all of the records in the file.

If further detail is desired, you can setting TraceLevel=3 for the QP. It should result in an Adabas command summary being produced for every Adabas call issued by a QP service.
