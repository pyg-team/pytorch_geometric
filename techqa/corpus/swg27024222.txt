Co-Installing vs Shell-Sharing 

Co-Install means two or more products are installed on the same machine, but into different package groups (each product functions independently). 

Shell-Share means two or more products are installed on the same machine in the same package groups. When starting one of the products, the functionality in other products will also be available.
