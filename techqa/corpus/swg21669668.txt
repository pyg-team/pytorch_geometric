SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
DESCRIPTION:
CVEID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector:(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.


CVEID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affects confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160 

You only need to remove existing broker SSL certificates and reissue new certificates for the broker component. To revoke the old certificates, they need to be removed from the trust store and replaced with the new certificates. Use the following steps to change your certificate. 

1) Revoke the existing broker certificates. To revoke the old certificates, they need to be removed from the trust store on the server. You will find instructions on how to do this in the following section of the documentation: 

v 9.1.0 

http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.tem.doc_9.1/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcbdelcert.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.tem.doc_9.1/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcbdelcert.html] 

v 9.0.1 and v 9.0.0 

http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.tem.doc_9.0/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcbdelcert.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.tem.doc_9.0/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcbdelcert.html] 

2) Issue new broker certificates. You will find instructions on how to do this in the following section of the documentation: 

v 9.1.0

3) 
If you have installed targets that are configured to use the broker, update the trust store on those targets by using the Target Configuration Wizard. Create a new configuration task and enter your new certificate in the Target Configuration Wizard, then run the task. You will find instructions on how to do this in the following section of the documentation: 

v 9.1.0
