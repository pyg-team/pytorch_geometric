ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description : Assembly Relation Position Matrix reverts to
   Identity after versioning a Component Assembly.
   We have found
   a number of Component Assemblies, where the details of the
   Component Assembly Relation Position Matrix reverts back to
   Identity after the Part is Versioned.
   We have not been able
   to identify a repeatable scenario.  We understand the
   difficulty in not having a reproducable scenario.
   I am
   including a sample SQL script and its output for Part number
   403Z1348-7.  You will see that in version ---, the Assembly
   Relationships have positioning.  In --A, the Assembly
   Relationships revert back to Identity.  Version --B is In Work
   and being used by the Engineer to correct the Instances
   created with Version --A.
   Without a reproducable scenario,
   this is difficult to debug.  However, this same part number
   should exist in the recent data rerfresh and  Workplace.  You
   should be able to see the postion shift in that data
   refresh.
   I am opening this CR to begin communication on the
   issue.  We are analyzing additional data and interviewing
   Designers as to what actions they may have been doing when
   this occured.

COMMENTS
 *  There is a utility in existence already that can repair the
   missing data.  "Unreproducible" in this case simply means that
   the repair already exists and there is no need for a new code
   delivery.
   THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   VERSION
   V5R18.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   VERSION V5R19
   SP6.
   Additional Closure Information:

   THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   VERSION
   V5R18.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :

   To run the repair utility, use the following
   documentation:
   Inside catstart,
   CorrectARMatrixPos -user
   USERNAME -pwd PASSWORD -vid PARTNUMBER -version VERSIONSTRING
   -report REPORTFILE
    -simul | -delete
   -user USERNAME
   :       user name
   -pwd  PASSWORD
   :       user password
   -vid PARTNUMBER
   :       User have to specify parent part number
   having child part with wrong matrix position
   -version
   VERSIONSTRING               :       User have to specify
   version string for parent part having child part with wrong
   matrix position
   -report REPORTFILE      :    Tool will
   create reports containing document name which is link to parts
   are not ok and will be deleted.
   -delete
   :       Run the tool and
   delete the invalid property. If not specified, simulation
   mode will be used.
   -simul
   :
   Run the tool without committing changes to database.  This
   option is assumed
   unless
   -delete is given.
   Return code signification:
   0
   : Quitting the application successfully
   1
   : Failed to get the session
   2              : Bad input
   parameter
   3              : Failed to create or write to report
   file.
   In the lab we corrupted a database to simulate the
   corruption at customer site, and then ran this utility in R19.
   It corrected the data.
