   The "Installing a resource adapter archive" topic in the
   Information Centers for WebSphere Application Server Versions
   6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 describe how to install RAR files at the node
   level. It does state how to install RAR files at a cluster or
   server level. You must first install the RAR files at a node
   level and then create a new copy of that file that is defined
   for the cluster or server level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the
   current documentation before you read this text. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at: http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate  for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the December,
   2008 update to the Information Centers for WebSphere
   Application Server Versions 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0.
   
   The topic ""Installing a resource adapter archive" will be
   updated to include the following note:
   
   Important: When you use the Install RAR dialog to installing a
   RAR file, the scope you define on the Resource Adapters page
   has no effect on where the RAR file is installed. You can
   install RAR files only at the node level, which you specify on
   the Install RAR page. To set the scope of an RAR file to a
   specific cluster, or server, after you install the RAR file at
   the node level, create a new copy of the RAR file with the
   appropriate cluster or server scope.
   
   Also, the following optional step will be added to the
   procedure for installing an RAR file:
   
   8. Optional: Create a copy of the RAR file with a different
   scope level. After you install the RAR file at the node level
   you can create another copy of the file that has a specific
   server or cluster as the scope for that file.
      a. Click Resources.
      b. Click Resource Adapters.
      c. Select the scope level and then click NEW.
      d. Choose the RAR file from the installed aRChive path.
      e. Click OK.
