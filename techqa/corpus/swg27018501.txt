Text:
Rational Automation Framework for WebSphere; RAFW RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
The IBM® Rational® Automation Framework for WebSphere version 7.1.1.4 release contains new fixes, enhancements, and new features.

It also includes all fixes, enhancements, and features from previous version 7.1.1 releases. 

The following is a summary of enhancements and new features in the version 7.1.1.4 release. 

CONTENT
1.0 Consumability improvements 

The following features and enhancements are related to product consumability. 

1.1 Environment Generation wizard

The Environment wizard now discovers existing WebSphere cell topologies. This new capability simplifies setup. You supply basic information that the Environment wizard needs to connect to the running WebSphere cell and read the topology. The Environment wizard imports the cell topology and generates required objects, including a project that uses a new super-composite action to import cell configuration data and complete setup.

1.2 Super-composite action for cell configuration

For an existing cell, the Environment wizard generates a project that inlines the new super-composite action: was_common_configure_all. This action imports the current configuration for the WebSphere cell by running more than 25 actions in a single command execution, saving time and system resources. 

1.3 Command enhancements and new command features

The rafw and rafwEnvBuild commands now support long arguments for most command options; for example, use -e or –env to specify the environment name for the rafw command. 

The rafw command has added the –opt option to allow you to pass custom properties to an action in the form of name-value pairs.

Enhancements to compare mode include improvements to the comparison report messages. Messages now generate more context information from the configuration file for each change listed. The additional information makes it easier to find and synchronize configuration data.

1.4 Enhanced integration with Rational Build Forge

The createAll option of the integrateToBF command now includes the ability to automatically create the Rational Build Forge server object and its associated objects: an environment, a server auth, and a selector. 

In addition, the createAll option of integrateToBF also adds new V7.1.1.4 actions to the Libraries module and new mode options to the RAFW_Global environment in Rational Build Forge.

A new option for integrateToBF, createIntegrationArtifacts, adds objects to Rational Build Forge to support integration with other IBM products. In V7.1.1.4, integration with WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance is supported.

1.5 Augment mode support for configuration actions

Augment mode allows you to add new data to an existing configuration in WebSphere; for example, add a JDBC data source for a new application. Augment mode adds new data to your tested and working cell configuration. Specify the configuration data to be added in an augment file and run the action to add the new data. The existing cell configuration is not deleted, updated, or replaced. To synchronize the cell definition with the newly augmented configuration in WebSphere, use the –opt importAfterAugment flag.

Augment mode is supported for configuration actions for WebSphere Application Server.

1.6 Promote mode support for configuration and deployment actions

Promote mode allows you to leverage configuration changes and testing completed in one environment and reuse those changes in another environment. For example, promote changes from DEV source to QA target for testing or from PROD source to DEV target for debugging. The source and target scopes can be anywhere in the environment tree. As a part of the promote action, you can change scope-specific value such as host names, if you specify them in a promote.properties file. After promoting configuration changes, you must run the action in execute mode to apply the configuration changes to a WebSphere cell. 

Promote mode is supported for configuration and deployment actions for WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server (IHS), and WebSphere Portal. 

2.0 Integration with WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance

The capability to integrate Rational Automation Framework for WebSphere and WebSphere Cloudburst Appliance delivers additional value to users:

- Customize your patterns that represent WebSphere cells by using configuration
and deployment actions provided by Rational Automation Framework for
WebSphere.

- Actions are supported for WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server
(IHS), and WebSphere Portal.

- Automate and standardize pattern customization by using projects. A project
contains actions that execute a standardized, repeatable customization every
time.

- Apply projects to a single pattern or to all of your patterns. You can apply a
project every time that a pattern is deployed or only one time. Selecting a project
is optional when you deploy a pattern.

- Using a standard, repeatable set of actions to customize a pattern ensures that
your development, testing, and production environment have a consistent
definition.

3.0 Additional platform support
In V7.1.1.4, new platforms are supported for target systems and the framework server.

3.1 Support for managing WebSphere Portal target systems on z/OS

In V7.1.1.4, WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS versions 6.0 and 6.1 are supported. Support details are as follows:
- Installation actions are not supported and most post-installation actions are not supported. 
- Configuration actions are supported. For a list of supported WebSphere Portal actions, see the Information Center: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rafwhelp/v7r1 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rafwhelp/v7r1]

3.2 Additional platform support for the framework server
In V7.1.1.4, support was added for running the framework server on Windows 2008.

4.0 New actions added to support the latest WebSphere fix packs

New actions were added to support installation of the latest fix packs for: 
- WebSphere Application Server 6.1 and 7.0
- IBM HTTP Server (IHS) 6.1 and 7.0
- WebSphere Portal 6.0 and 6.1
