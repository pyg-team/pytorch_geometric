PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When deploying JSR 168 Portlets on WebSphereÂ® Portal 6.1, the following error occurs:

LanguageSetIm E com.ibm.ws.portletcontainer.om.common.impl.LanguageSetImpl loadResourceBundle EJPPC0103E: Error occurred while initializing portlet
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name 
com.ibm.testportletspace.nl.TestPortletSpacePortletResource
, locale en
at java.util.ResourceBundle.throwMissingResourceException(ResourceBundle.java:853) 

SYMPTOM
A portlet installs but does not initialize. When you place a portlet on a page, you see the message that this portlet is temporarily unavailable.


CAUSE
This error occurs when the resource-bundle entry in the portlet.xml file needs modification.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In your portlet.xml file, you have a line like the following:


<resource-bundle> 

 * 

</resource-bundle> 

Change that line to read as follows, as one line: <resource-bundle>com.ibm.testportletspace.nl.TestPortletSpacePortletResource</resource-bundle>

Then uninstall and reinstall the portlet, or update the preserve configuration settings option in the DeploymentService resource provider. 

Refer to the WebSphere Portal Information Center [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/zones/portal/proddoc.html] for more information on setting those settings.
