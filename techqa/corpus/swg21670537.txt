ABSTRACT
 The IBM Tivoli Monitoring for System P agents (AIX Premium, CEC Base, HMC Base and VIOS Premium) are not affected by the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160). 

CONTENT
By default, the IBM Tivoli Monitoring for System p agents do not use OpenSSL. However, users might configure agent communication to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring System (TEMS) using OpenSSL key generation. In that case, use OpenSSL Version 1.0.0j or later.
The communication from the HMC Base agent to the HMC uses ssh and not OpenSSL.
