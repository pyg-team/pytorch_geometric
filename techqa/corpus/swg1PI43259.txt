PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * IMS V14 users of DDL with GSAM databases are affected.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The universal drivers need a way to access a table or root   *
   * segment for a GSAM database.  We need to allow GSAM to have  *
   * a root segment be defined with fields.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * INSTALL CORRECTIVE SERVICE FOR APAR/PTF                      *
   ****************************************************************
   The IMS data definition language (DDL) for a GSAM database does
   not allow tables or columns to be created.  Users are able to
   map the contents of their GSAM databases using COBOL copybooks.
   Using IMS Enterprise Suite Explorer for Development (E4D) and
   the IMS Universal JDBC drivers, users need a method to import
   their COBOL copybooks for a GSAM database and have them stored
   in the IMS catalog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFS3ACH was modified to correct the length declaration for
   constants CATA_MCRPOOL1 and CATA_WORKPOOL.
   
   DFS3DST0 was modified to add a new flag in the DBDBLOCK work
   area to identify to the catalog decoder is processing a GSAM DBD
   that has a SEGM defined.
   
   DFS3DBDG was modified so it can translate a record from the IMS
   catalog that represents a GSAM database that also contains
   segment and field information.
   
   DFSSQLA was modified to add a field to save the database os
   access type.
   
   DQFHSM4B was modified to change the maximum record length that
   can be specified on the CREATE TABLESPACE statement from 64K to
   32K.
   
   DFSDDL10 was modified to validate the record length values
   specified on the CREATE TABLESPACE statement.
   
   DFSDDL20 was modified to allow one table space to be created for
   a GSAM database.  Validation added to only allow the CCSID and
   IN keywords to be specified on a GSAM table.  Validation also
   added to only allow column and map definitions on a GSAM table.
   
   DFSSQL10 was recompiled to pick up changes implemented in
   DQFHSM4B.
