LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Thread hang when CICS/WAS application(using JNIReaderPool) makes
   an EJB request using the ORB. This is due to the Connection not
   moving to ESTABLISHED state.An outgoing new request is waiting
   forever for the Connection to move to ESTABLISHED state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR11
   5.0.0 SR14
   .
   The ORB has been fixed to move the Connection to ESTABLISHED
   state prior to the Reader Thread getting created.
