APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: The snap trace describes a failed assertion:
   
   ** ASSERTION FAILED ** at ParallelScavenger.cpp:2993:
   ((MM_StackSlotValidator(MM_StackSlotValidator::NOT_ON_HEAP,
   *slotPtr, stackLocation, walkState).validate(_env)))

LOCAL FIX

   xitUnsafe*}
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This is a problem with JIT live monitor metadata. The
   optimization incorrectly made some assumption which is untrue in
   this corner case. The problem could appear on x, power, or z.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  JIT has been updated to handle this special case.
   .
