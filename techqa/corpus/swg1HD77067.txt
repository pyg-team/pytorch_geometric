ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SMARTEAM switches configurations in SW2007
   without getting finished
   The customer has the problem that if he opens or
   saves a SW-Part with more than 1 configuration via
   SMARTEAM, SMARTEAM switches between the
   two configurations in a loop, that finishes with SW
   crash or the SW Task has to be killed manually.
   This problem I could reproduce with customers
   Database and the following scenario.
   - In the System Configuration Manager, set the
   following value
   "SolidWorks.MapEvaluatedValue" = TRUE
   - Launch SolidWorks 2007
   - Login to SmarTeam (user = joe / pwd =
   2smart4all)
   - Open "SmarTeam / Extras / Options" and select
   "Administrator Options"
   In the field of "Simplified configuration extension"
   enter (*)
   - Sel OK to close
   - Fk File / Open and
   select "Teil_mit_zwei_Konfigs.sldprt"
   (is attached to this request)
   -> In the configuration manager, there are two
   configurations available
   - Fk SmarTeam / Save
   - Save this part into SmarTeam
   - On the Profile Card select OK to confirm
   => SolidWorks loops
   You can see, that it activates one configuration and
   afterwards the other one.
   After some time, SolidWorks closes.
   If the "SolidWorks.MapEvaluatedValue" has been
   set to FALSE, this problem can not be reproduced.
   If the Option ""Simplified configuration extension"
   is not set, this problem does not happen.
   (This problem, I couldn't reproduce on a SmDemo.)
   Could you please analyse this problem and let me
   know, if you need additional information.
   As attachement you also get a video, showing the
   problem.
   As the database has about 34MB of size, I have it
   on a filetransfer with the import information.
