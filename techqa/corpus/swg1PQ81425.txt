APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Object Compare does not preserve COMMENT ON for COLUMNs or
   TABLEs With KEEPTGT specified as "Y" and an IGNORE file for
   SYSTABLES and SYSCOLUMNS REMARKS (where COMMENTs are stored in
   the catalog). COMMENTS may show up as "garbage" in CHANGES
   data set entries (i.e.):
   .
   COMMENT ON TABLE TB99999X IS 'TEST TABLE FOR PMR99999';
   .
   becomes
   .
   COMMENT ON TABLE TB99999X IS '_.y.>ï¾‹ ................';
   .
   Same sort of output with COLUMN COMMENTs
