APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After the V7.5.1.2, V8.0.1.2, or V8.5.0.1 fix pack is installed,
   the default exposed process value (EPV) overwrites the latest
   updated EPV during snapshot deployment or instance migration.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  How EPVs are migrated changed because the requirement to use the
    default EPV specified in the snapshot, if one is defined. The
   concern depends on the application development process. The
   application might require this new EPV defined in the snapshot,
   or the application might use only what is defined in the runtime
    environment instead of the values defined in the snapshot.
   Either scenario is valid, but IBM BPM can't accommodate both
   scenarios.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new configurable property (<epv-deploy-default>) is available
   for IBM BPM V7.5.1.2, V8.0.1.3, V8.5.0.1, V8.5.5.0, and V8.5.6.0
    and is included in the IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 cumulative fixes (CFs)
   and V8.5.7.0 CFs.
   
   The <epv-deploy-default> property toggles between the two
   behaviors. After the fix is applied, you notice the default
   behavior reverts to how it was in previous releases where the
   latest modified EPV is migrated. This means the property is, by
   default, set to false. When the property is enabled (set to
   true), the default EPV from the snapshot is used during
   deployment or instance migration.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Update the EPV variable after deployment or migration.
