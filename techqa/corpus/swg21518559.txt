QUESTION
 Are there any differences when running C:D Windows v4.4 on a Server2008 or Vista machine? 

ANSWER


Introduction This document identifies the requirements for the deployment of Connect:Direct for Windows 4.4.00 on Windows Server 2008 with a focus on high impact issues. In Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, the security model has been changed to minimize the need for administrative privileges. The following features have some impact to how Connect:Direct Windows is managed on these platforms.  * 
 * User Account Control (UAC) 
 * 
 * Run as Administrator (RAA) 
 * 
 * File system and registry virtualization 

User Account Control: When an administrator user logs on, two access tokens are created: a filtered standard user access token and a full administrator access token. The desktop is launched using the filtered standard user access token is used. By default, all users, including administrators, log on to Windows as standard users. The “Run as Administrator” (RAA) feature is used to launch application that require administrative privileges. This feature is available by right clicking a menu item from the start menu or an executable file in Windows Explorer or desktop. When an application modifies a system-global location in the file system or registry and that operation fails because access is denied, Windows redirects the operation to a per-user area. This feature is called file system and registry namespace virtualization and is a compatibility feature for legacy applications. 

Installation Installation must be performed by a user with local or domain administrative privileges. The run as administrator feature must be used to execute setup. Failure to do so results in an error message… If the Server is configured to logon under a user account, it is recommended to disable the UAC feature for the account. This setting is found in the control panel->user account dialog. The Log on locally group policy is no longer required. It has been replaced with Deny log on locally, which by default requires no change.  * 
 * Log on locally 
 * 
 * Log on as a service 
 * 
 * Replace a process level token 

Service Control In addition to the CD Admin Tool, the CD Server and MySQL services may be controlled using the Server Manager or Services snap-in available from administrative tools menu. The user is automatically elevated to administrator by these applications. Executing Applications The following Connect:Direct applications are required to use the “run as administrator” feature. WARNING: The Connect:Direct menu does not support the RAA feature, therefore, these application must be executed using the Windows Explorer or by creating custom shortcuts. Failure to execute these as an administrator may result in file system and or registry rights related errors. In the case of Secure+ Admin Tool, it results in per-user data configurations that are not recognized by Connect:Direct Server.  * 
 * CD Admin Tool 
 * 
 * CD Change Notification Utility 
 * 
 * CD Configuration Tool 
 * 
 * CD Database Wizard 
 * 
 * CD Message Import Utility 
 * 
 * CD Message Lookup Utility 
 * 
 * CD Secure+ Admin Tool 
 * 
 * CD Secure+ CLI 
 * 
 * CD System ID Utility 

The following Connect:Direct applications do not require the RAA feature.  * 
 * CD Client Connection Utility 
 * 
 * CD Requester 
 * 
 * CD Command Line Interface 
 * 
 * LCU 

Submitting RUN TASK/JOB The run task/job with DESKTOP(YES) feature is not supported on Windows Vista or Server 2008. The "Interactive Services Detection" service must be running in order for the user to see a dialog for a RUN TASK/JOB. If this service is stopped, then the user does not get any kind of notification at all and the submitted process hangs. Miscellaneous The Connect:Direct SNMP feature is not supported on 64 bit versions of Windows.
