QUESTION
Gatekeeper may not install or run on a 64-bit Linux Distribution without the correct libraries

CAUSE
If the correct 32-bit libraries are not installed on a 64-bit Linux distribution the Gatekeeper may fail to install or run afterward. 

ANSWER
The 32bit libraries (.i686) which we have found are required are: 

libstdc++ This is a pre-requisite for the java with GateKeeper to install
libXrender
libXft
libXmu
libXtst

Also insure that xinetd service is installed and enabled.

If the GateKeeper fails to launch, check in ~/.wgcfg for StdErr.txt which should show what compatibility libraries you still need to install.
