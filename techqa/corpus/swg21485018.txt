Title: IBM Receiving errors 2265 and 105 in output due to improper variable names being generated by SPSS/PASW Statistics Text Import Wizard. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to import a text-based data file. The file contains more than twenty-six identically-named variable. During the import process I receive the warning message 'Invalid variable names for this application have been found and changed' but I am able to continue the import without further warnings. The resulting dataset contains no data. In my output, there are multiple instances of 'Warning # 206' ('An invalid character has been found on a command'). The output also contains error messages for '2265' ('Unrecognized or invalid variable definition') and 105 ('This command is not valid before a working file has been defined.'). Why am I receiving these warnings and errors? How can I respond to this problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This collection of errors and warnings is caused by the following:

1) There are more than 26 identically-named variables in the original text-based data file.

2) The Text Import Wizard is erroneously assigning non-valid characters to variable names when more than 26 new variable names are required to be created from identically-named variables in the original data file.

The work-around for this problem is to correct original conditions desribed in (1) by editing the variable names in the original text-based data file so that no more than 26 variables have the same name.

A defect report has been filed for the behavior described in (2)
