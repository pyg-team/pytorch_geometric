 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 This document describes how to change the default font in the working area for Report Studio, Analysis Studio and Query Studio 

ANSWER
The default font for objects and classes in Report Studio is set in the file GlobalReportStyles.css under c8/webcontent/reportstyles 

For every object or class adjust the wanted font to change its default font value. 

In example to change the default font for the body cells in list columns adjust following changes: 

- open GlobalReportStyles.css under c10/webcontent/reportstyles 

- goto the section for lists called /*List Styles*/ 

- there you will find following section: 


.lc /* list column body cell */
{
vertical-align: top;
border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;
padding: 3px 5px;
} 

 

- edit and change the entry ".lc /* list column body cell */" as seen below to use the desired font, in this case here 'Comic Sans MS': 


.lc /* list column body cell */
{
font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
vertical-align: top;
border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;
padding: 3px 5px;
} 

 

After adjusted this setting the default font from system will be overwritten and the before defined font 'Comic Sans MS' will be used for list column body cells. 

All objects/classes having this entry/change will use the font defined in the GlobalReportStyles.css under c10/webcontent/reportstyles 

Again - please be advised that these changes will affect the style in the working area for Report Studio, Analysis Studio and Query Studio
