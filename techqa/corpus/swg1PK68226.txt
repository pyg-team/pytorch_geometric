APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Specifying a KEYSTRNG with embedded blanks and no quote to
   enclose the string leads to HALDB partition high key value
   invalid when registered in the RECON by the INIT.PART.
   i:e :
    KEYSTRNG(DUPONT ALAIN) is registered in DBRC as 'DUPON'.
    KEYSTRNG(021287 A) is registered as '0'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Specify enclosing quotes when embedded blanks
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IMS V10 DBRC users of the INIT.PART      *
   *                 or CHANGE.PART command with the KEYSTRNG     *
   *                 parameter may be affected.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The KEYSTRNG parameter for the          *
   *                      INIT.PART or CHANGE.PART command        *
   *                      is not validated correctly.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: INSTALL CORRECTIVE SERVICE FOR APAR/PTF      *
   ****************************************************************
     In the IMS Command Reference, Volume 3 manual Version 10 under
   the INIT.PART (and CHANGE.PART) command the description for the
   KEYSTRNG parameter states in part:
   "Character values must be alphanumeric (with no embedded blanks
   or commas unless the string is enclosed by single quotation
   marks)."
   This restriction was not being enforced.  A KEYSTRNG value that
   was not enclosed in quotes and had embedded blanks was processed
   without errors and created an invalid partition high key value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  AIDS: RIDS/DBRC RIDS/CMD DBRC CMD
    GEN:
   KEYWORDS:
   
   *** END IMS KEYWORDS ***
   DSPURX00 has been changed to enforce this restriction.  The
   DSPARSE Parsing service, after parsing a KEYSTRNG parameter
   that contains embedded blanks or commas and not enclosed in
   quotes, will return an indication that the keyword has multiple
   values.  The KEYSTRNG parameter can never have multiple values
   so this indicates an invalid value.  MSGDSP0204I INVALID VALUE
   FOR PARAMETER KEYSTRNG will report the error and the command
   will terminate.
