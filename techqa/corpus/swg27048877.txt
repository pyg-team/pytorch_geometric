ABSTRACT
 The IBM Security Guardium Support team hosted an Open Mic webcast on October 27th 2016 to discuss configuration of your policy to prevent appliance problems. 

CONTENT
This Open Mic is an overview of the Guardium policy from a problem prevention viewpoint. Many appliance problems are linked to the policy definition, and often simple changes in the policy are enough to prevent them. We will look at using the right ignore, log and alerting actions to prevent sniffer performance and database full problems.
