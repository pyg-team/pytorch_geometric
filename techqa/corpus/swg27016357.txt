DSRdoc PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document lists the hardware and software requirements for WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.0 on the Linux operating system on x86-64 platforms. 

CONTENT
This page describes the minimum product levels that must be installed before opening a problem report with the WebSphere ILOG JRules support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with minor updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible. 

Supporting software (for example Databases) can run, but does not need to run, on the same computer or operating system where the product runs. For additional information: 

 * Check supporting software requirements to determine whether the supporting software runs locally or is connected remotely to the product. 
 * Refer to the document corresponding to the operating system on which you want to run the supporting software, see List of supported operating systems for WebSphere ILOG JRules Version 7.0. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=4043&uid=swg27015807]
