QUESTION
 How do I check the Service permissions using the "sc" command? 

ANSWER

At times it may be necessary to check your Service permissions. This may be necessary when you've installed ITCAM as a certain user and need to run as a different user. To see the Service permissions you can use the "sc" command from a Windows command-line prompt. 

To compare permissions for a particular Service, run it on two systems. See the outputs and compare each line in a notepad/wordpad session.

Here's an example of using the Windows command "sc" and a Service called TCsiteStandard216.

(Note: The "sc" command is in the C:\Windows\System32 dir. So if this directory is not in your direct path, you'll have to run it from the C:\Windows\System32 directory.)
