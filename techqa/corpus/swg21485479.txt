 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After implementation of SSL, BIRT reports are failing with errors. Cacerts have been updated in the birtdesigner/jre/lib directories on server and pc.

As a stand alone report job, the report will run and output a file, but if the birt step is edited in job editor an error occurs - error retrieving datasets.

From the spssemgr.log:

Dec 01 2009 10:04:24 [main] ERROR com.spss.mgmt.content.ui.dynamicdata.dialog.DynamicDataFocusListener - Remote Exception Occured while calling Reporting Web Service Exception:

From the pes35.log:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue is resolved in Collaboration and Deployment Services 4.0.

Workaround:
Specify port 443 (if this is the one you use for SSL) in Deployment Administrator (web), configuration, setup, URL Prefix and then restart server. This should resolve the issue.
