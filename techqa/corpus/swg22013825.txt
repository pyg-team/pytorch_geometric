Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The Optim documentation notes that InfoSphere® Optim™ web applications can be configured on IBM® WebSphere® Application Server V8 with no mention of subsequent releases of WAS. 

ANSWER
Note that even though the documentation denotes WAS V8, the Optim web applications have been successfully installed in the field on WAS 8.5 and above. 

Also note the following: 

For Optim 11.3.0.6 and above, the minimum version of WAS required is 8.0.0.3 and the WebSphere SSL settings need to be updated to use TLS V1.2. Here are the steps that need to be performed to accomplish this: 

 

 1. Make changes in WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solutions Console.  1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server Integrated Solutions Console. 
     2. Click Security > SSL certificate and key management, and under Related Items, click SSL configurations (such as CellDefaultSSLsetting, NodedefaultSSLsetting). 
     3. Select each SSL Configuration described above, then click Quality of protection (QoP) settings under Additional Properties. 
     4. On the Quality of protection (QoP) settings panel, select TLSv1.2 from the pull-down list in the box named Protocol. Change the protocol to TLS V1.2 
     5. Click Apply and Save.
    
    
 2. Update the file ssl.client.props.  1. The SSL protocol is set with the property com.ibm.ssl.protocol in this file. Edit the file ssl.client.props and set the value com.ibm.ssl.protocol to TLS.
        For example, under WAS_install\profiles\AppSrv01\properties, in the file ssl.client.props modify this line:
        com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2
    
    
 3. Restart the WebSphere server.
