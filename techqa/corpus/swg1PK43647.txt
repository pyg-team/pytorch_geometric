ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for V5R4 i5/OS, OS/400 Version 6, and
   WebSphere Application Server for i5/OS V6.1 do not document the
   national language version CCSID support limitations. Although
   the Japanes information is available in the Information Center
   for V5R4 i5/OS, the information is not available in the other
   information centers. In addition, the information centers do
   not document the national language version CCSID limitations
   for Arabic. The following information needs to exist in the
   information centers:
   
   NOTE:
   -Japanese CCSID 5026 is not supported by WebSphere
   Application Server. 5035 is the recommended CCSID for this
   environment. The QEJB and QEJBSVR user profiles default to the
   system CCSID setting. If the QCCSID system value is set to 5026,
   the CCSID attribute of the QEJB user profile must be changed to
   prevent the WebSphere Application Server Monitor and
   Administration server jobs from trying to start with a CCSID of
   5026. The QEJBSVR user profile, and any other user profiles used
   to run WebSphere Application Server instances, must also be
   changed.
   QLOCALE set to  /QSYS.LIB/JA_JP_5026.LOCALE is not supported.
   QLOCALE=/QSYS.LIB/JA_5035.LOCALE or QLOCALE=*NONE would be the
   recommended choices for a Japanese system
   
   Arabic CCSID 420 is not supported by WebSphere
   Application Server. 425 is the recommended CCSID for this
   environment. The QEJB and QEJBSVR user profiles default to the
   system CCSID setting. If the QCCSID system value is set to 420,
   the CCSID attribute of the QEJB user profile must be changed to
   prevent the WebSphere Application Server Monitor and
   Administration server jobs from trying to start with a CCSID of
   420. The QEJBSVR user profile, and any other user profiles used
   to run WebSphere Application Server instances, must also be
   changed.

   ****************************************************************
   The documentation for the affected products does not indicate
   that the Japanese 5026 and the Arabic 420 CCSIDs are not
   supported by WebSphere Application Server. The documentation
   needs to state that you can use the Japanese 5035 CCSID and
   the Arabic 425 CCSID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The documentation for each version of the affected products
   has been updated with the following information:
   
   -The Japanese CCSID 5026 is not supported by WebSphere
   Application Server. 5035 is the recommended CCSID for this
   environment. The QEJB and QEJBSVR user profiles default to
   the system CCSID setting. If the QCCSID system value is set
   to 5026, the CCSID attribute of the QEJB user profile must
   be changed. The QEJBSVR user profile, and any other user
   profiles used to run WebSphere Application Server instances,
   must also be changed. A QLOCALE value that is set to
   /QSYS.LIB/JA_JP_5026.LOCALE is not supported. However, a
   QLOCALE=/QSYS.LIB/JA_5035.LOCALE value or QLOCALE=*NONE
   value are the recommended choices for a Japanese system.
   -An Arabic locale that is based on CCSID 420 is not
   supported by WebSphere Application Server. The QEJB and
   QEJBSVR user profiles default to the system CCSID setting.
   If the QCCSID system value is set to 420, you must change
   the CCSID attribute of the QEJB user profile. Also, you
   must change the QEJBSVR user profile and any other user
   profiles used to run WebSphere Application Server instances.
   A QLOCALE value that that is set to  /QSYS.LIB/AR_AA.LOCALE
   is not supported because it is based on CCSID 420. However,
   either a QLOCALE value that is set to an Arabic CCSID
   425-based locale or a QLOCALE=*NONE value are recommended
   for an Arabic system. You can create the locale by using
   the create locale command. You must have option 21
   installed so that WebSphere Application Server can locate
   the locale source. The following command shows how to
   create the Arabic locale:
   CRTLOCALE LOCALE('qsys.lib/AR_AA_425.locale')
   SRCFILE('qsys.lib/qsyslocale.lib/qlocalesrc.file/ar_aa.mbr')
   CCSID(425)  TEXT('my AR_AA locale in CCSID 425')
   
   
   Date that information will be available externally to
   customers: The modified documentation will be available in
   the next update to the Information Centers, which is
   scheduled to occur on or before June 30, 2007.
