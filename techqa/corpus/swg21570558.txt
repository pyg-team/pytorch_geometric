QUESTION
 How to correctly interpret the values visible in the CSV version of PVU reports generated by LMT tool ? 

CAUSE
The PVU repots in CSV format can be misinterpreted by some customers.

ANSWER
Please review the data in the attached document. 

Please note the values in column N (Server PVU Subcapacity) - they do not refer to the specific network addresses/nodes displayed in column O (Network Address), but to the servers defined in column H (Server ID). 

If it was otherwise the sum of PVU values for the specific product would be exactly 10000 (sum of all the values in the N column), while it is 1400 (column G - Product PVU Subcapacity). 

The same applies to columns K, L and M. 

ILMT/TAD4D tool does not provide the functionality to generate a report for a given period of time which would allows users to drill down to see PVU values for each individual node/agent. 

The goal is to calculate values for physical machines (servers), not virtual machines/LPARs/zones/etc.
