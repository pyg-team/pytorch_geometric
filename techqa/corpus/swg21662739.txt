QUESTION
 How do you ensure TIMESTAMP values in IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) test artifacts using custom attributes hold the same value as exported from excel? 

CAUSE
You want to export data from excel into RQM

ANSWER
The [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime]dateTime (Date/time) value in RQM artifacts are represented as XML dateTime values and a valid dateTime string is as given below: 

For example, 2014-06-29T12:00:00+05:30 represents noon on 29th of June 2014, India Standard Time.

Any other formats of dateTime string eg : 2014-12-10T12:00:00Z, 2014-12-10T12:00:00 will convert to a different time string based on the timezone of the client machine (Microsoft office package which contains RQMExcelExport addin) or that of the RQM server.
