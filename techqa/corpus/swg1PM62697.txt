ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HP Image Copy terminates with ABEND U4000 with TOSI message
   FOI571W when TOIAUTO_Q=Y is requested.
   Because HP Image Copy request TOSI TYPE-2 disconnect command
   without obtaining request buffer of TOSI.

   ****************************************************************
   This APAR fixes following 2 problems of HP Image Copy when using
   IMS Tools Online System Interface of Tools Base:
   
   1. When IMS UPDATE DB STOP(QUIESCE) command is used by
      TOIAUTO_Q=Y, HP Image Copy terminates
      with ABEND U4000 ( ABENDU4000 ) RC=08 ( RC08 ) by following
      symptom:
       - Issue FABJ4608E ( MSGFABJ4608E ) with RC=00000004,
         RSN=00000701 ( RC00000004 RSN00000701 ).
   
      HP Image Copy tries to issue UPDATE DB STOP(QUIESCE) command
      in the termination process in case UPDATE DB STOP(QUIESCE)
      command has not been processed. But if all DB has been
      already released DB QUIESCE status, unnecessary IMS Tools
      Online System Interface call is done in HP Image Copy and
      IMS Tools Online System Interface returns error.
   
      HP Image Copy should not issue unnecessary IMS Tools Online
      System Interface call in the termination process, when IMS
      command has been done successfully.
   
   2. When TOIAUTO=Y is requested in HP Image Copy Advanced Image
      Copy function and IMS online region program is terminated
      before /STA  command is issued from HP Image Copy, HP Image
      Copy terminates with ABEND U4000 ( ABENDU4000 ) RC=08
      ( RC08 ) by following symptom:
       - Issue FABJ4603E ( MSGFABJ4603E ) with RC=00000012,
         RSN=00000201 ( RC00000012 RSN00000201 ).
   
      If IMS Online region is terminated during HP Image Copy
      process, IMS command can not be processed, so HP Image Copy
      should bypass IMS command process through the IMS Tools
      Online System Interface. When the IMS Online region is not
      active, IMS Tools Online System Interface checks it in the
      initialization process and returns error reason to HP Image
      Copy. Then HP Image Copy does not issue the termination
      request call of IMS Tools Online System Interface and tries
      to continue IMS command request for next Database.
   
      HP Image Copy should issue the termination request of IMS
      Tools Online System Interface if its error reason at the
      initialization process is that IMS Online region is not
      active.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  FABJTOI2 has been modified not to issue unnecessary IMS Tools
   Online System Interface call in the termination process.
   
   FABJSTA has been modified to issue the termination call of
   IMS Tools Online System Interface if the IMS Online region is
   not available.
