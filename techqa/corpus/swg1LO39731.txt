ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Added by Greg Klouda - 10/10/07
   
   Original design was to reposition the side calendar to the
   current time only
   when the user closed and then reopened the side calendar.  As a
   result of this
   the side calendar doesn't update to the current day (when would
   we do this,
   would it be confusing to users working at midnight to see the
   side calendar
   suddenly switch days, etc).
   
   John suggests we get more feedback before deciding to change
   this behavior.
   
   Hi Greg,
   I've heard this request a few more times. I think it is
   deferrable out of 8.01.
   I think its worth keeping on the books for 8.5 as we may hear
   similar input
   once more people start using it.
   Thanks,
   JL

   Day-At-A-Glance Java Plug-in does not automatically refresh when
   client is left
   running over night:
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Open Day-At-A-Glance plug-in and leave it running overnight.
   The next day, the calendar view is not refreshed and will still
   display the
   previous day.  However, the second half of the plug-in will
   refresh.
   
   In the example below, the client was left running on Tuesday,
   October 2nd.  The
   screen shot is from today.  Notice that the first date displayed
   still reflects
   the previous day while the second date displayed (with the
   "Today" button) did
   refresh for the next day.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Click on the "Today" button and it will refresh the plug-in's
   view.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A programming error was found and will be corrected in a future
    release.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A programming error was found and will be corrected in a future
    release.
