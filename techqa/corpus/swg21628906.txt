Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Running the createGCD script fails with an exception message stating that the GCD has already been created.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the createGCD script is run correctly the output will resemble the following:

If the script fails at the point of "Creating Domain and GCD ...", you may rerun the createGCD.bat script after fixing the error as stated in the message. 

However, if the failure of the createGCD script is after the point of "Setting Server Cache ...", you cannot rerun createGCD.bat directly but must instead drop and recreate the Connections Content Manager databases using the DB Wizard.
