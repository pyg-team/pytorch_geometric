APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using a mediation flow component in conjunction with
   asynchronous callback request-response message flows, it is
   possible to stop the server before outstanding responses have
   been processed.
   
   If the mediation flow component is configured such that the
   message is saved to the context correlation store where the
   message body definition resides in a WSDL file, after the
   server restart when the outstanding reponse messsage is
   received you may observer an exception message of the following
   form:
   
   CNTR0020E: EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception
   during invocation of method
   "transactionNotSupportedActivitySessionSupports" on
   bean "BeanId(Async_ServiceApp#Async_ServiceEJB.jar#Module,
   null)".

   Upon receiving this exception, the response flow processing will
   fail for that message.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server who are         *
   *                 making use of applications which contain     *
   *                 mediation flow components which contain      *
   *                 primitives which store WSDL defined          *
   *                 DataObjects on the context store.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a DataObject is saved to the       *
   *                      mediation flow component's context      *
   *                      store, as happens when an asynchronous  *
   *                      with callback message flow is being     *
   *                      used, the corresponding response flow   *
   *                      will fail if the server has been        *
   *                      restarted since the request message     *
   *                      was processed, and the DataObject is    *
   *                      defined within a WSDL file within       *
   *                      the application.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you encounter this problem then you       *
   *                 should install the code fix associated       *
   *                 with this APAR.                              *

   *                 Alternatively if you are using v6.1 or       *
   *                 later, in conjunction with a Project         *
   *                 Interchange file which was originally        *
   *                 created on v6.0.2 or earlier, you can        *
   *                 delete and recreate any custom primitives    *
   *                 which are copying the DataObject to the      *
   *                 correlation context part of the Service      *
   *                 Message Object (SMO).                        *
   ****************************************************************
   This problem was caused by the loading process of the WSDL
   files which the product makes use of to serialise DataObjects.
   
   In order to save away a DataObject on the context store, it is
   being serialised from a Java object to its XML representated
   form. In order to do this, the serialiser requires access to the
   appropriate WSDL file which defines the DataObject.
   
   For the request flow, the serialiser is aware of the WSDL file
   and serialisation occurs without issue.  However, if the server
   is subsequently restarted and then the corresponding response
   message is returned to the server for response processing, the
   WSDL file was not loaded into memory and the deserialisation
   process fails.
   
   This issue only occurs where the original application was
   created using WebSphere Integration Developer v6.0.1 or v6.0.2
   of the product.  V6.1 and beyond make use of an updated
   serialisation process which allows the deserialiser to locate
   the WSDL file when necessary, so this particular problem is
   not seen.
   
   However, if your application originally developed on v6.0.2
   (or before), then even when deployed to v6.1 it will make use
   of the older process and this APAR would then be applicable.
   In this case, on v6.1 and beyond, a workaround is to open the
   project for the application in WebSphere Integration Developer
   (v6.1 and beyond), delete the Custom Primitive within the
   mediation flow component which copies the DataObject to the
   correlation context, and recreate the Custom Primitive.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product code was changed such that the failure to
   deserialise the DataObject off the context store forces the
   appropriate WSDL file to be loaded, and the deserialisation
   step is repeated.
   
   There are no known side effects associated with this code
   change.  It was targeted to be included in the following
   fix packs:
   
       v6.0.2 Fix Pack 6 (v6.0.2.6)
       v6.1.0 Fix Pack 4 (v6.1.0.4)
       v6.1.2 Fix Pack 3 (v6.1.2.3)
       v6.2.0 Fix Pack 1 (v6.2.0.1)
