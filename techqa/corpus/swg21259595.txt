PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are starting a CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 region, and receive message DFHPC0401 reporting an abend ACN2 in the III task. This brings the region down. Prior to the abend, you also receive DFHDH0002 messages reporting a severe error code X'0406' in DFHDHTM and X'0C08' in DFHDHRP. CICS creates a dump for each DFHDH0002 message. 

CAUSE
The global (DFHGCD) and local (DFHLCD) catalogs are from a CICS TS V3.1 region.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Prior to the DFHPC0401, the following messages were seen in the joblog:


DFHRM0141 Recovery manager autostart override record is not present. Normal processing continues.
DFHDH0002 A severe error (code X'0406') has occurred in module DFHDHTM. DFHME0116 682
(Module:DFHMEME) CICS symptom string for message DFHDH0002 is

Note: The messages for the dumps that were taken after each DFHDH0002 have been removed for all but the first DFHDH0002 message.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete and redefine the local and global catalogs using the CICS TS V3.2 DFHCCUTL [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha2/topics/dfha2_def_local_catalog.html] utility for the DFHLCD and DFHRMUTL [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha2/topics/dfha2_def_global_catalog.html] for the DFHGCD.
