Title: IBM List of XU log message codes - United States

Text:
BRES; RES; XU; code; error; execution unit TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Where can I find the list of possible error and warning message codes (XU.ERROR.XXXXX and XU.WARNING.XXXXX) that are used by the Rule Execution Server Execution Unit (XU) when logging? 

ANSWER
XU error or warning codes are not listed in the documentation as they are used internally while the corresponding messages are printed in the log file along with the error code:
for example XU.ERROR.10009 corresponds to "Cannot create ruleset" as in 


 * Cannot create ruleset: /MyRuleApp/1.0/MyRuleset/1.0, error code: XU.ERROR.10009


and XU.ERROR.10014 corresponds to " Cannot parse ruleset" as in 
 * Cannot parse ruleset: "IRL/Pricing/Collision-dt.irl", line 10: error (40 times): undefined identifier myQuoteResp, error code: XU.ERROR.10014


In order to understand the origin of such an error, one should look at the last portion of the stack trace (last "Caused by:") which indicates what the root cause of the issue is. 


Starting in V8.0, the error codes are changed to consists of 10 alphanumeric characters all starting with GB. They are also now listed in the documentation at Decision Server V8.0.1 > Decision Server Rules > Reference > Rule Execution Server reference > Rule Execution Server Messages [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.ref.res/html/extensions/html/extensions.html]. 


Note: Prior to V8.0, the list of error codes can be found in a messages.properties file packaged inside the XU RAR archive ( jrules-bres-xu-<AppServer>.rar/jrules-res-xu-<AppServer>.rar) under ilog/rules/bres/xu or ilog/rules/res/xu in a ra.jar (directly in the RAR for WebLogic). As the file is internal, this is subject to changes in coming versions. Starting in V8.0, that file is found under com/ibm/rules/res/xu.
