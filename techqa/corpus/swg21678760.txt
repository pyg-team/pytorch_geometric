Title: IBM Editable fields in other widgets lose focus when Daeja Viewer loads from IBM Content Navigator in the Viewer widget - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users entering character input in editable fields on other widgets are prevented from entering more data when the Daeja Viewer applet being loaded from the associated instance of IBM Content Navigator acquires focus and consumes all keyboard input instead. 

SYMPTOM
(The same issue occurs for earlier releases of Case Manager which load the Daeja viewer from Workplace XT: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634938]) 

On both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer, a user updating an editable field in the Case (Work Item) Data widget on the Work Details page while a document is loading in the Daeja Viewer in the Viewer widget will find, at a certain point, that they are unable to enter more characters in the field they were editing. The keyboard input is consumed by the Daeja Viewer applet instead. The page and widget where the editable fields exist may vary, but all will suffer from the problem of losing focus to the Daeja Viewer when a document is being loaded.

This can occur when the Attachments widget is configured to automatically load an attachment as soon as the page loads, when the "Open a document when the Work Details page is opened" setting is configured. At the same time, the user starts editing a field while loading is still in progress.

For example, if a user is entering the character 'z' repeatedly in an editable field while a document is loading in the Daeja Viewer, they will find, at a certain point in the loading process, that they are unable to add more character input and that the 'z' is instead consumed by Daeja, causing the document there to Zoom.

To continue typing in the editable field, try one of the following steps: 


- For Microsoft Internet Explorer, the user can click back into the editable field, and it will immediately allow the user to continue editing.


- For Mozilla Firefox, click anywhere else on the page, then click back into the editable field, before you continue editing. This is true regardless of whether the document is displayed in the viewer widget or in a separate window. This is an issue with Firefox and Java applets generally and not the result of Daeja or IBM software.

The primary issue here is not specific to Daeja but is rather the result of default Java applet loading behavior.


CAUSE
The problem is a result of default Java applet loading behavior as handled by supported browsers.



ENVIRONMENT
The problem can occur on Case Client workstations (Windows), on both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you see the issues described in the Symptom section, Java applet loading behavior is the likely cause.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The issue can be resolved by editing the IBM Content Navigator file that is used to load the Daeja Viewer applet by both IBM Content Navigator and IBM Case Manager.

It is this file that passes in the startup parameters used/consumed by the Daeja Viewer applet when it loads from IBM Content Navigator.

NOTE: Make sure to make a backup copy of the file you will be editing in the instructions below.

This file, named filenetViewer_properties.jsp, is typically deployed in the following location:

\navigator.ear\navigator.war\applets

To resolve the issue, use the text editor of your choice to add the following two (2) parameters to the file:

<===
...
var filenetViewerParameters = { 
// annotateEdit: "true",
... 
initial_focus: "false",
initialFocus: "false", 
trace: "false",
traceNet: "false"
};
===>

NOTE: After modifying the filenetViewer_properties.jsp, make sure it has a current timestamp (newer than any cached copies so the JSP compiler will pick it up), shut down WebSphere Application Server, clear the \logs, \temp, and \wstemp folders under the WebSphere Application Server profile, restart WebSphere Application Server, and then clear your browser cache as well before testing.

NOTE: After testing the above and verifying that the changes work to resolve the issue, make sure to apply the same changes to the installed copy of the filenetViewer_properties.jsp, file under your local equivalent of the following two directories:

\<ECMClient_INSTALL_HOME>\configure\explodedformat\navigator\applets

\<ECMClient_INSTALL_HOME>\tmp

Editing these copies of this files makes the change permanent so that you do not lose your changes the next time IBM Content Navigator is redeployed,

NOTE: You will still need to reapply these changes each time you apply a new IBM Content Navigator fixpack since this file may be overwritten if the fixpack contains its own copy of this file.

NOTE: The same issue occurs on earlier releases of IBM Case Manager where the Daeja Viewer applet loads from IBM Content Navigator instead of Workplace XT.
