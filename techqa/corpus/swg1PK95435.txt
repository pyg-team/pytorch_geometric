ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  226123
   A client is wondering if there is a way to find unresolved
   elements when they were the  main diagram of an element.  The
   Advanced Search and Replace does not find them.
   
   I see that the silentMode.log has reference to the UR that it is
   trying to load, but I can't figure out any way to find which
   elements refer to them.
   
   If the Main Diagram has been removed from a project, it just
   appears that there was never one set.  Although, Rhapsody must
   be trying to load it.  I checked in the API, but I see no
   difference between an element with an unresolved Main Diagram
   and an element that never had one.
   
   There is no indication in the UI (Features Dialog) that the Main
   Diagram is unresolved.  The field is blank.
