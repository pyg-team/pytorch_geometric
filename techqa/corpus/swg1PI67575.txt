ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When performing an Advanced search on a component or baseline
   with a Japanese name in IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC), there
   are no search results when using Microsoft Internet Explorer 10
   or 11.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Open JKE Banking sample in Eclipse client
   2. Open e.g the BRM stream and add a component which has a
   Japanese name (e.g. "NihongoKonpounentoÂˆ" in Japanese)
   3. Open Firefox browser to project dashboard (e.g. JKE Banking)
   4. Select [Source Control] > [Advanced Search] > select the
   Components radio button > enter e.g. "Nihongo"Âž in Japanese as
   the "Name
   begins with" search string
   5. Notice that the component with Japanese name is found.
   6. Copy the same URL to the dashboard and open it in IE 10 or
   11.
   7. Notice that the same component is not found in IE.
   8. Try entering "a" in the "Name begins with" search string
   instead (English ASCII)
   9. Notice that "Account Mgmt" component is found in IE.
   
   Expected behavior:
   Advanced search would get search result for Japanese component
   or baseline name regardless of browser used.
   
   Actual behavior:
   Japanese component or baseline names do not appear in Advanced
   search results when using IE 10 or 11.
