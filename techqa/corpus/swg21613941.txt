Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2INST; Tivoli Integrated Portal; 2.2.0.1; CTGWA0069E; Not a valid TIP 2.1 Install Location TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.1 feature pack installation failed with the error:

"...00001_TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1/TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1.xml:614: CTGWA0069E Not a valid TIP 2.1 Install Location. " 

CAUSE
The path specified in the response file for the existing TIP install did not match the path recorded in the Deployment Engine database. The customer specified a soft link in the response file, but the DE registry had the literal path.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the installation log located in the install user's home directory ("TIPFeaturePackInstaller-00.log") for the following error:

while executing this line:
<TIP HOME>/_uninst/TIPInstall2201/plan/cheks/MachinePlan_localhost/00001_TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1/TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1.xml:614: CTGWA0069E Not a valid TIP 2.1
Install Location.
###

Navigate to <DE HOME>/bin directory and execute the de_lsrootiu command (de_lsrootiu.bat or de_lsrootiu.sh)

Check the "discriminant" value which is the path that the DE has recorded for the TIP install. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the TIP 2.2.0.1 response file to reflect the path specified in the "discriminant" attribute in the de_lsrootiu output, and then retry the install
