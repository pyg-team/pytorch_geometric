LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The agent terminated because it had received a recovery message
   from the destination agent before it had received the response
   to the initial transfer negotiation message.  This can occur
   when messages are received from IBM WebSphere MQ out of order.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   All
   
   PLATFORMS AFFECTED:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been altered so that it handles out of order
   messages from IBM WebSphere MQ.  The agent ignores the recovery
   message continues to wait for the initial transfer negotiation
   response message.
