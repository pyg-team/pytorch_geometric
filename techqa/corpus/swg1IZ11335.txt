   .
   The Server is on ORB 50 and client is on ORB142. The Remote
   Method called involves sending a serializable object which has
   evolved on the Server side. Consequently, the Client makes a
   meta call to resolve the differences for that class and it fails
   to interpret the received reply and throws a CORBA.MARSHAL
   Exception.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The Client side can maintain the same version of the class as
   the Server. This will avoid the meta call and hence the
   exception from being thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is results from orb50's new way for determining
   whether an interface is abstract or not. This was resulting in
   the a change in the way the meta description is written out to
   the OutputStream.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR7
   .
   The problem is solved by making the calculation of the
   Description Object for a particular class sensitive to the
   peer's Partner Version and also storing the Description Object
   depending on the Partner Version.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20080111 or later
