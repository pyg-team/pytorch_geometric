QUESTION
 How to configure the IBM i Access Host Servers for SSL communications only? 

CAUSE
Each IBM i Access client can be configured as to whether is connects over a non-secure or secure SSL/TLS communication link. In some environments, It may be desirable to limit IBM i Access Family connections to secure SSL/TLS communications only from the IBM i OS so that clients not configured for secure connections will not be able to connect.

ANSWER
IBM i Access Family clients (IBM i Access for Windows and IBM i Access Client Solution) connect using the following ports: 

PC function Server Name Non-Secure TCP port Secure SSL/TLS TCP port [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021130&amp;aid=1] as-svrmap 449 - License Management as-central 8470 9470 Database Access as-database 8471 9471 Data Queue as-dtaq 8472 9472 Network Drive as-netdrive 8473 9473 Network Print as-netprt 8474 9474 Remote Command as-rmtcmd 8475 9475 Security as-rmtcmd 8476 9476 5250 Emulation telnet 23 992 
The Telnet Server can be limited to only using the Secure 992 port using command CHGTELNA and changing the option Allow Secure Sockets Layer to *ONLY: 

After change is done, the Telnet server starts only port 992.

Server port mapper (port 449) is used by both, secure and non-secure communications. The data transferred by this port is software related and does not contain any customer information. 

The other IBM i Access Host Servers do not have an attribute or parameter that can be set to only start the secure ports for communications, but there is a way this can be accomplished. You can shut down the IBM i Access Host Server non-secure ports using i/OS Work with Port Restriction command : 
(CFGTCP opt.4): 

The following shows how to configure a TCP/IP Port Restriction for the IBM i Access Host Server non-secure ports of 8470-8746 so that the user profile of QSECOFR is the only profile that can start up a TCP/IP Service on those ports. Since the IBM i Access Host Servers start under the QUSER user profile they won't be allowed to start on these non-secure ports. The next time that TCP/IP Servers are started the IBM i Access Host Servers will only start on the secure 9470-9476 ports.
