Title: IBM Workplace XT logout from SSO Webseal Junction issue on WebSphere - United States

Text:
Webseal ibm_security_logout ContainerSignout.jsp com.ibm.websphere.security.allowAnyLogoutExitPageHost com.ibm.websphere.security.logoutExitPageDomainList TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to configure FileNet WorkplaceXT on WebSphere to redirect to a custom logout page when using in an SSO WebSeal/Tivoli Access Manager environment? 

SYMPTOM
Upon clicking on the "Logout" link on the main WorkplaceXT page, the user is not logged out. and instead sees the default logout page which shows: 

"Successful Logout"


CAUSE
Workplace XT is always a container-managed application, the expected behavior is to invalidate the session and go back to the context root specified by the app server and let the app server handle the re-authentication automatically. Destroying the session does not invalidate the user credentials. Therefore, any subsequent navigation in the browser creates a new session re-using the existing credentials and the end-user does not see an "effective" logout.


ENVIRONMENT
Workplace XT with WebSeal



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Collect an HTTP trace which shows the following: 

ContainerSignout.jsp is called 

ibm_security_logout servlet is invoked (through ContainerSignout.jsp) 

ContainerSignin.jsp is called


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In ContainerSignout.jsp configure the value of the "logoutExitPage" for the "ibm_security_logout" action to redirect to the desired URI. 

Note that with WebSphere V6.0.2.33 or later, V6.1.0.23 or later, or V7 the URI supported must point to a local page. 

It is possible to define one of the following security custom properties to allow for remote pages to be used for redirection: 

com.ibm.websphere.security.allowAnyLogoutExitPageHost=true/false 

When true, the redirection is unrestricted, and the following property is ignored. The default is false. 

com.ibm.websphere.security.logoutExitPageDomainList=<host1|host2|host3> 

This is a list of hosts that are valid targets for the redirection specified by logoutExitPage. The separator is the vertical bar. There is no default.
