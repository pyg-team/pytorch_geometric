 * WebSphere MQ File Transfer Agent Hangs
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  The required items under the WebSphere MQ File Transfer Agents section above. Two javacores of the hung agent process, with approximately 2 minutes between them. 
   
   Collect a javadump by setting the following property in the agent.properties file:
   
   javaCoreTriggerFile=c:\\temp\\jdump.txt
   
   The path used in the property value above needs to be escaped with '\' characters. For example c:\temp\jdump.txt needs to be c:\\temp\\jdump.txt.
   
   When a javadump is needed, simply create or modify the file named c:\temp\jdump.txt.

 * 
 *  Start the agent in the foreground using the -F flag on the fteStartAgent.cmd and use Ctrl+Break.
   
   Details of the javadump file location will be printed on the screen. The location is usually in the working directory where the fteStartAgent.cmd was issued. To collect an automatic heap and javadump use the following environment variable. Note that the agent must be started in the same command session where the environment variable is set. 
   
   set FTE_JVM_PROPERTIES="-Xdump:none -Xdump:heap+java:events=vmstop,opts=PHD+CLASSIC"

 * Uninstalling Early Access Program drivers
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Carry out the following steps before uninstalling the driver:
 *  Stop all agents using the fteStopAgent command. Remove the SYSTEM.FTE name from the SYSTEM.QPUBSUB.QUEUE.NAMELIST namelist on the coordination queue manager. Delete the SYSTEM.FTE queue on the coordination queue manager. Delete the SYSTEM.FTE topic on the coordination queue manager. Delete all agent queues on the agent queue managers. Each agent has the following queues:  * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * 
 * Uninstall the Early Access Program driver
 * 
 * 
 *  Uninstall WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition from your system. Restart your machine. If you do not restart your machine after uninstalling an Early Access Program driver and before installing the GA version, there might still be files marked for deletion. This file deletion still occurs, even if you have installed a new version. This might cause your new install to stop working after a future restart. Delete the WMQFTE directory if the directory still exists. Install the general availability (GA) version of WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition
