ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Approver: gdc
   
   Environment:
   The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS 6.2.2 on AIX
   
   Problem Description:
   On AIX the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS
   stat_daemon process can hang after adding CPUs dynamically,
   or it can report wrong metrics for all the CPUs
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The stat_daemon process hangs after adding CPUs dynamically.
   
   On AIX, the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS stat_daemon process can
   hang after adding CPUs dynamically, or it can report incorrect
   metrics for all the CPUs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem was due to a memory corruption that occurred when
   buffer used to manage CPUs information is reallocated because
   number of CPUs increases.  Memory management has been improved.
   
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is going to be included in the following
   maintenance vehicle:
