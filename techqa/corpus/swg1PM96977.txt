APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running a map using the ODBC Adapter to CALL a Stored Procedure
   causes a crash to occur and the Stored Procedure call does not
   get processed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00043544
   GK / GK
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender users of the ODBC adapter,
   particularly when invoking stored procedures with the "CALL"
   command.
   
   Problem Description:
   
   The ODBC adapter is failing whenever executing a call to a
   stored procedure.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Unix
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Conclusion:
   The ODBC adapter properly processes stored procedure calls that
   are made in a DBLookup, Get or input card call.  Before this
   fix, processing would fail due to improper processing of the
   stored procedure statement, particularly on UNIX platforms.
