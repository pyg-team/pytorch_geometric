QUESTION
 We set sqlnet.ora to eliminate the creation of sqlnet.log. Why are we still getting large sqlnet.log files? 

CAUSE
Inactive net service end points have invalid definitions, 
or they are not active for some reason and need to be enabled again.


ANSWER
 

The content of the sqlnet.ora file is as follows: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


The result of these entries is the sqlnet.log is not created because the data is sent to /dev/null, unless there is no sqlnet.ora file for that service name. When you view the sqlnet.log file, if you see this error, there are some inactive service end points that must be reviewed : 

Fatal NI connect error 12514, connecting to: 
(DESCRIPTION=(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=toad)(CID=(PROGRAM=krzstart)(HOST=hst1d)(USER=root)))(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=IPC)(KEY=d_oradvv_emp1.world))) grep the tnsnames.ora file for "SERVICE_NAME" to see the list. Verify the service names that tnsping canâ€™t resolve are valid and active. For example in this list we found 5 inactive service names to be cleaned up...

SERVICE_NAME = drg)
(SERVICE_NAME = rbt)
(SERVICE_NAME = tgr)

(SERVICE_NAME = hrs)

(SERVICE_NAME = snk)
(SERVICE_NAME = hst)
(SERVICE_NAME = shp)
(SERVICE_NAME = spg)
(SERVICE_NAME = SOX)
(SERVICE_NAME = rtg)
