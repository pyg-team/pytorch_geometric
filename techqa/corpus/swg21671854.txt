Text:
HATS Oracle WebLogic; RAD TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installing Oracle WebLogic Server Tools in IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) 9.0 or 9.5 for Rational Host Access Transformation Services fails when trying to use the installation wizards in the Eclipse studio with error stating the installation is incomplete. 

SYMPTOM
The installation will fail with error "Cannot complete the install because one or more of the required items could not be found". The items listed can vary depending on what is currently installed. 


CAUSE
The version of the Oracle WebLogic Server Tools that the studio tries to install may only work with newer versions of Eclipse. Oracle often removes support for previous versions of Eclipse from the latest version of their server tools. 

RAD 9.0 is based on Eclipse 4.2.2 and requires a version of the server tools which run on Eclipse Juno to install properly.

RAD 9.5 is based on Eclipse 4.4.2 and requires a version of the server tools which run on Eclipse Luna to install properly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps when installing to Rational Application Developer (RAD) 9.0: 

In order to install the Oracle WebLogic Server Tools in RAD 9.0, an older version of the plugin is required. The last version that supported Eclipse 4.2 was the Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse 12.1.2.
