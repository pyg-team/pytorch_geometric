 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM DataStage client login to InfoSphere Information Server fails:

Failed to authenticate the current user against the selected Services Tier

Unable to send HTTP request to Server [servername] on port [9080]. The WinInet ErrorCode is: [0] 

SYMPTOM
If SSL revocation cannot be checked then authentication fails for IBM DataStage clients. Fails with WinInet error code 12057.


CAUSE
WinInet 12057 indicates that revocation cannot be checked because the revocation server was offline (equivalent to CRYPT_E_REVOCATION_OFFLINE).

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if certificate is enabled for revocation in Internet Explorer. Follow the steps
1) Open Internet Explorer
2) Click on Tools in File menu->Internet Options->Advanced Tab.
3) Under security section check if these options are enabled: 
i) Check for publishers certificate revocation
ii) Check for server certificate revocation

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Uncheck these two options and click OK to save the settings. Once this is done we can login through IBM DataStage clients.
