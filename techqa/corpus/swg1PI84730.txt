APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have a model with a class "MyBaseClass" ccontaining a
   Statechart. The
   Statechart have, among others, a state "StateX" and an event
   "eventX".
   The class is a generalization of 3 different classes "MyClass1",
   "MyClass2" and "MyClass3" which inherit the Statechart from the
   class
   "Base"
   I open the model, select "Blase" class; double click on the
   "Statechart" and delete the "StateX" and "eventX" from the
   model.
   I save the new model for further usage (and eventually close the
   Rhapsody).
   At this moment my expectation is that "StateX" and "EventX" has
   been
   completely removed from my model.
   (I reopen the Rhapsody and) type Ctrl+F to search for "StateX"
   or
   "eventX". I find there are occurrences of those in "MyClass1",
   "MyClass2" and "MyClass3".
   I click on the reference and Rhapsody crashes.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The state remains because it was deleted from a base statechart
   and the the derived statechart is not being updated
   automatically.
   Once the user clicks on the state in the search results, the
   statechart is being updated against its base statechart and the
   state is being deleted.
   Fixed by adding safe programming.
