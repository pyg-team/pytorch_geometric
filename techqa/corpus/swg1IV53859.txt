APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The LG0 agent file is filling up with ASI login messages.  The
   customer needs a way to disable this message as the log is
   filling up the filesystem space.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Post a request to the url "http://<ip>:1920///<agent service
   endpoint>/<agent service endpoint>/html/default.htm" with the
   token "Authorization:Basic xxxxx" put in the head. On windows
   platform, put the encoded local account instead. An equivalent
   example using curl tool looks like
   
   curl -H "Authorization:Basic xxxxxx" --url
   "http://ip address:1920///xxxxx-6_lz//xxxxx-6_lz/html/default
   .htm" -d "<REPORT><TABLENAME>UNIXOS</TABLENAME></REPORT>"
   
   
   Read the agent service endpoint by reading the response of the
   simple request "http://<ip>:1920"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually monitor or write a situation to trim the LG0 file if it
   grows to a larger size.  Or move the location of the file to a
   larger file system using CTIRA_HIST_DIR
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Provide environment variable to disable ASI logon message.
   
   
   The LG0 agent file is filling up with ASI login messages.  The
   customer needs a way to disable this message as the log is
   filling up the filesystem space.
   
   The messages is:
   
   1140108024619670KRAI003I  Client user root successfully sign-on
   to Agent Service Interface
   
   Added environment variable that can be used in the agents config
   file to disable the KRAI003I message. In order for this APAR to
   be properly implemented in your environment, a new environment
   variable has been added. See the "Install Actions" section of
   the APAR conclusion for more details.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Install Actions:
   
   The environment variable IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_LOGON_MSG=N is
   added to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent environment
   file, where {pc} is the two-character product code:
   
   Windows: Install_dir\TMAITM6\k{pc}cma.ini.  Reconfigure the
   agent to implement any changes.
   Linux/UNIX: Install_dir/config/{pc}.ini.  On system monitor
   agents, this file is {pc}.environment.  Recycle the agent to
   implement any changes.
