Title: IBM The "Edit in Doc" button missing - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The Docs server SystemOut.log the following error is generated when accessing a file. 

HttpMethodDir I org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector executeWithRetry I/O exception (javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException) caught when processing request: RSA premaster secret error


CAUSE
The Java unrestricted policy files were updated on the Connections Node server, but not on the Docs Node server. The FileViewer server did not have any issues, because that jvm is also the Connections Node server. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Coping the unrestricted policy files from the Connections node server to the Docs node server resolved the issue. 

----------------------------------------------
1. Shutdown the Docs node server
2. Rename policy files to:
local_policy.jarold
US_export_policy.jarold
3. Copy the following files from the Connections node server to the Docs node server
local_policy.jar
US_export_policy.jar
4. Restart the Docs node server

NOTE: The files are located in the following directory. 
<WAS_Path>/AppServer/java/jre/lib/security
