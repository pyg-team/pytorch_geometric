APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DASH menu is NOT displaying 100% when AEL page is active in IE
   11 (also in IE 8).
   
   Reproduced from DASH 3.1.1.x, DASH 3.1.2 including CP5. to DASH
   3.1.3.0 but NOT on DASH 3.1.0.3
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Zoom 100% of IE increases the visibility (upto 90%) of DASH menu
   but whenever a new item(pages) gets added, decreases the
   visibility of the menu hiding behind AEL.
