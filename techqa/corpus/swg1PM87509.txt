APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a broker execution group is dumping due to any reason,
   a second dump may be initiated due to the fact, that WBI-FN
   didn't react on the abend signal and keeps the thread running.
   
   This occurs on MQGET calls with a wait interval specified.
   As no pthread_testintr() is executed after the MQGET call, this
   holds up the internal shutdown or abend and may cause the second
   dump.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none, ignore the second dump, as it does't provide additional
   information

   ****************************************************************
   Formerly, when a broker execution group is dumping due to any
   reason, a second dump may be initiated due to the fact, that
   WebSphere BI for FN did not react on the abend signal and keeps
   the thread running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now, WebSphere BI for FN reacts on the abend signal and allows
   threads to be canceled, when a broker execution group is
   dumping.
