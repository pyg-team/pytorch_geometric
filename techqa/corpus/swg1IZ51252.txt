APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As of few months ago the status was, the Linux version of the
   Remedy
   gateway is not available due to pending  licensing arrangement
   with
   BMC/Remedy.  IBM working on a new agreement with BMC,  which
   will
   allow us to compile the gateway using Remedy's static library.
   
   Recently (last week) for another PMR I received the following
   from
   the product management (via the customer account team):
   
   The most recent version of the Remedy gateway has recently been
   certified for use with BMC Remedy 7.1 as well. While the docs
   may take
   some to time to get updated to reflect this support.
   
   The Integration  Wiki  at

   says ... except Remedy Express we support 7.1 and 7.0 on Linux.
   
     IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus Gateway Tier 2
   Gateway for Remedy ARS           TroubleTicket          ARS 6.3
   , 7.0 and 7.1         nco-g-remedy         Solaris, HP-UX, AIX,
   Linux, Windows
   
   "The Gateway for Remedy ARS converts alerts into Remedy help
   desk trouble
   tickets. Trouble tickets are updated, according to a predefined
   mapping throughout the lifetime of the alert. Remedy
   Express(Magic Servicedesk) is not supported via this Gateway .
   There are no plans of supporting Remedy Express "
   
   The gateway read me says ...
   
   The default installation supports Remedy 6.3 for Linux and
   Remedy 7.0
         for all other platforms.
   
   Can you please confirm the subject support to advise the
   customer please.  Thanks.

   Venkat,
   
   As per Gavin's request, can you please create a docs APAR for
   the Remedy gateway.
   
   Gavin, there are no changes to the gateway, as this is the
   existing GA gateway retested for ARS 7.1 compatibility, so
   unless there are other Remedy gateway docs APARs outstanding,
   this should be it.
   
   Thanks,
   Christian

   Hi Christian
   
   Yes to both.  Also, apart from the compatibility issue, are
   there any other changes that can be made to the guide at the
   same time?

   Thanks Anish.
   
   Gavin, do we need a technote or docs update to reflect the new
   compatibility status WRT ARS 7.1? Do we need a docs APAR?

   Hi all,
   
   I can confirm that I successfully tested the previous version of
   the Remedy gateway (Release ID: 8.0.5565 available on XL) with
   Remedy v7.1 running on Aix (6.1), Linux (SuSE10), Solaris
   (5.10), and HPUX (11.11).

   Subject:  Re: [INTERNAL] Omnibus Integrations - Gateways L3
   Communication: PMR 84290,422,000 Linux Remedy Gatway Support
   for Remedy ARS/ITSM V7.x Question
   
   
   
   I believe the existing Linux gateway (part number C1TS0EN) was
   tested against Remedy 7.1, using the default ARS 6.3 module.
   Perhaps Anish can clarify what platforms were validated against
   Remedy ARS 7.1? Regardless, the Linux version should work
   against ARS 7.1, as ARS 7.1 is backward compatible with 6.3
   clients.
   
   You're right that the ARS 7.x module for Linux will require a
   new build environment. If the customer has a problem with the
   GA gateway on Linux, then we can look at putting together a
   concession release for them when we have an updated build
   environment.

   Christian , I know for certain that we did not upload a linux
   binary to the enablement sites. Jonathan had informed me
   sometime back that  we were unable to compile the Remedy 7
   Gateway on Linux due to build issues. Has that changed ?  If so,
   can we make a Linux build available to customer on concession ?
   
   Thanks,
   Rajesh

LOCAL FIX
 *  Communcated to the customer that ...
   
   Here is what we've found out from L3:
   
   "The current GA gateway is simply the older gateway, initially
   tested
   against ARS 6.3 and 7.0, but now validated against ARS 7.1 in
   addition
   to the existing ARS 6.3 and 7.0 support, including Linux.
   
   So, ARS 6.3, 7.0 and 7.1 is supported on all platforms,
   including Linux.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the Gateway for Remedy on Linux.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The guide currently states in the Summary table that the gateway
   supports Remedy V6.3 and V7.0. However, the gateway also
   supports Remedy V7.1.
   
   The supported Remedy versions table indiates that on Linux,
   only Remedy V6.3 is supported. The gateway has now been tested
   successfully against Remedy V7.0 and V7.1.
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   The reference guide will be updated with the next release of the
   gateway.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Summary table will be updated to indicated that the gateway
   supports Remedy V6.3, 7.0, and 7.1.
   
   The supported Remedy versions table will be updated to indicate
   that all platforms support Remedy V6.3, 7.0, and 7.1.
   
   There are also a number of places in the guide that mention
   Remedy V7.0.  These will be all be updated to state Remedy V7.0
   and V7.1.
