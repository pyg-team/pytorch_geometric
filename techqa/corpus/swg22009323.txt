AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational Directory Server (Tivoli) v5.2.1 and earlier.
Rational Directory Administrator v6.0.0.2 and earlier.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
1. Install one of the following IBM JREs supported versions that contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities: 

 * IBM Java Runtime Environment, Version 7 R1 Service Refresh 4 Fix Pack 10 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FIBM+Rational+Directory+Server&fixids=5.2.1-RDS-JRE-71SR4FP10&source=SAR] 
 * IBM Java Runtime Environment, Version 8 Service Refresh 4 Fix Pack 10 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FIBM+Rational+Directory+Server&fixids=5.2.1-RDS-JRE-8SR4FP10&source=SAR]


2. After installing a fixed IBM JRE version, install Rational Directory Server v5.2.1 iFix12 and Rational Directory Administrator v6.0.0.2 iFix06 from:  * Rational Directory Server (Tivoli) Interim Fix 12 for 5.2.1 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043554] 
 * Rational Directory Administrator Interim Fix 06 for 6.0.0.2 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043555]

These steps will update the path of recommended/fixed IBM JRE in RDS/RDA. 

For versions of Rational Directory Server that are earlier than version 5.2.1, and Rational Directory Administrator versions earlier than 6.0.0.2, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
