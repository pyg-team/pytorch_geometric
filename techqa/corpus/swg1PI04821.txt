PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  New Borrow Tool should be used, which is a part of LKAD
   (License Key Administrator) installation. This tool uses
   borrow plugin, which is a part of Rhapsody installation and
   registered in
   C:\ProgramData\IBM\RCL\Borrow\borrow.properties file. The
   plugin itself is located in ?Rhapsody
   root?/BorrowLicenses/com.ibm.rcl.client.admin.borrow.sampleP
   lugin_1.0.0.jar.
