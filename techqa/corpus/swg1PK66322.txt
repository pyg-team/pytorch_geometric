APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Connections should be PreTested in the case of using 'Failed
   Connection Only' and NOT PreTested in the case of using 'Entire
   Pool' for Purge Policies.  This is the behavior to be fixed
   whereby Entire Pool policy does NOT PreTest.  Now there are also
   configurable PreTest New or Existing pool connection properties
   at the DataSource, but these are not used in conjunction with
   the purge policy.  PreTest logic for failed connection does use
   the same PreTest SQL String as shown by Default DataSource
   properties previously mentioned, which is
   which is "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1".  If this value is
   left Blank, then it will revert to "SELECT 1 FROM DUAL".

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of Relational Resource Adapter    *
   *                  (RRA) on IBM WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  V6.1.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After a fatal or stale connection       *
   *                      exception, the new connections are      *
   *                      pre-tested before use.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a connection fails with a fatal error or stale
   connection exception, the new connections for the same
   connection pool are pre-tested before being given to the
   application.
   The following trace point may appear in such cases in the
   WAS.j2c=all traces:
   
   [4/14/08 14:01:11:467 CEST] 00000040 WSRdbManagedC 3
   preTestConnection
   WSRdbManagedConnectionImpl@7e0e7e0e
   preTestSQLString: "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
   
   This happens regardless of a value of the Pretest New
   Connections property and is correct. However, this should not
   happen when the pool Purge Policy is EntirePool and this APAR
   corrects that.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After a fatal or stale connection exception, the new
   connections are pre-tested before use only if the pool Purge
   Policy is FailingConnectionOnly.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 6.1.0.19. Please refer to the Recommended Updates
