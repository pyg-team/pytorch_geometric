PROBLEM
For Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, the "XML Dom Document" add-on is required for some IBM Connections functionality. However, with this enabled, Cognos Business Intelligence Metrics is slow to load, or doesn't load at all.

SYMPTOM
Starting in Connections 5.5, and while using Internet Explorer 11, Cognos Business Intelligence is extremely slow to load. This slowdown is tied to the "XML Dom Document" IE11 add-on. With "XML Dom Document" disabled, Metrics loads normally. However, without that add-on enabled, some Connections Community items (such as Members and Bookmarks) will then not load. Therefore, disabling this add-on is not a viable option.

This issue is specific to Internet Explorer 11; it does not occur in Firefox or Chrome.


CAUSE
This problem has been identified as a product defect under APAR LO88879. A fix is being considered for a future Connections 5.5 CR release.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can apply one of the following workarounds to this problem. 

 * Consider using a different Web browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, as they are not affected by this problem.
   
   
 * If Internet Explorer must be used, then add the following lines to your httpd.conf file:
   <Location "/metrics"> 
   Header set X-UA-Compatible "IE=9" 
   </Location> 
   
   <Location "/cognos"> 
   Header set X-UA-Compatible "IE=7" 
   </Location> After making this change, metrics should load normally even with the add-on enabled.
