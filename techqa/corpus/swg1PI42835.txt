APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 Client and Server
   environment. You have some syntax files including a lot of
   Python commands inserted in Production job files that used to
   run in release SPSS 20.
   When you run it you see a message on the Production facility
   about a connection reset:
   
   Java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
   
   However, all your production runs fine to the end successfully
   in release 23 as well but you would like to know where the above
   error comes from
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   The above error message on running production jobs either
   interactively or running in batch mode can be ignored.
   It will not hinder the successful run of the jobs until they are
   finished.
   
   The customer reporting this issue is using Python as their
   default scripting language and they have a custom autoscript,
   which is fine.
   However, when the autoscript executes, a third-party library
   named XMLRPC communicates using sockets between Python and the
   Statistics application.
   The 'SocketException: Connection reset' error message is an
   issue in XMLRPC, where IBM SPSS development have no control of.
   The 'SocketException: Connection reset' message indicates that
   one end of a socket connection was closed without notifying the
   other end of the pending closure.
   The error message has no effect on running SPSS production jobs
   and can be ignored.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Although the above error message can be ignored a fix was
   created to remove the message caused by third party library.
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed for customers who need the fix
   prior to the next upcoming Fix Pack.
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI42835
   and technote 1959951 about about Interim Fix 012
   for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
