APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BE Support Engineer:   CJ
   Change Team Engineer:  EJ
   SAMP: 4.1.0
   RSCT: 3.2
   Problem Description:   The instructions for setting up non-root
   security for TSAMP require that the localhost line in the
   default stanza of /var/ct/cfg/ctrmc.acls  be commented out.
   With a recent change to RSCT this causes a problem with RMC
   which causes a problem for the entire cluster.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the entire localhost line from the default stanza
   completely.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   * Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (SA MP) 4.1 users
   * using non-root security setup
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * The SA MP Installation and Cpnfiguration guide is incorrect in
   * the description for the setup of 'non-root security'.
   * The procedure describes to comment out the line
   *
   *   LOCALHOST  *  r
   *
   * within the file /var/ct/cfg/ctrmc.acls, but the line has to be
   * removed from the file instead.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SA MP Installation and Configuration guide will be updated
   to correct this issue as follows:
   
    Chapter 5: Securing
      Setting up non-root user Ids for the command line interface
   
      The step 6 of the procedure will be adjusted.

    6.Modify the file /var/ct/cfg/ctrmc.acls on all nodes. You must
      add the following entries for the global user IDs sa_operator
      and sa_admin to the RMC ACL file (/var/ct/cfg/ctrmc.acls) on
      every node in the cluster and comment the line that starts
      with LOCALHOST, for example:
      # The following stanza contains default ACL entries.
      # These entries are appended
      # to each ACL defined for a resource class and
      # are examined after any entries
      # explicitly defined for a resource class
      # by the stanzas in this file,
      # including the OTHER stanza.
      DEFAULT
      root@LOCALHOST * rw
      # LOCALHOST * r // comment this line out!
      none:root * rw // give root access to all
      none:sa_admin * rw // append this row for saadmin
      none:sa_operator * rso // append this row for saoperator
