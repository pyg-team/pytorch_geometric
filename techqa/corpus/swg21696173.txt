 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do some pages in Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) only have a "Reset" and "Close" button? The "Save" button is missing. 

ANSWER
Dependent objects in Content Platform Engine (CPE) have the "Save" button located in it's parent object's page/tab. 

An example of a dependent object would be a Directory Configuration. Its parent object would be the p8 domain. To save changes to a Directory Configuration, navigate back to the p8 domain page/tab and click the "Save" button. 

Another example of a dependent object is a Property Definition. The Document Class is the parent object for a Property Definition. To save changes to a Property Definition navigate back to the Document Class page/tab and click the "Save" button.
