QUESTION
 Why did IBM include IBM CL/SUPERSESSION for z/OS V1.4.7 (compid 5608-A24) in an End of Service (EOS) announcement letter and state that it will be withdrawn from support 30 September 2013? 

ANSWER
The EOS announcement is only indicating that if ordering CL/SUPERSESSION V1.4.7, you can no longer use the product number 5608-A24. Instead you must use the new product number 5655-P05 which has new pricing associated with it.
There are no changes to the product function or release number, and IBM still fully supports the original compid 5608A2400 (5608-A24). So, if you are currently using this product, you are not required to reorder the product or make any SMP/E changes. You should also continue to use compid 5608A2400 when opening a service request (PMR). 

The Software service discontinuance announcement letter (EOS letter) indicating that CL/SUPERSESSION V1.4.7 (5608-A24) will be withdrawn from support 30 September 2013 is 912-144 [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS912-144]. As you can see from the following product replacement information included in this announcement, the product version is still 1.4.7: 

5608-A24, IBM CL/Supersession for z/OS , V1.4.7 is replaced by 5655-P05, IBM CL/Supersession for z/OS , V1.4.7, announced in Software Announcement 205-066 [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&appname=gpateam&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS205-066], dated March 15, 2005.

The only change is to the product number (from 5608-A24 to 5655-P05) and this is only for marketing purposes.
