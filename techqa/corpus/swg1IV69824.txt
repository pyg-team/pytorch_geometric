PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Service Registry and Repository V8.5 on
   Windows.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The script which runs DB2 as part of the profile creation uses
   the Windows PATH environment variable to find the location of
   the DB2 executable. The script is case sensitive and assumed
   this variable is called PATH. However on some Windows
   installations this variable may be called Path. Hence the script
   could not find the correct path to the DB2 executable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The profile creation script has been updated to look for a
   Windows environment variable called either PATH or Path.
   
   This fix is targeted for WSRR V8.5.5.0.
