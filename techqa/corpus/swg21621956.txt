QUESTION
 My borker session is working however in the broker log is reported an error. 

CAUSE
What does the error "ERROR Â¬ 2208| I0000/00cf: unable to obtain peer certificate" mean? Which is the impact?

ANSWER
This message can be safely ignored for connections coming from a controller or target. 

Background information: 
When the broker accepts an incoming connection, the first thing to 
happen on the connection is the SSL/TLS handshake to establish a secure (encrypted) connection. During the SSL/TLS handshake, there is a certificate verification step where the client verifies the server certificate and optionally the server verifies the client's certificate. 
Endpoints (controllers and targets) do not need a certificate but brokers do need one. 
The problem is, during the TLS/SSL handshake, the broker does not yet 
know if the client is an endpoint or another broker, which means that it 
doesn't know if it has to ask for a client certificate or not. Hence, 
the broker always requests a client certificate and if the client sends 
a certificate, the broker verifies it. Then, after the SSL/TLS handshake 
has completed, the broker determines the type of client. Now that the 
broker knows the type of client, it can check if a certificate is 
required and refuse the connection when the client did not provide a 
certificate if one was required.
