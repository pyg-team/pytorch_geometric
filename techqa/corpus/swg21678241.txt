Title: IBM Insufficient permissions to install Decision Center (ODM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing Decision Center, when trying to access the Installation Settings Wizard through the console, the following error message is seen:
"Insufficient permissions to install Decision Center. Decision Center has not been installed. You must sign in with rtsInstaller rights to be able to access the Installation Settings Wizard" 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to log in with a user mapped to a Decision Center administrative role: rtsInstaller or rtsAdministrator/rtsConfigManager. 

WebSphere Application Server has single-sign-on (SSO) activated by default so you may need to sign out and sign in again with the proper Decision Center user you have defined and mapped to one of the above roles as explained in the documentation at 
Operational Decision Manager V8.5 > Configuring > Configuring Operational Decision Manager on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring the Decision Center consoles on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring the Decision Center consoles on WebSphere Application Server for distributed platforms > Step 3: Configuring security [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.wodm.family.config.was%2Fconfig_dc_websphere%2Ftsk_was_create_users_and_grps.html]

Also, make sure you have enabled security on the server, under Security > Global security > Enable application security in the WebSphere Application Server admin console, as explained in the above documentation. Please restart the server after enabling security.
