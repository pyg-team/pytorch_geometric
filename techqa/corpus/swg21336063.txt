PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Problem:

Failed to load Upfront computer group information when trying to log into the Upfront administration server

Solution:

If you wish to preserve your current data which is in Upfront follow the steps below. If the data which is currently in Upfront is of no relevance simply uninstall Upfront, delete the upfront folder from the <drive>:\program files\cognos\cer1\ directory. Then reinstall the application.


If you wish to preserve the items in Upfront do the following:
1. Open a DOS window
2. Navigate to the <drive>:\program files\cognos\cer1\bin directory
3. Type upfpack -un <username> -pw <password>
This will create a file in the bin directory named upfpackage.pkg
4. Copy the upfpackage.pkg file to your desktop or some location out of the Cognos directories.
5. Now go to the control panel and select add/remove programs. Select Cognos BI and select remove.
6. 
Do a custom uninstall and only select the two Upfront options
7. When the uninstall is finished go into windows explorer and browse to the <drive>:\program files\cognos\cer1 directory.
8. At the above location you should see a folder named Upfront, (rename it to Upfrontold.old)
9. Insert the Upfront installation cd and perform a custom install.
10. During the install select only the two Upfront options to be installed and proceed with the install.
11. After the install completes make sure that all of the Upfront services are running and launch the Upfront Server Administration utility.
12. You will be prompted for a servername and then a username and password. Use a username and password from the root user class in Access Manager.
13. In the Upfront admin utility go to the server menu and select add server. Enter your server name.
14. After the server is added select that server name in the left hand pane. 
15. Go to the tools menu / 
security / newsindex administrators / set security. Select the root user class and any other user classes which you want to have full access to Upfront. Remember that the user classes that are chosen here you will not be able to restrict access to items in Upfront.
16. Ignore the restart the service message and go to the tools menu again. This time do the same procedure as step 15 but do it for Server Administrators.
17. Stop and restart all of the Upfront Services.
18. Open up a DOS window again and navigate to <drive>:\program files\cognos\cer1\bin directory.
19. Now, find the upfpackage.pkg file that was created before and place it in the <drive>:\program files\cognos\cer1\bin directory.
20. Now from the command line type the following from the bin directory 
upfunpack -ns <namespace name (probably default)>
21. You will be prompted for a userid and password, after you enter these hit enter.
22. Stop and restart all of the Upfront 
services.

This will get rid of the error and retain the information that was previously in Upfront. You should login to Upfront as an administrator and delete the duplicate entries. There may be 2 or 3 duplicate entries which will have to be deleted.
