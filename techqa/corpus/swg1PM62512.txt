APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is able to import the simulink model into Rhapsody
   successfully.
   The simulink model is in a folder above the project folder.
   When I import the simulink model I HAVE to specify the relative
   path to the model (e.g. ..\Simulink_model\model.mdl.
   This works very well.
   Now I want to open the simulink model from Rhapsody. This does
   not work! There is no error message, it simple nothing happens.
   
   Otherwise, when I specify the absolute path to the model (like
   D:\main_dir\Simulink_model\model.mdl) the model can be opened
   normally.
   
   Neither setting the TAG value for 'SimulinkProjectFile' makes
   any difference.
