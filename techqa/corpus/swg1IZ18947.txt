   Issue:
   Customer applied the concession patch (after concession
   patch, probe upgrade 3.0.3169) to address the issue in APAR
   IY99350. Howver the issue was not fixed but slightly different
   with IY99350.
   
   
   When the probe initially connects to T2000 server, probe is able
   to receive real-time alarms no matter PersistentNotification is
   set to true or false. However after notification service is
   restarted(after being down), probe is not able to receive alarms
   anymore when PersistentNotification=true.
