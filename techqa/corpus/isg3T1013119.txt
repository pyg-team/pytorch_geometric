QUESTION
 Verify license upgrade 

ANSWER
I have upgraded my licenses. How do I verify my license upgrade is successful?
Once you've upgraded, you can use the following steps to verify:

1) Start the license server (lmgrd) with the new license. 

2) Verify that it works fine by using lmstat -c -a .

3) Change the LSF_LICENSE_FILE in lsf.conf pointing to the new license file (new license) 

4) Restart master lim by using lsadmin limrestart on the master hosts in order to have the cluster check out the new licenses.

5) Finally you can run lsid, lsload, bhosts and bjobs to verify that the cluster is functioning well. 

6) TIP: lshosts -l will tell the licenses enabled for each machine in the cluster.
