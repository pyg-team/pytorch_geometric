ABSTRACT
 This session is for WebSphere MQ users who use SSL or TLS to secure their channels. It covers an overview of terminology, certificate administration (GSKit, Java, RACF and DCM) and problem diagnosis. The session covers Windows, UNIX, IBM i, z/OS, JMS and Java (including JSSE).

Open Mic session 
29 April 2010 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 03:55 Technical introduction 05:21 What are CA certificates, signer certificates, personal certificates, client certificates and server certificates? 08:31 What is a certificate chain and how do I view it? 17:51 How do I renew an expired certificate? 21:50 How do I make sure that SSL/TLS is set up correctly? 36:12 What has changed in MQ SSL/TLS since version 5.3? 43:41 Must the environment variable MQSSLKEYR be always defined? Does it apply to all MQ versions and platforms? 44:57 Does SSL work for only point to point channels, or can it work in a clustered environment? If yes, how do you handle keystore and personal certificate in a clustered environment? 45:42 On Windows, we seem to require having the full certificate chain of certificates we want to authenticate, whereas on Unix it appears the root certificate CA is sufficient to authenticate. Is this difference in behavior expected between the two platforms? 47:42 We have queue managers on AIX that were installed without the SSL components and we moved them up to 6.0.2.6 and also added some additional patches to them. What is the best way to get them to use SSL? 51:41 When using the MQCONNX verb to connect a WMQ client to the server, what do I need to specify in the options for the key database or does MQSSLKEYR work? 53:15 For slide 36, how do I manipulate the OCSPs in MQ V7.0.1 to be active or not? 56:20 Closing remarks 57:19 End of Call
