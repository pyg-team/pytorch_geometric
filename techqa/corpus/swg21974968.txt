Title: IBM How in-session detection mechanism works - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How does the "in-session detection" mechanism work in IBM Security AppScan Standard? 

CAUSE
There may be instances where AppScan detects it is out-of-session and is not able to successfully validate its marked in-session pattern. If this occurs, an out of session notification will be displayed in the the scan log and if it cannot log back in after multiple attempts the scan will suspend.

ANSWER
 

Note: The in-session detection mechanism is working only when using the Recorded login method. Consult Login methods in AppScan Standard [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21607424]. 

 

How AppScan keeps being in-session 

When running a scan with the Recorded login, AppScan will poll the application periodically to check if it can reach the page marked as "in-session" and whether it is able to detect the marked detection pattern. The period is defined by the following switch "Scan Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Session management: In-session heartbeat interval". By default it is set to 5 seconds. 

If AppScan Standard is unsuccessful reaching the page (such as the response to request is a redirect to the login page or a customized error page), an out-of-session state is detected. AppScan will stop the scan, replay the login sequence, confirm its valid session state using the In-Session Detection pattern and if successful, continue the scan. 

If an out-of-session state is detected in the test phase, AppScan will stop all of its testing threads, re-login, check its in-session state, and then re-run in single-threaded mode all the tests since the last point a valid session state was confirmed. After each test is performed, it will poll the in-session page and skip a test should it cause the session to be invalidated. AppScan will continue using one thread for the remaining tests until all have been performed, at which point it will return to the original thread configuration. 

If AppScan is not able to re-login, it will show an error as described in Scan results in error "out-of-session and is trying to re-login" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21283302].
