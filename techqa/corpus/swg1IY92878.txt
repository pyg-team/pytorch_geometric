APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description: can assign a tool an accelerator key in the admin
   config and it will show on the client menu but if it is
   not in the main menu the accelerator key will not function.  If
   I have the tool under the main menu it works fine.
   Procedure used:
   Assigning the keys in the Menus portion of the admin config gui.
   I have made the updates to the name using the & sign and the
   updates to the database tools.menu_items.  if I have the tool
   off the main menu in a sub- menu it will not work.  Now if I
   take the same tool and move it back into the main menu it works
   fine use the accelerator key.
   Functionality customer wants to achieve:
   I just wanted to make it work, in my tests I have been using a
   copy of the Windows ping tool.  The question came up about the
   accelerator keys after a customer wished to know why they did
   not work on sub-menus.
   After replicating the issue, the development Team have verified
   that  this is a bug in the Event List.
   However, it only exists in the Windows Event List and that the
   UNIX event list correctly responds to accelerator
   (hot keys) on sub-menu's.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  no work around for windows, required functionality not
   working..
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users who are trying to use Administrator to *
   *                 add accelerator keys to the Tools in         *
   *                 sub-menu of Windows EventList                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For Windows EventList the accelerator   *
   *                      keys added to Tools in sub-menu don't   *
   *                      work.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: N/A                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   Windows EvenList only support accelerator keys added to Tools
   in top level menu(main menu).  Accelerator keys added to sub
   memus are not processed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A change has been made to handle all the accelerator key
   settings from submenus along with the parent top level menu.
   After the change users can assign accelerator  keys to Tools in
   any level of menu and use the accelerator key to invoke the
   Tools directly.
