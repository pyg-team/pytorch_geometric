APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type: Internal
   
   Approver: JM
   Severity: 2
   Reported Release: 622
   Compid:  5608A41CI Distributed Installer
   Abstract: Upgrading MSSQL Agent with instances causes the
   instances of the agent to be deleted during the upgrade.
   
   Environment:
   Windows only. Possibly any agent that uses templates to cause
   instances to be generated may demonstrated this behavior.
   Defect may be related to fix 90620.
   
   Problem Description:
   During upgrade the instance is identified and uninstalled.
   There is then an attempt to recreate the instance which fails.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   Install MSSQL Agent with release prior to 6.2.3. Upgrade this
   agent with the 6.2.3 Agent. The instances for the initial agent
   are deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix:
   Readd the instance using Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
   Services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Upgrading the MSSQL agent will cause agent instances to be
   deleted.
   
   After upgrading the MSSQL agent, the existing instances are
   unconfigured then re-configured. This fails, thus causing the
   instances to be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MSSQL agent instances are now preserved upon upgrade.
   
   Older MSSQL agents, or workstations that have MSSQL 2000 may not
   update the version of MSSQL properly.  The agent functions but
   the version information is corrupted.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0007
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Recreate the agent instances which were deleted.
