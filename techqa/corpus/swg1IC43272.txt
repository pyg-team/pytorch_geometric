   29787 - Highlighted row not rendering to end of subfile.

           alignment.
   30691 - <BR> tag shown in widget preview for subfile.
   30735 - HATS connection timeouts are not occurring soon enough.
           If a connection definition has set the maximum busy
           time or the maximum idle time, HATS periodically scans
           all such connections to see if any should be
   terminated.
           Depending on the value of the times chosen, this
           periodic scan might not run as frequently as desired.
           HATS has been modified to scan at least once per minute
           for connections that are eligible to be terminated.
   30781 - Select Item popup only updating first input field on
           host using the Konqueror browser.
   30782 - Macro : Unable to create IO with If/Else statement.
   30819 - Timed-out clients should get a disconnected page.
           HATS no longer creates a new legacy host connection
           and a new HATS application after the original
           application has timed out. Instead, the end user
           receives a page indicating the application has
           disconnected due to inactivity. This page offers a
           button to restart the application, if desired.
   30834 - SBCS: The "Use project defaults" check box becomes
           unchecked in component settings for default rendering
           item.
   30908 - XSLT Style Sheets not applied on server using Web
           Services.
   30929 - Subfile: subfileActionFieldStartCol function not
           working.
   30950 - Migrated a HATS V4 application through CVS and
   received
           an Error.
   30984 - Mozilla sends unchanged input fields to the server.
           Mozilla sends more fields to the server than were
           actually modified. This may cause some problems for
           legacy applications, such as TSO. This fix only allows
   modified fields to be sent to the server.
