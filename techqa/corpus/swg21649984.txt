Title: IBM Issue in configuring Business Space widgets through WebSphere Portal - United States

Text:
WebSphere Portal ; Business Monitor 7.0.0.2 theme; /models; Business Space; ProxyConfig TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After configuring a widget in IBM Business Monitor, the widget cannot be edited in WebSphere Portal. The error log shows a 404 error for the URL /models, as it is not routed through the AJAX proxy. 

SYMPTOM
- Business Monitor widgets cannot be configured. 

- /models URL is loaded directly from WebSphere Portal server, and results in an HTTP error code 404.


CAUSE
This issue is caused by the AJAX proxy configuration.


ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Portal Server V7.0.0.2 CF 12 or higher and IBM Business Monitor V8.0.1.1.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the Javaâ„¢script console, look for a 404 error for the /models or other URLs. There might be an attempt for the failing URLs to be loaded directly from WebSphere Portal, instead of being routed through the AJAX proxy. 

Check if the proxy-config.xml file has entries for only https URLs. If yes, add the identical entries for http URLs as well. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The proxy-config.xml file should have entries for both 'https' and 'http'.
