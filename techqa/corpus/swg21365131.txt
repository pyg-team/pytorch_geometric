Title: IBM The transaction log for the database is full. - United States

Text:
commit; transaction; full. TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running a build using Relational Table delivery you get this error: 

DS-DBMS-E400: UDA driver reported the following on connection 'market01':
DMS-E-GENERAL, A general exception has occurred during operation 'execute'.
[IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/NT] SQL0964C The transaction log for the database is full. SQLSTATE=57011 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If processing a large volume of data the transaction log may become full, generating the error. This error will continue to occur until the log is increased to be large enough.

There are two options to resolve the issue:

1) Increase the size of the database log file by increasing the value of LOGFILSIZ.

2) Set the Commit Interval of the Delivery Module to an appropriate number (e.g 5000) so the commit be issued.

By default, a COMMIT instruction is not issued until all the data rows have been delivered. The entire delivery is executed as a single transaction.
