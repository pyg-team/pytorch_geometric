PROBLEM CONCLUSION

   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   Search results are different compared to the no. of results
   mentioned in the message.
   Reason:
   Although the predicate "where attribute like 'abc%_'" is
   syntactically correct, it doesn't mean much.
   It means : 'abc' followed by any string, followed by a
   character. 'followed by any string' already includes
   'followed by a character'.
