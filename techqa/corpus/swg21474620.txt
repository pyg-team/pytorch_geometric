If you have Rational License Server 7.1 or earlier installed, you must uninstall the license server before installing Rational License Key Server 8.x. You cannot upgrade license servers versions 7.1 or earlier to version 8.x. 
 * Rational License Key Server version 8.x cannot be on the same computer as IBM Rational Common License version 7.1 or earlier and IBM Rational License Server TL 2.0.
