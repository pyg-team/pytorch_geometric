PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Remove limitation on using fixed log names in Event Integration
   Facility (EIF) per IZ08862 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ08862].
   
   The PreFilter statements in the Tivoli Log File Agent .conf file
   do not allow custom Windows Event log names. This limitation was
   present in the EIFEvent library base code.   This APAR removes
   the limitation per IZ08862 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ08862].
   
   For the Log File Agent to take advantage of this APAR fix the
   following are needed:
   - On Windows, this APAR fix is included as part of Log File
     Interim Fix 6.2.2.4-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0006.
   - On UNIX/Linux this APAR fix included in the IBM Tivoli
     Monitoring Shared Libraries (TEMA)
     component of IBM Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 Fix Pack 8 as part of
     the Shared Libraries (ax) component.
