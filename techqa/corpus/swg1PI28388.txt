APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z 9.1 - RDz - CARMA Endevor
   'Preview JCL' on batch action returns 'Job Submit error: Unable
   to access JCL Template on the host' .
   
   When CARMA Endevor user selects 'Preview JCL' for 'Submit as
   batch job' option on CARMA User Interface screen, the following
   error is returned to client:
   'Job Submit error: Unable to access JCL Template on the host'.
   The following errors are seen in the host log indicating that
   CARMA server holds an exclusive lock on
   "CRABJCLO" file:
   
   MIM1038I RDZRSE5 contention with CRA19559 OWNS EXCL on PROD
   MIM1039I RDZRSE5 needs SHR SYSDSN
   xxxx.xxxx.PROD.CRA$NDVR.CRABJCLO
   
   In the above messages, RDZRSE5 is the threadpool that CARMA user
   is connected to and CRA19559 is the user's CARMA server that
   continues to hold an exclusive lock on CRABJCLO file after
   Endevor host has completed writing JCL to file and has closed
   file.  If MIM is not installed, this contention can be seen by
   using F1 to gather Data Set Contention information.  In this
   scenario, the "CRABJCLO" file contains the JCL to be "previewed"
   at the client.  The allocation request to download CRABJCLO file
   to client fails and the client is presented
   "Job Submit error".  This problem does not occur at most CARMA
   Endevor customer sites.
   
   A simular problem has periodically been seen with the "SPCLLIST"
   file.  When this EXCL lock exists with the "SPCLLIST" file, the
   drop-down lists (Environment, System, Subsystem...) are "empty"
   on the CARMA Endevor UI screens.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Preview JCL problem: Select 'Submit on host' or 'Run in
   foreground' on 'Submit as batch job' option.
   
   Empty drop-down lists problem: N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: PQF USRTPLED                                 *
   *                 01.RDz users who access the Endevor          *
   *                    repository using the IBM supplied RDz     *
   *                    Endevor RAM.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.For some users, the IBM Rational     *
   *                         Developer for System z (RDz) is not  *
   *                         able to access some of the           *
   *                         temporary datasets that are          *
   *                         allocated by the host IBM RDz        *
   *                         Endevor RAM because those datasets   *
   *                         are not released after being         *
   *                         updated by the IBM RDz Endevor RAM.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.The RDz Endevor RAM needs to release and reallocate the
      datasets that are locked.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The RDz Endevor RAM is being enhanced to provide a new
      option to explicitly request that the datasets be freed and
      re-allocated.
