APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user has the option in the Pattern Builder to select
   and deploy a pattern  using a virtual image version that the
   user does not have permissions to access.
   
   For example, User00 does not have access rights to the OS Image
   for RedHat version 2.1.1.0, but User00 can choose version
   2.1.1.0 from the dropdown list on the pattern editor to deploy a
   pattern.
   
   The versions listed in the dropdown should be filtered on
   the user access rights.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The REST API call used to populate the dropdown list was not
   filtering the results to just images to which the user had
   access.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.1.2.0.
