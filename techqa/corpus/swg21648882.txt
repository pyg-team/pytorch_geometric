QUESTION
 If the floating license server is not connected, how can I still scan my site with IBM Security AppScan Standard? 

CAUSE
AppScan requires a valid license in order to scan a site. However, you may sometimes need to scan your site in one of the following scenarios: 

 * From outside your corporate network 
 * From your laptop at home or elsewhere (on weekends for example) when you do not have access to the license server 
 * While the license server, or the connection to the license server, is down 


ANSWER
Floating license keys for the AppScan Standard product include a feature called Disconnected Mode. This allows you to scan using a valid AppScan Standard license for up to to three days while disconnected from the license server. 

You activate the Disconnected Mode by having AppScan Standard running (and consuming the floating license) while being disconnected from the License Server. 

When disconnected from the license server, the AppScan > Help > License... dialog still shows End-User License type, but with a message in red "License server unreachable. AppScan can run for up to 72 hours. Switching to Demo license in 72 hours."

NOTE: You can see the feature in License Key Administrator (LKAD) opened on the machine where the License Server is running, as in the screen capture below: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648882&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21648882&aid=2]

The second line in the LKAD with "Disconnected Use Allowed" License Type is a feature on the license key shown on the first line. The Expiration date on that line shows the date when the feature would expire if disconnected now. The screen capture was taken on "03-SEP-2013", and for that day the Expiration date was showing: "06-SEP-2013". 

The three lines in the LKAD in the screen capture above show the same license key. The first line displays the license acquired directly from the license file; the second line displays the disconnect use feature, and the third (gray and dimmed) line displays the same license key acquired through the License Server. 

 

NOTE: When looking into the AppScan Standard license key, you may find reference to a borrowing function (the "BORROW=2160" token) in the license key. However AppScan Standard does NOT support the license borrowing feature.
