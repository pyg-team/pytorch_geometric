DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/pool.html#TIMEOUT [http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/tutorial/ldap/connect/pool.html#TIMEOUT]

The pool of connections maintained by the LDAP service provider may be limited in size; this is described in detail in the Connection Pooling Configuration section. 

When connection pooling has been enabled and no pooled connection is available, the client application will block, waiting for an available connection. You can use the "com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout" environment property to specify how long to wait for a pooled connection. If you omit this property, the application will wait indefinitely. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use 'com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout' parameter in 'Extra Provider Parameters' section of LDAP Connector Configuration. 

 Example : For below configuration, it will come out of wait situation after 5 seconds.
