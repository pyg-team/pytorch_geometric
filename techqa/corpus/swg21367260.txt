CAUSE
This error will occur if the option to use an external namespace as a datasource signon is used, as this is not supported for Metric Studio. It is a requirement that a specific database logon be defined for the data source to be used as the metric store.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modify the signon properties of the datasource to use a specified login. 


Steps: 

 1.  From Cognos Connection, go to Tools --> Directory. 
 2.  Click on the Data Sources tab. 
 3.  Click on the datasource used by the metric package. 
 4.  Click on the Set Properties button. 
 5.  Click on Edit the Connection String (the pencil icon). 
 6.  Click on the radio button next to the signons of this connection. 
 7.  Click OK. 
 8.  Click on the datasource connection. 
 9.  Click on New Signon. 
 10. Enter a name for the new signon and click Next. 
 11. Enter a valid database login for the User ID and password fields, and click Next. 
 12. Click the Add button and navigate to the specific users/groups/roles that will have access to use this signon. 
 13. Click OK. 
 14. Click Finish.
