Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Forms Experience Builder could be susceptible to allowing for a denial of service, cause by an error in Apache POI Libraries 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-3574 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3574]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OOXML file to consume all available CPU resources and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95768] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3529 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3529]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error within the OPC SAX setup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted OpenXML file containing an XML external entity declaration to read arbitrary files on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95770] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2016-5000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5000]
DESCRIPTION: Apache POI could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when XLSX2CSV example uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an XML document containing an external entity reference to read arbitrary files on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115530 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115530] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
