APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently, ITCAM retrieves web service information on the first
   application thread invoking the web services.  This should be
   changed to application startup to avoid the overhead on this
   first application thread execution.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PROBLEM SUMMARY
   ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   
   ITCAM Agent for WebSphere v7.2 users who track web service
   applications on the Application health workspaces of ITM agent
   (kynagent).
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   The web service configuration was being determined at the time
   of first request.  This sometimes causes a performance issue as
   the application thread may hang for some time.  This fix removes
   this and determines the configuration of the web service at the
   JVM startup or application installation time on a
   non-application thread.
