APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you attempt to run the DBUpgrade command after migrating
   your environment, if the config file does not include the
   source version, the DBUpgrade command may not perform the
   bootstrap correctly due to the profiles being recognized as
   already being migrated.
   
   This will be fixed in the BPM857 2016.12 release
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the BootstrapProcessServerData command manually after the
   DBUpgrade.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that ensures the DBUpgrade script runs correctly if the
   source information not found in the configuration properties
   file is included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 2016.12
