Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After restarting WebSphere, when you log on to the DWE Administration Console, an error 500 displays. 

CAUSE
This error could be caused by one of the following issues: 

 1. The WebSphere JVM heap size is set too low. 
 2. The Generic JVM arguments are incorrect and produce a UTF-8 error. 
 3. The WebSphere Scheduler could have caused errors if a scheduled process was running during startup. 
 4. A classloader conflict between the DWE Administration Console application and the ISC. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this error, follow the steps that are listed below in order. 




Step 1. Increase the JVM heap size in the WebSphere Administrative Console. 

To increase the JVM heap size: 

 1. Login into the WebSphere Administrative Console. 
 2. In the navigation, select Servers > Application servers and click server1. 
 3. On the server1 properties page, select Server Infrastructure > Java and Process Management > Process Definition. 
 4. On the Process Management page, select Additional Properties > Java Virtual Machine. 
 5. On the Java Virtual Machine page, type 512 as the Initial heap size and 1024 as the Maximum Heap Size. Note: You can set the Maximum Heap Size to a higher value if needed. 
 6. Save your changes. 
 7. Restart WebSphere. 



Step 2. Rerun the DWE Administration Console Configuration Tool to restore the Generic JVM arguments. 

Before you rerun the Configuration Tool:  * You need to backup the metadata database before you rerun the Configuration Tool. 
 * Your metadata tables could contain deployed applications, schedules that you have created, etc. When you rerun the Configuration Tool, do not recreate the metadata tables or the information that you have created could be deleted. 


To check that the JVM settings in WebSphere are correct:  1. From the Websphere Administrative Console, select Servers > Application Servers > server1. 
 2. In the Server Infrastructure section, expand Java and Process Management. 
 3. Select Process Definition. 
 4. Select the Java Virtual Machine link. The Generic JVM arguments option is listed on this page. Check the settings. The original settings are as follows: -Dclient.encoding.override=UTF-8 -Ddefault.client.encoding=UTF-8



Step 3. If the previous two steps do not solve the problem, follow this step to resolve the problem. 
 * 

Step Action 1 . Copy the following jar files from the $DWE_INSTALL_PATH\DWEAdmin\lib\ directory to the $WAS_INSTALL_PATH\AppServer\systemApps\isclite.ear\ directory: 
commons-logging.jar 
log4j.jar 2. Restart WebSphere 3. Login to the DWE Administration Console
