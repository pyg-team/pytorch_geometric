PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to change hostname for an existing installation of Impact 7.1 Environment? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Step1 : Stop both Impact and GUI server.
Step2 : Update hostname on Impact host.
Step3 : In a Netcool/Impact split installation, you can have an Impact
Server server and a separate GUI Server server. If you need to change
the host name of the Impact Server server, enter the following command:
On the Impact Server server, run the nci_changehost script by entering
the command :$IMPACT_HOME/install/tools/nci_changehost

In a Netcool/Impact combined installation both the Impact Server and
the GUI Server are installed into the same home directory in the same
server. If you need to change the Impact Server host name, enter the
following command: On the server run the nci_changehost script, by
running the command : $IMPACT_HOME/install/tools/nci_changehost

Step4: Update following files with your new hostname:

/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/etc/NCI_wsadmin.props
/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/etc/nameserver.props
/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/etc/NCI_ImpactDB.ds

/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/install/build.properties
/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/install/buildimpact.properties
/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/install/buildgui.properties

/opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/wlp/usr/servers/NCI/apps/nameserver.war/WEB-INF/w
eb.xml

Step5 :Then start Impact Server and GUI server, and you need to do SSO
config again if SSO was configed.
