APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Channel errors are reported by the queue manager when a .NET
   client application running under non-multiplexed environment in
   WebSphere MQ v7.1, disconnects.
   
   The application successfully connects to the queue manager and
   processes messages. After closing the queues, a disconnect is
   issued. No errors are reported by the client.
   
   The disconnect causes errors CSQX209E and CSQX599E at z/OS end:
   
   +CSQX209E CSQXRESP Connection unexpectedly terminated
   126 channel SVRCONN.CHANNEL,
   126 connection 99.99.99.99)
   126 (queue manager )
   126 TRPTYPE=TCP RC=00000000
   +CSQX599E CSQXRESP Channel SVRCONN.CHANNEL ended abnormally
   
   If the client connects to a distributed queue manager, the
   error seen on distributed queue manager is as follows:
   
   AMQ9209: Connection to host 'xxxx(yyyy)' for channel
   SVRCONN.CHANNEL closed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of MQ 7.1 & 7.5 running .Net client applications in
   non-multiplexed mode on Windows are affected by this APAR.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Channel errors are reported by the queue manager when a .NET
   client application running under non-multiplexed environment
   in WebSphere MQ v7.1 or v7.5, disconnects.
   
   The application successfully connects to the queue manager and
   processes messages. After closing the queues, a disconnect is
   issued. No errors are reported by the client. Whereas the
   server side receives errors as the .Net client would not have
   completed the disconnect activity cleanly. The .Net client is
   supposed to send a close channel flow to the server to let the
   server know that it can end the channel. As the .Net client
   doesn't send across this flow to server, the server reports an
   error and doesn't end the channel cleanly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR addresses the disconnect activity from the .Net
   client side. As this was not being done cleanly which was
   resulting in channel errors on the server side, this fix alters
   the way in which the .Net client disconnects. The .Net client
   now sends the required close channel flow to the server so that
   the server can end the channel cleanly.
