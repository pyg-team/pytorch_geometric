Notes: 1. License Keys for Third-Party Software: In general, assistance with planning, ordering, and retrieving these keys should be pursued directly with the third party or an IBM Business Partner. 2. Showcase product license keys: Generating license keys for Showcase products is not handled by the IBM Global Support Center or the License Key Center. Showcase uses its own license key generator. PMRs that come in requesting license keys for Showcase products should be routed to the Showcase Client Care team at BACSR,19F. The Client Care team does not operate 24 hours a day. If the customer has Showcase v8 or above, they will need to provide their authorization code to Client Care. If the version is 7 or below, they will need to provide the model number, serial number, and user count. 3. Temporary License Keys: A temporary set of license keys may be issued in emergency circumstances. This service is limited to one time per serial number per year. If a second set of temporary license keys is needed, the customer will need to send an e-mail to RCHALPR@us.ibm.com stating the reason why a second temporary key should be granted as well as the customer's contact information, contract number (if known), company name, customer number, system serial number, processor group, product(s), and operating system release. It is possible that the temporary license key request may not be approved.
