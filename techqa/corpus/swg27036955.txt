ABSTRACT
 This topic describes the host and client software packages for the IBM PureData System for Analytics appliances on Fix Central. 

CONTENT
Users who have permission to access IBM PureData System for Analytics software can download Netezza Platform Software (NPS) clients and patches from IBM Fix Central (www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral]). Fix Central allows you to search, select, order, and download fixes to your system with a choice of delivery options. Fixes provide changes to your software, Licensed Internal Code, or machine code that fix known problems, add new function, and keep your appliance and its software operating efficiently.
