Title: IBM Does the PLS extension use weights? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm running the PLS extension command with weighted data, and am having trouble understanding how it handles weights. When my data are weighted, I see the following in my output:

Warning: This dataset is weighted, but the weight variable is ignored by this procedure. [This limitation may affect only the Beta version.]

In some cases I get the same results with and without weights applied, but in others they're different. What's happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the PLS regression is run, the weights are ignored. However, prior to the regression analysis, weights are rounded, and cases with weights that round to less than 1 (original weight values less than .5) are not used. A defect report has been filed with SPSS Development, requesting that weights be used or not used, as is the case in procedures, and that the warning message be appropriately updated or eliminated. We apologize for any resulting inconvenience
