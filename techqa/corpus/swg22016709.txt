REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix IBM Security AppScan Enterprise 9.0.3.x N/A Steps to download and replace JRE in IBM Security AppScan Enterprise: 
1. Download AppScanEnterprise-JavaSE-SDK-8.0.5.15-Windows from http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+AppScan+Enterprise+Edition&fixids=AppScanEnterprise-JavaSE-SDK-8.0.5.15-Windows&source=SAR [https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product%3Dibm%252FRational%252FRational%2BAppScan%2BEnterprise%2BEdition%26fixids%3DAppScanEnterprise-JavaSE-SDK-8.0.5.15-Windows%26source%3DSAR&data=02%7c01%7cnarasinga.m%40hcl.com%7c6b0e89f1381b49e2dc9b08d5c7b11fab%7c189de737c93a4f5a8b686f4ca9941912%7c0%7c0%7c636634485926973888&sdata=kd26K67lr786ejbR7Ak1tX79hJD%2BlnEF5D6IbTWFhzk%3D&reserved=0]
2. Steps to replace JRE:  * Unzip the downloaded JRE zip file to a directory. 
 * Stop the IBM Security AppScan Enterprise Server service from the Service Control Manager. 
 * Move%ASE_HOME%\java\jrefolder to backup folder. 
 * Move%ASE_HOME%\Liberty\jrefolder to backup folder. 
 * Copy the unzipped jre folder to%ASE_HOME%\java\ and %ASE_HOME%\Liberty\folders. 
 * Start the IBM Security AppScan Enterprise Server service from the Service Control Manager.


To verify if IBM Security AppScan Enterprise has JRE version to address above security vulnerabilities: - 
Open a command prompt 

Go to %ASE_HOME%\java\jre\bin folder 
Execute java -version 

Example Output:- 
java version "1.8.0_171" 
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 8.0.5.15 - pwi3280sr5fp15-20180502_01(SR5FP15)) 
IBM J9 VM (build 2.9, JRE 1.8.0 Windows Server 2012 R2 x86-32 20180425_385365 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled) 

If the output version is 8.0.5.15 or greater than 8.0.5.15, it implies that the JRE addresses these security vulnerabilities. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
