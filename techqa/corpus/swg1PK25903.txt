APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a problem with filtering/excluding classes.  Here is
   a brief description (using an example) of the problem.
   
   - In the BCM xml file, all com.ibm.* methods have been enabled.
   - In the DC configuration, com.ibm.* has been added into the
     Exclude list, filtering these methods back out.
   - In the DC configuration, we have put
     com.ibm.cyns.connector.* into the Exclude overrid list, so
     the net effect should be that you only see
     com.ibm.cyns.connector.* methods at level 3.
   
   No data gets into the Database.  However, when Occurrence traps
   are run that pick up methods matching "get", we see method
   traces from classes in the com.ibm.cyns.connector.* package.
   However, these traces are corrupted:
   depths jump around, like from +2 to -1.  This happens for 100%
   of the occurrences.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Level 3 performed some code changes, that may resolve
   the issue with negative depths for pmr 20047,724,724.
   There are two attached files - archiveagent.jar
   and octigate-was.ear
   
   To apply these changes you need to move 'archiveagent.jar'
   into <MS>/lib folder and redeploy WAS ITCAM_Application
   using 'octigate-was.ear'.
