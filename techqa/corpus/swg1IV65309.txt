APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a (sustained) flood condition the probe can not discard
   traps faster than they arrive  so rules file based  flood
   protection does not work.
   
   This may be partially mitigated by using  the DSALog and
   DSAPeriod properties to direct the probe to create log messages
   that record which traps are lost.
   While an operational question remains as to what to do with
   these logged traps,  at least there would be a record as to the
   fact they were dropped.
   
   Therefore, changes to the probe are probably required to address
    this issue.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Users need to upgrade to nco_p_mttrapd v19.0                 *
   ****************************************************************
   As a mitigation, the probe was enhanced to collect incoming trap
   statistics and identify event flood in probe.
   New property for the feature: TrapStat.
