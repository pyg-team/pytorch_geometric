 Creating a C++ struct and enum in Rose Classic C++ add-in 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
QUESTION:

How can a C++ struct or an enum be created in Rose Classic C++ add-in?

ANSWER:

To create a struct, create a new class and give the class the name for the struct. Then bring up the Class Specification and enter "struct" in the Stereotype. Then click on the C++ tab and enter the code for your struct in the ImplementationType property. 

To create a enum, create a new class and give the class the name for the enum. Then bring up the Class Specification and enter "enum" in the Stereotype. Then click on the C++ tab and enter the code for the enum in the ImplementationType property.

Generating code for the stereotyped class will produce a typedef in the .h file. The .cpp file will only have an "include" statement in it.

The code can be generated for all of the struct/enum definitions in one file and not generate the .cpp file. To do this create a Subprogam Specification in the Component View and assign it to all of the classes. When code is generated a warning will be given stating that the classes were not assigned to a module body (This is okay). All of the definitions will be in the same .h file. Note that the name of the .h file will be the name of the Subprogam Specification in the Component View and the name of the enum/struct will be the name of the class in the Logical View.
