PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You installed CICS Configuration Manager for z/OS (CICS CM) and are unable to reach the main ISPF menu panel. You receive message "realm not found". If you specify STGPROT=NO, you receive abend U4093 from Language Environment (LE). This occurs after you upgrade your operating system to a new release of z/OS. 

SYMPTOM
These are the messages you see in the log for the abend4093:
DFHDU0203I A transaction dump was taken for dumpcode: 4093, Dumpid: 1/0001.
DFHAC2236 Transaction CWBA Abend 4093 in program CCVWSSH term ????. Updates to local recoverable resources will be backed out.

You also tried use of EXECKEY=CICS and EXECKEY=USER, but the problem still occurred.


CAUSE
You upgraded your operating system from one level of z/OS to another without running the CEECCSD to upgrade the Language Environment (LE) definitions. This problem originally occurred after upgrading to z/OS V1.6, but it can also occur for other releases of z/OS if the LE definitions have changed.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The dump shows an AEYD [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/AExx_abend_codes/AEYD.html] on an EXEC CICS LOAD in CCVWSSH. The AEYD occurs because one of the output parameters is in key 8 storage while the program is running in USER Key (9). Storage protection is active.

An EXEC CICS LOAD is done from LE module CEECZLOD within LMOD CEEPLPKA. The argument list for this LOAD at x'1820B698' contains 7 parms:
188A9301 1820B808 1820B6B8 188A92D0 1820B40C 188A92D0 80072ACC

The AEYD occurs because 00072ACC, an output area for the command, is Key 8 (CICS) and yet the application is running Key 9 (USER). X'00072ACC' is in a page allocated to the SMSHRC24 SM subpool, also known as SHARED_CICS24.

The Kernel Error shows that DFHEIP (UQ89452) had an 0C4 abend at +x'B4E' as part of the AEYD process. This happens when it ensures all output parms passed from an application can be accessed (touched) in the Key of the application.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you upgrade your operating system, you must run DFHCSDUP [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.doc/dfha3/topics/dfha37d.html] UPGRADE [SCEESAMP(CEECCSD)]to upgrade the LE definitions. See Upgrading the CSD for CICS-supplied and other IBM-supplied resource definitions [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.migration.doc/dfheh/dfhe5_rdo_csd_upgrade.html] in the CICS Transaction Server information guide for details.

Verify that you have the latest version of the CEE Group defined to your CICS CM region - compare against the sample in CEE.SCEESAMP(CEECCSD). Also, ensure that the correct versions of CEE.SCEECICS and CEE.SCEERUN are specified in the CICS CM region JCL. In this case, CEE module CEEEV011 was not defined in the CICS CM Server region. If there are changes to be made to CEE, ensure that the CICS CM object definitions are restored to their distributed values prior to performing any verification.
