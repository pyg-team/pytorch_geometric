ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  no error message
   
   PROBLEM:
   In Maximo 7.5 you can set Display Options for a Result Set to
   display lines in different colors based on a condition.  As an
   example I have set up a query with the following workorder
   query:
   
   (siteid = 'BEDFORD')
   
   Any query can be used that pulls up multiple workorders.
   
   In this case the client is trying to find date values less than
   or equal to the current date using  :&datetime&
   This finds values less than today's date but not equal to
   today's date.
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE: na
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   On a Result Set setup in Start Center add a Display option
   using  column Reporteddate , using an expression of <=
   expression value of :&datetime&
   and a color value of red.
   
   As an example I have set up a query with the following workorder
   query:
   (siteid = 'BEDFORD')
   Any query can be used that pulls up multiple workorders.
   
   After adding the Result Set to the Start Center click on the
   Edit Portlet button on the portlet.
   
   From the Available Queries tab select the workorder query
   created in the step above.
   
   Then click on the Column Display tab and select the Reportdate
   and Wonum fields.
   
   Next click on the Display Options tab
   and enter REPORTDATE in the Condition Attribute field.
   
   Then click on "Add Color Alert" and for the Expression choose
   Less Than or Equal To (<=),for the Expression Value enter
   :&datetime& and for the color select red.
   
   To test this you can either create a new workorder so that the
   report date field defaults to today's date, or you can modify an
   existing record and change the report date to today's date in
   the workorder.
   
   Previous days values for reportdate will change to display
   in red but not when the reportdate is today's date.  The records
   that have a reportdate equal to today's date should also change
   color.
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT: Records with a report date equal to
   the current date do not change color as expected.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:  Records with report date equal to the current
   date should also change color.
