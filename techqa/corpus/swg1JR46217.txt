APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While trying to import metadata from Sybase server using the
   ODBC Connector in IA, the following error is thrown in the IA
   logs
   "Catalogue procedure SP_Pkeys cannot be run in a transaction."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This works fine while importing the Metadata using the ODBC
   Connector in the Datastage Designer. Import through data stage
   and shared meta data with IA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Trying to import metadata from Sybase in IA recieves error:
   "Catalogue procedure SP_Pkeys cannot be run in a transaction."
   The MDI using the ODBC Connector works fine through the
   Datastage Designer.
   This message is seen in the CAS logs
   <Message><![CDATA[ODBC function "SQLPrimaryKeys" reported:
   SQLSTATE = HY000:
   Native Error Code = 18,040: Msg = [IBM (DataDirect OEM)][ODBC
   Sybase Wire Protocol driver]
   [SQL Server]Catalog procedure 'sp_pkeys' can not be run in a
   transaction.]]></Message>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Since the Sybase Database does not allow calling of the Stored
   Procedure SQLPrimary Keys in a transaction, we should explicitly
   set the Auto Commit mode.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Import the Metadata using the Information Server Designer and
   share the Metadata
