CAUSE
The server was configured as a Windows Service.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If this was unintentional, create a new server profile that does not run the application as a Windows Service. 


Steps describing how to do this can be found in the Related URL section.

Alternatively, you can do the following:


 1. Open Windows Services Control Panel (Start > Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services).
    
    
 2. Look for the service name of WAS V6.1:
    
    "IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 - [service_name]".
    
    
 3. Open a command window and go to [RAD_Installation]\runtimes\base_v61\bin
    
    
 4. Run the command:
    
    WASService.exe -remove [service_name]
    
    You should see a message "Successfully removed service". 


Restart RAD and you should now be able to successfully start your WASv6.1.x server.
