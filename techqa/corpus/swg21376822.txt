information analyzer data source connection sql server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Information Analyzer is unable to connect to source database.

When trying to test the connection for Adding the Data Source in Information Analyzer, gets error: 

'Test connection failed' in the Connection Test Result display. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are able to successfully connect to Information Analyzer DataBase and other databases, check the following: 

 

 * Ensure the DSN definition for the data source is added to the .odbc.ini file


 * Ensure the DSN is included in the [ODBC Data Sources] section of the .odbc.ini file, for example: 
   
   MyDSNdef=DataDirect (database OS) Wire Protocol Driver 


 * Ensure you can successfully connect to the data source outside of the product. Please try running the example utility in the /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/branded_odbc/example directory.  Here are instructions for testing the connection using the example utility:
   
   1. Go to <path to>/branded_odbc/example on the server
   2. You should see example in that directory.
   3. Please ensure the following environment variables are set correctly:
   $ODBCINI points to the location of the .odbc.ini file
   *PATH points to the <path to>/branded_odbc/lib directory, refer to list below:
   $LIBPATH on AIX
   $SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX and HP Itanium
   $LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux (RedHat and SUSE) and Solaris
   4. Please run the example utility by typing ./example
   5. If you get to the SQL> prompt, then the connection was successful
   6. At the SQL> prompt, try to select the tables (this will indicate whether you can access the tables). 
   
   
    
   
   
 * For SQL Server databases, you can also try using the IP Address in the DSN definition for the Address= field in the .odbc.ini file, for example:  
   
   Address=<IP Address>,1433
