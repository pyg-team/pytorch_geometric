QUESTION
 Steps to do a silent configuration of the HT agent to monitor the Apache web server. 

ANSWER
To augment the documentation for the silent configuration [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDTFJ_7.1.0.2/com.ibm.itcamfad.doc_7101/itcam_j2ee_711_install/ch_config/silent_config.html] of the HT agent, I've included the steps here. If you want to see the GUI configuration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432428] for the HT agent, please see this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432428]. Or if you want to see a manual configuration, look at this technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22001710]. 

1. First you will need to create your own response file. You can find the sample HT silent config file in the samples dir, copy it to your /tmp directory and then modify it. I've attached here in this technote my very own silent config response file. You can copy that one, and change it to your own environment. 

2. After you create the response file you will first start/verify your Apache server is up and running. Otherwise, start the Apache server before you configure the HT agent. 

3. Start your HT silent configuration as follows, with the following command. You will get something similar to this output when you run the command.

4. If the HT agent is configured successfully, you will see the kht-httpd.conf file created, and the main httpd.conf file modified. See the screenshot below.

5. Restart your Apache Web Server and the HT agent. Then login to your TEPS and it should show up, see the screenshot below:

Note: If you want to see the GUI configuration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432428] for the HT agent, see this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21432428]. Or if you want to see a manual configuration [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22001710], please look at this technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22001710].
Attached here is my sample response file. Copy it to your /tmp directory, and modify it to suit your environment.
