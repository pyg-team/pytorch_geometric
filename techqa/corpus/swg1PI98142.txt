APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The number '2' is being converted into a '-' when running a
   (fully working) map from WTX 8.4.1.x using ITX 9.0.0.2.
   
   Input  ->  Output
   2054       -054
   5196       5196
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  ITXCQ - ITX00058885
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: Exporting / importing the input type tree then
   re-compiling the map resolves the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender customers who migrate type trees
   from earlier versions of the product
   
   Problem Description:
   Map compiled in 9.0.0.2 behaved incorrectly due to corrupted
   type tree; exporting and re-importing one of the type trees it
   referenced restored the correct behavior.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This behavior was caused by a function returning the incorrect
   length of data. The returned length has been corrected.
   
   Applies to:
   9.0.0.3
