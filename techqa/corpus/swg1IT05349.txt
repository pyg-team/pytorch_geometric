APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  User noticed that one of the IBM PureApplication Systems was
   generating an error message frequently:
   
   CWZIP3529E The Call Home request failed while attempting to add
     a note to service ticket null. The error message is:
     PrsNullPrsUriRefresh
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Many CWZIP3529E call home requests failure errors were being
   displayed on a PureApplication System. The events were displayed
   when a request did not contain a Problem Management Report (PMR)
   ticket number.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.0.0.1 to check for a PMR number and if it is not available
   continue processing as a local event instead of adding it to a
   service ticket.
