QUESTION
 PLAT: Compatibility of Internet Explorer (IE) 8 with Sterling Multi-Channel Fulfillment Solution 8.0. Is this browser version supported? 

ANSWER


Sterling Commerce supports browser versions MS Internet Explorer 6.0 SP2 and MS Internet Explorer 7.0 only.
This means that the systems and functional testing were done only on the listed versions for Sterling Application and Sterling Commerce recommends using only the supported versions.

IE 8 is not supported.

For further information: Refer product documentation Installation_Guide.pdf -> Section 2.5 Internet Browser and Plug-in requirements.

Note:
IE 8 is the latest version of internet explorer from Microsoft, and users might go ahead and update their system with IE 8.
A preliminary round of testing on IE 8 may indicate the Sterling application to be running fine, however Sterling Commerce does not recommend using IE 8 and will not be supporting any of the issues reported on the unsupported browser version.

Future Version:

We support IE8 in the 9.1 release. It will also support supported client browsers running on Windows 7.
