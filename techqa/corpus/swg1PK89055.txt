ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Microsoft Windows2003 Server
   WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment edition,

   Problem: The "Pretest existing pooled connections" value is

   -
   Problem Details:
   
   This is the panel where the setting is modified:
   
   Data sources > Default Datasource > WebSphere Application
   Server data source
   
   First, check the "Pretest existing pooled connections" and save
   the configuration. Then, bring up the panel again and change
   the "Minimum connections", and then bring up the panel again
   and see that Pretest existing pooled connections" is
   unchecked. The resource.xml file now shows
   testConnection="false" again.

   On the administrative console, under JDBC Providers >
   <provider> > Data Sources > <data source> > WebSphere
   Application Server data source properties, the checkbox for
   Pretest connections is sometimes cleared after loading the
   Connection Pool Properties or Advanced Connection Pool
   properties screens.
