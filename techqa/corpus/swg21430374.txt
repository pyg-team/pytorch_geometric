The preceding announcements stated that IBM would withdraw support for IBM WebSphere Application Server for Multi-platforms Version 6.0, IBM WebSphere Application Server for OS/400 Version 6.0, and IBM WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Version 6.0.1 on 30 September 2010. 

IBM HTTP Server Version 6.0 is part of the WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0 product and, therefore, has the same end of support date. However, IBM HTTP Server for z/OS Version 530 and IBM WebSphere HTTP Server for z/OS Versions 6.1 and 7.0, are not affected by this and are still within support. 

For the entire list of announced End of Support dates for all IBM WebSphere Application Server products, please see:  * Alphabetically listed products at IBM Software Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/index_w.html].


Support Extension Offering, if necessary: 
IBM WebSphere Application Server recognizes that there might be unique situations where a Client is not able to migrate to a supported product version prior to an End of Support date. Application Server may, at its discretion, extend customer technical support and defect support for a withdrawn release. Extended support for a product will be considered and provided on an individual Client basis. Information on how to pursue requesting and purchasing a Support Extension can be found in the IBM WebSphere Application Server Support Extension technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21298463]. 

Information about our expanded lifecycle support policy for our IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0 products, and later, can be found in Support Policy Change: Announcing the new "5 plus 3" support policy [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21256700].
