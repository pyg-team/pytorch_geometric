APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the name of the ITM installation directory name (CANDLEHOME)
   ends with 'n' or 't', those characters are truncated from the
   directory name. Here's an example where "/opt/itmagent" is
   truncated to "/opt/itmage":
   
     # ./install.sh
     INSTALL
   
     Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
     directory.
     [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]: /opt/itmagent
     "/opt/itmage" does not exist
     Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; "1" is default ]?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use silent installation instead of interactive installation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  install.sh truncates characters from installation directory name
   
   
   If the name of the installation directory (CANDLEHOME) ends with
   'n' or 't', those characters are truncated from the directory
   name.  Here's an example where "/opt/itmagent" is truncated to
   "/opt/itmage":
   
     # ./install.sh
     INSTALL
   
     Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
     directory.
     [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]: /opt/itmagent
   >>"/opt/itmage" does not exist
     Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; "1" is default ]?
   
   The same problem exists for the data directory name
   (CANDLEDATA).
   
   This problem occurs only for interactive installations on
   Linux/UNIX, and began with 6.30.05.00 (IV67523 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV67523]).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem code attempts to remove trailing white space,
   including newline (\n) and tab characters (\t).  The code was
   changed to properly remove the intended characters.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0006
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  a) Choose a directory name that doesn't end with 'n' or 't'.
   b) Use the installer in silent mode instead of interactive mode.
