ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 with Fixpack 1 installed on
   Windows or Macintosh operating systems.
   You work on Russian user interface language.
   You noticed that some shortcuts are missing on Russian graphical
   user interface language (GUI):
   
   - On Windows OS: Statistics 22 FP 1 GUI language Russian
   Syntax Editor Window: No shortcut for Run -> Selection on Syntax
   Editor
   For the Run Symbol you only see Ctrl+Unknown key code 0x41e
   
   For comparison on English GUI language the shortcut on menu Run
   -> Selection on Syntax Editor is Ctrl+R
   
   - On Macintosh Mavericks OS: Statistics 22 FP1 GUI language
   Russian
   No Shortcut for Run -> Selection on Syntax Editor as well
   
   For comparison on English GUI language the shortcut on menu Run
   -> Selection on Syntax Editor
   is CommandR for Statistics 22 FP1 on Macintosh
   
   2. Missing shortcuts on Data Editor for Russian GUI language
   
   - On Windows OS:  Statistics 22 FP 1 GUI language Russian
   On Data Editor -> File menu no shortcuts for File -> Save
   (instead you see Control + Unknown key code 0x421)
   and File -> Print (instead you see Ctrl + Unknown key code
   0x424)
   
   For comparison on English GUI for File -> Save the shortcut is
   Ctrl+S and for File -> Print the shortcut is Ctrl+P
   
   - On Macintosh 10.9.3 Mavericks OS
   Statistics 22 FP1 GUI language Russian
   On Data Editor -> File menu
   No shortcuts for
   File - Close,
   File - Save and
   File - Print (instead you see not any shortcuts for Close, Save
   and Print)
   
   Finally, it has been observed that accessing the Run menu via
   keyboard shortcuts will fail if your language UI is set to:
   English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Italian and
   Japanese.
   
   All other language settings work as expected.
