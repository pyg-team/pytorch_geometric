PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SI executes a SFTP Get service using parm "RemoteFilePattern" and the filename contains a wild card to pull all available files, the files are not retrieved and the BP hangs in Waiting_On_IO. This problem occurs attempting to get a file and the filename contains a space. When this situation occurs the SI SFTP Client log for the SFTP Get service will post error 'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.' 


SYMPTOM
The SFTP Client log during the SFTP Get post error 'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.'
