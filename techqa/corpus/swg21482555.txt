 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There is no toolbar menu in the SPSS Statistics Data Editor or Syntax Editor window and no Toolbars menu item in the View menu. I'm running SPSS Statistics on Windows. How can I get the toolbar? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please uninstall the application completely using Add/Remove Programs or via Programs and Features in the Control Panel, and then re-install. If you still have no toolbar item, please contact SPSS Technical Support. 

For versions 21.0 and later on both Windows and Macintosh, please see Technote 1640411 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411].
