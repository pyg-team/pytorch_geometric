Title: IBM How to set up Rule Execution Server Warm-up - United States

Text:
RES; caching; ruleset TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 First rule invocation is costly due to the round-trip to the database( to get the ruleApp ) and the ruleset parsing. Rule Execution Server Warm-up is the process to pre-cache in advance the versions of the ruleset that would be used. 
Depending of the application server used or the implementation this process might be inefficient. 

CAUSE
When the Rule Execution Server is called it receives as well the XOM classLoader (ThreadContextClassLoader), which is attached to the ruleset in the cache, this XOM classloader is used as a filter in the cache mechanism.

ANSWER
To use Rule Execution Server Warm-up you must always call the Rule Execution Server from the same point. 

Either your application, or a component within your application, in order to ensure that the classloader used is the same. If you have wrapped your RuleSession within a method, do call it from there, do not create another RuleSession to warm-up for instance. 
WebLogic for instance uses some special classloader when invoking WebService that 
changes the classloader signature.
