APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 needs to contain documentation on the
   ibm-entryuuid field as it relates to federated repositories.
   This field needs to be returned from the Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) server. It is part of the system
   attributes. The bind distinguished name (DN) must have read
   access to system attributes.

   The documentation needs to indicate that when you configure an
   LDAP server in a federated repository configuration, the LDAP
   administrator needs to ensure that read access privileges are
   set for the bind distinguished name (DN). These read access
   privileges allow access to the subtree of the base DN and
   ensure that user and group information is successfully
   searched.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuring Lightweight Directory Access Protocol in a
   federated repository configuration" topic has been updated to
   solve this problem. The following note has been added to step 8:
   Note: To create LDAP queries or to browse, an LDAP client must
   bind to the LDAP server using the distinguished name (DN) of
   an account that has the authority to search and read the
   values of LDAP attributes, such as user and group information.
   The LDAP administrator ensures that read access privileges are
   set for the bind DN. Read access privileges allow access to
   the subtree of the base DN and ensure that searches of user
   and group information are successful.
   
   The directory server provides an operational attribute in each
   directory entry. For example, the IBM Directory Server uses
   ibm-entryUuid as the operational attribute. The value of this
   attribute is a universally unique identifier (UUID), which is
   chosen automatically by the directory server when the entry is
   added. The value is expected to be unique: no other entry with
   the same or different name would have this same value.
   Directory clients can use this attribute to distinguish
   objects that are identified by a distinguished name or to
   locate an object after renaming. Ensure that the bind
   credentials have the authority to read this attribute.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the August
   2007 update to the information centers.
