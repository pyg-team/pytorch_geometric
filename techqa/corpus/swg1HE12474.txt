ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the ICC Interactive archiving feature, Outlook emails are
   being archived into P8 and declared records into IER. During
   some testing, we discovered if the same email is sent to
   multiple people and each declares the email to a different
   record category, only the first email archived is declared a
   record. We are attempting to alleviate this records
   shortcoming. Our goal is that one email sent to multiple people
   should be declared to each record category chosen by the users.
   When I opened a previous PMR on this issue (PMR 19801,756,000
   with Tyler Sky), it was recommended we use the ICC Script
   Connector feature and write code that modified the Hash so each
   email would be considered unique and not deduped. If each email
   was considered unique, it would be possible to declare the same
   email to different record categories. 2015-06-01T16:49:03Z

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The P8 Find Duplicate Email and P8 Archive Email tasks use a
   hash key to determine if an email has already been declared as a
    record. The hash key is calculated from the message content and
    headers and properties. Using the hash key ensures that an
   email message is only declared as a record once, even if
   multiple copies are processed. However, this means an email
   message can only be assigned to one record category.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.1.2, the duplicate hash
   key input expressions for the P8 Find Duplicate Email and P8
   Archive Email tasks can now be edited using the key combination
   Shift-Ctrl-H to launch the expression editor. When used in
   conjunction with a custom Script Connector task that
   recalculates the hash key, email messages can be declared as
   records in multiple record categories.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
