QUESTION
 How do I configure rack on the PAC server? Do I need to install xcat? 

ANSWER

You don't need to install xcat on PAC server. You can use the command #rackconfig to allocate the node.

Follow these steps to associate hosts with locations:
Steps
1. Associate hosts with locations on a rack or a chassis in a rack. If the location you specify for a host is already occupied, the system will prompt you of a conflict.
Associate a host with a location on a rack:

# rackconfig assign -m host_name -r rack_name [-s starting_unit][-u height][-y]

2. View the host that you associated with locations:

# rackconfig listhost [-r rack_name --noblade] [-c chassis_name] [-mhost_name,host_name,...]

Notes: From PAC10.2 we don't support #rackconfig command any more.
