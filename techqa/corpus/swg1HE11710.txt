APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Content Collector indexer for text search does not process
   certain Domino email documents that contained embedded MIME
   parts correctly. The generated XML output contains content that
   cannot be indexed by Net Search Extender and results in an
   indexing error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install IBM Content Manager 8.4.3 Fix Pack 3 which contains the
   latest version of the Oracle Outside In Technology filters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Oracle Outside In Technology filters that are used by the
   Content Collector indexer for text search do not process certain
   Domino email with embedded MIME parts correctly. The generated
   XML output cannot be indexed by Net Search Extender and results
   in an error during indexing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Content Collector 4.0 checks that the output
   from the Oracle Outside In Technology filters can be indexed.
   
   The Content Collector indexer for text search of IBM Content
   Collector 4.0 is applicable to all supported versions of
   IBM Content Collector and IBM CommonStore for Lotus Domino
   and IBM CommonStore for Microsoft Exchnage Server.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Update of OIT filters is required, provided by
   Content Manager 8.4.3 FP3.
