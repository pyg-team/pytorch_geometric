APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ v7.0.1 .NET application intermittently crashes
   after several hours runtime.
   The application crashes with error message "Access Violation
   at address FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"
   
   A First Failure report is generated with the following:
    Probe Id :- XC130031
    Component :- xehExceptionHandler
    UserID :- USER1
    Major Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC
    Probe Description :- AMQ6109: An internal WebSphere MQ error
   has occurred.
    Comment1 :- Access Violation at address FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF when
   reading
   
   Stack:
   xcsWaitThread
   ccxFreeConv
   reqFreeSess
   reqFreeConn
   rzstMQDISC
   tmzstMQDISC
   MQDISC
   
   Trace shows:
    System.AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write
   protected memory. This is often an indication that other
   memory is corrupt.
    at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.Native.MQDISC
    ...
    at IBM.WMQ.MQQueueManager.Disconnect()
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of MQ v7.0.1 .net client calling multiple
   connect/disconnect under high load.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A dot net client crashes with an access violation exception
   during disconnect with a stack trace as below:
   System.AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write
   protected memory. This is often an indication that other
   memory is corrupt.
      at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.Native.MQDISC(Int32& hConn, Int32&
   compCode, Int32& reason)
      at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.UnmanagedNmqiMQ.MQDISC(Phconn phconn,
   Int32& pCompCode, Int32& pReason)
      at IBM.WMQ.MQQueueManager.Disconnect()
   
   An FDC with probe ID XC130003 is generated reporting an access
   violation which causes the WebSphere MQ client application to
   crash. The client calls multiple connect and disconnect calls
   and sporadically encounters this exception under heavy load.
   
   The FDC has the following stack:
   
   MQQueueManager.Disconnect()1
   UnmanagedNmqiMQ.MQDISC(Phconn,out int,out int)
   MQDISC
   MQDISC
   reqFreeConn
   reqFreeSess
   ccxFreeConv
   xcsWaitThread
   xcsFFST
   
   This happens when the disconnect call is waiting for the
   receiver thread to end and the receiver thread is already ending
   and is waiting for a mutex which has been held by another
   thread.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix ensures that MQ checks to see if the thread is active
   before trying to close it in the xcsWaitThread method. Also
   the code change ensures that the thread locking the mutex
   required by the receive thread, performs its work without
   holding a lock on the mutex as its not required.
