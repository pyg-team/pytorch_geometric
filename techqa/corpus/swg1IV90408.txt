APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A customer sends some events and a synthetic event was created.
   but the stats(Times Fired,Times Fired in last month, last
   fired) were NOT being updated, ie: 0, 0, N/
   
   The reason for this is:
   There are delays in the statistics sometimes being updated.
   These are due to the time window during which the related event
   groups are open so that events can be correlated.
   
   The stats(Times Fired,etc) are updated only when Group Time to
   Live is expired.
   
   i.e:
   synthetic event is triggered
   action is done
   but the stats are calculated later.
   
   The following query shows:
   
   SELECT GROUPTTL FROM RELATEDEVENTS.RE_GROUPS WHERE GROUPNAME =
   'XXX';
   
   The GROUPTTL, was 82800000  milliseconds,( so 23 hours later.
   this is why the stats were not being seen to be updated)
   
   customer reduced GROUPTTL to 10 seconds  by running the
   following command.
   
   UPDATE RELATEDEVENTS.RE_GROUPS SET GROUPTTL = 10000 WHERE
   GROUPNAME = 'XXX';
   
   when the customer then executed more tests, the stats were then
   being updated.
   
   The reason for this is that the algorithm creates group time-to-
   live time based on the historical occurrences of the events.
   There is no default value for that and no best practices.
   
   As was seen the value could range from 1 minute anywhere 24
   hours.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To avoid the lag in having the policy 'RE_STARTPROCESSING'
   kicking in, reduce GROUPTTL value to 10 seconds
