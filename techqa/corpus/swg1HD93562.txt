ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario:
   
   In R19 Web Navigator, we are still able to perform some
   
   update, create links,....
   
   We tried to remove the visibility of these menus in Menu
   
   Editor at User level but it was not taken into account and
   
   the menu were still visible. We then removed these
   
   Menus from User level but we had the same behavior:
   
   menu were still displayed.
   
   We tried then to remove the visibility of these menu at
   
   System level but same result.
   
   So how can we remove Web Menus?
   Yes we are using ST Web Navigator and not Web Editor. The
   plan is to use
   Web Navigator for read only use and this is why we are
   removing some
   menus like "Open" menu that is not needed for read only use.
   Through
   Menu Editor we managed to remove some menus like "Open" menu
   in the Web
   menu section.
   But we are not able to remove the "Configuration Views" Menu.
   You can
   find the attached scenario.
   Scenario:
   1.Open ST Web
   2.Select a document
   3.You can select the Views ??? Configuration views Menu
   4.As this menu is not needed for the users, we want to remove
   it from Menu Editor
   5.Open Menu Editor and select User Profile ??? ST Web editor
   menu ??? Pulldown Menu
   6.Remove the ???Configuration View??? menu
   7.Open again ST Web
   8.The ???Configuration View??? menu is still here.
