APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deploy errors out with BIP2210E when Java or C user defined
   nodes are a part of sub flows. This is because the "Node" part
   of the name of the node tag in the CMF is missing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 and user defined
   nodes in sub flows.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Java and C user defined nodes are not working with deployable
   subflows because the "Node" part of the name of the node tag in
   the CMF is missing. This is happening when the msgflow is
   compiled to form the CMF in the API causing deploy errors.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that deployable
   subflows with Java or C user defined nodes deploy without any
   errors.
