Title: IBM Datacap does not display Unicode characters correctly when using MS SQL Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unicode characters are not displayed correctly in Datacap Studio and Taskmaster Web when using MS SQL Server. 

SYMPTOM
Arabic and Thai characters for Jobname or Taskname are displayed as "????????" in Datacap Studio and Taskmaster Web when MS SQL Server is used.


CAUSE
This is a known limitation of MS SQL Server, which applies to database attributes (such as user names, groups, shortcut names, task and job names, custom columns, and so on), but not to document text or data. 

MS SQL Server has a special requirement for using Unicode string constants. The NVARCHAR data stores ASCII characters and characters in the national language SQL Server is installed with. 
Other Unicode characters (which are not included in the national languages installed on the MS SQL Server) can be stored by use of prefix N. However, IBM Datacap does not implement these 'escape' characters. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the required national language on MS SQL Server. This allows the Admin DB objects to include non-ASCII characters in that language. 

For example, in this case, add Arabic and Thai languages in addition to the default languages to MS SQL server.
