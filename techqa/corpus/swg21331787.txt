Q: What happens if a font used during creation of a report is not available at run time? 

A: If a font used in creation is 
not available on the viewer's workstation, then the printer font substitution table is used (see settings, printers, properties) - for example, Helvetica is often substituted for Arial. The basic fonts installed are usually the 14 as listed above.
