Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx : ISM https monitor reports "SSL handshake failed" message - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 
ISM HTTPS monitor against an https target server reports "SSL handshake failed", but wget works. why? 

CAUSE

Possible cause is that the targeted web server SSL implementation predates the TLS
v1.2 standard, so it may not correctly handle a TLS 1.2 client connecting (like ISM client).
WGet may work because it isn't using tls v1.2 as its maximum protocol.


ANSWER
 

Try and disable tls v1.1 and tls v1.2 from ISM HTTPS monitor.

In order to do this, install these on your ISM agent, if not already in use

Install ISM 74 IF18
see its readme:
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400001898 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400001898]
(for reference, it includes IF13
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400001841 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400001841]
which includes
APAR IV56117: ISM MONITORS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DISABLE TLS 1.2 AND TLS
1.1 FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER CRYPTOGRAPHY IMPLEMENTATIONS)

Once ISM 74 IF18 is installed, set in https.props file the line :
SSLDisableTLS11 : 1

That disables TLS1.1 and TLS1.2

Recycle the ISM agent.
