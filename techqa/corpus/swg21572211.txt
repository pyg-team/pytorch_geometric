 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I manually failover the cluster management daemon (heartbeat)? 

ANSWER
In releases prior to NPS 4.5.3, the Netezza HA solution leveraged Red Hat Cluster Manager as the foundation for managing HA host systems. In NPS 4.5.3 and later, the Linux-HA solution uses different commands to manage the cluster. 

Because of these changes, the description of cluster management functions has also evolved. 

 * A failover is an automated event which is performed by the cluster manager without human intervention when it detects a failure case. 
 * A resource migration occurs when an administrator intentionally moves the resources to the standby.


For more information about cluster management, refer to the latest version of the IBM Netezza System Administratorâ€™s Guide. 

To perform a resource migration, run the following command: /nzlocal/scripts/heartbeat_admin.sh --migrate 

Note: Running this command will kill the shell you run it in, and close your connection to this host.

The following is sample output:
[root@NZ-80019-H1 scripts]# ./heartbeat_admin.sh --migrate
Testing DRBD communication channel...Done.
Checking DRBD state...Done. 

Migrating the NPS resource group from NZ-80019-H1 to NZ-80019-H2.............
Session terminated, killing shell.... ...killed.
[nz@NZ-80019-H1 ~]$ ......Complete.
