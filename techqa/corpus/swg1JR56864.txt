APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you have a client-side human service (CSHS) that has a date
   variable. Clicking any button that takes you away from the CSHS
   and calls an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) service fails
   and you see the following CWTBG0019E Java date format error even
   if the service does not do anything with the date:
   
   "Unexpected exception during execution. Exception information:
   ''0''. During execution of the API an unexpected exception
   occurred."
   
   The CSHS works fine if you run it as a stand-alone service but
   fails if you run it in the context of a business process
   definition (BPD).

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a CSHS used as a task has a date variable and the sequence
   flow heading into a service call has save enabled, the service
   call fails with an error. The service does not use the Date
   variable. However, the Date variable must have a value so that
   it can be saved in the execution context.
   
   Code retrieves the data after the CSHS is saved to update the
   inputs to the service. It expects each of the values to either
   be a TWObject or a Java primitive. For date variables the value
   is neither, as shown in the error message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that allows navigation away from CSHS containing a date
   variable.
