Title: IBM Monitor model deployment with remote CEI cannot create RMI connector - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you try to install a monitor model with remote Common Event Infrastructure (CEI) and security enabled, the Monitor Lifecyle Step "Select Monitor Model CEI options" fails with the error "ADMC0017E: Could not create an RMI connector to connect to host <remote_host_name> at port <port> due to insufficient or empty credentials." There is also a message in SystemOut saying that authentication failed when using LTPA keys. You might need to exchange the LTPA keys both ways. 

SYMPTOM
When you specify a remote CEI server (in Lifecycle Step 13 Select Monitor Model CEI options), the monitor model installation fails with messages similar to the following errors in the user interface:
ADMC0017E: Could not create an RMI connector to connect to host [remote_host_name] at port [Remote_RMI_port]
ErrorADMN0022E: Access is denied for the listModels operation on LifecycleServices MBean because of insufficient or empty credentials.

Messages similar to the following messages are found in the SystemOut.log file:
[7/20/10 13:44:50:807 EDT] 00000047 LTPAServerObj E SECJ0369E: Authentication failed when using LTPA. The exception is <null>.

[7/20/10 13:45:10:921 EDT] 00000034 J2EEContext E ASYN9999E: Unexpected Exception Occurred: com.ibm.websphere.asynchbeans.SerialDeserialException: Exception while deserializing a saved service. Service=security. Unable to deserialize the Subjects in this Context, cause: Validation of LTPA token failed due to invalid keys or token type.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Sometimes, in a cross-cell configuration, the LTPA keys must be exchanged both ways. 

 1. Export the LTPA keys from cell 1. 
 2. Import the LTPA keys from cell 1 into cell 2. 
 3. Export the LTPA keys from cell 2. 
 4. Import the LTPA keys from cell 2 into cell 1. 
 5. In a stand-alone environment, restart both servers. In a network deployment environment, restart both deployment managers.


See the WebSphere Business Monitor Information Center for information about sharing LTPA keys [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.sec.doc/sec/ltpa_cfg.html].
