QUESTION
 Do we need to resync or update our work areas after an upgrade of our Synergy database? 

ANSWER


If the database path to the upgraded Synergy database remains the same then the workareas require no updating. If the database path has changed , however, the workareas just need to be updated to "point to" the new database path. The "ccm work_area" command can be used to update the _ccmwaid.inf files.  The syntax is: 

 ccm wa |work_area /dbpath "old_database_path" 

 [/scope working|prep|shared|checkpoint|STATIC|ALL|DB] 

 [/p|/project] project_spec [project_spec...] 

 

 

 This command should be run from every client necessary to update all project workareas. The user running the command must have write permission and visibility to the workarea path. 

 

 For example, each developer would run the following command to update each of their working project's workarea path on their local client system: 

 

 ccm wa /dbpath "old_database_path" /scope working 

 

 Note: the ALL scope is useful only when user has write permission and visibility to all project workareas. 

 

 Also note: This command updates the _ccmwaid.inf file in each project workarea. Do not edit this file manually, because touching the timestamp of this file will cause CM Synergy to believe that the workarea is out of date and will require a sync.
