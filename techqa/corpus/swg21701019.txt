 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the GNU C Library that could lead to buffer overflows and local leakage of sensitive information.. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-2015-1472 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1472]
Description: GNU glibc is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by stdio-common/vfscanf.c. A remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100635] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)


CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
Description: GNU glibc could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the writing of DNS queries to random file descriptors under high load by the getaddrinfo() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/100647] for more information

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server version 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Fixes for these issues are currently only available in very recent releases of glibc, for which there is as yet no official Red Hat patch. Users who wish to mitigate this issue should download and apply glibc release 2.21 or later from the GNU web site [https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/].
