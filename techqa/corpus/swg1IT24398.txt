APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the XML Manager for the SFTP Poller fails to parse the
   list of files obtained from the polled directory,
   the error message might only be displayed in the default domain
   
   and be unexpectedly absent from the application domain.
   This might make it very difficult to determine the reason why
   the
   poller seems to be failing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set XML Manager for the SFTP Poller XML Parser value byte count
   limits to a higher level than the list of files from the polled
   directory (byte count) size.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In some cases when using the SFTP poller, useful error messages
   might unexpectedly be absent from the application domain of the
   poller.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.1.0.22, 7.2.0.19, 7.5.0.14, 7.5.1.13,
   7.5.2.13 and 7.6.0.6
