QUESTION
 Seeing Warning: W-UNK-000-000: Regexp does not match for EXTRACT operation on line ... messages in probe logs? 

CAUSE
As the message indicates, the regexp specified in the extract function does not match the variable value due to null value, etc.

ANSWER
 

When rules file specifies extract statements, depending on the regular expression, and the string value the probe rules file may generate warning message that are harmless. Once rules testing is finished, and if these warning messages need to be filtered out (not listed in the log file) from the log file, the following technique(s) can be used:

For example, if the rules file contains the following extract statements:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Resulting in the following error messages, making harder to read other issues with the probe rules: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Using the length function, the variable length can be verified before extracting via the IF statement to avoid these warning messages. Note the length(expression) returns the number of bytes in a string. 
 * 
 * 
 * 


More simpler way to avoid these warning msgs. may be using the setlog function. 

The setlog function sets the minimum level at which messages are logged during rules processing. By default, the level for logging is WARNING and above. 

The syntax is: setlog([ DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR | FATAL ]) 

For example, the following lines show a sequence of logging functions that are in the rules file: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


These statements will produces log output of: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The DEBUG level message is not logged, because the logging setting is set higher than DEBUG. The second WARNING level message is not logged, because the preceding setlog function has set the log level higher than WARNING. 

See Probe and Gateway Guide, and Probe rules file syntax for more information and see if you can use either of the above resolve the issue. For example, 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
