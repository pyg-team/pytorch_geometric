Text:
TPAEANYWHERE; DSRA0023E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DSRA0023E: The DataSource implementation class "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2ConnectionPoolDataSource" could not be found. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to Deploy Maximo Anywhere applications if the WorkLight server is down.


CAUSE
This is caused by an incorrect JDBC Provider or Data Source Configuration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
One reason this error can occur is when the DB2 JDBC driver doesn't exist in the location specified on the JDBC Provider, to check this follow the steps below.


1. Log into the WebSphere Console 

2. Expand Resources - > JDBC - > JDBC providers and click on Worklight JDBC Provider 

3. The Class Path box should be pointing to a Directory that contains the DB2 JDBC Driver. 

 

e.g 

F:\ibm\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\ctgAppSrv01\config\cells\ctgCell01\nodes\ctgNode01\servers\WorkLight\WorkLight-5.0\db2 

 

4. If this directory does not exist, create it and copy the db2jcc4.jar to the folder. 

5. Start the Worklight Server 

 

You can download the DB2 JDBC Driver for the document below.
