APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WCM breadcrumb doesn't match item location after moving item in
   custom workflow action (note: moving an item inside a custom
   action is not recommended and should be avoided where possible).
   Additionally, the libraryUuid property on the item node will be
   incorrect if the item is moved to a different library which
   causes the breadcrumb to display the the previous library
   location instead (even though the item itself is located within
   another library).
