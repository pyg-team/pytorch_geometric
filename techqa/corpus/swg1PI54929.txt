ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Android applications created using Apache Cordova that use a
   remote server contain a vulnerability where whitelist
   restrictions are not properly applied. Improperly crafted URIs
   could be used to circumvent the whitelist, allowing for the
   execution of non-whitelisted JavaScript.

   Cordova Announcement:
   CVE-2015-5256: Apache Cordova vulnerable to improper application
   of whitelist restrictions on Android
   
   Severity: Medium
   
   Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
   
   Versions Affected: Cordova Android 3.7.2 and earlier
   
   Description: Android applications created using Apache Cordova
   that use a remote server contain a vulnerability where whitelist
   restrictions are not properly applied. Improperly crafted URIs
   could be used to circumvent the whitelist, allowing for the
   execution of non-whitelisted Javascript.
   
   Upgrade path: Developers who are concerned about this should
   rebuild their applications with Cordova Android 4.1.1.
   Developers using remote content roots should also use SSL, as
   well as Content Source Policy to further mitigate this issue.

COMMENTS
 *  There is no iFix available for supported versions of MobileFirst
   Platform Foundation. Users can solve the issue by taking time to
   make sure good security measures in place that prevent
   redirection to improperly crafted URLs .
   
   The Cordova Whitelist does exactly what it is supposed to do.
   The problem is that it is not very smart to differentiate
   redirecting to an improperly crafted URL, so it could redirect
   to the bad URL. To prevent redirection to bad URLs, all of the
   allowed URLs must be explicitly added to the whitelist.
   Whitelist does not handle the wildcard '*' that well, so it is
   recommended to replace it with more specific URLs if possible.
   The whitelist will only protect specifically what you tell it
   to, so if you do add a wildcard, then it will allow any and all
   URLs that happen to have the same domain.
   
   Using CSP and SSL are other ways to mitigate the issue. These
   are important security measures that can easily be added to your
   application. More information on these and other recommended
   mitigation steps can be found here:
