APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is attempting to use DM release 4.1 with TBSM release
   1.5.  When a TEC event comes in the name field shows N/A
   instead of valid information.  Also if you look at the
   properties for this event, the TMR number (for the 1st instance
   of an endpoint) will be TMR_ (default).
   This apar is being taken to insure that TBSM will accept feeds
   from DM 4.1 withhout the need of a generic interface.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TBSM users with ITM 4.1 and above.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DM 3.7 and ITM 4.1/5.1 have a different *
   *                      architecture with regards to the slots  *
   *                      that they use in their TEC events,      *
   *                      therefore using ihstztec with an ITM    *
   *                      event did not result in a usable event  *
   *                      for TBSM.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Ihstztec needs to map the ITM slots to those used by DM inorder
   to provide acceptable information to TBSM.
