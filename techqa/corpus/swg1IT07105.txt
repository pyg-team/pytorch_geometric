ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM StoredIQ Knowledge Center documentation for the backup
   and restore of the StoredIQ data server system configuration is
   missing a step by step procedure. There are no details
   documented on how to perform this procedure
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the following procedure:
   
   To prepare for disaster recovery, you can back up the system
   configuration of a StoredIQ data server to a StoredIQ gateway
   server. This process backs up volume definitions, discovery
   export records, and data server settings. It does not back up
   infosets, data maps, or indexes.
   
   Before you begin the StoredIQ gateway must be manually
   configured to support this backup.
   
   To Backup the configuration follow these steps:
   1. Configure a working StoredIQ stack. (Data server, Gateway
   and Appstack).
   2. Go to the gateway. Login as util or issue the su util
   command as root.
   3. Select Appliance Tools -> OK -> Enable NFS Share for
   Gateway. Note that it should present a message saying 'checking
   exports'.
   4. Navigate to the data server in a browser using https://<data [https://<data]
   server name or IP address> and log in as admin
   5. Navigate to the Configuration -> Backup Configuration page
   and select the Start backup button
   6. Navigate to the Administration -> Dashboard page and check
   the "Event log" for the status information.
   7. If desired, navigate to the /deepfs/backup directory on the
   gateway server to examine the files created by the backup
   procedure.
   
   To Restore the configuration follow these steps:
   1. Build a new data server which will serve as the restore
   point for the backup. Use the same IP address and server name
   as the original data server. Ensure that the original server is
   shutdown and not on the network.
   2. Ensure the gateway still has it's NFS mount configured by
   completing (Steps 2 and 3) above.
   3. On the data server login as util or issue the su util
   command as root.
   4. Use Appliance Tools -> OK -> Restore Configuration From
   Backups
   5. Enter gateway server name or IP address and select Enter
   6. Provide the full system restore date or leave blank to
   restore the most recent backup
   7. Confirm the restore by Entering 'y' and selecting Enter.
   Options to go back or quit are also provided at this point.
