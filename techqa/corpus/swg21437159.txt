ANSWER
After upgrading to firmware 2.5, the LMI stops loading at "Waiting for the Java detector to start" and access to the administration web interface is prohibited. The problem occurs since Java 1.5 is running on your workstation. The web interface of firmware 2.5 is no longer compatible with Java 1.5. 

To resolve this issue, update your Java Runtime to the current version 1.6.
