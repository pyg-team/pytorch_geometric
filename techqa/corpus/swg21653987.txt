Title: IBM Action Script Relevance Question - United States

Text:
action operator task fixlet issuer TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I write an action statement that provides information about the operator who runs a task or fixlet on the client 

CAUSE
need to know which operator runs a task on a client

ANSWER
You could get the "action-issuer-name" from the "headers of action". Here is an example where the file __appendfile is created on the client when the task/fixlet is ran. It contains all the values of the headers:

Created a Custom Action:
delete __appendfile
appendfile {concatenation "%0d%0a" of (((name of it, value of it) of headers of action) as string)}

it created an __appendfile file with the following content:
