PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Currently, the IWS client product does not generate stubs with built-in support for the WSDL tag <soap:header>. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Currently, the IWS client product does not generate stubs with built-in support for the WSDL tag <soap:header>. If a programmer wants to set SOAP header data, they will need to use the some of the following APIs: 

The APIs would be as follows: 

o axiscStubCreateSOAPHeaderBlock()
o axiscHeaderBlockCreateStdAttribute()
o axiscHeaderBlockCreateImmediateChildBasicNode()
o axiscHeaderBlockCreateChildBasicNode() 
o axiscBasicNodeSetLocalName
o axiscBasicNodeSetValue() 
and so on.

These functions are prototyped in header files located in directory \QIBM\ProdData\OS\WebServices\V1\client\include\axis\. The files are as follows: 

o client/stub.h
o BasicNode.h 
o IHeaderBlock.h
