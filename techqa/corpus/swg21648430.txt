 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You work with IBM SPSS Client application which requires to be licensed. You would like to set up a redundant license environment at your site.
You open the Network License Administrator Guide.pdf for release 21 or 22 and go to chapter "Administering the Network License -> Setting up Redundant License Servers"
and see the following sentence:

'You will need a special authorization code to enable the redundancy feature. The authorization
code shipped with the software will not enable redundancy.'

However, you think this is confusing as only a special license code will enable redundant features, not the authorization code. Therefore you would like to have the sentence change to:

'You will need a special LICENSE code to enable the redundancy feature. The authorization
code shipped with the software will not enable redundancy as you need a LICENSE code.'

You think it should also be mentioned on this page that there is a difference between authorization code and license code. 

ANSWER
