Title: IBM Errorcode=-4470 when using a CLOB data type field for a Query Studio report that uses a dynamic query mode package and DB2 data source - United States

Text:
clob db2 dqm jdbc 4470 XQE-GEN-0005 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We have an IBM Cognos Query Studio report with a CLOB data type field using a dynamic query mode package. The data source for the report is DB2 10.5. When we run this report, it runs fine as HTML and fetches the records. If we uncheck the checkbox for "Automatically summarize detail values, suppressing duplicates" in the Advanced Options in Query Studio, and click BOTTOM to go to the last page of the report, then we get this error: XQE-GEN-0005 Found an internal error: [jcc][10120][11936][4.19.49] Invalid operation: Lob is closed. ERRORCODE=-4470, SQLState=NULL 

CAUSE
The error is due to using a CLOB data type field for the particular JDBC driver being used for the DB2 data source defined in Cognos Administration

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error can be resolved by adding this parameter "progressiveStreaming=2;" to the JDBC connection string for the DB2 data source defined in IBM Cognos Administration.
