APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have an web app that contains java classes that import
   packages from
   the eablib.jar and recjava.jar. I am targeting sever WAS 5.1.
   The
   properties->Java Buildpath->Libraries shows "JRE System Library
   [WebSphere v5.1 JRE]" and "WebSphere v5.1 Runtime" are in the
   classpath.
   
   When I expand the "WebSphere v5.1 Runtime" entry and view its
   jars,
   eablib.jar and recjava.jar are not listed, although they are in
   "C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\runtimes\base_v51\lib". I
   must
   explicitly use "Add External Jars..." to add the jar files to
   the
   buildpath.
   server targeting should add all jars in the lib and lib/ext
   directories to the build classpath.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a workaround is to add them manually
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SERVER TARGETING SHOULD ADD ALL JARS IN THE LIB AND LIB/EXT
   DIRE
   CTORIES TO THE BUILD CLASSPATH
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  All of the JAR files found in the WebSphere Application
   Server lib directory cannot be added but the eablib.jar and
   recjava.jar JAR files were included.
