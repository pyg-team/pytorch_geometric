Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Business Process Manager is vulnerable to open redirects, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-1159 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1159]
DESCRIPTION:IBM Business Process Manager could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122891 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122891]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
- IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.0.0 through V7.5.1.2 

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.0.0 through V8.0.1.3 

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.0 through V8.5.0.2 

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5.0 

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6.0 through V8.5.6.0 CF2 

- IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7.0 through V8.5.7.0 Cumulative Fix 2016.12 


Note: A fix for IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix (CF) 2017.03 is available even though IBM BPM V8.5.7 CF 2017.03 is not vulnerable to this security issue. The intention of this interim fix is to prevent the following unnecessary warning message in IBM Installation Manager, which you see when you upgrade IBM BPM: 

"One or more fixes will be uninstalled when IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> is updated to 8.5.7. CF2017.03. The update does not address issues that were resolved previously by the maintenance packages. The problems might return if fixes for the the following issues are not reapplied or have new fixes applied to prevent the problems from returning.
- JR57478 in the package IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> 8.5...
- JR57590 in the package IBM(R) Business Process Manager <Advanced | Standard | Express> 8.5..." 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Interim fix JR57478 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR57478] does not fix this vulnerability for releases 8.5.5 and later.

If JR57478 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR57478] is already installed, update it to interim fix JR58405 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR58405].
