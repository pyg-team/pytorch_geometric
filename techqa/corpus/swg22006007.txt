CAUSE
The currently defined "number of open files" limit is not sufficient to accommodate for the action.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the cds.log and review for the symptoms listed above. Too many open files is usually the core indicator.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Have the Linux admin increase the kernel value of ulimit -n. Begin with 6048.
