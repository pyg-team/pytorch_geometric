ABSTRACT
 You need help finding information for the Robotic Response Time (RRT) agent. What kind of information do you need? 

CONTENT
 

Robotic Response Time provides active monitoring of business transactions. These business transactions represent a complex set of steps typically performed by an end user to complete a business objective, such as logging in to an online banking application, checking an account balance, and transferring funds. This set of steps can be recorded and played back by using this agent to verify availability and performance. The agent is installed separately on various desktop and server systems in your enterprise and on the internet.

Monitoring can be completed from the start of a transaction and, because it is enabled to support Transaction Tracking API (TTAPI) and can be integrated into the Transaction Collector and Transaction Reporter functions, you can display end-to-end topology views of your robotic transactions as they flow through the system.

Robotic Response Time provides the following features:

_ Improved robotic monitoring with Rational Performance Tester.

_ Playback of scripts by using Rational Functional Tester against Windows applications, including 3270 applications.

_ Immediate playback of robotic scripts.

_ Monitoring causes of script failure by viewing actual screen captures and HTML data captures from failed playback sessions in Rational Performance Tester and Rational Functional Tester.

_ Monitoring the performance and availability of applications to detect problems before end-users experience them. It performs this monitoring by using robotic technology to record and play back transactions that determine if the transaction is performing as expected.
