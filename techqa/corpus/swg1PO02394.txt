PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  APAR PO02394 was included in release 6.0.5.4
   Please see release Notes:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27041715 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27041715]
   Previously, verification warnings (information messages) were
   raised when running in Deferred or Batch mode. These
   verification warnings are intended to be displayed to a user
   for informational purposes for online transactions but not for
   deferred or batch where they can never be displayed.
   Now, a configuration has been introduced that allows a customer
   to suppress the creation of verification warnings when running
   in a deferred or batch transaction.
   The new configuration property is:
   curam.miscapp.preventingVerificationWarningsInBatchOrDeferredPro
