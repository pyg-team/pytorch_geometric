CMB236E 080014 080058 RC=0208 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer was getting:



CMB236E - VPF BTVSMPGE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080014 ERROR 00000000

CMB236E - VPF BTVSMGSE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080058 ERROR 00000000



Customer eventually had to recycle the VSAM server and online started task to recover from the issue. 

SYMPTOM
Get messages:

CMB236E - VPF BTVSMPGE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080014 ERROR 00000000
CMB236E - VPF BTVSMGSE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080058 ERROR 00000000

Additionally it cause the CEZ started tasks to hang.


CAUSE
CMB236E - VPF BTVSMPGE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080014 ERROR 00000000 - indicates that there are "too many tasks wanting a VSAM Placeholder (PLH) control block concurrently".
CMB236E - VPF BTVSMGSE FAILED RC=0208 REASON 080058 ERROR 00000000 - unknown exactly what the issue is but it does have something to do with attempts to access a VSAM file is failing. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is recommended that for the 080014 reason code the customer could increase the RETRY parameter on the VSAM server EXEC statement. This parameter controls how many times task will attempt to open the desired resource. The default is 120. CEZ attempts the open once every second, so the default of 120 will be 2 minutes. The customer could increase and resolve the 080014 reason which might resolve the 080058.

But the bottom line is that when these two messages start coming out your VSAM file is probably already messed up and you won't get the started task to continue on. At this point you will need to recycle both the VSAM server and the online started task.
