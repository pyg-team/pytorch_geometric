Feature enhancements 

As part of this interim fix, the following new enhancements have been added:

 * You can now retain the "Fit to Width" and "Fit to Height" settings during the complete logon session. A user views an image in DajeaViewer, and selects "Fit To Height" or "Fit to Width" from action menu. The image is scaled to proper zoom level in viewer, and also the selected setting of zoom level will be held on during the complete user session, and take effect until the user logs out. The new selected setting is only stored in user session temporarily, and does not replace the existing zoom level in user settings, but if the user changed zoom level in user settings, the session setting is overwritten by user settings. This feature applies to the following clients:
   
    * Scan client (Daeja HTML Viewer or Local Viewer)
    * Verify client (Daeja HTML Viewer)
    * Classify client (Daeja HTML Viewer)
    * SpeedScan client (Daeja HTML Viewer)
    * SpeedIndex client (Daeja HTML Viewer)
   
   
 * You can switch between "Fit to Width" and "Fit to Height" in the user settings. A user can switch between "Fit to Width" and "Fit to Height" in the user settings. This setting applies to Scan, Verify, Classify, SpeedScan and SpeedIndex tabs with Daeja HTML Viewer and Local Rendering Viewer.
   
   
 * The keyboard shortcut for moving the image in viewer has been changed from "CTRL +ALT +P" to "CTRL + ALT + M".
