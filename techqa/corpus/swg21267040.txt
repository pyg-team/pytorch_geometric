QUESTION
 When using the IBM® DB2® Content Manager OnDemand Windows® Client, you might encounter display problems under different text fidelity modes. You might find that only "Draft" mode is acceptable. 

ANSWER
You can try turning off the "Fidelity" option in the ftdport2.ini file by setting it to zero, for example, Fidelity=0. This option is used to help determine what type of fidelity you require. The number is used as an average character length per line. The higher the number, the greater the tolerance for character placement. When you turn off the Fidelity option, the APF Viewer that OnDemand invokes to view AFP documents uses the same API as the API that is called for the Fidelity=Draft mode to determine line length. So if the report is displayed correctly only under "Draft" fidelity mode, you can turn off the "Fidelity" option to get a desired appearance under "Word" and "Line" fidelity modes. However, there is a limitation that "Character" fidelity might not get the same display as "Draft" mode even when you turn off the option.
