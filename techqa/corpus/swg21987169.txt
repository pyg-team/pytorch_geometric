Title: IBM InfoSphere Analyzer IAAdmin Error:  The reference to entity must end with the ';' delimiter - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running IAAdmin.sh command using xml file that has name parameter value in xml using patten like "THIS_IS_&YOUR_DQ_RULES_TEST"

For example:
IAAdmin.sh -user isadmin -password isadm_password -url https://yourservername.doman.com:yourport -runTasks -content /home/dsadm/test.xml

Generates error similar to below:

[Fatal Error] The reference to entity "YOUR_DQ_RULES_TEST" must end with the ';' delimiter.
Error: Invalid Request: The XML request passed as parameter could not be parsed for the following reason: The referenced to entity "YOUR_DQ_RULES_TEST" must end with the ';' delimiter. 

CAUSE
The problem is with ampersand('&') in the Information Analyzer project , column or other name specified. The '&' (ampersand) is a special character in XML, which needs to be escaped to work correctly. The XML parser is trying to resolve "THIS_IS_&YOUR_DQ_RULES_TEST" since it is followed by the ampersand causing the syntax error. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, wherever an ampersand character appears in the xml file add "amp;" (without quotes) , save the xml and then run IAAdmin command. So the xml should be changed as follows as an example before running the IAAdmin.sh command--add "amp" and semicolon ";" then rest of name.
