APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When users try to view any Requirement Change Details (which
   requires IE), there is complaint about the version of IE as well
   as error thrown by the DOORS change management ActiveX
   control:just a message that the browser is not supported and no
   RCR or requirement details are loaded onto the page. This
   happens using Internet Explorer 11.
   
   Looking at the code (Hit F12) in IE11, wheninitializeActiveX()
   thinks that the
   browser is not Internet Explorer, it returns (line 83).
   For some reason the browser is being reported as Netscape
   
   If you put a breakpoint in the script, reload the page, change
   the value of browser from Netscape to Microsoft Internet
   Explorer and continue, the RCR details load properly.
