   ****************************************************************
   When the Object Compare job compares large volumes of DDL ( for
   example over 2.5 millions of lines of DDL which included over
   20000 number of views) with mask option, DSNHDECP exceeded the
   maximum use count and an abend906-08 is observed:
   
   CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE DSNHDECP EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   CSV028I ABEND906-08
   
   An additional unrelated issue is found. When using a CCSID
   which can not be converted to CCSID=37, the compare program
   terminates with an ADB3318E error message:
   
   ADB3318E >program name<: could not convert characters from
   CCSID(>source CCSID<) to CCSID(37).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ONCODE problem has been resolved.
   
   The additional unrelated issue for message ADB3318E has been
   resolved.  Warning message ADB3318W will be issued instead of
   ADB3318E:
   
   ADB3318W >program name<: could not convert characters from
   CCSID(>source CCSID<) to CCSID(37).
   
   Explanation: The program could not convert the characters to
   CCSID(37).
   System action: Processing continues.
   User response: Use valid CCSID.
