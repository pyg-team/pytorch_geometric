PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why is it that sometimes when using tssub -I, it takes a lot of cycles before it actually starts? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When submitted using tssub -I, sometimes they take a lot of cycles before they actually start, sometimes more than 10.Adding an environment variable LSF_TS_LOGON_TIME that means the time to make a Windows Terminal Service session. In our old design, we hardly code it as 30 seconds. Actually, it should be configurable according to varying network environment.

If the environment variable is not set, inside of LSF,it is set as 30000 （millisecond）by default. If it is set as a very small value, the LSF might need to try multiple times before making a TS session with the TS server succefully, which will make the job wait very long time before it really runs. 300000 ms can work in most cases.
