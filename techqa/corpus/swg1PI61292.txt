APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a customer sets the C&DS Admistration Portal > Security >
   Cache Session Timeout value to 1 minute, it has been observed
   that only the Administration Portal will ask for the user to
   enter their C&DS login credentials again after the minute
   timeout has passed.
   
   Deployment Manager Client and Deployment Manager Browser
   continues the session as if there were no idle moments.
   
   According to documentation, by default all logins are cached. As
   long as there is no activity from the same session, the cache
   will be invalidated after this period passes.
   
   Current experience suggests that this is only applicable to the
   Admin Portal and that the same should be expected from DM
   Client and Predictive Browser.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This behaviour is functioning as designed. The setting 'Cache
   Session Timeout' is only applicable to the Deployment Manager
   Administration Portal (http://<host>:<port>/config).
   
   Deployment Manager Client uses session-less SOAP calls (user
   token is passed and authenticated with each SOAP call), and is
   not affected by this setting.
   
   The "cache session" would only apply to the thin clients (ie.
   PEA, PEB), however, there is a "ping back" feature in PEB that
   will keep the session alive, by design, so it can accommodate
   longer running jobs without timing out the session. Therefore,
   if the browser is open to PEB and is "pinging back" to the
   server (which is invisible to the user), it's possible that the
   session will not time out.
