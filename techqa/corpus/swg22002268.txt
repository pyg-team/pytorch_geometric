 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a vulnerability in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition Version 7 that is used by IBM Cognos Express. This issue was disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in July 2016. 

OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Cognos Express. IBM Cognos Express has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2000-1254 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2000-1254]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of C bitwise-shift operations that exceed the size of an expression by crypto/rsa/rsa_gen.c. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms and decrypt data.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113136 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113136] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2180 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-3485 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3485]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Networking component has no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 2.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115273 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115273] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by multiple memory leaks in t1_lib.c during session renegotiation. By sending an overly large OCSP Status Request extension, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
