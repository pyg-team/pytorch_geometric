APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  They have just started using Rhapsody again and they are
   receiving a large number of crashes. They are stating that it
   tends to occur once they add something to a diagram.
   The crashes have occurred during user interaction with various
   diagram types while using Rhapsody for Developer as well as well
   as Rhapsody for System Designer (developer components were
   installed on the machine).
   
   The Windows XP have 4GB of RAM and this is occurring for most
   users with this environment.
   There is another team that has 2GB that is not receiving any
   crashes.
   
   As for differences between the machines, our machines are
   installed from a common image with unique hardware
   configurations.  The crashes have occurred across multiple types
   of hardware.  The largest significant difference, as I had
   previously pointed out, was location on the network.  I have not
   heard a response from you on whether network communications can
   be a possible factor.
   
   The greatest software configuration differences on these
   machines is the presence of software development tools.  The
   machines that have crashed have slight uniquenesses across their
   configurations but really only differ from the stable machines
   in the presence of software development tools.  These tools are
   tools such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.  They are also unique
   in that they have other modeling tools installed including
   Artisan Studio and Enterprise Architect.
   
   Windows XP will support 4GB physical memory.  Each application
   also gets a 4GB virtual address space.  However, as MSDN points
   out:
   
   'Devices have to map their memory below 4 GB for compatibility
   with non-PAE-aware Windows releases. Therefore, if the system
   has 4GB of RAM, some of it is either disabled or is remapped
   above 4GB by the BIOS. If the memory is remapped, X64 Windows
   can use this memory. X86 client versions of Windows don't
   support physical memory above the 4GB mark, so they can't access
   these remapped regions.
   
   Page file is 4092 MB.  DEP is enabled only for essential Windows
   programs and services.  Memory usage is set to favor Programs vs
   System Cache.
