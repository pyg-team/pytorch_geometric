Title: IBM Workspace Dashboard does not show latest data - United States

Text:
workspace; refresh data; filter TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Created a workspace dashboard a few months ago where everything was working perfectly. Run the same report now and you aren't seeing the latest month of data. 

SYMPTOM
Showing incorrect data output as expected.


CAUSE
The root cause of the problem is that the queries used in the dashboard were from reports that already had query filters in place. The filters were selected when dragged in which prevents any new data from showing.

ENVIRONMENT
Any workspace environment.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution is to drag in the entire query into workspace and not set any filter. If the workspace dashboard requires a filter then create a filter within the dashboard itself. That dashboard filter will be dynamic and not pre-set based on the query you drag into the workspace.
