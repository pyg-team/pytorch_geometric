QUESTION
 How can I clear AMM event log when it gets full? 

CAUSE
This happens when too many events are logged in the AMM. This is a non-critical warning and when the event log is full, new events continue to be added while the oldest events in the log are deleted (FIFO)

ANSWER
The issue can be quickly fixed by clearing the event log. 
To do so you should collect AMM service data first and save it for future reference. 
To collect AMM service data, please run where X is the spa chassis number: 

/nz/kit/bin/adm/ibm_amm --loc=spaX.mm --service_data=/tmp/mm00X_sd.tgz 

Where X is spa number where the issue occurs. 
This script could take few minutes to finish. Once it is completed, move the file mm00X_sd.tgz to another directory then /tmp 
After that below command can be safely run and the event log should be cleared: 

ssh mm00X clearlog -T mm[1]

It may fail if the mm[1] is not primary. In that case you should use:

ssh mm00X clearlog -T mm[2]


To check if the warning was cleared you may use folowing command: 

ssh mm00X health -l 2 -f 

It should display: Ok.
