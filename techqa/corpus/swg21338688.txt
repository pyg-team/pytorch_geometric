Technote (troubleshooting) Problem(Abstract) How to setup an ODBC connection to Microsoft SQL Server from IBM Cognos ReportNet on UNIX [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21338688&amp;aid=1] Resolving the problem This can be accomplished using a Data Direct Driver. This driver is available from Data Direct.Make sure the following environment variables exist and point to correct locations.

>  a. ODBCINI - / /odbc.ini 

b. ODBCINSTINI - / /odbcinst.ini 

c. Correct Library Paths:

 For Solaris: LD_LIBRARY_PATH
For AIX: LIBPATH
For HPUX: SHLIB_PATH


Steps:1. Install a Data Direct Driver. Use Microsoft SQL Server 2000 with DataDirect Version 4.10 for Cognos ReportNet 1.1.

 2. Create a file in the home directory called .odbc.ini. A template .odbc.ini is provided where the ODBC driver is installed.

 3. Modify the file as required. Please see the following example:

>  [ODBC]
InstallDir=/isvdb/sql/datadirect
ConversionTableLocation=/opt/odbc/tables
UseCursorLib=0
InstallDir=/isv/teradata/6.2.0/odbc

[ODBC Data Sources]
GOSL=ivmsss18.so

[GOSL]
Driver=/isvdb/sql/datadirect/lib/ivmsss18.so
Description=DataDirect 4.10 SQL Server Wire Protocol
Database=GOSL
LogonID=sa
Password=sa
Address=10.70.11.243,1435
QuoteId=Yes
AnsiNPW=No


 4. Set the appropriate environment variables to point to <ODBC Driver Location>/lib:

>  For Solaris: LD_LIBRARY_PATH
For AIX: LIBPATH
For HPUX: SHLIB_PATH


 5. Set environment variable ODBCINI to point to the odbc.ini created in step 3, / odbc.ini:

 6. Set environment variable ODBCINSTINI to point to the odbcinst.ini in / odbcinst.ini:


 7. Restart the Cognos ReportNet services. (Note: There have been instances where a server reboot was necessary for the driver settings to take effect.)

 8. Within Cognos Connection, click Directory, Data Sources to define the connection

 9. Click New Data Source and provide a name. Click Next.

 10. Define the type as Microsoft Sequel Server (ODBC). Click Next.

 11. Define the ODBC data source using the name of the database provided in odbc.ini.

 12. Define a signon and click Next.

 13. Test the connection and if successful, click Finish.
