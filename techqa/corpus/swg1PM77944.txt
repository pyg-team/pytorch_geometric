APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Images that are inserting into a design field from the local
   file system (and not from an image component) are missing on
   the item after the server is restarted. The problem only
   affects locally inserted images within a virtual portal (the
   problem does not affect the default base portal).
   
   The following error will be seen in SystemOut.log when an
   attempt is made to retrieve the inserted images:
   ResourceServe W 8b099096-41c6-4cd6-86dd-32189768c6e6: Resource
   not found, 404 response returned.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Images that are inserting into a design field from the local
   file system (and not from an image component) are missing on the
   item after the server is restarted. The problem only affects
   locally inserted images within a virtual portal (the problem
   does not affect the default base portal).
   
   The following error will be seen in SystemOut.log when an
   attempt is made to retrieve the inserted images:
   ResourceServe W 8b099096-41c6-4cd6-86dd-32189768c6e6: Resource
   not found, 404 response returned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Locally uploaded images within a virtual portal scope were not
   saved and fetched correctly, causing the resources to be missing
   after a server restart.
   
   Note: After the fix is applied, any missing images will have to
   be manually repaired as the way in which the resources are being
   saved and retrieved within a virtual portal was modified.
