Title: IBM Configuring IBM Atlas Policy Suite to use Kerberos SSO for Oracle WebLogic Server - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 You can configure IBM Atlas Policy Suite and the IBM Employee Retention Portal to use Kerberos SSO for Oracle WebLogic Server to authenticate IBM Atlas Policy Suite users. 

CONTENT
You must complete two main tasks to configure IBM Atlas Policy Suite or the IBM Employee Retention Portal to use Kerberos SSO:


 1. Configure your SSO environment. 
 2. Configure and deploy IBM Atlas Policy Suite (PolicyAtlas) or the IBM Employee Portal (AtlasPortal) with Kerberos/SPNEGO.


Step 1: Configure your SSO environment

Before you configure single sign-on for SPNEGO/Kerberos for IBM Atlas Policy Suite, configure your environment for SPNEGO/Kerberos. See Configuring Single Sign-On with Microsoft Clients [http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/wls/SECMG/sso.htm#SECMG233] on the Oracle support site.

The Oracle documentation does not mention Google Chrome because that browser does not need to be configured for SPNEGO/Kerberos. 

 

Step 2: Configure and deploy IBM Atlas Policy Suite (PolicyAtlas) or the IBM Employee Portal (AtlasPortal) with Kerberos/SPNEGO or both

Procedure 

 1. Run the Atlas installation program. AtlasHome is the installation directory, for example, AtlasHome:C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\IBM_Atlas_Policy_Suite 
 2. Edit AtlasHome\Atlas\Properties\ssoConfig.properties and set the following properties:
    sso.enabled=true
    sso.type=KRB
    # LoginID or other column used as the Person identifier
    sso.column.name=LoginID 
 3. Open a command prompt or shell and set ANT_HOME environment variable to the Apache Ant included with WebLogic Server:
    For example: set ANT_HOME=C:\Oracle\Middleware\modules\org.apache.ant_1.7.1 
 4. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
    For example, set JAVA_HOME=C:\Oracle\Middleware\jdk160_29 
 5. Change to the AtlasHome directory, for example, cd AtlasHome


To Configure IBM Atlas Policy Suite for Kerberos: 

 1. Run the Ant command. Specify the buildfile option with a value of Atlas\setup\Weblogic\Kerberos\updateForKerberos.xml
    For example (in a Windows environment), "%ANT_HOME%\bin\ant" -buildfile Atlas\setup\Weblogic\Kerberos\updateForKerberos.xml 
 2. InstallAtlas\EAR\PolicyAtlas.ear with the WebLogic Server Administration Console. 
 3. Start the application.


To Configure the IBM Employee Portal for Kerberos: 

 1. Run the Ant command. Specify the buildfile option with a value of Portal\Kerberos\WebLogic\updateForKerberos.xml.
    For example (in a Linux environment), "%ANT_HOME%/bin/ant" -buildfile Portal/Kerberos/WebLogic/updateForKerberos.xml 
 2. Install Portal\Kerberos\WebLogic\AtlasPortal.ear with the WebLogic Server Administration Console. Important: Do not install the WAR file. Only the EAR file in this directory supports Kerberos. 
 3. Start the application.


Troubleshooting your deployment 


Problem 
You receive the this error message when you connect to the Policy Atlas URL: 

Unauthorized Page you cannot access this page because you do not have the required permissions. Contact your Atlas System Administrator.

Solution
The logged in Active Directory user must also be defined as an Atlas person. To check whether the Active Directory account is also defined as an Atlas person, open the IBM Atlas Policy Suite web client, click Admin > Persons, and ensure that the Active Directory account is also defined as an Atlas person.
