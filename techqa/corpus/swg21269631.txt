PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The only content type supported by IBM WebSphere Adapter for FlatFiles is text/xml. For other content types, for example Delimited, FixedWidth, or NameValue, you must provide custom data bindings. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the information on creating a custom data binding provided in Making the business object name optional for FixedWidth DataBindings in inbound and outbound scenarios of the Adapter for Flat Files. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21256263] The SampleDataBindings.zip file in the document contains the source files for Fixed Width data bindings that you can use to create your own data bindings.
