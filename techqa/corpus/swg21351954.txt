 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error:

Error Number -4:
DMS-F-BUGCHECK, An internal system failure has occurred during operation
'open result'.
Language_exec: Process 13 generated access violation; SQL Server is
terminating this process
DMS-E-CONNECTREJECT, A connection has been rejected by the remote interface
during operation 'open result'.
Unexpected EOF from SQL Server.
DMS-E-CONNECTREJECT, A connection has been rejected by the remote interface
during operation 'open result'.
Possible network error: Read from SQL Server failed.

when trying to run a query against MS SQLServer 6.5, native connection. A test connect in Database Definition is succesful. Simple queries work but any calculation or complex query results in the error. This may occur using a Impromptu 3.5 report which used to run in Impromptu 304 against tables and views. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Test this sql in WISQL, This may be caused by a view which has been used with a 'case' construct with other tables. If the case is commented out the query will run. This is not an Impromptu problem but is an error generated by the SQL Server Database. For further information contact Microsoft Support, they are aware of this issue.
