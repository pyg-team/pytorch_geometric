APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a webservice request node (HTTPRequest, SOAPRequest,
   SOAPAsyncRequest) is called and it needs to generate a default
   HTTPRequest header then it creates an extra HTTPRequest parser
   which is not released when the node finishes executing.
   The parser is not released until control returns to the input
   node of the flow.
   If a webservice request node is called repeatedly during the
   execution of a flow then this can look like a memory leak as it
   results in high memory usage which gets higher for each
   additional call to the request node.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker making repeated
   webservice request node calls in the same flow.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When a webservice request node (HTTPRequest, SOAPRequest,
   SOAPAsyncRequest) is called and it needs to generate a default
   HTTPRequest header then it creates an extra HTTPRequest parser
   which is not released when the node finishes executing.
   The parser is not released until control returns to the input
   node of the flow.
   If a webservice request node is called repeatedly during the
   execution of a flow then this can look like a memory leak as it
   results in high memory usage which gets higher for each
   additional call to the request node.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to create the new
   HTTPRequest header parser in the correct message group so that
   the memory is released when the execution of the node finishes
   instead of when the input node resumes control.
