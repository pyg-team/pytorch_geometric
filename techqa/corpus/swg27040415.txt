CONTENT
IBM has provided customers with a Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool where you can locate and find complete lists of supported operating systems, system requirements, prerequisites, and optional supported software for IBM Integration Bus versions, including IBM Integration Bus Retail Pack 1.0. 

The SPCR tool links to information about the minimum product levels that must be installed before opening a problem report with IBM Integration Bus Technical Support. The software versions and any maintenance levels listed in the tool have been explicitly verified as working. 

Please refer to the IBM Integration Bus Retail Pack README [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] for the latest information. 

Virtualization Environments 
Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by IBM Integration Bus. IBM will not undertake to troubleshoot issues which are caused solely as a result of running in a virtualized environment.

Please also refer to:
Server virtualization policy for IBM software [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/virtualization_policy.html]
