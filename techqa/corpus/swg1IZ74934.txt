ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   TAMIT 7.2
   
   Problem Description:
   With TAMIT 7.2 a new feature moving assets between GL accounts
   is provided. But when we are moving asset to a new site of
   different organization, GL account lookup does not show the GL
   account of the new organization.
   An asset is presently at Site SG (Organization: UOB-SG). We are
   moving to site Thai (Organization: UOB-Thai). But when I select
   'To Cost Center', the lookup still shows the values of  UOB-SG
   organization.
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue:
   1. Select an asset in site 'ALEXANDRA' (Organization : UOB-SG)
   2. Select 'Move/Modify Assets' menu option.
   3. In "To Site", select 'BK' (Organization: UOB-Thai)
   4. In "To Cost Center", click the lookup, it shows a list of GL
   Accounts from Organization UOB-SG, instead of the GL accouts
   from Organization = UOB-Thai.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When trying to move a single asset and  *
   *                      clicking the GL Account lookup button,  *
   *                      the resulting dialog is populated with  *
   *                      values of the 'from' site rather than   *
   *                      the 'to' site.                          *

   move assets shows wrong GL Accounts
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new class was created for 7201, 721, and 722 which extends
   GLNavigatorDialogBean.  It swaps site/newsite so the GL lookup
   dialog will populate with the correct values.  The new class is
   called TAMITGLNavigatorDialogBean.  There were also small hits
   to library.xml and tloam_pmp.xml.
