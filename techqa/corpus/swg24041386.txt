ABSTRACT
 This fix pack is a cumulative fix release and addresses APARs and internally found issues since the release of OMNIbus 8.1.0 fix pack 6. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following defect solutions are included in this release:


IV78818
The de-duplication trigger in the configuration for the default
multi-tier aggregation layer type ObjectServer has been modified
so that it will not alter the Severity of events that have been
suppressed by the ITNM root cause analysis (RCA) mechanism.


IV80092
An issue introduced in Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Fix Pack 4 meant
indexes were not used by triggers and procedures at all times.
This issue has now been fixed.


IV80567
In response to RFE request 81245, additional password checking
functionality has been added to the ObjectServer.
The additional checks allow an administrator to specify that
ObjectServer user passwords cannot contain the user name.
The checks are configured using the PasswordFormat property,
which now includes an additional <contains username> field to
control checks.
The default behavior is to allow passwords that contain the user
name. More information about the PasswordFormat property is
available in the IBM Knowledge Center.


IV80895
The JRE for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V8.1.0 was updated to IBM JRE
7.0 SR9 FP30 to address possible security issues.


IV81216
The Aggregation layer self-monitoring log file includes entries
for all alerts that it generates as well as those it receives
from both AGG_B and any Collection layer ObjectServers.
Previously it was ambiguous as to which ObjectServer the alerts
were coming from, with respect to the log messages. This fix
prepends the ServerName the alert was generated on to the log
file message to clarify this. Users who have V8.1 fix pack 6 or
older should apply the following file to address this APAR:

$OMNIHOME/etc/update81fp5to81fp7.sql

The Netcool administrator should review the contents of this file
before it is applied.


IV81225
The scope-based event grouping code in OMNIbus/extensions has
been extended with configurable properties that can be used to
set up the behavior as well as the look and feel of the resulting
event groups. The properties provide flexibility and also enable
the "one incident = one ticket" scenario. The properties are
stored in the master.properties table and can be modified
dynamically.

The properties include the following features:
- Propagate Acknowledged status, ticket number, owner UID and GID
to children
- Simplify the grouping to a single level for the more simple
use-cases
- Customize the look and feel of synthetic parent events
- Option to populate parent event Node field with Node of first
child received
- Propagate attributes of synthetic parent events down to their
children
- Propagate detail of priority child events up to the parent
event
- Roll up child event details into journal entries in the
synthetic parent
- Dismantle any groups that do not have the minimum number of
events

To upgrade scope-based event grouping to use the new properties,
see the instructions in the IBM Knowledge Center at
