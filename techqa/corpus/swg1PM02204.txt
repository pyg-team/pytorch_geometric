ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   ---------
   Loading DLL plugin adds note to Plugins.log file which is not de
   sired
   
   Description:
   -------------
   If we use DLL plug-in in Rhapsody, a file called Plugins.log is
    left                                       in the directory  wi
   th the project .rpy file with a message
   saying 'Failed to set codegen  callbacks in plugin XYZ.dll'.
   
   Since the log file is being appended, it grows  everytime the pr
   oject
   is opened with  Rhapsody.
   
   This message is added only with DLL plugins and not others.
   
   Example: TestConductor.dll in 7.2.1 and 7.4 also ends with such
   errors.
   
   Work around:
   ------------
   The example plug-in  works as expected and we can as workaround
   simply
   delete the  log file when shutting down my plug-in.
   
   Business Impact:
   ----------------
   Overhead to delete and file size keeps growing.
