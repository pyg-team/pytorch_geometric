Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Spectrum Control (formerly IBM Tivoli Storage Productivity Center) is affected by OpenSSL vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-3735, CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3737, CVE-2017-3738) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed August, November, and December 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL, used by IBM Spectrum Control (formerly Tivoli Storage Productivity Center), has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in multiple Oracle products could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and high availability impact.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
