PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The PCOMM documentation under "Host Access Class Library
   Automation Objects" section -
   (ref:
   https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQ5Y_12.0.0/com [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQ5Y_12.0.0/com]
   .ibm.pcomm.doc/books/html/host_access08.htm#usnot22)
   - mentions the following:
   
   PROFILE=<filename>: Names the Personal Communications
   workstation profile (.WS file), which contains the configuration
   information. This parameter is not optional; a profile name must
   be supplied. If the file name contains blanks the name must be
   enclosed in single quotation marks. The <filename> value may be
   either the profile name with no extension, the profile name with
   the .WS extension, or the fully qualified profile name path.
   
   However, when the <filename> contains blanks, the name must be
   enclosed in double quotation marks for StartConnection()
   function to work.
   
   PCOMM documentation to be updated as below:
   PROFILE=<filename>: Names the Personal Communications
   workstation profile (.WS file), which contains the configuration
   information. This parameter is not optional; a profile name must
   be supplied. If the file name contains blanks the name must be
   enclosed in double quotation marks. The <filename> value may be
   either the profile name with no extension, the profile name with
   the .WS extension, or the fully qualified profile name path.
   
   Above changes shall be effected in PDF help document as well:
