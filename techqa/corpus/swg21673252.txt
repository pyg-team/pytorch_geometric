Title: IBM PDF report progress bar intermittently hangs - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a report to PDF, the output's progress bad intermittently hangs. 

SYMPTOM
Example #1 

In one example, a large report is run as PDF with the run options set to e-mail a link to the report. When one of the recipients launches the link (so that it opens in the Adobe Reader plugin in their
browser) the progress bar stops moving and the PDF does not load.
If the PDF is downloaded to the local PC and launched in the reader client instead it works fine. 

 

 * Example #2


In another real-life case, in Cognos Connection the customer created pages with multiple tabs. Each tab pointed to a pre-executed report output. Outputs were saved in PDF format. When the end user tried to open these tabs (to view output), they could successfully see the output of (randomly) two or three tabs. However (after that) the outputs did not open - instead, the PDFs just hung (and the reports do not open). 


CAUSE
There are other possible causes for similar behaviour. 

 * See separate IBM Technote 1673565 (plus also #1672938 & #1671436) for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the cause is a defect (APAR PM86538) in Cognos BI 10.2. 
ENVIRONMENT
Problem affects early (unpatched) versions of Cognos BI 10.2. 

 
However, problem does not affect all environments. In one real-life customer case: 

 * Problem affected Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and IE9 
 * Problem did not affect Google Chrome.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade to either: 

 * IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2 Refresh Pack 1 
 * or IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2 Fix Pack 2
