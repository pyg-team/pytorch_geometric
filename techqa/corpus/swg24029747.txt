INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Download the archive file 7.0.0.3-TIV-XEforMsg-LA0001.tar and extract to a local directory where the MQ agent to be updated is installed. This step creates a directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems. 

==================================
Installing the fix on UNIX and Linux
==================================
1 Stop all running MQ agent instances by "itmcmd agent -o <instance> stop mq" commands. Use "ps -ef | grep kmq" on UNIX/Linux to ensure no running kmqagent processes.

2. Backup the original MQ agent binaries in <ITM_HOME>/<arch_code>/mq/bin directory. Note
- On Solaris and HP-itanium, only the kmqagent binary file requires to be updated. On all the other operating systems, kmqagent, kmqlocal and kmqremote are updated.
- <ITM_HOME> is the directory where your ITM components are installed.
- <arch_code> is the architecture code (such as aix523, sol283, hpi113). 

3. Replace with the same files in the tar. Note
- Directory Linux is for glibc 2.2.x while Linux3 is for glibc 2.3 and above for xSeries Linux.
- Directory ZLinux2 is for glibc 2.2.x while ZLinux is for glibc 2.3 and above for zSeries Linux
- Directory Plinux is for pSeries Linux which the glibc version should be higher than 2.3.

4. Restart MQ agent instances by "itmcmd agent -o <instance> start mq" commands. 

==================================
Installing the fix on Windows
==================================
1 Stop all running MQ agent instances from "Mange Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(MTEMS)" panel and ensure there are no kmqlocal or kmqagent process in task manager.

2. Backup the original MQ agent binaries(kmqagent.exe, kmqlocal.exe and kmqremote.exe) in <ITM_HOME>\tmaitm6 directory. 

3. Replaced with the same files in the Windows directory. If you have multiple MQ agent instances, copy kmqagent.exe, kmqlocal.exe and kmqremote.exe to kmqagent_<instance>.exe, kmqlocal_<instance>.exe and kmqremote_<instance>.exe respectively.
4. Restart MQ agent instances from the MTEMS.

==================================
Installing the fix on i5/OS
==================================
1. Open WebSphere MQ Monitoring menu running the following command from the i5/OS command line:
WRKOMAMQ

2. Select the option to stop the agent. 

3. Open the jobs menu by 'WRKACTJOB' command and make sure that the WebSphere MQ Monitoring agents are stopped.

4. Backup the KMQLIB/kmqagent.

5. On the Windows or UNIX system, use FTP to transfer the KMQ7003LA1.savf in the i5 directory in binary mode to the target i5/OS machine.

6. Create a library named KMQ7003LA1 on the i5/OS system and restore the objects directly into the production library. For example
RSTOBJ OBJ(*ALL) SAVLIB(KMQ7003LA1 ) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF({tmp_library}/KMQ7003LA1) MBROPT(*ALL) ALWOBJDIF(*ALL) RSTLIB(KMQLIB)

{tmp_library} is a temp library where the save file is stored at step 5.

7. Open the WebSphere MQ Monitoring menu by WRKOMAMQ and restart the agents.
