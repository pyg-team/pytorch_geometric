ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The PX Import Operatr (Sequential File stage) cannot read
   correctly a line with a Char/VarChar field containing a quoted
   terminator such a  carriage return if you are running on
   Windows.
   The Server job Sequential File stage has this ability with the
   column option "Contains Terminators".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   Terminators"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   PARALLEL JOB SEQUENTIAL FILE STAGE IS NOT ABLE TO HANDLE
   ACHAR/VARCHAR FIELD CONTAINING A RECORD TERMINATOR
   e created a parallel job (LKL_PORTALSERVICE_JM) that reads data
   from a .
   csv-file using an sequential file stage and loads the data to
   an oracle
   table.
   Some records of the csv file may contain fields with a word
   wrap, but
   the text in these fields have double quotes at the start and
   the end.
   Example:
   EVENT;"Kunden-Portal|Fahrzeuge|Fahrzeuge
   registrieren/vehicleRegistrationApplicationMailSuccess/<SPRACH_I
   D>
   - BTN vehicle-registration--application-mail-success--back";
   Fahrzeugregistrierung ;Validierungsfehler  Backend. Eingabe
   korrigieren;

   How can we import those records without throwing an error?
