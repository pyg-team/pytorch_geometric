APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When modifying a AAA Policy object that uses LTPA in the
   PostProcessing step, the undo feature may not work as expected.
   The change will be reverted, but the object will be down with
   an error about an invalid configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Reapply the object after running undo to bring the object back
   up.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected customers are those using a AAA policy configured with
   Generate LTPA Token in the PostProcessing step. The Undo
   function in the WebGUI causes the object to be marked down.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Undo now reverts the change and then the AAA object transitions
   back to op state up.
   
   The fix is available in 4.0.1.9 and 4.0.2.5.
