 How to run published Data Manager Jobs from Cognos Connection using different Databases ( Aliases) for the same catalog? 

ANSWER
How to run published Data Manager Jobs from Cognos Connection using different Databases ( Aliases) for the same catalog?
This will work only if you use a connection type “Cognos Data Source” in Cognos connection.
Then you can define many Database connections for the same data source and set the permissions for different users so user1 can access only DB definition1 and user2 can access only DB definition 2 
Now when user 1 will log on to Cognos connection and run the published Data Manager Jobs from Cognos connection DB Definition1 will be used and the same procedure for user2.

------------------------------------------------------------
Or define different signons for the connection in congos connection and use the new Variable: DM_DATASOURCE_CONNECTION_SIGNONS 

When using IBM Cognos Connection with multiple data source connections, this variable specifies the data source or data sources to use. 

The following example specifies, using a comma delimited list, that the data source details are /data source name/connection/signon name 

DM_DATASOURCE_CONNECTION_SIGNONS='/gosales/oracle/signon1',gosales/oracle/signon2,
gosales/sybase/signon1
