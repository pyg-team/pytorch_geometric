Text:
  A FIX IS AVAILABLE
IBM Security AppScan Enterprise v9.0 now available [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037004]



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Security AppScan Enterprise 8.8, when a job is created
   based upon an existing IBM Security AppScan Standard template
   (which uses an Action Based Login sequence) the scan may suspend
   with a message about being unable to login to the application.
   
   This is due to Internet Explorer having been configured to use
   Enhanced IE on the agent machine for the Service Account.  To
   work around the issue there are two possible workarounds to
   this, which both must be applied on the the Agent machine:
   - Add the target site to the Trusted Sites list under Tools ?
   Internet Options ? Security ? Trusted Sites ? Sites
   or
   - Disable Enhanced IE through Control Panels ? Administrative
   Tools ? Server Manager ? Configure IE ESC
   in order for the Action Based Login to succeed.

   AppScan Enterprise scans suspend when using Action Based
   Login scan templates
   
   The suspension was caused by the browser (IE) set to
   Enhanced Security mode which prevented the required actions
   for scanning.
   A proper error message will be logged if scanning cannot
   complete because IE is set in Enhanced Security Mode on the
   scanner machines.
   The Install of scanner agent would also produce a warning if
   IE Enhanced Security Mode is detected during the install.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 9.0 release of Appscan Enterprise
