ABSTRACT
 WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne version 6.0.2 has been updated. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne fix pack version 6.0.2.3 includes the following enhancement and fix.

Enhancement


Internal tracking number 95090: The adapter has been changed to allow a business function to be called multiple times within a JDE transaction. For example, a business function container business object can be created to call three business functions, BeginDoc, EditLine and EndDoc, as a JDE transaction. The adapter now allows for the EditLine business function to be called multiple times. Previously, the adapter allowed each business function to be called only once. 

Fix 

Internal tracking number 88458/APAR JR26315: The adapter only accepted dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY" for business function business objects and generated a JDEInvalidValueException exception for any other date format. The adapter has been changed to accept only the "YYYY-MM-DD" date format to match what is used for XML List business objects, which is also the common SDO date format.

PREREQUISITES
This fix pack should be installed on Version 6.0.2 of WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Note: If you are using WebSphere Integration Developer, upgrade the adapter using the WebSphere Integration Developer 602 (with the latest interim fix).

Install the fix by following these instructions:

1. Download the file for your operating system. 
2. Unzip the archive to a temporary location.
3. Run the appropriate setup file for the operating system and install it to the same folder that contains the RAR file from the 6.0.2 version of the adapter. 

To deploy adapters on AIX®, HP-UX, and Solaris platforms, generate new EAR files from the updated RAR file after applying the fix pack, using the enterprise service discovery wizard available with WebSphere Integration Developer on Windows® or Linux® platforms. The new EAR file can then be deployed to WebSphere Process Server on the respective platform.
