APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An application connecting in client mode may get an error
   MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED (2035) returned to it incorrectly.
   The error does not happen every time, and may occur when there
   is an increasing MQ workload.
   
   The following three messages are written in queue manager error
   log file when the application receives the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED:
   
   
   AMQ5534: User ID '' authentication failed
   and
   AMQ5542: The failed authentication check was caused by the queue
   manager
   CONNAUTH CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED) configuration.
   and
   AMQ9557: Queue Manager User ID initialization failed for '...'.
   
   The errors detailed above do not occur if Connection
   Authentication is disabled.
   
   MQ trace likely to show incorrect user IDs(e.g. blank user id or
   part of the user idn etc) during the failure.
   
   additional keywords: AUTHINFO CHCKLOCL
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disabling connection authentication and/or shared conversation
   likely to workaround this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using MQ client applications connecting to MQ v8 queue
   manager with SHARECNV > 1 and connection authentication enabled.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This problem occurred because the user id and password were not
   set up correctly when using shared conversation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  MQ has been modified to set up the user Id and password
   correctly when using shared conversation.
