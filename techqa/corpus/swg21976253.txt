 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When accessing Cognos Workspace Advanced a user is greeted with a blank metadata area and when switching to Toolbox this area is also blank. 

SYMPTOM
Missing options on right side, no options to create a new report otherwise. Could be perceived as javascript being stuck, no browser indications of this however.


CAUSE
There is a capability involved which is not enabled for the user.

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos BI 10.2.2 - any operating system

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Launch IBM Cognos Administration
2) Click on Security > Capabilities
3) Click on the Report Studio capability
4) Click on the arrow to the right of the "Create/Delete" capability and select "Set Properties"
5) Click on Permissions and look at the list of users/groups listed in this view. The user in question needs to be part of this list and have Execute and Traverse permissions granted on the capability.

Ensure also that the user has Execute and Traverse on the "Report Studio" capability.
