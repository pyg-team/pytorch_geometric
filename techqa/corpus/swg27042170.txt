IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile customers are encouraged to use the IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile RFE (Request for Enhancement) Community. [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rfe/?PROD_ID=997] 

RFEs are your way to tell the IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile team what features you would like to see in IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile.

With the IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile RFE Community you can collaborate with IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile development team and other product users through your ability to search, view, comment on, submit, and track RFEs.

Once a request is submitted, the IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile product team will review the request and provide status as a decision is made on the request. By default, each request is created as private, which means a customer can only see the requests they have submitted.

Before you submit a new request, please view requests that have already been submitted. If your idea has already been submitted, you can add comments to the existing request, thereby indicating your agreement with the idea. We may use this information to help prioritize development of new features. 

The RFE Community portal is intended for enhancement requests only. That is, it is limited to those cases where it is clear that the product is working as designed, but additional functionality is desired. It is not intended as a substitute for troubleshooting product issues or creating / submitting defects.
