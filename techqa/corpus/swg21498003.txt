ABSTRACT
 Collecting troubleshooting data for Caching with IBM速 Lotus Web Content Management速 7.0 expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. 

CONTENT
If you have already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal 7.0. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21444911] 

Web Content Management Cache specific MustGather information
Use this MustGather if you are having issues with the usage and function of the Web Content Management Caching features.


Questions I. Environment:
1. WebSphere Portal & Web Content Management version 
2. WebSphere Application Server version 
3. WebServer version and details 
4. Operating system name and version 
5. Database details and version

II. Detailed problem description:
1. Provide details on the type of WCM Cache implemented. Basic or Advanced web content caching. 
2. Detailed description of the problem and steps followed when the problem occurs. 
3. Details on enabling trace can be located in the WebSphere Portal Server Infocenter. Please enable trace with below trace settings. 


Manual collection of troubleshooting data I. Enabling trace logging 

Enable tracing during problem recreation in order to investigate the specific behavior of the component(s). Choose to enable either static or dynamic tracing and proceed with the steps accordingly. For further information regarding logging and tracing in the portal, refer to the System event logging [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/System_event_logging_wp7] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/trouble/pd_intr_logs.html] topic in the WebSphere Portal 7.0 Information Center. 

Option A: Enabling static (extended) tracing
Static tracing is the recommended method of capturing data, as it collects data from server startup until problem recreation. 

1. Log into the Integrated Solutions Console as the WebSphere Application Server administrator. 

2. Click Troubleshooting->Logs and Trace->WebSphere_Portal->Diagnostic Trace. 

3. On the Configuration tab, ensure Enable Log is selected. On this same tab, ensure you increase the Maximum File Size and and Maximum Number of Historical Files as needed to ensure that the tracing of the problem recreation is not overwritten due to the amount of traffic on the system and output of the tracing itself. 

4. Click Change Log Level Details and enter the following trace string: 

com.presence.connect.cache.*=finest:
com.presence.connect.business.*=finest:
com.aptrix.pluto.renderer.*=finest:
com.ibm.workplace.wcm.services.content.*=finest 
5. Click OK and save the changes. 
6. Restart the WebSphere_Portal application server. 

Option B: Enabling dynamic tracing 
Dynamic tracing can be used for situations that do not permit a server restart. 1. Log in as the Portal administrator. 

2. Click Administration->Portal Analysis->Enable Tracing. The Enable Tracing portlet appears. 

3. Type the required trace string into the field Append these trace settings: 

com.presence.connect.cache.*=finest:
com.presence.connect.business.*=finest:
com.aptrix.pluto.renderer.*=finest:
com.ibm.workplace.wcm.services.content.*=finest 
4. Click the Add icon. Enable Tracing updates the field Current trace settings. 

Note: Restarting WebSphere Portal will remove traces that were set by using the Enable Tracing Administration portlet. 

II. Collecting and submitting logs and configuration data 1. Reproduce the problem with traces enabled. Collect screenshots, userId, and timestamp information as appropriate. 

2. Run the following script from <WebSphere>/PortalServer/bin to collect the data: 

 * Windows: wpcollector.bat 
 * Linux/Unix/i: wpcollector.sh


Note: If you wish to use wpcollector to FTP the files to IBM Support, include the -Dpmr=<pmr_number> parameter to indicate the relevant PMR #. For example: wpcollector.bat -Dpmr=11111,222,333 

3. If you did not FTP your files via wpcollector, locate the "wp.mustgather.zip" file or the "<pmr #>-wp.mustgather-timestamp.zip" file in <wp_profile_root> [https://idoc2.swg.usma.ibm.com/portal/topic/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v70/reference/wpsdirstr.html#wpsdirstr__wp_profile_root]/filesForAutoPD/. Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]. 
III. Manual File Collection

If you do not use the wpcollector tool in step II above to collect files, please collect and send the following files manually after recreating the problem with trace enabled. 

 * <WP_profile>/PortalServer/WCM/Shared/App/Config/WCMservices/WCMConfigService.properties 
 * Entire contents of the <wp_profile_root>/logs/<server_name> directory after the traces have been collected including: 
   SystemOut.log
   SystemErr.log
   native_stderr.log
   native_stdout.log
   VersionInfo.log
   trace.log 


Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571].
