Title: IBM Inbound component of Siebel Adapter stops working after the number of event entries passes 10,000 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Siebel inbound stops polling and throws some exception. 

SYMPTOM
The following error message displays: 

There were more rows than could be returned. Please refine your query to bring back fewer rows


CAUSE
The Siebel Adapter use Siebel API to access the event table. The possible cause for this issue is:


 * You performed a query or search which is trying to return more rows than is allowed in a result set. 
 * MaxFetchArraySize or MaxCursorSize parameter values may be set too low. 
 * Maximum Cursor Size property may be set too low for a specific business component.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Following is corrective action you can take: 


1. Modify your query or search specification to return fewer rows in the result set. If not user initiated, check any running workflows, scripts, EAI, charts, or reports that may be executing the query. 

2. Increase the rows allowed in your result set by modifying the value of MaxFetchArraySize or MaxCursorSize. This will affect the entire Siebel application. For MaxFetchArraySize, values are:
-9,999 (number of rows)
0 (10,000 rows)
-1 (unlimited rows)

For instructions on the MaxFetchArraySize parameter, refer to Siebel Bookshelf version 7.5.3 > Siebel Object Interfaces Reference > Interfaces Reference > Business component Methods > Execute Query. For instructions on the MaxCursorSize parameter, refer to Siebel Bookshelf version 7.5.3 > Siebel Web Client Administration > Configuration Parameters > Data Source Parameters. 

Caution: Setting DSMaxFetchArraySize to -1 may cause large memory use, growth of the Siebel Object Manager process, and the Siebel Object Manager to crash from memory exhaustion. Refer to Alert 951 for additional information.

3. Increase the number of records requested for a specific business component by modifying the values of Maximum Cursor Size property for the specific business component. This will only affect operations performed on the specific business component. For instructions on how to set the Maximum Cursor Size property in Siebel Tools, refer to Siebel Bookshelf version 7.5.3 > Object Types Reference > Siebel Object Types.
