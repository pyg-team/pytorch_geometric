QUESTION
 How to assign a value containing a reserved XML character in process data? 

CAUSE
When editing bpml with the Business Process manager and entering a value containing an XML reserved character (like the ampersand, "&") to a process data element, 
the business process fails to validate, the error varies depending on the character used.

Error for the ampersand example:

Validation Error
Line Number : 3
Column Number : 49
Validation Message : The reference to entity "RV" must end with the ';' delimiter.

Error for the less-than character (<)

Validation Error
Line Number : 3
Column Number : 68
Validation Message : Element type "MT" must be followed by either attribute specifications, ">" or "/>".

ANSWER
Some XML reserved characters cannot be entered directly in the BPML. The reserved characters need to be replaced by their XML entity representation. 

For example the entity representation for the ampersand is &amp; and the entity representation for the < character is &lt;

The Graphic Process Modeler (GPM) will automatically convert the characters but if the bpml editor is used, then the characters will need to entered using the XML entity values.

Example assign that fails validation:

<assign to="test">test&RVrequal<MTanotherTest</assign>

Example of corrected version of above assign:

<assign to="test">test&amp;RVrequal&lt;MTanotherTest</assign>
