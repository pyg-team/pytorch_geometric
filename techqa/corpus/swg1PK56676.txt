APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 needs to be clarified as it relates to starting
   a profile as a Microsoft Windows service.
   
   During the creation of profile in 6.0.X the user will get a
   option at the "Windows service definition" step to select
   startup type with "Manual, Automatic or Disabled"
   
   In WebSphere Application Server V6.1, the default
   value for the Windows Service is automatic. This information
   is explained in the "Default values for the Windows Service"
   section of the following topics:
   -"Creating an application server profile"
   (tpro_instancessaappserv)
   -"Creating a deployment manager profile" (tpro_instancesdmgr)
   -"Creating a cell profile" (tpro_instancescell)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the startup type to "manual" in the Windows Services
   panel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects users who are creating a   *
   *                 cell profile, a deployment manager           *
   *                 profile, or an application server profile    *
   *                 using the Profile Management tool, and       *
   *                 wanting to run the resulting process as a    *
   *                 Microsoft Windows service. This APAR         *
   *                 applies to WebSphere Application Server      *
   *                 Version 6.1.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The documentation does not provide      *
   *                      information on changing the default     *
   *                      startup type for the Windows service    *
   *                      from automatic to another value.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The documentation for "Creating a deployment manager profile",
   "Creating a cell profile", and "Creating an application server
   profile" in the section on the Windows service defaults says
   "The startup type is automatic. The values for the startup
   type are those values that the Windows operating system
   imposes." However, the documentation does not tell the user
   how to change the startup type.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following information has been appended to "Creating a
   deployment manager profile", "Creating a cell profile", and
   "Creating an application server profile" topics:
   "If you want a startup type other than automatic, you can
   either select another available option from the drop down list
   or change the startup type after you create the profile. You
   can also remove the created service after profile creation,
   and add it later with the desired startup type. You can choose
   not to create a service at profile creation time and
   optionally create it later with the desired startup type."
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the March 2008
   update to the information centers.
