Title: IBM Uninstall WebSphere MQ Client jar files from IBM Sterling B2B Integrator - United States

Text:

QUESTION
 When you install WebSphere MQ (WMQ) Client jar files to IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI) there might be unexpected behaviour due to already installed WMQ Client jar files in a different version.
How can this be avoided? 

CAUSE
Multiple versions of WMQ Client jars files installed and loaded at the same time may cause incompatibility issues.

ANSWER
Remove previously installed WebSphere MQ Client prior to install new jar files. 

For this, proceed as follows: 

 1.  Make a backup of <si-install>/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg (e.g. to <si-install>/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg.<timestamp>) 
 2.  Make a backup of <si-install>/jar (e.g. to <si-install>/tmp/jar.<timestamp>) 
 3.  Open <si-install>/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg and 
 4.  Locate all references to jar files that are WebSphere MQ related (do not change the file dynamicclasspath.cfg manually as this is a generated file) 
 5.  Ensure that the list of found WMQ Client jars does not contain jar files that are related to other message queueing products like Active MQ or WMQ FTE; files for ActiveMQ, WebSphere MQ FTE etc. may not be removed in this procedure 
 6.  A valid selection of WMQ Client jar files may be for example all jar files that are in the folder that also contains com.ibm.mq.jar 
 7.  The full path filename is build up with the pattern <si-install>/jar/<Name>/<Version>/<file>.jar 
 8.  To uninstall the selected WMQ Client jar files change on command line to the folder <si-install>/bin and execute:  * on Linux/UNIX:
        ./install3rdParty.sh <Name> <Version> -j <si-install>/jar/<Name>/<Version>/*.jar -uninstall 
      * on Windows:
        install3rdParty.cmd <Name> <Version> -j <si-install>\jar\<Name>\<Version>\*.jar -uninstall
     
     
 9.  Verify that the uninstalled WMQ Client jar files are no longer listed in <si-install>/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg 
 10. Verify that no other version of WMQ Client jar files are installed (check <si-install>/properties/dynamicclasspath.cfg) â†’ restart at step 4. if needed 
 11. Now you may install the WMQ Client jar files in the desired version (see IBM Technote "How to get and install new WebSphere MQ Client jar files for Sterling B2B Integrator" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21670087])
