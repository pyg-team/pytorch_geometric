Additional notes:  IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8 is the latest release, which is compatible with Oracle Java SE 8 application programming interfaces. This release is updated on a monthly basis to include any new enhancements and IBM fixes to the code base. Oracle CPUs are included in the refresh that follows the Oracle quarterly CPU schedule, which is outlined in the following bulletin [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html]. Quarterly updates of this version will be marked either as a service refresh level or as a fix pack level that ends in a 5 or 0. For example, the next quarterly update will be marked as Version 8, service refresh 4, fix pack 5. 

All earlier supported versions of the IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition are updated on a quarterly basis in line with Oracle's CPU schedule.
