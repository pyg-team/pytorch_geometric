PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Due to variations in browser rendering capabilities unique to each environment, you might see a noticeable slowdown in browser performance when using the Web interface to view a WS-Proxy configuration containing multiple WSDLs. 

CAUSE
 This slowdown is due to the time required to render multiple WSDLs in certain browsers. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To minimize the impact of this issue, consider creating additional WS-Proxies to reduce the number of WSDLs per proxy. 

NOTE: Firmware 3.8.1+ improved WebGUI performance in the Web Service Proxy configuration when populated with a large number of WSDL files.
