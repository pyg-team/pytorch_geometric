The HMC V7 Recovery DVDs perform a full installation of the Hardware Management Console. You can perform installation or upgrade tasks by using the Recovery media alone, or by upgrading to or installing HMC V7 over the network. (The recovery media are not always needed for network installation.)

For additional information, including enhancements and fixes, and known issues with HMC Version 7 releases, please refer to one of the following Readme documents.

PREREQUISITE TASKS
 1. Order the appropriate set of HMC V7 Recovery DVDs online from Fix Central [//www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral] (recommended). Alternately, you can download the ISO images for the HMC V7 Recovery package from Fix Central, and then create DVDs from these ISO images by using your favorite method to create DVDs.
 2. The HMC V7 package consists of two or more Recovery DVDs. It is highly recommended that you obtain this media from IBM. If you wish to download the ISO images and burn your own DVDs, please make sure high-quality, single-layer, DVD-R media is used. Do not use DVD+R or DVD-RW.
 3. Review the following notes carefully:
    Notes:
     1. Because the HMC is a closed system, you cannot download the ISO files onto the HMC. There are no utilities available to burn DVD media on the HMC.
     2. The combined size of these two files is greater than 1 Gigabyte. If you are downloading these files to a server, please make sure that the operating system can handle files of this size. For UNIX systems, use the ulimit command to check the file size limit, and then change it, if necessary. Do not use the browser on the HMC to download the file onto the HMC. The download and save functions on the HMC's browser are disabled.
     3. You must perform a Save Upgrade Data task to preserve information on the HMC before upgrading to HMC V7. There is no Corrective Service to update the HMC to HMC V7 from any Version lower than HMC V7. You must upgrade immediately after the Save Upgrade Data task. If you restart the HMC again without doing the upgrade, you will need to log in and run the Save Upgrade Data task again, before you perform the Upgrade.
