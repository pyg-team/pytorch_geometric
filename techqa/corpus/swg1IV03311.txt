ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer added WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION to be visible
   on the
   VIEWSR Log section since v7.1.1.5.
   Since upgrading to v7.1.1.7, when Adding a Log entry and
   pressing enter
   in the
   WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION field on the Update Service
   Request
   Log dialog box, the
   WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION field on the Log section is
   displayed mis-shapen.
   
   Steps to replicate:
   
   1. Add the following section to the viewsr presentation.xml
   
   
    <tablecol id="log_tablebody_4"
   dataattribute="description_longdescription" type="link"
   mxevent="selectlog" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" />
   
    <table id="log" inputmode="readonly" label="Log"
   description="Comments
   can be added by clicking the Update Service Request button."
   relationship="WORKLOG"
   beanclass="psdi.webclient.beans.common.WorkLogBean"
   orderby="createdate
   desc" >
               <tablebody id="log_tablebody" filterable="false"
   displayrowsperpage="5" filterexpanded="false" >
                 <tablecol id="log_tablebody_2"
   dataattribute="createby"
   type="link" mxevent="selectlog" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" />
                 <tablecol id="log_tablebody_3"
   dataattribute="createdate"
   type="link" mxevent="selectlog" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" />
                 <tablecol id="log_tablebody_1"
   dataattribute="description"
   type="link" mxevent="selectlog" mxevent_desc="Go To %1" />
               </tablebody>
   
   2. Now that the WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION is also
   displayed,
   create a new SR from Self Service->Service Requests -> Create
   Service
   Request.
   3. Submit the SR and select View Details when prompted.
   4. update the Work Log on the displayed SR record by using the
   Add Log
   Entry button;
   5. In the Update Service Request Log dialog box, under details,
   enter
   some text, press enter and enter some more text.
   6. After pressing OK, the Details
   (WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION)
   is displayed much wider than normal when enter has been pressed.
   If
   enter is not pressed, the Details field is displayed normally.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WORKLOG.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION FIELD FORMAT IS DISPLAYED
   MIS-SHAPEN
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Turns out there was a line in the code that would not wrap the
   text properly if the text contained a <br>.  This was only the
   case for text that appeared in a table.  As a result, a table
   column containing a 'longdescription' was susceptible to this.
   A fix was delivered so that text containing <br> lines will also
   be wrapped appropriately in a table.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   package:
