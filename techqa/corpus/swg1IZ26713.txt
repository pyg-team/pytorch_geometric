ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   
   ITM 6.2 FP1 Upgrade to TEPS on Unix/Linux
   The problem is known to occur with RedHat 5.1, but this
   problem likely occurs on other operating systems.
   
   Problem Description:
   
   After installing ITM 6.2 FP1, it is no longer possible to log
   in to the TEPS from the TEP console (browser or client).
   Note: There are no obvious signs during the upgrade that
   anything went wrong.
   
   After the TEPS server has been restarted, trying to log in to
   the TEPS will result in the error message below:
   
   KFWITM009I The Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server is still being
   initialized and is not ready for communications.
   
   To prove that the problem is due to an unsupported operating
   system, first examine the file :
   
   $CANDLEHOME/<arch>/iw/properties/version/EWAS.product
   
   and check the version information.  If the version is 6.1.0.3
   as shown below, then EWAS did not get upgraded, and is still
   at the 6.2GA level.
   
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE product SYSTEM "product.dtd">
   <product name="IBM Embeddable WebSphere Application Server">
     <id>embeddedEXPRESS</id>
     <version>6.1.0.3</version>
     <build-info
       date="10/31/06"
       level="cf40644.23"/>
   </product>
   
   If however EWAS has the version <6.1.0.13>, then EWAS did get
   upgraded to the 6.2 FP1 level and this APAR is not applicable
   for your problem.
   
   If EWAS is still at level 6.1.0.3, then check the directory:
   
   /tmp/niflogs
   
   in this directory will be files similar to
   
   log_20080709.182935.txt.gz  trace_20080709.182935.txt.gz
   
   Examine the log*.gz file with the following command:
   
   gunzip -c log_20080709.182935.txt.gz
   
   If the EWAS upgrade failed due to an unsupported operating
   system, an error similar to that below will be shown:
   
   (Jul 9, 2008 6:29:35 PM), Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp
   .actions.MaintenancePrereqCheckAction, err, CWUPI0036E: A
   supported operating system was not detected. Current detected
   OS level: Linux l3esxh3g1 2.6.18-53.el5 #1 SMP Wed Oct
   10 16:34:02 EDT 2007 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux
   
   
   The above error shows that the operating system that was
   detected is not supported by this version of EWAS, as a
   result the update of EWAS failed. If you have this situation
   this APAR addresses this issue.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   
   Do this all as the root user.
   
   1) Install TEMS and TEPS from ITM 6.2 GA.
   2) Start TEMS (bin/CandleServer start TEMS)
   3) Configure TEPS (bin/CandleConfig -A cq)
   4) Start TEPS (bin/CandleAgent start cq)
   5) Log into TEPS using TEP browser client - to verify
   login works.
   6) Stop TEPS (bin/CandleAgent stop cq)
   7) Stop TEMS (bin/CandleServer stop TEMS)
   8) Upgrade TEMS and TEPS from 6.2 FP1. - Notice lack of
   any errors.
   9) Start TEMS (bin/CandleServer start TEMS)
   10) Start TEPS (bin/CandleAgent start cq)
   11) Observe that you cannot log into TEPS, receive
   errror KFWITM009I
   12) Observe EWAS.product file still reports version 6.1.0.3
   13) Observe the /tmp/niflogs/log_*.gz contains error
   CWUPI0036E as above.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  EWAS upgrade fails because Update Installer OS prerequisites
   checking fail. When TEPS is being upgraded from version 6.2 to
   6.2 fp1, TEPS extension component (eWAS) has to be upgraded to
   6.1.0.13. TEPS extension component (eWAS) is being upgraded by
   Update Installer. UpdateInstaller 6.1.0.13 incorrectly
   recognizes a few operation systems as unsupported.
   Operation systems recognizes as unsupported:
    - RedHat 5.1
    - Win 2003 SE 64bit SP2
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. OS prerequisites checking during Update Installer
   installation was disabled.
   2. Message is displayed when TEPS extension upgrade fails.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
