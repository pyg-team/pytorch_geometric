 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 Oracle connector does support the Oracle 12c client. However, there are certain limitations in the InfoSphere Information Server 11.3.1 release. 

CONTENT
Limitations
The following plugins do not support Oracle 12c: 

 * Oracle OCI 
 * Oracle Bulk Load 
 * Dynamic Relational Stage 
 * Oracle Operator


Manually adding the symbolic link 

An option to select the Oracle 12c variant is not yet added to the Oracle Connector stage. To use the Oracle 12c client, select the Oracle 11g variant in the Properties page of the Oracle connector stage. Because of this, the Oracle connector looks for the Oracle 11g client library. In some platforms, a symbolic link for the Oracle 11g client library might not be automatically added to point to the Oracle 12c client library. If this happens, you must manually create a symbolic link. 

Limitations in working with tables 

When the extended size feature is enabled on an Oracle 12c database, tables have the following limitations: 
 * Reading and writing VARCHAR2 and NVARCHAR2 Oracle column values larger than 4000 bytes. The maximum length in 11gR2 and earlier is 4000 bytes and Oracle 12c extends this to 32767 bytes. 
 * Reading and writing RAW Oracle column values larger than 2000 bytes. The maximum length in 11gR2 and earlier is 2000 bytes and Oracle 12c extends this to 32767 bytes.
