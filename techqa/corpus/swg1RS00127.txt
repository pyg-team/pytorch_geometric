ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In JRules Studio 7.0.2 rule reporting is different from JRules
   Studio 6.7.4, where there was a Rule Report option in the
   context menu.
   As we follow the documentation for 7.0.2, upon imported the
   custom-rule-project and opened the BIRT editor for a specific
   template. the option "View report" is not available in JRules
   7.0.2 File menu.
   Where / how can we find this option?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The documentation is provided in JRules 7.0.2 is not correct.
   The correct steps to run a rule report are as follows:
   1. In the Rule Explorer, under custom-rule-report, double-click
   one of the report templates, for example
   businessrulereport.rptdesign. The report template opens in the
   BIRT editor.
   2.Click Run > View Report to display the different ways of
   viewing the report.
   3.From the list, select the option that best suits your needs,
   for example View Report in Web viewer. The BIRT report window
   opens.
   4.In the Parameter dialog, select the name of the rule project
   you want to report on.
   5.Click OK. The rule report is generated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In "WebSphere ILOG JRules V7.1 > Samples > Rule Studio business
   rule management extension samples" section, go to "Generate
   custom report sample". Look at the point 2 of "Running the
   Business Rules Report": it is asked to "Click File > View Report
   to display the different ways of viewing the report".
   
   In the menu File > View Report is not accessible.
   
   This option is available when the user double click a .rptdesign
   file (on the preview tab ).
