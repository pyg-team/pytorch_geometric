 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 Language Independent 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document will provide guidelines to server sizing of the Cognos Disclosure Management application 

SYMPTOM
Poor performance


ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document is intended to provide insight and best practices on server sizing when deploying IBM Cognos Disclosure Management. It will outline all necessary hardware considerations required by both the application and the database server based on active user connections and the size of the environment required. 

IBM Cognos Disclosure Management is scalable solution: The underlying three tier architecture allows further customization based on the type of environment required. The following table summarizes the different types of environments available, along with the hardware requirements for the application server. 

Figure 1 - shows the # of users based on the environment including application and database servers.

Notes: 

 * Testing Metrics has been conducted using VMware machines 
 * Testing Metrics are developed based on a single application server deployment. 


Testing Metrics are based on the following operation types:  * 80% Report Object Management/Generation Tasks which include and are not limited to: 


Working with Report Objects  * Generate multiple objects/Entire Report 
 * Viewing Various Report Screens 


20% XBRL Related Tasks  * Tagging Objects 
 * Generating Tagging Reports/Instance Documents 
 * Taxonomy Mapping 


The following section illustrates mock up examples of each of the mentioned environments above. These diagrams are not to be taken as recommendations of ideal setups but are merely for illustration purpose.

Enterprise Deployment 
Larger Client implementations involving 100+ active users have to be evaluated by an IBM Services Consultant in order to provide accurate estimates and recommendations based on the environment in place. 

The following examples will illustrate a mockup network topology for common environments 

High Availability/Load Balancing 
This environment will likely resemble a multi-instance application server deployment with a hardware load balancer
