PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Application Server    *
   *                 also running WebSphere Extended Deployment   *
   *                 6.1.                                         *
   *                                                              *
   *                 All users of WebSphere Extended Deployment   *
   *                 using the On Demand Router.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Status codes of 503 are temporarily     *
   *                      returned for HTTPS requests by ODR.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Under heavy load after a new server
   starts, it can take a long time
   between being notified of the HTTP and
   the HTTPS transports.  During this
   interval, 503's are returned for HTTPS
   requests.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix has been put in so that the On demand router does not
   load balance to a server that does not have an HTTPS transport
   configured if the received request is for the HTTPS protocol.
   This will prevent the 503 status codes from being
   returned.
   
   The fix was made available for XD 6.0.2.1 and XD 6.1.0 and
   will be incorporated into XD 6.0.2.2 and XD 6.1.0.1.
