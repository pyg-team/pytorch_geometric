APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNM 3.8 GA
   
   ncp_perl process goes to 4G and displays out
   of memory when trying to run the 5620 SAM collector.
   
   SAM Collector needs to gather data per-device and re-use the
   SOAP proxy
   
   - Note: Bug in per-device Entity discovery (response not set)
   
   - Note: Bug in per-device VLL discovery (wrong parse method
   called)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A new pm has been provided in the short term by development.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Specifically user running the Alcatel Collector against a    *
   * 5620 EMS with large amounts of data (e.g. lots of layer 2    *
   * VPNs)                                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When running a discovery against an Alcatel 5620 SAM using   *
   * the Alcatel5620SamSoap Collector the memory usage of the     *
   * ncp_perl process becomes excessive.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * upgrade to latest FP | fix pack | 3.8.0-ITNMIP-FP0005        *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Alcatel5620SamSoap Collector will now perform more memory
   efficiently when discovering large amounts of SAM data.
   
   The major changes are:
       - requests now issued on a per-device basis to reduce the
   size of response
       - the SOAP client is now reused to reduce memory usage
       - a new option 'noload' as been added to allow inital data
   download to be skipped if desired
         (i.e. specifying -noload on the command line will make the
   Collector wait for contact from the collector finder before
   downloading data)
