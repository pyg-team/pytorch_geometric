PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do you make playback faster an IBM Rational Functional Tester script? 

CAUSE
The playback needs a long time to complete.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The playback time depends on several factors. 




 * Java scripting is faster than simplified scripting. Therefore, do only Java scripting.
   
   
 * Object recognition might be the rate determining step. Change the ScriptAssure settings to less strict values.
   
   
 * Increase the Eclipse heap size.
   Eclipse applications like RFT might benefit from a larger heap size. Start RFT with an argument -vmargs -Xmx 1024M (for example) or set the heap size in eclipse.ini through the -Xmx parameter.
