APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Found in trc.log that there were many targets with repeated
   CallHomes at short intervals... for example:
   .
   Repeated callhomes ............. [('19026', 87), ('19812', 64),
   ('21056', 61), ('18382', 49), ('18717', 48), ('2932', 47),
   ('3018', 46), ('10259', 46), ('6260', 45), ('21333', 45),
   ('20222', 45), ('18715', 45), ('18080', 45), ('17899', 45),
   ('8803', 44),
   .
   We found in target log the endpoint is having ip-changes that is
   causing the callhome trigger - for example:
   .
   2013.05.16-00:42:52.086 (GMT) INFO  [ 4976] ip changed:
        10.xxx.xx.189;0.0.0.0
   2013.05.16-00:42:52.086 (GMT) INFO  [ 4976] Triggering heartbeat
   for info change (ip_changed=1) (nodename_changed=0)
   (user_changed=0) (other_changed=0)
   .
   This ip-change seems to be caused by the target connection
   dropping / reconnecting to the wi-fi network...
   .
   need an option to control this callhome trigger or way to
   prevent trc-server from getting flooded.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  diable wi-fi on target devices if not needed
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users affected
   Controller: not affected
   Server: not affected
   Target: all , platforms: all
   CLI: not affected
   Gateway: not affected
   
   Problem description
   In cases where there are network malfunctions or
   misconfiguration and this is causing repeated and constant
   changes of IP addresses, the target can send a large number of
   updates to the server. This could severly degrade the
   performance in the remote control server if a large number of
   targets are affected by the network problems.
   
   Problem summary
   The target has a mechanism to avoid overloading the server but
   updates considered important, for example, IP address changes,
   are always sent to the server without delay. If network problems
    or misconfiguration is causing the targets to change IP
   addresses very frequently, this could result in degraded
   performance in the remote control server.
   
   To prevent this issue, a mechanism was added to detect and delay
   or filter spurious updates in changes that would otherwise be
   immediately reported to the server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix will be included in
   5.1.2-TIV-TRC512-IF0016, 8.2.1-TIV-TEMRC821-IF0006 and
   9.0.1-TIV-IEMRC901-IF0001
