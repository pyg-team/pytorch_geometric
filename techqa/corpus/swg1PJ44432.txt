ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "FNRCE0010E: E_BAD_VALUE: The value given for a property or list
   element lies outside the permitted range or value set" error
   occurs when moving a document with a name value greater than 255
   to the recovery bin
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1)  In Administrative Console for Content Platform Engine
   (ACCE),  create a String property ?MyStringProperty? template
   with max character length = 512
   2)  Create class definition "MyClassDefinition", add property
   "MyStringProperty" to this class and set IsName property to
   true.
       a.  Uncheck is name property for document title.  Select
   "Display inherited properties" to view document title.  This
   step is needed, otherwise there will be an error stating the
   document class cannot have 2 name properties.
   3)  Create instance of MyClassDefinition, and add text to
   MyStringProperty with any string value over 255 characters
   4)  Then open the document and from the actions menu, select
   'Move to Recovery', select a recovery bin
   5)  The following error is displayed in a popup window:
   ? The value given for a property or list element lies outside
   the permitted range or value set, or exceeds the maximum length
   allowed. The length of the value (400) specified for property
   OriginalName exceeds the maximum permitted length (255).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users of 5.2.1.5-P8CPE-FP005 and or earlier making use of    *
   * Recovery Bin functionality                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * If a customer has defined a custom name property for a       *
   * document class, and the value of that name property can      *
   * exceed 255 characters, attempting to put a document with     *
   * such a value into a Recovery Bin, an exception will occur as *
   * a result of trying to copy that name into the OriginalName   *
   * property of the Recovery Item since it is longer than        *
   * permitted for that property.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.1.6-P8CPE-FP006 or higher.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.1.2.6-P8CPE-FP006 and higher where the code that
   populates the OriginalName property has been modified to
   truncate the value to the maximum length of 255 characters. Thus
   in what was previously an error scenario, the operation will now
   succeed, with that truncated name being applied.
