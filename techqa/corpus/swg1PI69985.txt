APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Rational Quality Manager, Internal server error is raised
   when attempting to open an Execution Schedule in a Configuration
   enabled project area
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Log into an Configuration enabled project area.
   2. In the initial stream, create an execution schedule that
   contains at least 1 TCER or TSER.
   3. Create a stream from this stream and switch to the new
   stream.
   4. Go to Execution > Execution Schedules and open the (branched)
   execution schedule created in step 1.
   5. In the Steps section, remove the existing TCER or TSER and
   add the TCER/TSER again
   (You can also just modify the steps in the execution schedule or
   replacing the original TCER with another TCER or add another
   TCER)
   6. Save the execution schedule
   7. Switch to the initial stream used in step 1
   8. Go to Execution > Execution Schedules and open the execution
   schedule created in step 1
   
   
   Actual Results:
   The execution schedule cannot be opened. Instead, the system
   displays an error message:
   " Unable to retrieve the specified Execution Schedule. Error
   500: Internal Server Error Close this page"
   
   
   Expected Behavior:
   The execution schedule created in step 1 can be opened in the
   context of the initial stream regardless of any modifications in
   other streams
   
   This issue has been identified as a product defect:
