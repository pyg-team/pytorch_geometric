PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) users     *
   *                  of IBM WebSphere Application Server V7.0.   *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The SIP container throws a              *
   *                      StackOverflowError under load when a    *
   *                      TCP or TLS connection breaks.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem happens under load, when the application is
   sending out a large number of SIP messages over TCP or TLS,
   and the connection gets broken. There is a bug in the code
   that handles the connection error, which causes a
   StackOverflowError, if there are a large number of messages
   queued for delivery.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is fixed in the SIP container code. With this fix,
   the container recovers from this situation without throwing an
   exception.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 7.0.0.11.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
