ERROR DESCRIPTION

   ***************************************************************
   Rational Developer for System z (RDz) 9.0: Invoking HATS RCP
   application from an editor for a remote file does not run work
   
   
   APAR Error Description (unlimited lines of 64 chars):
   ***************************************************************
   Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.0: the HATS RCP
   application does not run properly when invoked from an open
   editor session for a remote file.
   
   Recreation steps:
   - create a simple HATS macro
   - exported the HATS plug-in,
   - create a new action using the Menu Manager preferences in RDz
   - from the RSE view, select a member, the action works fine
   - open a COBOL program, or a JCL file, right click and select
   the new action: nothing happens. No error logged.
   
   ***************************************************************
   Local fix:
   None
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The HATS integration code was not properly obtaining the
   hostname, userid or password for the remote object so that it
   could be used by the HATS RCP application to connect to the
   proper host.
   There is no local workaround.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The HATS integration code was modified to recognize this
   scenario and obtain the appropriate connection information from
   the selected object (the remote file being edited).
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
   IBM Rational Developer for System z V9.0.1 Refresh Pack which
   is available from the Recommended Fixes support download page:
