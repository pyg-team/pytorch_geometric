QUESTION
 How can you add, remove and replace certificates in SiteProtector using the Certificate Manager Tools? 

ANSWER
The Certificate Manager Tools provide a way to add, remove, and replace certificates. The latest version is 3.1.1.1. 

The SiteProtector Certificate Manager Tools can be downloaded from the IBM Download Center [https://ibmss.flexnetoperations.com/control/ibms/login?] under My software > Download > IBM Security SiteProtector System > SiteProtector 3.1.1 > Accessories > under SiteProtector 3.1.1.1 Certificate Management Tools click link CertificateManagerTools_3_1_1_1.zip to download.

Notes: 


 * The current tools version, 3.1.1.1, supports both Strict mode configuration and Compatible mode as well. The older version, 3.1.1, still available for download, will work only with the SiteProtector Strict mode configuration. 
 * Changing the certificates on SiteProtector Appliance is unsupported.


These tools allow the administrator to do the following: 
 * Add certificates to SiteProtector (like Certificate Authority certificates). 
 * Remove certificates from SiteProtector (like expired certificates). 
 * Produce a Certificate Sign Request (CSR). 
 * Replace the default certificate used by SiteProtector. 
 * Configure Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for the Update Server (XUS) and Agent Manager (AM) SiteProtector components. 
 * Configure Bidirectional Authentication for Update Server (XUS) and Agent Manager (AM) SiteProtector components.


The Certificate Manager Tools package consists of the following files: 
 * CertificateAddRemoveTool.exe provides a way to add or remove certificates such as Intermediate Certificates and Certificate Authority (CA) Root Certificates so that a certificate chain exists in the SiteProtector keystore to allow proper certificate validation.
   
 * CertificateReplacementTool.exe provides a way to generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSR) and to import Certificate Authority (CA) Signed Certificates that are received through a CSR Response to replace the default certificate in a SiteProtector keystore.
   
 * CertificateConfigurationTool.exe provides a way to set configuration files for the following items:  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to configure revocation status checks for certificates 
    * Bidirectional SSL authentication for XUS and Agent Manager components.
