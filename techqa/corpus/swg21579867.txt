RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This solution is covered in the P8 Product Documentation. Search for the section "Configuring WebSphere Application Server to support user tokens and WebDAV connections for Workplace XT" in your version of the P8 Product Documentation. Or use the link for the P8 5.1 documentation provided below. 

NOTE: The documentation says copying the jars applies to CE 4.0 and CE 4.5.1, but these .jar files are also required for P8 CE 5.x.
