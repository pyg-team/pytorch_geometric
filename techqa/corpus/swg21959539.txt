Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Apache Tomcat which is shipped with WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (WASCE) 3.0.0.4 is vulnerable to Diffie-Hellman vulnerability known as Logjam 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Application Server Community Edition 3.0.0.4

REMEDIATION/FIXES

Tomcat provide a choice for SSL implementation:(refer to
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html [https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html])

1. the JSSE implementation provided as part of the Java runtime (since 1.4)
2. the APR implementation, which uses the OpenSSL engine by default.

Per JSSE:
Specify the cipher suites in the server.xml file as below if your JDK is vulnerable to Diffie-Hellman vulnerability known as Logjam :

<Connector
ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_SHA,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_SHA"
/>

Per OpenSSL:

Add !DHE:!EDH to disable DHE/EDH and remove any lines that explicitly enable DHE/EDH

i.e. old
SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!EXPORT:DHE:EDH
new
ALL:!ADH:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!EXPORT:!DHE:!EDH

Check with openssl ciphers -V command to make sure DHE/EDH are disabled. See
http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html [http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html] for more detail on the syntax of cipher suite configuration
