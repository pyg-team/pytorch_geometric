Title: IBM The time gets truncated when programmatically setting a DateTime Index - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When setting an Index field (with a DateTime data type), the time gets truncated. After the batch/document has been successfully committed to the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE) backend, the time always shows as 12:00PM. 

SYMPTOM
Executing the following code, regardless of the date and time value, will result in the time being reset to 12:00PM. 

===========
oRepObject.Indices(strDateField).Value = CDate(strDateVal) 
** where strDateVal is formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm AM/PM" 
===========


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For the DATETIME index property of a CE Document Class (DocClass), IBM FileNet Capture Professional does not save the time-portion of the data. When a document is created in Capture, the DATETIME field will only save the date-portion of the Index field--not the time-portion. 


Using native Capture, only the date information can be entered in the Index Grid (the time information cannot be entered). Programmatically, when the date and time are saved into an Index field, the time info will not be saved by Capture.

By design, Capture Professional only supports Date Index fields. This is demonstrated when performing a Tools->Config->Index and viewing any DATETIME CE fields. Through Capture Professional, the type will only show as "Type: Date" not "Type: DateTime". In addition, the Input Mask will only show ##/##/#### (no characters are allotted for time).

Note: Please use Index Fields of type String to save Date and Time information.
