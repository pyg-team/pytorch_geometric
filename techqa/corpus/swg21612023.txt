Text:
db2look; ulimit; stmt_ptr; data; stack TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running db2look command with "-e -a -l" options fail with space allocation error. 

SYMPTOM
Example: 

db2look -d sample -e -a -l -o db2look.out 
-- Generate statistics for all creators 
-- Creating DDL for table(s) 
-- Output is sent to file: db2look.out 

The db2look utility could not allocate space of stmt_ptr 
The db2look utility is now terminating


CAUSE
The ulimit settings are not set to unlimited for data and stack.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the 'ulimit -a' output and verify that 'data' and 'stack' are set to 'unlimited'. If they are not set, please login as root and set the data and stack to unlimited as below:

ulimit -d unlimited 

ulimit -s unlimited

Note: ulimits are read at process startup, so the DB2 instance needs to be restarted for the values to take effect.
