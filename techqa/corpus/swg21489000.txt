Title: IBM Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream when opening file, or Red X - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys. I have created my project and tried to save it. However the program hangs, crashs or was ended on saving and closed. Now when I try and open my project, I get the following error:

Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream

or I just see an empty message box with a red X. The project files are then unusable.

What is happening? 

CAUSE
This issue is caused by having an extremely large and/or complicated groupings of categories utilizing many force in and force outs. This swells the underlying xml to a very large size which in turn hinders the ability of Text Analysis to work with and especially save the file causing it to become corrupt. Unfortunately, once the project file is corrupt it cannot be recovered and will need to be recreated.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


This behavior has been significantly improved in the current release, SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys 4.1. Upgrade media has already been sent to our maintenance customers. Customers not on maintenance will need to contact their SPSS Account Executive to discuss upgrade options.
