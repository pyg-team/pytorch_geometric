PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the meaning of the &quot;!&quot; character before some functions displayed in the expression editor ? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Not all data sources support functions in the same way. The data modeler can set a quality of service indicator on functions to give a visual clue about the behaviour of the functions. Report authors can use the quality of service indicators to determine which functions to use in a report.
The quality of service indicators are:

not available: (X)
This function is not available for any data sources in the package

limited availability (!!)
The function is not available for some data sources in the package

poor performance (!)
The function is available for all data sources in the package but may have poor performance in some data sources

The function is available for all data sources
