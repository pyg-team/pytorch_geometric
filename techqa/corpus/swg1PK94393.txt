ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PMR: 26706,999,760
   Quintus: 226065
   
   Whilst generating source code using customer's model, Rhapsody
   causes a Fatal Error.
   This symptom has been reproduced with Rhapsody 7.4, 7.5, and
   7.5.0.1(Build1160126).
   I have sent the customer's model to Dudu.
   
   Followings are the steps to reproduce:
   
   (1) Unzip the material (p1_ptimer.zip) to a working folder.
   
   (2) Copy 'TestingProfile.sbs' into:
          '?work? \p_timer\p_timer_rpy\Test'.
   
       TestingProfile is in:
   
   '?rhapdody?\Share\Profiles\TestingProfile\TestingProfile_rpy'
   
       This is a file copied from Rhapsody Share directory,
       no modification applied.
   
   (3) Start Rhapsody and open the model 'p_timer.rpy'
       Whilst opening the model, you will be prompted to specify
       'TestingProfile.sbs'.  Specify the folder you copied on (2).
       Update the unit path in model, too.
   
   (4) In the Rhapsody Model Browser, expand and right-click
       'p_timer ? Components ? sim ? Configurations ? Animation',
       and select 'Generate Configuration Main and Make Files'.
   
   (5) After the Gen ends, select menu 'Code ? Re Generate ?
       Animation'.
   
   (6) After the previous Gen ends, select menu 'Code ? Re Generate
       ? Entire Project'.
       Rhapsody will prompt you to reply if you want to roundtrip.
       Reply [Yes to All].
       Rhapsody will also reports parsing error.  Reply [Yes].
   
   (7) After the previous Gen ends, select menu 'Code ? Re Generate
       ? Animation'.
   
       You will be prompted if you want round trip.  Reply [Yes to
       All].   Rhapsody will also prompt reverting change.  Reply
       [Yes].  Reply [Yes], for parsing error, too.
   
   (8) After the Gen ends, select menu 'Code ? Re Generate ?
       Animation', again.
   
   (9) Repeat operation (8) multiple times.
   
   
   After you repeat the gen (8), you will encounter a Fatal Error,
   asking 'Save As' the model.  On my environment, I had to repeat
   (8) 3 to 10 times before encountering the symptom.
   
   Click [OK] to close the Fatal Error message.
   
   After the Fatal error, I encountered two types of symptoms:.
   
   - Symptom (a)
   Rhapsody shows Report Error message while creating RER file.
   
   - Symptom (b)
   Rhapsody continue working and you can 'Save As' the model.
   However, the Save As operation errors creating insufficient
   model file (*.rpy).
