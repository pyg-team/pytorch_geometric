PROBLEM SUMMARY

USERS AFFECTED:
IBM WebSphere Application Server Feature Pack for Web Services users of JAX-WS

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
If a JAX-WS web service references the com.ibm.websphere.security.WSException class, a WSWS7054E error may occur.

RECOMMENDATION:
Install a fixpack containing this APAR.

The following error may occur when starting a JAX-WS application:

javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: WSWS7054E: The Web Services
Description Language (WSDL) file could not be generated for the
sample.MyServiceSoapBindingImpl Web
service implementation class because of the following error:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
com/ibm/websphere/security/WSSecurityException

Note: The error was reported for an IBM WebSphere Application Server running on the Solaris operating system. 





Note: The class that is not found (com.ibm.websphere.security.WSSecurityException) is present in the WebSphere Application Server runtime.

Note: Most customers do not have web service classes that reference the WSSecurityException class.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION: 
The JAX-WS runtime did not include the runtime jar in its classpath when it generated the wsdl for the customer's web service. As a result, the WSSecurityException class was not 
found. 

The JAX-WS runtime is changed to include the runtime jar when it generates the wsdl. 

This problem is already corrected in GM version of the V7 WebSphere Application Server. 

The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in 
fix pack 6.1.0.33. Please refer to the Recommended Updates
