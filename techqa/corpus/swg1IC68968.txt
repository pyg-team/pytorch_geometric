APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The JMSInput node does not reconnect after restarting a JBoss
   JMS Provider.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker version 6.1 or higher
   with JMS Nodes connecting to a JBoss JMS provider.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The JBoss JMS client does not throw an exception when calling
   MessageConsumer.receive() if the underlying connection has been
   broken due to a JMS Provider restart. This does not follow the
   JMS 1.1 specification, however there is an alternate
   asynchronous exception handling strategy outlined in the JMS
   specification which JBoss does implement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new parameter has been added to the JMSProvider configurable
   Service definition named jmsAsyncExceptionHandling. Setting this
   property to 'true' causes the broker to register an exception
   listener on the JMS connection when it is created and handle
   connection exceptions asynchronously from the main flow. This
   allows the broker to detect when the connection has been broken
   and therefore attempt to reconnect.
