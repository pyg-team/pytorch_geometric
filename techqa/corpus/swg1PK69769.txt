APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1, the description of the -winserviceCheck parameter
   should be updated to state the following information:
   "The value can be either true or false.  Specify true to create
   a Windows service for the server process that is created within
   the profile.  Specify false to not create the Windows service.
   The default value for this parameter is false.  Note:  With a
   custom profile, a Windows service cannot be created using this
   parameter.  Instead, use the WASService command to create the
   service separately."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects administrators who are    *
   *                  creating a custom profile and attempting    *
   *                  to create a Windows Service during this     *
   *                  profile creation process. This issue        *
   *                  applies to WebSphere Application Server     *
   *                  Version 6.1.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The -winserviceCheck parameter is       *
   *                      described for the manageprofiles        *
   *                      command. However, when you use the      *
   *                      -winserviceCheck parameter for the      *
   *                      manageprofiles command and are          *
   *                      creating a custom profile, the          *
   *                      Windows service is not created.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The "manageprofiles command" topic in the Version 6.1
   Information Centers does not describe a limitation for custom
   profiles. If you create a custom profile, you cannot use the
   -winserviceCheck parameter with the manageprofiles command.
   You can use the -winserviceCheck parameter with the profile
   templates. To create a Windows service for a custom profile,
   use the WASService command after you create the profile.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "manageprofiles command" topic will be updated. The
   -winserviceCheck parameter will include the following note:
   "With a custom profile, you cannot create a Windows service
   with this parameter. Instead, use the WASService command to
   create the service separately."
