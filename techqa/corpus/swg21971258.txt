Microsoft’s updated support policy will affect customers who utilize combinations of Windows operating systems and browsers that deviate from the following chart:

Customers who use web browsers that are not coupled with the associated operating systems listed above will no longer receive updates or patches for their web browser on their particular operating system. Although IBM will continue to support customers on these browsers, any issues that would require support from Microsoft cannot be supported. 

For reference, listed below is a chart detailing the supported Windows operating systems and Internet Explorer versions for each of the releases of IBM Cúram’s Social Program Management Platform:

IBM Cúram is committed to providing a fully supported environment for all of our customers. Therefore to mitigate the end of support for these supported browsers and to provide a fully supported web browser across the multitude of technical environments utilized by our customers, IBM is pleased to announce that we are currently testing with a view to expanding support across additional browser versions, on affected versions of IBM Cúram where a customer need exists. 

As alternatives are validated for support we will release additional Technotes detailing the browser version now supported as well as any steps necessary for implementation. 

IBM also wishes to provide to you the benefits of upgrading to our recent release versions, which support many new third party prerequisites and provides the technical currency to avoid the impact that a termination of support by a third party vendor can have on your organization. 

We look forward to meeting your support needs. Thank you for choosing IBM Cúram Social Program Management. 

Please feel free to contact John Durham – Product Marketing Manager [durhamj@us.ibm.com] if you have any questions or if you wish to discuss the many benefits of upgrading your solution to our recently announced versions.
