ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   
   
   User has 8.1.5 and 8.2 installed on their system. When building
   code using the MicroC profile, it works correctly.
   User then uninstalls 8.1.5. If they now try and build MicroC
   code using 8.2, they get the error "NMAKE : fatal error U1073:
   don't know how to make 'mxf_cfg.h'' See attached ErrorLog1.txt
   Reinstalling 8.2 (and not 8.1.5) does not solve the issue. User
   has to reinstall both 8.1.5 and 8.2 in order for the MicroC code
   to build correctly.
   All projects without MicroC build correctly.
   
   I was able to reproduce the issue on my VM environment.
   - Uninstalling 8.1.5 broke the 8.2 install.
   - The JVM would no longer run at all on 8.2: No project
   structure, no mxf_cfg.h, empty APILog, etc..
   - To fix I had to reinstall both 8.1.5 and 8.2

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Uninstalling Rhapsody 8.1.5 (or any other version)           *
   * unregister the latest registered RhapsodyServer. But another *
   * Rhapsody (8.2 in our case) cannot register it if it doesn't  *
   * run as Administrator.                                        *
   * Workaround is to run the following command as Administrator  *
   * (only once, if no other installations/uninstallations done)  *
   * >rhapsody.exe  -RegServer                                    *
