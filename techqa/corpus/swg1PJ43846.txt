APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a case client user concurrently opens 2 cases there is an
   observable delay after pressing a key and the corresponding
   character echos.  Entering characters with a Shift+keystroke
   will incur about a one second delay.  When the users opens 3 or
   more cases concurrently the delay is more pronounced.  Holding
   down the shift key renders it completely non-responsive.  It is
   not possible to enter any characters that require the shift key
   depressed.
   
   This issue is not reproducible via Chrome, Firefox or a
   different version of Internet Explorer
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a different version of Microsoft Internet Explorer other
   than V11, or any versions of Chrome or Firefox.

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * It is recommended to apply 5.2.1.4-ICM-FP004 GA release or   *
   * later.                                                       *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This code defect has been corrected in the underlying Dojo IDX
   library.  Both IBM Case Client and IBM Case Builder have been
   updated to include the new library in this GA release.  With
   this fix there is no delay of typed characters to appear when
   the shift key is pressed.
