PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to uninstall or restore IBM Rational Host On-Demand (HOD) through Licensed Programs on IBM i5 fails to completely remove the product. 

CAUSE
You should no longer uninstall or restore Host On-Demand on the IBM i5 with the operating system commands RSTLICPGM (Restore Licensed Program) or DLTLICPGM (Delete Licensed Program).
During the Host On-Demand install and uninstall, the RSTLICPGM command installs the native code and the DLTLICPGM command removes the native code. Some native code such as the HOD Service Manager and the Host On-Demand menu are affected, but the majority of the product is not uninstalled.

When you run DLTLICPGM directly, you manually erase part of Host On-Demand without removing the entire product. As a result, Host On-Demand continues to be detected in subsequent installations even though it has been removed. The result causes the installation to be incomplete. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Procedure: 

 

 1. Run the uninstall.sh script to completely remove Host On-Demand.
    
    
 2. Re-install Host On-Demand in one of two ways:
     * Install using Windows remote install 
       or 
     * Install using i5 console install
       
       
    
    
 3. Copy the private directory and any custom files to the new installation.
