LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the CHLAUTH facility who are using the BLOCKADDR
   CHLAUTH type with WARN set to YES may be affected by this
   problem.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When attempting to write a channel blocked event to the
   SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT queue, IBM MQ first checks whether
   these events are enabled by querying the queue manager object.
    It was possible for BLOCKADDR type authentication to occur
   before the appropriate internal state information had been
   obtained, which caused the MQOPEN of the queue manager object to
   fail with an MQRC_HCONN_ERROR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ queue manager code has been modified to detect the timing
   condition that lead MQRC_HCONN_ERROR, in order to avoid querying
   internal state information until after the MQOPEN of the queue
   manager object has completed successfully.
