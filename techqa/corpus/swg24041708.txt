ABSTRACT
 This patch provides an update to the Basic Services component to provide mitigation to the security vulnerability listed below. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following patch is provided to provide a workaround for the security vulnerability listed in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) Security Bulletin http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21976125 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21976125]. 




Note: The patch disables the use of TLS 1.2 and can be used until a newer release of GSKit is provided, 

 

 

To use this workaround, the patch needs to be installed on each portal server, distributed management server (hub and remote), and ITM distributed agent systems. 


Distributed Agents 
For distributed agent systems, the patch updates the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries (ax component on UNIX/Linux) or Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework (GL component on Windows). The technote Upgrading Shared Components for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agents [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673490] provides information on how shared libraries are used. 

For Agents running on distributed environments, if the patch cannot be installed, the HTTP Server can be disabled using the steps below to remediate the vulnerability. 

NOTE: Disabling the service console using the steps below will result in the following functions to be disabled for that agent : 

 *  SOAP requests tacmd commands dynamic trace 

For this reason, HTTP_SERVER:N should be configured on agent endpoints ONLY (not on portal or management servers) and only if these functions are not needed by the user or agents installed on that system. 

These these steps will need to be done for each agent and agent instance on the system. 

Windows:  * From the MTEMS, right-click on the agent or agent instance and select Advanced..Edit Variables. 
 * Select KDC_FAMILIES. Add "HTTP_SERVER:N" to the beginning. For example,  * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Restart the agent or agent instance.


UNIX/Linux::  * Update the <pc>.ini file and locate the line 'KDC_FAMILIES'. Add "HTTP_SERVER:N" to the front of the line. For example, if the default line looks like:  * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * For multi-instance agents, if the <pc>_<instance>.config file exists, edit it and locate the 'KDC_FAMILIES'. Add "HTTP_SERVER:N" to the front of the line. For example, if the default line looks like:  * 
   
   Change it to the following:  * 
   
   
 * Restart the agent or agent instance
