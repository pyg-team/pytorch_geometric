QUESTION
Why am I unable to run the DoDAF Report Generator in IBM Rational Rhapsody?

ANSWER
When a user installs Rhapsody v7.5.2.1 onto a 64-bit Windows 7 system, the registry will need to be populated with the appropriate registry entries. 

If the registry entry for ReporterPLUS is not assigned, the user receives the following error when right-clicking and trying to generate a document using the DoDAF Report Generator project in Rhapsody:


Rhapsody DoDAF Pack 

Registry ReporterPLUS is not installed on this system - Exiting. 



The fix for this issue is to create the following Registry entry:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Telelogic\Telelogic Rhapsody ReporterPLUS 

7.5.2\Settings



Its value should be the reporter plus exe path, such as;


c:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.5.2\reporterplus
