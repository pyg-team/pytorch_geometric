 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Cloud Application Performance Management (APM) Server 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 4 (or later server interim fix) includes security fixes for Synthetics, which has dependency on a change in the Synthetic Playback Agent for IBM Cloud APM 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 2.

If you apply the Cloud APM Server 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 4 without applying the Synthetic Playback agent update, any new synthetic scripts will not work until the Synthetic Playback agents are updated. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Prerequisite: 

On the computer system where your Synthetic Playback agents are installed, use the command `firefox -version` to check Firefox version. If it is not on version 52.x.0, Firefox must be upgraded to version 52.x.0. Firefox versions other than 52.x.0 ESR are not supported.

For IBM Cloud APM Private users: 

- If you plan to install Cloud APM Server 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 4, you should apply the Synthetic Playback agent V8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 2 to all of your playback agents before applying the server interim fix.

- If you have already applied Cloud APM Server 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 4 without updating your Synthetic Playback agents, do not create new Synthetic scripts via Synthetics Script Manager UI until you update all of your playback agents. 

- If you have already applied Cloud APM Server 8.1.4.0 Interim Fix 4 and created new synthetic scripts without updating your Synthetic Playback agents, transactions for the new scripts are not displayed in the APM UI. For example, transactions for the new scripts will not be displayed in the My Transactions application. To recover you must remove the new synthetic scripts, update your Synthetic Playback agents, and then add the synthetic scripts again.
