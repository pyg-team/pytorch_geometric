Text:
ACUOSI0050E; TCR FP2; FixPack 2; installation; failure; tcr211_Core_FP2; /run_WASUI_SDKFIX_Install.sh; WAS UI; return code 127 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of TCR 2.1.1 FixPack 2 fails with message:
InterimFix installation failed.
Check details in /tmp/IBM_Tivoli_Common_Reporting_2.1_1_FP2.log 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In /tmp/IBM_Tivoli_Common_Reporting_2.1_1_FP2.log, you can find the following error message:
ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 127. Invocation string: [/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2Components/TCRComponent/conf/tcr211_Core_FP2/run_WASUI_SDKFIX_Install.sh, /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2, /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2Components/WASUIHome]

This problem can happen if the WAS UI folder requested by the installation program already exists before installing the FixPack.
In this case, /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2Components/WASUIHome folder was created by mistake before invoking the FixPack installation program.
FixPack Installation creates itself the needed WAS UI folder and you just need to pass the name of the folder that must be created as parameter for the installation program.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the WAS UI folder if already exists, and re-run FixPack installation program.
