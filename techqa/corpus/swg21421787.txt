QUESTION
 What is the purpose of the log files that are found in Rational Rhapsody? 

ANSWER
Below are some of the log files that are generated by Rational Rhapsody and a brief description of what these files contain. 

 * silentMode.log 
   
   The silentMode.log is used for storing debugging information when the system is in "silent mode"
   In this mode, no dialog or any message is popped-up to the user. So any info that should pop-up to the user will be stored there. Most of that is for debugging purpose.
   
   
 * load.log
   
   The load.log contains some debugging info about loading the model
   
   
 * store.log
   
   Store.log contains debugging information that is being written while Rhapsody saves the model
   
   
 * plugin.log
   
   This file is created when there is a failure with loading a Rhapsody plug-in.
   Plug-ins could be Test-conductor, Rules player or even just a user plug-in
   
   Similarly, as the name goes atg.log belongs to Automatic test Generator add-on and the rtc.log - to Rational Team Concert.
