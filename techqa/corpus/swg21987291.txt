Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Security Access Manager for Web is affected by vulnerabilities in nss, nss-util, and nspr (CVE-2016-1978, CVE-2016-1979) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications. The nss-util packages provide utilities for use with the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

IBM Security Access Manager for Web uses NSS and is affected by two use-after-free flaws that have been identified in the NSS libraries. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2016-1978 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1978]
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in ssl3_HandleECDHServerKeyExchange. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111321 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111321]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2016-1979 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1979]
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free when processing DER encoded keys in the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
