APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CJSA transaction is being run under the default userid, despite
   there being a URIMAP defined for CJSA. The transaction fails
   with:
   DFHXS1111 CICSTEST CJSL Security violation by user DFTCICS for
   resource CJSA in class.
   SAF codes are
   (X'00000008',X'00000000').
   ESM codes are
   (X'00000008',X'00000000').
   RACF request made was FASTAUTH.
   The thread in question is started using the CICSExecutorService
   and so is not subject to URIMAP processing.  It is being used
   for PIPELINE SCAN processing when z/OS Connect is enabled.'

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DFHXS1111 Security violation by default *
   *                      user for resource CJSA when running     *
   *                      z/OS Connect.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   A Liberty JVM server running z/OS Connect or z/OS Connect
   Enterprise Edition is enabled.  Initialisation of these features
   causes a PIPELINE scan to occur.  As the scan is triggered via a
   Java thread the default transaction CJSA is used.  CJSA is not
   appropriate for this internal system function.  Additionally
   if RACF has been configured such that the default user cannot
   run CJSA transactions then a DFHXS1111 security violation
   occurs.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICSEndPointServiceImpl.java for both z/OS Connect and z/OS
   Connect Enterprise Edition have been modified so the pipeline
   scan is performed under transaction ID CPIR.
