Datacap Desktop task configuration in the Datacap Web Client and Datacap Navigator  * You configure the graphical user interface panels to be displayed for each Datacap Desktop task when you create the task, or when you upgrade the task from Taskmaster 8.1. 
 * You bind batches or pages (DCO types) to panels when you create a task or reconfigure a task to use with Datacap Desktop. You configure the task settings by using the Datacap Web Client or Datacap Navigator. 
 * See Binding panels to DCO types [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044188] to learn how to convert DotEdit and DotScan task settings from Datacap 8.1 and for scenarios to bind DCO types to standard panels 


System Requirements For information about hardware and software prerequisites, see IBM Datacap 9.0 System Requirements [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043811].


Known Issues and Limitations 

 * A batch priority that is set explicitly by rules within a task might be lost or set back to the previous priority, if a subsequent task runs immediately. A fix will become available for Datacap Server tmcore.dll. You can apply a workaround by saving the priority to the batch metadata and using an external script or Maintenance Manager with custom action to update any priorities that get out of sync.

 * Document integrity checking might fail if the same name is used for a Batch, Document, or Page. For example, if you name a document, Invoice, and you name a page, Invoice, document integrity checking might fail. To avoid this limitation, do not use the same name for different objects in the Document Hierarchy. 

 * When using the Fingerprint Service an error might occur when FindFingerprint is run immediately after full page OCR. A fix will become available for cco2cco - NormalizeCCO action. You can apply a workaround by separating FindFingerprint into a separate task from recognition.

 * PatternMatch anchors do not fully support FPXML. Pattern Match anchor finding actions require field positions per fingerprint (variables like POSnnnn) in the Document Hierarchy. Datacap Studio strips field positions from the Document Hierarchy, if FPXML is selected in the Application Manager. You can apply a workaround by not selecting Enable FPXML in the Application Manager for applications that use PatternMatch anchors.

 * The configuration dialog for the ruleset Recognize Pages And Fields might lose previous settings when new settings are added. The issue can occur when the ruleset has settings configured using Datacap Studio or FastDoc. If the application is reopened in Datacap Studio or FastDoc and new settings are made, the previous settings can be lost if each DCO node is not visited while changing the settings in the ruleset configuration dialog. If you downloaded Datacap 9.0 software before November 28, you can apply the interim hotfix 9.0-RecognizePagesAndFields.Rul-Hotfix [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Enterprise%2BContent%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/Datacap+Taskmaster+Capture&release=All&platform=All&function=all]. to avoid this issue. The fix is included when you download Datacap 9.0 software on November 28 or later and in media labeled CN398ML.

 * FastDoc applications stop running during the VScan operation. When a non-supported file format, like datacap.log, is found in the image source folder when the Demo Multiformat job is reading the files, FastDoc hangs when it tries to run the VScan task. To work around this issue, see FastDoc applications stop running during VScan operation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043970].

 * The FastDoc field names are updated in the FastDoc documentation. The name of the Add Batch field on the Local Mode screen in FastDoc is changed to New Batch. For details see Updated field names in FastDoc documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044165].
