TPAEAPPDESIGNER TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When displaying my customized everyplace application why must I to scroll to view all of the screen? 

ANSWER
Mobile applications (applications using Everyplace) should not be designed
larger than the width of the device they will be used on. There is an
APAR that will allow app designer to show the screen width so that the
page can be designed for the proper width. The APAR also allows the user to
customize the size via metadata.
