APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Launcher ports not recognized,  Reason: Server is unable to get
   the status of the system on port number 7,042.  When launcher
   stop via line command, The compound system is not
   is not stopped (java exception) but launcher process is stopped.
   Launcher log also shows inability to recognize launcher ports.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00032783
   BD / LV
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers running Launcher on
   Linux operating system that does not support IPv6 protocol.
   
   Problem Description:
   On some Linux systems that do not have IPv6 support,
   launcher is failing to open server sockets needed for WTX
   monitoring tools. Getaddrinfo system call returns addrinfo for
   IPv6 AF family but socket system call fails with 97 or
   221 error (EAFNOSUPPORT).
   In order to help customer who experience this situation, WTX
   launcher provides special environment variable setting:
   LINUX_GETADDRINFO
   If LINUX_GETADDRINFO is set, it will force additional checks and
   will force IPv4 sockets in this case.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   1    LINUX (32 BITS)
   2    LINUX (64 BITS)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added code in launcher communication layer that will, if
   LINUX_GETADDRINFO is set, check can IPv6 family addr be used by
   calling socket function as a workaround for getaddrinfo
   behavior.
