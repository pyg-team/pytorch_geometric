APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We are experiencing errors when running a BPM process in
   Internet Explorer 8 (things appear fine in Firefox). At
   intermittant points when the user clicks a button or enters
   information that fires a boundary event in a Coach View (i.e.
   the process flow is meant to be returning to the server) a
   message is displayed
   
   "The Service you are trying to run has expired. Id is P1".
   
   Sometimes the P1 is replaced with P2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  "Service has expried" error shows when transiting from a coach
   that contains Table to another coach
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Coach that contains Stock control Table and Coach that has
   back-forward capability (e.g. has "Next" and "Back" button)
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   The dojo layer file dojo.js, in V8.0, doesn't contain all the
   dojo modules that are used by Table control. When dojo tries to
   download and parse the dojo  modules that are required by Table,
   problem occurs. Likely this is a dojo issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The solution for BPM V8.0 release is to make sure that dojo
   layer file, dojo.js, contains all the dojo modules that are
   requried by Table Control.
   
   
   FIX AVAILABILITY:
   Fix for 8.0 is available by applying fix for JR45092 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR45092], which
   supersedes this APAR fix. It is published on Fix Central,
   http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ .
   V8.0.1 doesn't have this issue, because we depend on a newer
   version of dojo which already packages dojo in a different way.
