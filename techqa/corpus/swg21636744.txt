 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I followed the install steps in the IBM Security Access Manager for Web Version 7.0 Installation Guide at,

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPREK_7.0.0.1/com.ibm.isam.doc_80/ameb_install_guide/task/tsk_linux_sms.html?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPREK_7.0.0.1/com.ibm.isam.doc_80/ameb_install_guide/task/tsk_linux_sms.html?lang=en]

but receive errors. 

SYMPTOM
The following errors may be seen, 

CRIMA1154E ERROR: Error installing.
ERROR: The silent installation process does not support installing packages that are contained on multiple media discs.

The 64-bit version of Installation Manager checks each package for 64-bit support. If a package does not support the 64-bit version, you receive a warning.

Use a 32-bit version of Installation Manager to install the package. 


CAUSE
WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment 8.0 requires the 32-bit installer on Linux 64-bit.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download the latest 32-bit installer for Linux from IBM Installation Manager page located at http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/All_download_links/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/All_download_links/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager] 


Install the necessary 32-bit libraries as documented in the TechNote titled Unable to install Installation Manager on RHEL 6.0/6.1 (64-bit) located at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21459143 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21459143]

In summary, the steps are,

1) Install 32-bit installer. For example,

Unzip agent.installer.linux.gtk.x86_1.6.1000.20121109_1537.zip to /WASND/installer
cd /WASND/installer
./install

2) Use the 32-bit installer launched from the Applications tab.

3) Register a repository in the installation manager GUI. by following,

Preferences ->
Repositories ->
Add ->
Navigate to where you unzipped all the WAS 8.0 ZIP files and select repository.config.

4) From the main GUI select,
