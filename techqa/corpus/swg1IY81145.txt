ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   Support Engineer: IH
   Change Team: GB
   .
   Environment: CEI 6 FP3, CARS
   .
   Problem Description:
   The Defect number is 310238 (WPS Family) or 152750/151924 (CEI
   Family) => CEI6003:CARS ND Clustered dep.Scripts must be
   generated on DMGR
   .
   In order to use CARS in a WAS ND clustered deployment, CARS
   needs CEI to generate scripts when the manager profile is
   augmented. The scripts should get created on the DMGR under the
   following location - "<was_home>\profiles\<DMGR>\event".
   CEI must generate scripts on DMGR when the manager profile is
   augmented
   .
   APAR/Defect: aixnm 152750
   .
   Symptoms:
   Create a Dmgr profile and augment with CEI. The event
   directory is not in the Dmgr profile directory.
   .
   Additional Information:
   Customers find that it is useful to have the event directory
   in Dmgr profile. The original design is
   that we don't need that. In the network deployment
   environment, customers can use the Dmgr profile to
   install CEI applications for other nodes.
   .
   Platforms/Binaries affected: All
   .
   Special installation instructions: None
   .
   Reproduction/Verification Steps:
   1. Create a Dmgr profile and augment CEI using CEI 6.0.0.2
   image. You will not see the event directory.
   Create a Dmgr profile and augment CEI using CEI 6.0.0.3
   image. You will see the event directory.
   .
   
   
   Test:
   1. Create a Dmgr profile and augment CEI using CEI 6.0.0.3
   image. You will see the event directory.
   .
   2. Unaugment CEI to make sure the event directory is deleted.
   .
   .
   Failure:
   1. Event directory does not exist. If the substitution is not
   correct for any of the following files:
       profile_path/event/dbconfig/logging.properties,
   config_event_database.[sh|bat], upgrade_event_database.[sh|bat]
       logging.properties:
          ##WAS_PROFILE_PATH# is replaced by actual WAS Profile
   PATH
   
       config_event_database.[sh|bat] and
   upgrade_event_database.[sh|bat
          ##WAS_PROFILE_PATH# is replaced by actual WAS Profile
   PATH
          ##CEI_HOME#         is replaced by actual CEI HOME PATH.
   
   .
   2. An error occurs or the event directory is not deleted.
   
   
   .
   Success:
   1. Event directory exists in the Dmgr profile directory. Make
   sure substitution is correct for the following files:
       profile_path/event/dbconfig/logging.properties,
   config_event_database.[sh|bat], upgrade_event_database.[sh|bat]
   .
   
   2. No error reported from the unaugment command and the event
   directory is removed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The CEI event directory does not exist in the DMGR profile
   directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The CEI event directory will now be created in the DMGR profile
   directory for both new and upgrade installations.
