RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Import the transport with correct settings as described below: 

 1. Delete the transport.
    Import delete transport ITMK711_00100_delete.
    
 2. Create file named transport.prop in SAP instance work directory, 
    /usr/sap/<SYSTEM ID>/<INSTANCE>/work, 
    and add the following setting to the file: 
    MAI_CONFIGURED = YES
    
 3. Now import transports as described in section 5.5 of 7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-FP0001:http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037991 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037991]
    
    After the import succeeds, restart the agent.
