APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the same GDG is referenced multiple times in a single jobstep
   (via different DD statements specifying different generations...
   for instance (+0) and (+1), That jobstep and all prior steps of
   the same job, other than the very first one, are shown as
   NON-RESTARTABLE in the RCL dialog, panel EQQMERSL.
   .
   In fact, there is no reason cleanup cannot be performed and this
   step (or any of the job's prior steps) cannot be restarted.  The
   TWSz RCL logic should be able to understand and handle this
   common JCL construction.
   CIRCUMVENTION:
   If RCLOPTS STEPRESCHK(NO) is set, the TWSz restartability
   validation logic is disabled and the operator is allowed to
   select any jobstep as the restart point.  However, users must
   be aware that in most cases, jobsteps flagged as non-restartable
   by TWSz are in fact not restartable, and selecting them as a
   restart point will result in the job's failing again when
   resubmitted -- as well as possible data corruption.

 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TWS for z/OS users.                      *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Problem with R&C function when the      *
   *                      same GDG dataset root is referenced     *
   *                      multiple times in a single jobstep.     *

   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY THE PTF FIXING THIS APAR               *
   ****************************************************************
   If in a single jobstep there are multiple references of GDGs
   with the same root, one of which has DISP=OLD and another one
   has DISP=NEW, then that jobstep and all prior steps of the same
   job, other than the very first one, are shown as NON-RESTARTABLE
   in the R&C dialog.
   In fact, in this situation, the GDG referenced with DISP=OLD
   erroneously resulted as not available. Consequently the step
   resulted as not executable and therefore all the previous ones
   were NON-RESTARTABLE.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a GDG is referenced in a step with DISP=OLD and:
   1. this step is flushed
   2. no other reference to this GDG in present in this run
   3. no information, about the GDG, is present in the previous
      run
   then the dataset will result available.
