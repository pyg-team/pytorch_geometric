PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why the IBM® Rational® ClearCase® Doctor (CCDOCTOR) will report an unknown WINS or DNS server name when there is no evidence that the IP Address is configured on the Microsoft® Windows® host. 

SYMPTOM
 

The following entry may be reported by ClearCase Doctor (but the local TCP/IP settings do not have a reference to this server):

This workstation has DNS enabled but the DNS server (or servers)

9.0.2.1

is(/are) unreachable.

CAUSE
 

Defect APAR PK41083 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK41083&rs=984] has been submitted to investigate this issue; however, the decision was made by Product Management to exclude the resolution of this defect from future upgrades and releases due to the significant architectural changes required to implement the solution.


Upon inspection you find there is no reference to this IP Address on your host in any of the TCP/IP properties related to your network connection.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21149303&amp;aid=3]

The reason this occurs is due to an entry in the registry that corresponds to this IP Address. ClearCase Doctor scans particular parts of the Windows registry for DNS and WINS server IP addresses to validate against. 

In some cases, the command ipconfig -all does not report the server IP as being configured for the TCP/IP settings, but the registry still has reference to this IP address.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

ClearCase Doctor is working as designed.


At some point on that host, the IP Address CCDoctor reports was used, and the Windows registry still holds a copy of the IP Address in its cache.


Note: This solution contains information about modifying the system registry. Before making any modifications to the Microsoft Registry Editor, it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of the existing registry. For more information describing how to back up the registry, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base article 256986 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986].


 1. Search the registry for the IP Address to confirm its existence.
    
    
 2. If the IP Address is in fact no longer currently used on the system, you can ignore the report.
