RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the Sybase Client version is 12.5: 

 1. Ensure the following environment variables are set in dsenv:
    
    # Define SYBASE variables
    
    SYBASE=/u1/sybase
    SYBASE_OCS=/u1/sybase/OCS-12_5
    export SYBASE SYBASE_OCS 
    
    # Define variable for Sybase Enterprise Stage
    
    PATH=$SYBASE_OCS/bin:$PATH
    export PATH
    
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SYBASE/OCS-12_5/lib:$SYBASE/OCS-12_5/lib3p;
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
 2. Issue the following command after logging on to the server and sourcing the dsenv:
    
    cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSComponents/bin/
    ldd sybaseoc.so



If you have upgraded to Sybase Client version 15: 
 1. Please refer to Sybase document "New Features SDK 15.0 and Open Server 15.0 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX."
    
    Basically, you need to run the script lnsyblibs (as ./lnsyblibs create) present under $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/scripts and the appropriate links are created.
