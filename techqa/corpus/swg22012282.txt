Text:
CVE-2017-3736; CVE-2017-3735 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on August 28, November 2, and December 7, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Rational ClearCase. IBM Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the "error state" mechanism when directly calling SSL_read() or SSL_write() for an SSL object after receiving a fatal error. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the decryption or encryption process and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) 

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. 

Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions:



Version Status 9.0.1 through 9.0.1.2 Affected 9.0 through 9.0.0.6 Affected 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.16 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Affected 
Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: 
 1. You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    
 2. You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
    
 3. On UNIX/Linux clients, you use the Change Management Integration (CMI), when configured to use SSL to communicate with the server.
    Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
    
 4. You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections.
