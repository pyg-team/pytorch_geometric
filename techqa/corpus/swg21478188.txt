Title: IBM Creating Graphs with Multiple lines using Legacy Dialogs & Chart Builder in SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS 15 and using the dataset 1991 U.S. General Social Survey.

I want to produce line graphs with multiple lines. The variables I use are both scale (age & educ).

I produce the graph as below

1) Graphics->Legacy Dialogs->Line->Multiple->Set to "summaries for groups of case" and click on Define.
2) Select "age" into Category Axis and "educ" into Define Lines By and generate the graph.

However, using Chart Builder->Lines->Multiple and selecting age as x-axis and using educ as the set color will not allow this action. I do not know why the legacy graph will allow multiple lines that are scale and Chart builder will not. I do know if the you change the variable measure from scale to nominal or ordinal you will be able to place the variable into the color category.

Why? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Chart Builder is a new feature of SPSS. It is SPSS' first graphics engine that will distinguish the difference between the measure of a variable. The color feature for the Chart Builder is meant to break the line up into different categories, thus SPSS would expect a categorical variable used. Since a scaled variable is not a categorical variable, SPSS will not allow such a variable to be used. If you would like to use a scale variable in the color, you can change the variable measure both in the Custom Tables dialog and in syntax
