PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using wTM API /ServicewTM.svc/Session/Logon with a valid body and header, the http response code is 400 (failure) on IBM Datacap 9.0.0.X or 9.0.1. 

SYMPTOM

CAUSE
The dc_KTF.xml file needs to be copied from the Taskmaster server to each client folder for decryption purposes to include FastDoc, DStudio, RV2\bin, DcDesktop, and tmweb.net, and wTM\bin. 

Note: The Fingerprint service does not require it.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

 2. Paste into C:\Datacap\wTM\bin 
 3. Restart Datacap Taskmaster Server 
 4. Restart the IIS server
