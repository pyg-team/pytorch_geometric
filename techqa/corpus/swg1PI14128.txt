ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   Attempts to install or upgrade to IBM Rational Software
   Architect (RSA) 9.0.0.1 results in the error message:
   CRIMA1161E: Failed to find required installation files when
   using a local repository.
   
   
   Error Description:
   Steps to reproduce the problem:
   
   1. Install RSA 9.0.0.0 with additional national languages such
   as French and/or Italian.
   2. Download the RSA 9.0.0.1 from fixCentral:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm
   ~Rational?product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Software+Architect?relea [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Rational?product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Software+Architect?relea]
   se=9.0.0.1?platform=All?function=all
   3. Unzip the download disks: rsa9001.update.disk1.zip and
   rsa9001.update.disk2.zip to the same directory
   4. Point IBM Installation Manager (IM) to the disk1 of the
   unzipped content.
   5. Upgrade RSA 9.0.0.0 to 9.0.0.1.
   Actual Result:
   The upgrade fails with the message:
   
   CRIMA1161E: Failed to find required installation files
     Explanation: Installation Manager did not find required
   installation files from the repository.An issue has occurred
   with the package that cannot be resolved by Installation
   Manager.
   
     User Action: If the repository files were transferred from a
   different location before the installation, verify that the
   files were not altered during the transfer operation. Copy the
   repository files to a different location and install from that
   location.  If the repository files were not transferred note the
   package name and version number and contact customer support.

   The same error happens if you try to directly install RSA
   9.0.0.1 pointing to the local repositories of both RSA 9.0.0 and
   9.0.0.1
   
   WORKAROUND:
   Use the online repositories of RSA 9.0.0.1 selecting the 'Search
   service repositories during installation and updates' in the IM
   repositories preferences page.
   If you cannot use the online repositories, please contact IBM
   Rational Client support to get a fix.
