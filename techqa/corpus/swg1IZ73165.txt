ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITNMv3.8 FP2 Build51
   
   We have ISIS agents in our discovery and they retrieve ISIS
   information. However the data available it is not fully modelled
   within NCIM  :  The ISIS data downloaded by the ExperimentalISIS
   and CiscoISISTelnet agent is stored within the
   master.entityByName table in ncp_model but it's not used to
   build ISIS entities. This was true when it was first implemented
   in ITNM IP 3.7 and is still true today. To date we've had no
   committed plans to model these entities. The view you're seeing
   is automatically generated because their is a collection type
   isisLevel object in the entityType table in NCIM (it's not in
   any way driven from the presence of the two agents already
   mentioned) and this view should not be available (this is a
   bug). We will remove this view type from the next 3.8 fixpack to
   avoid further confusion.
