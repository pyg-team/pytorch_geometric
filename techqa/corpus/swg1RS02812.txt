APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rule Designer, there is currently no error reported on two
   variables sharing the same verbalization. Thus from Rule
   Designer you can deploy a ruleApp having variables sharing the
   same verbalization without any error.
   However, the same ruleApp will not deploy from the Business
   Console, and in the Business Console, the deployment report
   will show "Variable A has the same verbalization as variable B",
   
    and deployment will fail from the Business Console.
   Duplicate verbalization should be reported in error in Rule
   Designer as well.
   In ODM versions prior to 8.8, duplicate verbalization were not
   reported as errors and did not prevent ruleApps from deploying,
   
   but then at execution time, the compiler seemed to pick a
   variable silently and arbitrarily, which was sometimes leading
   to the wrong one being executed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Rule Designer, there was no error reported when two
   variables share the same verbalization. Thus from Rule Designer
   a RuleApp could be deployed to Decision Center. However, the
   same Rule App couldn't be deployed from the Business Console.
   The deployment fails with the following error  "Variable A has
   the same verbalization as variable B".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed.
