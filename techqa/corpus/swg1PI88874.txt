APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When RuleBased Analysis is executed on all the resources with
   some rules an insufficient resource error occurs.
   When selecting about 100 programs, there are no problems.  But
   when selecting all sources (more than 20,000 COBOL programs),
   this error results:
   "The query processor ran out of internal resources and could
   not produce a query plan. This is a rare event and only
   expected for extremely complex queries or queries that
   reference a very large number of tables or partitions. Please
   simplify the query. If you believe you have received this
   message in error, contact Customer Support Services for
   more information."
