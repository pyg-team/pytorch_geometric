Title: IBM Message ID: CRIMG1029E - unable to launch Packaging Utility as a non-administrator user - United States

Text:
pu; packaging utility; CRIMG1029E; root ; administrator; non-admin; IM TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When an administrator account is used to install IBM Packaging Utility, non administrator users cannot launch Packaging Utility. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are alternatives to the instructions provided in error message CRIMG1029E. 
Option #1 - User can install and run Packaging Utility without using a root account: 

 1. As non-admin user, install IBM Installation Manager by running userinst 
 2. Launch Installation Manager (non-admin version) > Install Packaging Utility 


Option #2 - User can redirect the application data location by using the -data option:  1. Open a terminal window 
 2. Go to /Applications/IBM/PackagingUtility/IBMPU.app/Contents/MacOS
    Note: The Packaging Utility default install directory for other supported UNIX platforms is /opt/IBM/Packaging Utility/ 
 3. Run ./IBMPU -data <your new location>
    Note: Users cannot use a system variable to specify the application data location: ./IBMPU -data $HOME/var/ibm/PackagingUtility


Option #2 saves disk space if there is another version of Installation Manager that is owned by root. Since this option allows users to choose a location for the application data; the users must inform IBM Support staff if this has been used when contacting IBM for Packaging Utility issues.
