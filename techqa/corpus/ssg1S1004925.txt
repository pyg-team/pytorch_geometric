 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Vulnerabilities in Network Security Services (NSS) and Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2013-1740 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1740]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Network Security Services could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the ssl_Do1stHandshake() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to return unencrypted, unauthenticated data from PR_Recv.
Affected Versions: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90394 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90394] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1490 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1490]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox,Thunderbird and SeaMonkey, using the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
Affected Versions: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4
CVSS Base Score: 9.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90885 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90885] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1544 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1544]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the PK11_ImportCert() function when adding NSSCertificate structures. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
Affected Versions: NSS 3.x used in Firefox before 31.0, and Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7 
CVSS Base Score: 9.3
