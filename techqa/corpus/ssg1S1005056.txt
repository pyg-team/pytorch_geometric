 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects DS8000 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0235 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235]
DESCRIPTION:The gethostbyname functions of the GNU C Library (glibc) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the "Ghost" vulnerability.

CVSS Base Score: 7.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix DS8000 CVE_GHOST_PATCH_v1.0.iso N/A 02/11/2015 
The above patch is applicable to VRMFs R4.3- 64.36.xx.xx, R6.3 - 76.31.xx.xx / 86.31.xx.xx, and R7.x 87.21.xx.xx/ 87.3x.xx.xx / 87.4x.xx.xx and is applied to the attached HMCs. 

This security bulletin will be updated with the specific service release levels for DS8870,DS8880,DS8700 and DS8100/DS8300 as these are made available. 


Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting the HMC after upgrading is suggested. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
