Title: IBM CF upgrade fails with "the implementation does not exist" error - United States

Text:
upgrade; CF; the implementation does not exist TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When attempting to upgrade Portal to the latest CF you may receive the following error message or something similar...

[null] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[null] The extension post-apply-PTF is registered for component
wp.bp.feedspace but the implementation does not exist.
[null] The component wp.bp.feedspace must implement the target
action-post-apply-PTF-applyPTFStatic-wp.bp.feedspace

SYMPTOM
The CONFIG-WP-PTF-CF task fails with the following in the ConfigTrace.log...

[null] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[null] The extension post-apply-PTF is registered for component
wp.bp.feedspace but the implementation does not exist.
[null] The component wp.bp.feedspace must implement the target
action-post-apply-PTF-applyPTFStatic-wp.bp.feedspace


CAUSE
This indicates that an extension is not properly defined in the config on this Portal environment. Most likely the ConfigEngine registry.xml is incorrect and needs to be rebuilt.

ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8001
AIX

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the ConfigTrace.log to see the error. If possible, compare the /<portal_profile_root>/ConfigEngine/registry.xml from the failing system to environment that has been successfully upgraded to the same CF level.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please follow these instructions to rebuild the registry.xml...

Execute the following ConfigEngine command to clear the ConfigEngine
registry:

Unix/Linux: <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh -uninstall
-offeringList PortalServer -unregisterOnly
Windows: <profile_root>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.bat -uninstall
-offeringList PortalServer -unregisterOnly
IBM i: <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh -uninstall
-offeringList PortalServer -unregisterOnly

Execute the following ConfigEngine command to repopulate the
ConfigEngine registry:

Unix/Linux: <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh -install
-offeringRoot portal_install_root -installPath portal_install_root
-expandBinaries false
Windows: <profile_root>\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.bat -install
-offeringRoot portal_install_root -installPath portal_install_root
-expandBinaries false
IBM i: <profile_root>/ConfigEngine/ConfigEngine.sh -install
-offeringRoot portal_install_root -installPath portal_install_root
-expandBinaries false

where portal_install_root is your actual Portal Installation root, for
example /opt/IBM/WebSphere/PortalServer. Please Note: Do not add a
trailing '/' at the end of the path variable, portal_install_root .
Adding a '/' at the end will cause a misconfiguration that will impact
future Portal operations. Please use the syntax as shown in the example
provided.

After the registry is re-built, please re-run the CONFIG-WP-PTF-CF task

Additional details of this procedure can be found in the README of the CF.
