APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Abstract:
   =================
   An unmanaged orbtrc log is created by the ITCAM TEMA agent when
   Extreme Scale monitoring is enabled
   
   ---------------------------------
   Users Affected:
   ===============
   Users with ITCAM TEMA set up to monitor WXS with multiple
   catalog servers
   
   ---------------------------------
   Problem Description:
   ====================
   When monitoring of an Extreme Scale environment is enabled via
   the TEMA, a WebSphere generated log called orbtrace.*.log is
   created in the $CANDLEHOME/$ARCH/yn directory. It is not
   possible to control the location or size of this file, and this
   can lead to the file eventually filling up diskspace
   .
   Some parameters are needed to allow the user to set the location
   of this file and to be able to turn it on or off if needed
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  (1) Put the following settings into kynwb.properties:
   
   -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output=../logs/kyn-orb-trc.log
   -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug=message
   -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.CommTrace=false
   
   (2) restart the agent.
   
   (3) The log file will now be created in:
   <ITM_HOME>/logs/kyn-orb-trc.log and will contain less info
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users monitoring WebSphere Extreme Scale zone.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ORB trace file with name like:
   * orbtrc.NNNNNNNN.NNNN.NN.txt, containing exceptions from Object
   * Request Broker grows rapidly.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update KYN agent to version 7.1.0.3 IF3
   * or newer.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  KYN agent uses internally the library, which generates
   log file, unmanaged by KYN. In most cases, if a communication
   problem occurs, relevant information will be stored directly
   in KYN agent log files. Log file orbtrc.*.txt is now switched
   off by redirection to /dev/null (NUL on Windows).
   It may be turned on anytime, by modification of output file name
   in kynwb.properties to a choosen value:
   -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output=output_file_name
