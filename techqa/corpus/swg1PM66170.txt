ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Headline:
   Editing the column name in Table Object does not follow window
   standards
   
   APAR Error Description:
   Abstract: Attempts to edit column names of the grid elements
   does not follow windows standards
   Problem: Cannot see where cursor is when editing column name
   
   
   When editing an Attribute Name or Data (Data Element name) (in
   Logical Data Model) or Column Name (in Physical Data Model) or
   some other properties in the Grid
   view of Attribute List, the highlight and cursor are not
   windows standard
   
   Problem is that the text remains all highlighted even when
   editing the text
   
   
   The bigger issue is that when you try to highlight a part of the
   text to copy or to delete it, you cannot see which part is
   highlighted and therefore will be copied/ deleted   it all shows
   as highlighted. This is contrary to how a normal Windows
   text-type control behaves.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   1. Open any encyclopedia containg LDM/PDM for E.g. Samples
   2. I have used samples at my end. Open the PDM called Hotel
   Reservation System
   3. Edit any Table object
   4. Under the Columns Tab try to edit the Column called Name and
   notice thst it does not follow windows standards.

   As described, the problem is that a text string within a
   cell of SA's edit grid is initially displayed with the
   entire string in a "selected" state. Furthermore, it stays
   fully selected even while manual mouse or keyboard
   selections are attempted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem was introduced when SA was upgraded to support
   the bi-directional languages of Hebrew and Arabic.
   
   The error was traced to a single line of code that was
   inadvertently deleted during SA's "bidi" upgrade. That line
   was restored with this fix.
   
   Interestingly, the problem shows up only when Windows is set
   to work in English, but not when set to work in Hebrew.
