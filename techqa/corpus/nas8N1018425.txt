PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document contains information on IBM AnyNet requirements and problem resolution 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Important Note: Starting in i 7.1, AnyNet (a method used to run SNA communications traffic over IP) is no longer supported. Users of AnyNet are encouraged to migrate to Enterprise Extenders as a replacement. For information about migrating to Enterprise Extenders from AnyNet, see the Migrating from AnyNet to Enterprise Extender topic in the IBM i Information Center. 
The IBM OS/400 or IBM i5/OS system requirements for IBM AnyNet connection to OEM products or hardware are as follows: 1 TCP must be configured and running properly. 2 Network Attribute, Allow AnyNet Support (ALWANYNET) has been set to *YES. 3 Verify that there is only one active QAPPCTCP job in Subsystem QSYSWRK. 4 Key WRKTCPSTS OPTION(*CNN) or key NETSTAT <enter>, and select Option 3.

There should be two entries for APPCove, one in Listen State and one in UDP state:

* * APPCove > 002:34:05 Listen 
* * APPCove > 002:07:24 *UDP If all of the four conditions above are met, the OS/400 or i5/OS system is configured for AnyNet and is functional. There may be some additional requirements for your OEM product or hardware. These requirements should be provided or defined by that provider.  *   * 
   
   

Note: It is possible to have existing AnyNet conversations if the QAPPCTCP job is not running. Changing the network attribute for ALLOW ANYNET to *NO terminates these working conversations. Please verify that it is okay to change the attribute (with the potential of knocking off working users) prior to the change. 

AnyNet Problem Determination 1 If the above requirements have been met, do the following for additional problem determination:

a. Has this AnyNet connection worked in the past? If so, when did it stop working?
b. Do we have any messages related to these controllers and devices?
c. Are there any entries in the Problem Log related to the associated line, controller or devices?
d. Are there any entries in the Licensed Internal Code Log?
- Log entries that can be related to an OS/400 AnyNet code problem are:

Major code 0700 or 0701 Minor code 0001
0700 or 0701 0004
0700 or 0701 0080
0700 or 0701 0081
0300 0210
0700 or 0701 0013
0700 or 0701 0014

These codes would be significant only if they were logged at the approximate time the AnyNet connection failed.

e. Are there any messages in the QAPPCTCP job in subsystem QSYSWRK?
f. Are there active QTGTELNETS jobs in subsystem QSYSWRK?
g. Is it possible to PING in both directions using the fully qualified host name (rmtlocname.rmtnetid.sna.ibm.com)?
h. If the 0700 0013 or 0700 014 , 0701 0013 or 0701 0014 found check for duplicate T2 task. T2 task represent the APPC controller. For Rel V410 and higher the task can be found with Display Alter Dump and will have these task as T2- xxxxxx (xxxx= the APPC/AnyNet controller name). 2 Make sure that you have the latest OS/400 or i5/OS AnyNet and T2 task PTFs applied. These PTFs can be found on the following Web site:

You should be prepared to provide your customer number, and system serial number. You may be referred to a consulting agreement if the Technical Support specialist determines that the problem you are experiencing is not a problem on the OS/400 or i5/OS. Below are some of the known internet addresses for OEM product and hardware providers.
