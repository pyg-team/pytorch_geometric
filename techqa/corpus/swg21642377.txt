Title: IBM Web searches not returning results - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
An application with a full text index is searched from Notes, and then from the web. From Notes, the search results in a set of document returned for a given query, but from the web no documents are returned.

SYMPTOM
An application with a full text index is searched from Notes, and then from the web. From Notes, the search results in a set of document returned for a given query, but from the web no documents are returned. 


CAUSE
A search from the web is often done by using a form, such as $$SearchTemplateDefault. The form will specify the view to search. If the form is not searching the same view as is searched by the Notes client, you may see different results.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can enable a web browser debugger like Fiddler in order to see the complete search string submitted by the browser when searching from the search form. The view being searched will be included in the URL. 

You can also enable Full Text Index debug on the server, and observe the output from the debug when searching from Notes and the web. The debug setting of debug_FTV_search=1 can be set dynamically from the Domino server console. You can then verify if the same search string is being processed in the same manner. The debug output will report how many documents were found by the search, and then if there were factors that would cause them not to be returned in the result set. If the output reports "XX documents disqualified by NIF", this is indicative of documents that were found in the database, but were not present in the view being searched.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using search views with the same selection formula in the Notes client and in the web search should produce identical results. This also presumes the same ID is used, and the database access level is the same between the Notes client and the web client.
