 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 A user is still able to log onto the Cognos portal even though "Disable this entry" has been set on the account properties in IBM Cognos Administration. 

CAUSE
In this case, the applicable user account was still enabled in the third-party authentication source.

ANSWER
IBM Cognos 8 does not check whether an entry has been disabled in the portal during authentication requests. All authentication requests are passed directly to the third-party authentication source defined in the Namespace. 

In order to disable access to IBM Cognos 8 then disable the applicable user account in the third-party authentication source.

The reason IBM Cognos 8 does not refer to the "Disable this entry" property is because it is not a security property; instead it is used to prevent users from accessing the object it is set on. 

When an entry is disabled it can only be accessed if a user has write permission to the object, otherwise, it is hidden to users. 

Disabling entries is useful when wanting to perform maintenance operations. For example it may be desirable to disable a folder while the content is reorganized.
