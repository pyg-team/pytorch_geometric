QUESTION
 How do I know which Connect:Direct z/OS Secure+ cipher suites are available to me? 

ANSWER


In the Connect:Direct initialization parameters code 'DEBUG=8C0000AE'. Trace DD R0000001 will be dynamically allocated and cipher suite information, such as that in the following example, will be written to the DD:

"Locally available cipher suites are(0504352F0A090306020100)"

05 SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
04 SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
35 SSL_RSA_AES_256_SHA
2F SSL_RSA_AES_128_SHA
0A SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
09 SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
03 SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
06 SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5
02 SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
01 SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5

NOTE: Be sure to go to the ADMIN, MODIFY screen in the IUI and turn off the tracing to avoid JES spool filling up with trace data.
