RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

What do you do when you get a message indicating that internal objects are damaged? The messages may 
be:

CPF8A46 - Internal system objects are damaged.
CPF9032 - Document interchange session not started.

Here are the steps:

Step 1 - Run DMPDLO *INT

This will create six spool files that can be analyzed by a specialist. Be sure to keep these files on the spool 
queue, or to save the printouts. Some of the pages will need to be faxed into support.

Step 2 - Run RCLDLO *INT (or IPL the system)

This step is required to be able to use OV/400 or Client Access. It does not require a dedicated system, but 
it will require that everyone be out of OV/400 and out of Client Access (subsystems QSERVER and 
QSNADS will need to be ended). For most customers, this would be the definition of a dedicated system. 
The IPL will run a RCLDLO *INT automatically, so it does not matter whether you run RCLDLO *INT or IPL.

There are some damage conditions that may require a RCLDLO *ALL. This will take quite a bit longer than 
RCLDLO *INT. It is difficult to estimate how long a RCLDLO *ALL will run, but we have found it can 
process from 2,000 to 15,000 documents per hour (the faster the system, the more documents per hour).

Step 3 - Run DSPPTF 5769SS1 OUTPUT(*PRINT) where 5716SS1 is the appropriate component ID.

This will print a PTF listing that will tell which Cumulative Tape has been loaded, and will list any individual 
PTFs that are already on the system. This will be necessary to determine which PTFs are already on the 
system and to verify that they are applied correctly.

Call Support Line (1-800-IBM-SERV and select the appropriate option), and ask for OS/400 support. One of
the specialists will assist in determining if there is already a PTF to solve the problem. 

The DMPDLO *INT reports will identify which internal object is damaged, and what job/program damaged it.
