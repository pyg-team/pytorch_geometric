APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Because the action of updating process instance variables is not
   correctly authorized, users without required permission can
   update process instance variables in IBM Business Process
   Manager.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) provides a REST API to update
   process instance variables that applies insufficient
   authorization checks.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6 and V8.5.7 that adds an
   authorization check for the REST API. This check verifies that
   the user is either an IBM BPM admin or member of the IBM Process
   Portal admin team that is defined for the process application
   containing the process instance. As long as no IBM Process
   Portal admin team is defined, you can authorize additional users
   by setting the ACTION_UPDATE_INSTANCE_VARIABLE action policy.
   
   If set to "false", the members defined for an action policy can
   perform the corresponding action, regardless of whether the
   Portal Admin Team is defined.
