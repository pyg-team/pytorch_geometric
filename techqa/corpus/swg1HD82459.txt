ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Open a part via SmarTeam take a long time while
   an assembly is opened
   environment:
   SmarTeam V5R17SP8 + Hotfix1 + Hotfix3
   Inventor 2008 SP3 (reproduced also with Inventor
   2008 SP2)
   It reproduced using a big assembly (which includes
   over hundreds components).
   The Assembly attached is Personal Computer.iam
   Simple part attached is test_part.ipt; test_part1.ipt
   Scenario 1:
   0. SmarTeam Editor and Inventor are opened.
   1. Open this assembly in Inventor (you don't need
   save this assembly in SmarTeam, just open it as
   natural Inventor file)
   2. Then In SmarTeam Editor, open a simple
   Inventor Part via SmarTeam tree pop menu -> File
   Operation -> Open.
   KO: you can see the opening process takes long
   time (bso: in my tests it took about 5 s)
   3. Close the big assembly in Inventor Session.
   Close that simple part just opened via SmarTeam
   4. Then open that simple Inventor Part via
   SmarTeam tree pop menu -> File Operation ->
   Open again
   OK: you can see the opening process takes short
   time (bso: in my tests it took less than 1 s)
   ADDITIONAL AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND
   ADDITIONAL SCENARIO 2:
   When an assembly is opened, and not any part is
   opened yet in Inventor,
   the opening of the first part via SmarTeam takes
   long time, after that part is opened,
   to open any other parts via SmarTeam takes
   normal time.
   when not any assembly is opened in Inventor, the
   opening of any part has no issue.
   It is not easy to see this issue, it reproduced using
   a big assembly (which includes over hundreds
   components).
   The Assembly attached is Personal Computer.iam
   Scenario 2:
   0. SmarTeam Editor and Inventor are opened.
   1. Open this assembly in Inventor (you don't need
   save this assembly in SmarTeam, just open it as
   natural Inventor file)
   2. Then In SmarTeam Editor, open a simple
   Inventor Part via SmarTeam tree pop menu -> File
   Operation -> Open.
   KO: you can see the opening process takes long
   time (bso: in my tests it took about 5 s)
   3. DO NOT close the big assembly in Inventor
   Session. Do NOT close that simple part just opened
   via SmarTeam
   4. Then open ANOTHER simple Inventor Part via
   SmarTeam tree pop menu -> File Operation ->
   Open
   OK: you can see the opening process takes short
   time (bso: in my tests it took about 1 s)
   It shows that real problem exists while we are
   opening FIRST PART VIA SmarTeam WHILE THE
   BIG ASSEMBLY IS OPENED, and there is
   some unneeded interacting with the opened
   assembly.
   While even the big Assembly is opened and after
   that some Part is also opened via SmarTeam,
   opening ADDITIONAL Part via SmarTeam TAKES
   NORMAL TIME (as about 1 s).
