 *  Problem description
   
   mySAP 06.20.00.07 on AIX 6.1 64bit (have IF0014 but not applied

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IV15697: FUI Time and FENetTime values are zero
   
   
    Why are the values for Front-End Network Time and GUI-Time
   zeroes?  Is this because SAP is not tracking this metric and
   providing it to mySAP?
   
   If we compare the values of Transaction Performance attribute
   with  sap ST03N output then this will give mismatch values which
   is reported by customer.
