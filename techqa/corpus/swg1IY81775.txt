APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Security amnual uses the term digital signature. This is
   incorrect in the context where it is used.

   USERS AFFECTED:
   Platforms affected:
    All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The following paragraph claims that SSL signs each message
   using a digital certificate.
   
    WebSphere MQ Security Manual
     Chapter 4 - The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
      How SSL provides integrity
   
   This paragraph provides further information about the
   implementation.
   
   WebSphere MQ Security Manual
    Chapter 3 - Cryptographic concepts
     Digital signatures
   
   
   The process described in the above manual section, and the
   actual implementation, would be better described as a message
   authentication code (MAC).
   
   MACs are used to verify data integrity and authenticity.
   However, they differ from digital signatures, as MAC values are
   both computed and verified using the same secret key.
   
   When using TLS, HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code -
   a hash-function based type of MAC) is applied to all messages
   in the SSL session.
   
   When using SSLV2 or SSLV3, MAC is applied. Note that WebSphere
   MQ v5.3 uses SSLV3 (not TLS) for all Cipher Specs.
   As such, the manual's description of the WMQ process as being
   a 'digital signature' is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The manual sections identified above should be corrected to
   properly identify the process involved as MAC, rather than
   digital signature.
