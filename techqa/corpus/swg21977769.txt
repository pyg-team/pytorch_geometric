 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 ARA 5.1 introduces IE 11 support and removes support for previous releases of IE such as v9 and v10. IE is the only supported we browser for ARA 5.1

However when IE 11 is used to connect to the ARA server, the following message is displayed:

"Browser Compatibility: Algo Risk is compatible with the following browser(s): - Internet Explorer 11".

How do I fix this? 

CAUSE
It is likely that IE 11 has been enabled with Compatibility Mode, which causes IE 11 to behave like a IE9 or IE10 web browser.

ANSWER
From IE 11 settings (cog) button, go to the "Compatibility View Settings" and ensure compatibility view is not enabled for the ARA webserver host/domain. 

It may also be necessary to ensure the "F12 developer tools" are also not set to emulate an earlier version of IE.
