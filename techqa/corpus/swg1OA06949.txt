PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For the SQL 7 install, in Appendix B, page 339, step 13:
   --------------------------------------------------------
   
   "13. From the Services Accounts dialog, keep the default value:
   Use the same account for each service. For Service Settings,
   click Use the Local System account. Click Next.
   Notes:
   a. If you plan on using the Automated Line of Business
   and/or the Problem Management /Automatic Ticketing and Change
   Management features, you will need to use the Local
   Administrator Account as the Log on as: account for the
   Microsoft SQL Server Service. This is due to a problem with
   Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 with the Microsoft SQL Server 7.0
   Service Pack 4 applied.
   b. A utility program supplied by Microsoft called dcomcnfg.exe
   can be used to adjust the security rights a login can have for
   DCOM launching and access. Below are the instructions from the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base article #323287 to set default
   permissions for all DCOM programs on a server:
   1) Click Start, click Run, type dcomcnfg, and then click OK.
   2) Click the Default Security tab.
   3) Under Default Access Permissions, under Default Launch
   Permissions, and under Default Configuration Permissions,
   click Edit Default to set default permissions.
   4) If appropriate, click Add to add other user accounts to the
   Name Box.
   5) In the Name box, select the user or group whose default
   permissions you want to change.
   6) In the Type of Access box, select an access type for the
   selected user or group."
   
   should now read as:
   
   "13. From the Services Accounts dialog, keep the default value:
   Use the same account for each service. For Service Settings,
   click Use a Domain User account. Enter Username, Password and
   Domain information for a user that has administrative rights
   across all TBSM servers. Click Next.
   
   Note:
   A utility program supplied by Microsoft called dcomcnfg.exe
   can be used to adjust the security rights a login can have for
   DCOM launching and access. Below are the instructions from the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base article #323287 to set default
   permissions for all DCOM programs on a server:
   1) Click Start, click Run, type dcomcnfg, and then click OK.
   2) Click the Default Security tab.
   3) Under Default Access Permissions, under Default Launch
   Permissions, and under Default Configuration Permissions,
   click Edit Default to set default permissions.
   4) If appropriate, click Add to add other user accounts to the
   Name Box.
   5) In the Name box, select the user or group whose default
   permissions you want to change.
   6) In the Type of Access box, select an access type for the
   selected user or group."
   
   
   For the SQL 2000 install, in Appendix C, page 345, step 13:
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   "13. From the Services Accounts dialog, keep the default value:
   Use the same account for each service. Auto start SQL Server
   Service. For Service Settings, click Use the Local System
   account. Click Next."
   
   should now read as:
   
   "13. From the Services Accounts dialog, keep the default value:
   Use the same account for each service. For Service Settings,
   click Use a Domain User account. Enter Username, Password and
   Domain information for a user that has administrative rights
   across all TBSM servers. Click Next."
