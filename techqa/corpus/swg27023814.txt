Title: IBM Running P8 Client Applications with WebSphere Application Server 8.0.0.x - United States

Text:
 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 In order to use Workplace or Workplace XT without SSL or in an SSO/Container Managed configuration with WebSphere Application Server version 8.0.0.x or higher, security settings must be updated. These settings permit non-SSL connections to P8 Content Engine and allow container-managed applications to pass HTTP session information to an applet. 

CONTENT
Ensuring consistency for P8 Content Engine and Workplace/Workplace XT SSL Settings 

In WebSphere Application Server 8, the default settings for Security > Global Security > RMI/IIOP Security > Inbound and Outbound communications have changed. 

The CSIv2 Transport Layer >Transport default setting in WebSphere Application Server 8.0.0.x changed to SSL-Required. Workplace and Workplace XT work with this new setting (if the P8 environment is running SSL communication between the Content Engine and Workplace/Workplace XT server), but also continue to work in the previous default (SSL-supported). The settings between the Content Engine WebSphere Application Server instance and the Workplace/Workplace XT WebSphere Application Server instance must match for a successful sign-in to occur. 

If you are not running SSL, ensure that the SSL required option is turned off for both the server and client properties. This option is located at: WebSphereInstall\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\properties\sas.client.props

Verify the following setting and restart the application server:
com.ibm.CSI.performTransportAssocSSLTLSRequired=false

These changes should also be made to the Enterprise Records or Records Manager web application in the WebSphere 8 administrative console, if using IBM Enterprise Records.

Enabling Java Applet support

To prevent applet sessions from failing, you must disable the relevant HTTP Only settings for your deployment.


 1. Enable cookies and disable HTTP Only setting for the deployed application.  1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server admin console. 
     2. Navigate to Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > Workplace XT > Session management. 
        
        For Workplace: Navigate to Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > Workplace > Session management. 
         1. Under General properties, check the box Override session management and click Apply. 
         2. Click the Enable cookies link under Session tracking mechanism. 
         3. Under General properties, uncheck the box Set session cookies to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks and click Apply. 
            
        
        
     3. Navigate to Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > Workplace XT > Manage Modules > Workplace XT > Session Management. 
        
        For Workplace: Navigate to Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > Workplace > Manage Modules > Workplace > Session Management.
         1. Under General properties, check the box Override session management and click Apply. 
         2. Click the Enable cookies link under Session tracking mechanism. 
         3. Under General properties, uncheck the box Set session cookies to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks and click Apply. 
            
        
        
    
    
 2. Disable HTTP Only settings globally for SSO.
    
    Note: This step is required for all Workplace XT deployments. Skip this step for Workplace (Application Engine), unless you are using SSO or a Container Managed configuration.
     1. Navigate to Security > Global security > Authentication > Web and SIP security > Single sign-on (SSO). 
     2. Under General properties, uncheck the box Set security cookies to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks and click Apply. 
        
    
    
 3. Enable cookies and disable HTTP Only settings at the server level setting when using SSL.
     1. Navigate to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers. 
     2. Select the server where Workplace/Workplace XT is deployed. 
     3. Click Session Management. 
     4. Click the Enable cookies link under Session tracking mechanism. 
     5. Uncheck the box Set session cookies to HTTP Only to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
        
    
    
 4. Save the settings to the master configuration. 
    
 5. Restart the WebSphere Application Server.
