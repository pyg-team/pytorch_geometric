   issues an EXEC CICS WEB CONVERSE command.  The WRITE or SEND
   part of this command does not get a response in the 30 second
   DTIMOUT value, and th task ends up abending AEXZ.  This is a
   severe abend code for a timeout condition.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An application in CICS does an EXEC CICS WEB CONVERSE.
   The transaction has DTIMOUT set to 30 and RTIMOUT set to 0.
   
   The connection to the remote server uses SSL.  At the end of
   the SSL handshake the remote server fails to respond.
   The CICS request times out after 30 seconds as defined in
   DTIMOUT.  The timeout is percolated back up the stack and
   eventually DFHWBCL returns WBCL_EXCEPTION/WBCL_TIMED_OUT to
   DFHEIWB.
   
   DFHEIWB does not handle this exception response on the
   SEND part of a CONVERSE command.  The task abends in AEXZ.
