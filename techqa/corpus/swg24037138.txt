INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 

Review the update instructions [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/rational/rdz/90/updates/install_instructions/9012_interim_fix1/install_instructions.html] to apply the interim fix. Review the Installing [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/ratdevz/v9r0/topic/com.ibm.etools.rdz.installing.doc/topics/czdinstallintro.html] page in the information center for new installations.

This interim fix is provided as an update and installed using IBM Installation Manager. You can install the update directly from the IBM update server or download an archive file that contains the update and then use IBM Installation Manager to perform local installations.

It is recommended that the install is performed by connecting to the IBM update server, but an archive file that contains the update is available for those who may need it for the following reasons: 

 * Would like to download Rational Developer for System z interim fix 1, but install at a later time.
 * Have slow or unstable internet connections and would like to use a download manager with resume capability.
 * Have trouble accessing the live IBM update server from behind firewalls.
 * Are site administrators for a group of developers who do not have direct access to the internet.

If you choose to download RDz9012iFix1.zip instead of using the Installation Manager capability within the IBM update server, do the following steps: 

 1. Download the RDz9012iFix1.zip file from Fix Central.
 2. Unzip RDz9012iFix1.zip to a folder on your system. These files are temporary and may be deleted after the installation is completed.

DEFINITIONS
Regression: An error in the Maintenance Delivery Vehicle [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] (MDV) that produces incorrect or unexpected behavior causing a supported feature to stop functioning as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Coding errors that cause a regression
 * Documentation or packaging problems that cause a regression
 * Errors reported in a new function delivered in a MDV that cause a regression

Incomplete: An error in the MDV has not regressed, but does not work as designed. 
This includes: 

 * Fixed APARs which did not solve the original problem but did not break anything new
 * APARs reporting documentation errors, such as readme errors, that cause problems applying an MDV but do not lead to a regression




Notes:  * Regression and incomplete APARs are considered fix-in-error or MDV-in-error
 * Definitions above apply only to valid APARs that result in product fixes (APARs returned as working-as-designed are not assessed for being fix-in-error)
 * Issues in major releases due to new functionality do not apply in this definition

There are no known regressions to report.
