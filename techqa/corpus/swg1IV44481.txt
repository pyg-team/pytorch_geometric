ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: The Monitoring Agent for Windows OS 6.2.2
   
   
   Problem Description: The Windows OS agent fails to start on
   Windows servers where Micro Focus products are also installed.
   This issue was reported in several cases and it is caused by a
   corruption in one of the DLLs that supports Micro Focus
   performance counters.  The exact symptom can be highlighted by
   starting the agent at a command prompt:
   C:\IBM\ITM\tmaitm6\kntcma TEST
   
   and checking that it soon crashes with the following message:
   
   Object Code error : file 'cas0perf'
   error code: 153, pc=0, call=1, seg=0
   153     Subscript out of range
   
   
   Solution is given by disabling Micro Focus counters using
   Microsoft tools like exctrlst:
