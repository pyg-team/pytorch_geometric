CAUSE
The Javacore dump explains the jvm.dll failed to run with the exception code C0000005 Access Violation, so the ClearQuest Web Request Manager Java process crashed unexpectedly.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The IBM Rational ClearQuest version 7.0.1 is built with the IBM JRE 1.4.2 SR7. 

If the problem happens frequently, upgrade to the latest JRE and see if that resolves the issue. 

 * For updating the latest IBM JRE, refer to the section [Updating the JRE for ClearQuest 7.0.x ] in technote 1284358: JRE security alert for IBM JRE 1.4.2 SR7 for ClearQuest 7.0.x [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21284358].


If the problem still exists after the upgrade, contact IBM Rational support with diagnostic information described in technote 1257084: MustGather: ClearQuest Web Server [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21257084].
