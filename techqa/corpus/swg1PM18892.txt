APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Java classloaders internally use java.util.zip.Inflator object
   that has a native memory allocation which is freed only during
   finalize() methods. When ITCAM instruments classes and a large
   number of them cannot find dependent classes through the same
   classloader, new classloaders are created to find these in the
   application servers classpaths. Large amounts native memory may
   get consumed When the following conditions occur together:
   
   1. Classpaths for these classloaders are large
   2. Number of such classloaders are numerous
   3. Garbage collection of the heap does not happen frequently due
   to large free Java heap memory still present.
   
   Since GC does not happen fast enought, the native memory does
   not get freed through finalize() method leading to native memory
   exhaustion.
   
   Users Affected:
   
   Potentially any users of ITCAM Data collector.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * Potentially all ITCAM 6.1 and AD 7.1 users.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * Native memory exhaustion is seen in some cases due to delayed
   * garbage collection due to large free heap size available.
   *
   * During byte code instrumentation by ITCAM, when dependent
   * classes cannot be found, new classloaders are created to
   * search additional paths. Large amounts of native memory may
   * get consumed when the following conditions occur together:
   *
   * 1. Classpaths for these classloaders are very long.
   * 2. Number of such classloaders are numerous.
   * 3. Garbage collection of the heap does not happen frequently
   *    due to large free Java heap memory still present.
   *
   * The native memory held by these classloaders are freed only
   * during the finalize() method and since GC does not happen
   * frequently, they are not released fast enough to prevent
   * native memory exhaustion.
