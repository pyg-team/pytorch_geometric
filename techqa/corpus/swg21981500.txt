REMEDIATION/FIXES
Follow the steps in the "Workarounds and Mitigations" section.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
To avoid the untrusted search path vulnerability where users can gain increased privileges, perform the following additional steps prior to installation:




 1. Clear all contents (files, subdirectories, and so on) in the default download directory location. 
 2. Create a secure directory in a temporary location, such that elevated privileges are required to access this directory. 
 3. Copy and extract the setup.exe executable (generated by InstallShield) to the secure directory created in Step 2. 
 4. Launch the setup.exe executable file from the secure directory and wait until it completes.


Important: Do not enter line breaks in the command that you enter to start the installation program. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
