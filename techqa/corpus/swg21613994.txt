Title: IBM Cannot open session with Domino over SSL after Windows update - United States

KB2661254; security update; nonsecurity update TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Windows update 2661254 ("Update For Minimum Certificate Key Length") prevents starting an SSL session if the key length is less than 1024 bytes. This removes the ability to establish an SSL session with a Domino server whose SSL key size is less than 1024 bytes over Internet Explorer, and potentially other Microsoft software products as well.

SYMPTOM
Connections to Domino servers from Internet Explorer will fail when the SSL handshake takes place on the session, as the Windows workstation will make a connection over SSL to a server whose SSL key is less than 1024 bytes. An error page may display in Internet Explorer when this occurs, or the connection to the server may appear to never complete.


CAUSE

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The keyfile of the server should be updated to provide a key size of 1024 bytes or greater. As the size of an existing key cannot be modified, a new keyfile will need to be created on a server whose existing key size is less than 1024 bytes.
