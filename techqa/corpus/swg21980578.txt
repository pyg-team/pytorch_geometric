QUESTION
 How can I attach drawings to floors under structures on IBM TRIRIGA CAD (CI) Integrator ? 

CAUSE
Currently users can not attach graphics in graphics section of floor that is child of Structure in IBM TRIRIGA product. Is there a reason why current IBM TRIRIGA CAD Integrator mapping in TRIRIGA does not contain Structures?

ANSWER
Attaching drawings to floors under structures will be beyond the current design and considered a customization. If you want to attach drawings to floors under structures, you need to leverage the capabilities we provide (and document) around customizing an applications definition to suit that scenario.

We have never in the history of IBM TRIRIGA CAD Integrator (CI) provided application definition out-of-box that would work for attaching to every possible object scenario we ship with. What we do provide are application definitions for the most common scenarios, as well as a methodology for implementation partners or customers to build their own definitions for any object scenario.

This goes beyond the current design (currently CI 12.1.4). A change here needs to be analyzed in terms of our current code, metadata and taking the most of the system without bringing any performance or inconsistency issue as a side effect. You need a CI application definition we don't have available on our design, but see if you raise this need as a RFE (Request For Enhancement) our Strategy and Development teams will start working on this analysis and determine how feasible this is for being implemented on a further release. If all set and Strategy and Development teams agree on that
implementation, we will guarantee this will be coded and configured in a way it does not impact overall system function and operation, and this will be extensively tested (QAed) before providing that to customers.

If you want to do so yourself, you will need to refer to the following documents:


12.x Application Definitions In-Depth [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/12.x%20Application%20Definitions%20In-Depth] 

IBM TRIRIGA Version 12 Release 1.2 CAD Integrator/Publisher [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFCZ3_10.4.2/com.ibm.tri.doc/pdfs/pdf_tri_ci_cadint.pdf] 

Integrating, publishing, and reporting on CAD drawing information [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFCZ3_10.4.1/com.ibm.tri.doc/ci_cadint/t_ctr_int_pub_rep_cad.html] 


So the options will be:

O1) Create RFE(Request for Enhancement request) for each of your CI application definitions you need beyond the ones already provided by our current design;

O2) Create yourself your CI application definitions, but the support will be limited to pointing you to the documentation already available (above), and not helping you on the specifics about such customization.
