APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1)Under the topic "IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation
   6.3.0>Monitoring and mobile operations>Analytics>Operational
   analytics>IBM MobileFirst Platform Operational Analytics
   security>Protecting the analytics data entry point with basic
   authentication"
   it says that the path wl.analytics.url is unprotected. That is
   only true up to v6.2, in v6.3 it is protected by basic auth.
   
   
   2)In several places of the Knowledge Center for IBM MobileFirst
   Platform Foundation,
   the proposed value of both the wl.analytics.url and
   wl.analytics.console parameters is
   http://<hostname>:<port>/<context-root>/data. [http://<hostname>:<port>/<context-root>/data.]
   It is important to understand that in v6.3 and up these
   parameters use different context roots.
   wl.analytics.url is using the context root of
   worklight-analytics-service.war,
   and wl.analytics.console is using the context root of
   worklight-analytics.war
   Before that, the context root of analytics.war was used.
