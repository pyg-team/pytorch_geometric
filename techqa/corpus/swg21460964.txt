Text:
E-STK-102-013; ObjectServer failed to register pid TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When restarting an existing object server - it fails with "Failed to register server's PID. (-100:pid file exists, service already running)" - how to fix it? 

SYMPTOM
The log in $NCHOME/omnibus/log/<osname>.log will contain following errors: 

In this example - the ObjectServer name is - "OSFOR37:.

2011-01-26T10:35:41: Error: E-STK-102-013: [nstk]: OSFOR37: Failed to register server's PID. (-100:pid file exists, service already running)
2011-01-26T10:35:41: Debug: D-OBJ-105-003: ObjectServer shutdown handler invoked.


CAUSE
There is a file called $NCHOME/omnibus/var/<osname>.pid - for example: 
# cat $NCHOME/omnibus/var/OSFOR37.pid
21740
# ls -alrt $NCHOME/omnibus/var/OSFOR37.pid
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6 Jan 26 14:09 /opt/IBM//tivoli/netcool/omnibus/var/OSFOR37.pid

For some reason, when you try to restart the ObjectServer, the new instance wasn't able to update the file with new PID, or the file was owned by somebody else other than the user you are trying to start. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) If its incorrect user and a file permission issue(write access), correct the ownership/permissions on the <osname>.pid file and start with correct User. 

2) If its not permission issue - then delete the $NCHOME/omnibus/<osname>.pid file and restart the ObjectServer as normal.
