Text:
Workplace XT; login; SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logging in to IBM FileNet Workplace XT gets this error: 



The JNDI cannot be accessed. Message was error getting WsnNameService properties. 




SYMPTOM
The systemOut.log has these errors: 


JSAS1477W: SECURITY CLIENT/SERVER CONFIG MISMATCH: The client security
configuration (sas.client.props or outbound settings in GUI) does not
support the server security configuration for the following reasons:
ERROR 1: JSAS0809E: The current OID is RSA but this is not an
Admin request.
ERROR 2: JSAS0640E: The server requires SSL/TLS, but the client
does not support it.
ERROR 3: JSAS0606E: The server requires SSL client certificate
authentication but the client does not support it.


CAUSE
Mismatch of SSL settings between server and client.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the WebSphere Console for the Application Server hosting Workplace XT:

1. Access Security > Global Security

2. Expand RMI/IIOP Security

3. For each of:
CSIv2 inbound communications
CSIv2 outbound communications

verify whether the Transport is set to TCP/IP or SSL-required.

Then in the sas.client.props file check the parameter below:
com.ibm.CSI.performTransportAssocSSLTLSRequired





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Depending on your SSL requirement make sure the Transport configuration and the sas.client.props's setting match.
