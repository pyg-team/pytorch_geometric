ABSTRACT
 IBM Atlas Policy Suite V6.0.3 includes mobile support for custodian-level eDiscovery activities. Users can respond to notices, interview requests, and global hold reminders after logging in to the Atlas web client from an iPhone or iPad with iOS V6. 

CONTENT
Prerequisites: iPhone and iPad users must be connected to the network, must be able to access the IBM Atlas Policy Suite server by using a browser, and must be able to receive email that is sent by IBM Atlas Policy Suite. If necessary, users should consult their IT Administrator for assistance with these prerequisites. 

By pointing the browser on their iPhones or iPads to http://AtlasHost:port/PolicyAtlas, users can access the My Holds page. From the My Holds page, users can perform the following activities: 

 * View current notices and respond to a notice from the notice preview 
 * View a global hold reminder and confirm holds


Note: Users specify the same URL that they use from their PCs, but the landing page for mobile devices is the My Holds page instead of the My Atlas page.  

By following links that are embedded in email, iPhone and iPad users can perform the following activities: 

 * Access a Notice response page and respond to the notice or save a draft 
 * Access a Virtual Interview response page and respond to the interview or save a draft


To configure mobile support: 

 1. Confirm that the value of the ENABLE_EMPLOYEE_PORTAL parameter of the PA_CONFIGURATION component is set to Yes. 
 2. Activate mobile support by setting the value of the ENABLE_EMPLOYEE_PORTAL_MOBILE_SUPPORT parameter of the PA_CONFIGURATION component to Yes.


Troubleshooting tips: 

 * Determine whether a problem is data-related or device-specific by comparing the mobile display of a page with the PC display of that same page. 
 * Provide the following information to IBM Support, if you need assistance:  * The type of notice or page that is experiencing the problem. 
    * If possible, a screenshot of the problem when it occurs. (Press the Home and Power buttons at the same time to take the screenshot. Do not include sensitive or confidential information in the screenshot.) 
    * A screenshot of the Admin > Components > PA_CONFIGURATION page. 
    * The IBM Atlas Policy Suite log file (PAearlog.log, by default). If the logging level is not detailed enough, you might be asked to enable more detailed logging and to reproduce the problem.
