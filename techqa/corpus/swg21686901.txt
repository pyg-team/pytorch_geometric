 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TIP 2.2.0.15 installation fails with the documented TIP installation procedure, if TCR server is not stopped prior to invoking the TIP Fixpack installation 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The installation failure occurs if TCR server is still running when the TIP installer attempts to upgrade the existing Java used by TIP/TCR. In order to overcome this installation failure, Customers need to ensure that the TCR server is properly shut down prior to the TIP Fixpack installation. 

The following step by step instructions will help installing the TIP 2.2.0.15 Fixpack successfully

IAGLOBAL_TIP_HOME = <TCR installed path>/tipv2

IAGLOBAL_WASPassword=<TCR/TIP password>
6. Start the upgrade by executing the following command 
install.sh/bat -i silent -f <path of sample_response.txt> 
7. On a successful upgrade stop TCR server by invoking "stopTCRserver.<sh/bat>" which is available in the path <TCR installed path>/tipv2Components/TCRComponent/bin 
8. Start TCR Server by executing the command "startTCRserver.<sh/bat>" which is available in the path
<TCR installed path>/tipv2Components/TCRComponent/bin
