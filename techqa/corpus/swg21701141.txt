Title: IBM In a CDM Report, "The query failed" error after editing the structure periods in Cognos Controller FAP - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User adds periods into Cognos Controller FAP data mart. Afterwards, a user runs a report in Cognos Disclosure Management (CDM). An error appears. 

SYMPTOM
Error in Cognos Disclosure Management: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701141&amp;aid=1]
The query failed.


CAUSE
Not all periods (being published in the data mart by FAP) were available to the report.


Example Scenario: 

In the FAP data mart, some new periods had been added (e.g. 1501 to 1712) to the company structure. 

 * The new range of periods replaced (rather than adding to) the existing selection.


After changing the range to include all prior/future periods (i.e. from 1101 to 1712), and then running a FAP structure update, CDM was able to ‘see’ the 1412 data as expected. 

 * This stops the CDM error from occurring.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the CDM report definition matches the data range available in the cube instance. 

 

Example Scenario: 

Ensure all periods covered by the CDM report are added to the data mart:
