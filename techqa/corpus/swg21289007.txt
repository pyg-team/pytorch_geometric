System Prerequisites

QS21 blade (target): 

 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 (RHEL 5.1) for IBM POWER technology-based systems 
 * IBM Software Development Kit (SDK) for Multicore Acceleration Version 3.0


x86 System (host):  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 (RHEL 5.1) for Intel x86 Systems 
 * IBM Software Development Kit (SDK) for Multicore Acceleration Version 3.0


(The packages provided will install on both the host and target systems.) 


Installation Instructions 

To execute an application built with the XL C/C++ compiler, you need to install the following IBM C++ runtime on the QS21 blade: 

1. Download, unzip and untar the "xlc.cbe.rte.*" package. For example: 

gunzip xlc.cbe.rte.9.0.0.rhel5.x86.tar.gz 
tar -xvf xlc.cbe.rte.9.0.0.rhel5.x86.tar 

2. You must uninstall any previous version of the cell-xlc-rte rpm. To uninstall the package, use the following command: 

rpm -e cell-xlc-rte-x.x.x-x 

where x.x.x-x refers to the level of the rpm package installed on your system. To determine the level, use the following commands: 

rpm -q cell-xlc-rte 

3. Install the packages using the following command: 

rpm -ivh cell-xlc-rte-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm 

where x.x.x-x represents the version number. 


If you need rpms from the addon package as well: 

1. Download, unzip and untar the rpm packages. For example: 

gunzip <filename>.tar.gz 
tar -xvf <filename>.tar 

2. You must uninstall any previous versions of the rpms if any are installed. Do not uninstall rpms that you are not upgrading. To uninstall an rpm package, use the following command: 

rpm -e <package name> 

You must uninstall rpm packages in the following order: 

rpm -e cell-xlc-rte-lnk-x.x.x-x 
rpm -e cell-xlc-rte-x.x.x-x 
rpm -e cell-xlc-lib-x.x.x-x 

where x.x.x-x refers to the level of the rpm package installed on your system. To determine the level, use the following commands: 

rpm -q cell-xlc-rte-lnk 
rpm -q cell-xlc-rte 
rpm -q cell-xlc-lib 

3. Install the packages using the following command: 

rpm -ivh <package name> 

You must install the rpm packages in the following order: 

rpm -ivh cell-xlc-rte-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm 
rpm -ivh cell-xlc-rte-lnk-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm 
rpm -ivh cell-xlc-lib-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm 

where x.x.x-x represents the version number. 


Deinstallation Instructions 

To uninstall this software perform the following steps: 

rpm -e cell-xlc-rte-lnk-x.x.x-x 
rpm -e cell-xlc-rte-x.x.x-x 
rpm -e cell-xlc-lib-x.x.x-x 

where x.x.x-x represents the version number. 

In cases where an rpm package is required by other installed packages, that package may not uninstall.
