ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Background:
   To improve the performance of resource intensive scripts, we
   use the concept of background threads. One command initiates a
   specified number of background processes enabling the script to
   complete faster. e.g.
   ./migrateDataToXml.sh --company=ibm --threads=4
   Here the system will use 4 background processes to do the
   necessary conversion instead of just 1.
   
   Release Notes:
   Currently, the release notes define these threads and specify
   other necessary changes to use these threads; but there is no
   mention of how to decide the number of threads. The example
   given is:
   migrateDataToXml.sh --company=ibm --threads=4
   The customers are assuming that they should use four threads or
   use the default of 2.
   
   The problem:
   Most customers have a hardware which can support a lot more
   than 4 threads, e.g. 50. The number of threads determines how
   long the scripts will take to complete. With only 4 threads and
   a large number of items in the database, this script can run
   for days. This means production down for days. Migrating
   customers are unnecessarily running into this less than ideal
   scenario.
   
   The proposed fix:
   Modify the release notes to indicate that the customers should
   analyze their hardware and chose the optimum number of that
   their system can support i.e. processors, the rate of data
   insert that their database can handle etc. They should be
   encouraged to test their system performance(in non production
   environment) with increasing number of threads to use a value
   that they are comfortable with, since this has a direct impact
   on performance.
