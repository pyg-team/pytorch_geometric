ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If we install the ITM SAP transport, the default user
   IBMMON_AGENT is
   created as communication user at the SAP system. security
   rules
   implicate that the password for all communication users has to
   be
   changed after 6 weeks. That would mean that we have to change
   the
   If not, our SAP agent wouldn't be able to run properly.
   this ITM SAP transport has to be changed that the Tivoli
   user IBMMON_AGENT is always a system user.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In current design, mySAP agent will create a user with
   communication type and default password, but it doesn't allow
   customer to customized it. So it should has the capbility of
   allowing customer to customzied user type and password when
   install ABAP transport. We plan to add this function in 6.2 iF10
   and allow customer to set his customized user type and password
   in a property file and ABAP installer will create user type and
   password defined in property file if it exists, otherwise create
   default one just as what we do now.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  We have provide a specific fix to E.ON. In this fix, the user
   type and password are hard code, and it will not included into
   any iFix because this fix is only for E.ON. The normal fix will
   be in iF10.
