   *                      2.  The full text of a failing SQL      *
   *                      statement is not displayed on the SQL   *
   *                      error pop-up panel (FMN2ERR).           *

   ****************************************************************
   1.  FM/DB2 is is building a query that uses the ' ' (NOT)
   symbol.  DB2 is unable to recognise it and has included it as
   part of the column name. The problem is specific to customers
   using a code page in which the ' ' symbol is not defined, such
   as some DBCS code pages.
   2.  The SQL error panel shows only the first 330 characters of
   any failing SQL statement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. FM/DB2 has been changed to use '<>' instead of ' ='.
   2. FM/DB2 has been changed to recognize the SQL command, when
   entered on the FM/DB2 SQL error panel (FMN2ERR).  When the SQL
   command is entered on this panel, the complete SQL statement is
   displayed in an ISPF edit session.
