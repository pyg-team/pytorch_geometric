QUESTION
 Application Servers names are truncated in TEP Navigator. Is there any length limit to server names? 

ANSWER
The general 32-characters limitation in IBM Tivoli Monitoring also applies to the WebSphere server names. The default name for the WebSphere server managed system node is
<profile_name>_<server_name>:<host_name>:KYNS.

The two colons and KYNS are required entries. If the other parts of the names will add up to more than 26 characters, then the server names will be truncated. 

If you need correct names to be displayed, consider creating server aliases by providing correct short names for the servers. A server alias can be assigned by configuring the agent with an "Unique Alias Name for Application Server". 

Even the alias supplied will follow the same rule: <alias> + <hostname> must have a maximum of 26 characters. 

Note that if you need longer names, the <hostname> can be truncated by supplying a shorter "Alternate Node ID" in the TEMA configuration.


To add an appserver alias:


 * Stop the yn agent (<ITM_HOME>/bin/itmcmd agent stop yn) 
 * On TEP, "Clear Offline Entry" for yn agent including all the subnodes 
 * Delete <ITM_HOME>/config/<ServerName>*yn.ctx files 
 * Next, define your aliases for these AppServers. The specific procedure to create appservers alias depends on the version of the product (6.2, 7.1, 7.2), and is documented in the corresponding manuals 

 * Start the yn agent (<ITM_HOME>/bin/itmcmd agent start yn) 



NOTE: adding an alias will result in lost historical data, regardless of how it is added (i.e. via configuration or by editing a file). This is because the subnode will re-register with a new managed system name.
