PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why attempts to import an IBM® Rational® ClearCase MultiSite® replica creation packet results in the error Unable to create VOB replica: The feature level of the VOB family is not high enough to permit this operation and provides instructions to resolve the issue. 

CAUSE
 

Attempts to import a Replica Creation packet results in the following error: 

C:\>multitool mkreplica -import -workdir c:\temp\wdir -tag \rep_testvob -vob \\server1\ccstg_c\VOBs\rep_testvob.vbs -nc -perms_preserve 
"C:\shipping\ms_ship\incoming\repl_original"
multitool: Warning: Version mismatch, software:5.0, packet:4.0
multitool: Warning: In a permissions-preserving replica, cleartool protect 
operations will fail on client machines running ClearCase versions associated with feature level 3 or lower.
Should I create a permissions-preserving replica? [no] y
The packet can only be used to create replica "testvob_rep"
- VOB family is 9c31341c.526e11d4.a80d.00:c0:4f:09:da:07
- replica OID is ed9fad2c.fad14819.8664.e0:0d:f5:0c:ea:23

multitool: Error: Unable to create VOB replica: The feature level of the VOB 
family is not high enough to permit this operation. 

 

The import was run on a server running a version of ClearCase that does not support permissions-preserving replicas.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

The server has to support VOB feature level 4 or greater in order to create permissions-preserving replicas. 

Upgrade the server to a version of ClearCase MultiSite that supports feature level 4 or higher. Review technote 1119269 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21119269] to see which version correspond to a particular feature level.
