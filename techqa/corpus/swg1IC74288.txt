APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Messages are not being protected when running a WebSphere MQ
   (WMQ) v7.0.1.x .Net application in unmanaged mode using client
   connection and WMQ Advanced Message Security (AMS) v7.0.1.
   
   The AMS client interceptor does not complete PUT/GET operation.
   AMS log files for application process show:
   PID#9999 ERROR mqm mqput Drive:\ProgramPath\
   DRQDM1400E   IBM WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Security internal
   error: queue information could not be resolved from the current
   queue object handle. (0x000007e3)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Interceptor was not recognizing queue handle in MQGET and MQPUT
   as MQ .NET classes implementation bypasses C-level MQOPEN where
   interceptor records queue handle value. As interceptor relies on
   queues being opened by MQOPEN to set up the cryptographic engine
   the whole MQ call was failing.
   
   A code chage has been introduced in MQPUT and MQGET and now if
   the queue handle (hobj) has not been recorded by interceptor
   before, that is, no MQOPEN has been called, the interceptor
   checks if it should be protected. To do it, the interceptor must
   inquire the queue manager for the queue name and type. Inquire
   can be performed only if the queue has been opened with
   MQOO_INQUIRE and thus .Net applications woriking in unmanaged
   mode are required to open queues with MQOO_INQUIRE (when opened
   for either input or output).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will be contained in the fix pack 1.
