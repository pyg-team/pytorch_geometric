ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: When restoring person, ACI users are able to restore
   accounts of
   services for which they do not have permissions
   
   
   Description: The users of group which do not have permissions to
   restore
   an account of service, can restore those accounts if they have
   permission to restore the users, by selecting restore account
   while
   restoring the user.
   
    ITIM 4.6 FP85 - ACI user are able to restore accounts of
   services for
   which they do not have permissions for
   
   Problem Description:
   
   Solaris 10
   ITIM Server 4.6 Fixpack 85
   As an ACI user who is restricted to helpdesk role, I can restore
   accounts for which ACIs do not allow me to do by going via the
   restore
   user (and checking the restore account box) functionality. If I
   try to
   restore the accounts one by one manually, I get the correct
   prompt for
   no authorisation.
   Desired:
   Restore user and associated restore account functionality should
   respect ACIs.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Our setup is that only members of the HR team are allowed the
   restore
   the SAP-HR and SAP-HRBI accounts. Therefore, anyone with just
   helpdesk
   access should NOT be able to restore those accounts. As
   demonstrated,
   should I (as a Helpdesk user) select to restore a SAP-HR and/or
   SAP-HRBI
   account individually, I get the "You are not authorised..."
   error.
   
   If I do the restore via the restore user, I am able to restore
   the
   SAP-HR and SAP-HRBI accounts as a helpdesk user. This is
   therefore
   bypassing the ACI controlling those accounts which should not
   have given
   me any rights to control them.
   
   
   Customr Recreate:Yes
   L2 Support Recreate: n/a
   
   Desired Behavior:
   Abel to respect the ACIs for the users who will have the
   access/restore
   the account.
   
   
   Steps Duplicate:
   1. Set up a new ITIM group (aka HR)
   2. Create one or more ACI which grants
   add/modify/suspend/restore
   permissions to the newly created group
   3. Assign your test ITIM user an ITIM group such as helpdesk, as
   long as
   they don't have the newly created group above.
   4. Via the search results screen, suspend a user (along with all
   accounts)
   5. Via the same search results screen, now restore the user
   (along with
   all accounts)
   
   Environment:
