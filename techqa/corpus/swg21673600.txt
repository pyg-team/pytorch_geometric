WTX security bulletin Transformation Extender SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Secure Adapter Collection product is affected by two issues: one related to the TLS implementation which, under very specific conditions, can cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase, the other related to an insecure Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0963 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963]
Description: Multiple IBM products are affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the products and other software running on the affected system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92844 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92844] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)

Workarounds and Mitigations:

Method One) Monitor CPU utilization of IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender Launcher Agent instances. If utilization becomes abnormally high, stop and restart the affected instance.

Method Two) Configure WTX Launcher Agent to use the legacy security protocol, which does not use GSKit. To do this, perform the following for every WTX instance in your environment:
1. Rename m4gskssl.dll or m4gskssl.so to a different extension (e.g. .dll_disable for windows, .so_disable for UNIX). The older security protocol stack, as implemented by mercssl.dll or mercssl.so, will then be automatically used.
2. In the [SSL_SERVER] section of the dtx.ini configuration file, set
secure_mode=0
If secure_mode is set to a value other than zero, then WTX will fail all secure communications, since mercssl module does not implement NIST compliance.







CVE ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 
Description: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990] [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92844] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 
Workarounds and Mitigations: None. AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
