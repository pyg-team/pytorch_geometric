Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the names of the ref properties available in the IQueyOption interface which are available by calling the getRefProps() method? 


ANSWER
 The properties that appear are defined in the CUSTOM AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER 

DEVELOPER GUIDE . 

For example, for a user, this method returns the user name, account, and email. 

Note that from a custom provider perspective, not all the properties of an object are supported and you need to ignore unsupported properties. For example, for the account object the property format does not apply to the Authentication and will be ignored.
