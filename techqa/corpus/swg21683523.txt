QUESTION
 Why does ITCAM agent for Microsoft Exchange Server not provide data in MTA and SMTP workspaces for Exchange server 2007 and 2010 versions? 

CAUSE
Monitoring agent for MS Exchange Server documentation states the following:
- MTA workspace (Navigator item) 
Note: This workspace returns no data on Microsoft Exchange Server 
2007, and Exchange Server 2010. 
- SMTP workspace (SMTP Navigator item) 
Note: This workspace returns no data on Microsoft Exchange Server 
2007, and Exchange Server 2010. 

ANSWER
MTA and SMTP perfmon objects/features are only provided by MS Exchange Server 2003. Due to change in Microsoft Exchange Server architecture, these perfmon objects are no longer available with Exchange Server 2007 and higher releases. 


MS Exchange Server 2007 (and higher) version has role based architecture. Microsoft has provided Transport perfmon objects, which are monitored by the agent. To monitor these new objects, the Exchange Server should have either the Hub Transport or Edge role. 

 
Transport perfmon objects in MS Exchange Server 2007 and higher are the following: 
1. MS Exchange Transport Queues 
2. MS Exchange Transport SmtpSend 
3. MS Exchange Transport SmtpReceive 
4. MS Exchange Transport Database 
5. MS Exchange Transport Dumpster 
6. MS Exchange Transport Rules 

For Exchange Server 2007 and onwards, following attribute are provided by the monitoring agent. 
1. MS Exchange Transport Queues attributes 
2. MS Exchange Transport SmtpSend attributes 
3. MS Exchange Transport SmtpReceive attributes 

Corresponding agent queries in Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) are the following: 
1. MS Exchange Transport Database 
2. MS Exchange Transport Dumpster 
3. MS Exchange Transport Queues 
4. MS Exchange Transport Rules 
5. MS Exchange Transport SmtpReceive 
6. MS Exchange Transport SmtpSend 

TEP workspaces can be created by using above queries.
