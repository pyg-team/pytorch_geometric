APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying search templates using FileNet Deployment
   Manager, the deploy fails on the Covert Assets step with this
   error:
   ---------------------------------------------
   Unable to convert the assets.
   Mapping error encountered while processing the following object
   -
   Class: StoredSearch, Id: ....
   Unable to convert the environment-specific data in the content
   file:
   (path to the file).
   Unable to find replacement value. type='Object Store', source
   item='Name', source value='[Symbolic Name]'
   
   ----------------------------------------------
   
   It is requested that ICN 2.0.2 use the GUID when deploying
   search templates as the "id", which is congruent with the
   functionality in ICN 2.0.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update all deployed search template XML files with the GUID,
   replacing the deployed symbolic name.
