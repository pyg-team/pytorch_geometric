   Local transaction
   Global transaction
   
   For example.
   1st global transaction was failed SQL0911N with RC=68

   Here is a scenario that 2nd global transaction was fail.
   
   1st global transaction was failed with -911.
   Then xa_end and xa_rollback was executed.
   Usually, we need to switch out of the xa_tranasction.
   However, we do not do switch out of the xa_transaction.
   So, 1st transaction is still xa transaction mode.
   
   Local transaction which is not in xa transaction.
   Because local transaction is not needed with xa_start.
   When local transaction was completed, the xa_commit was executed
   in the local transaction.
   In this time, xa_commit was returned XAER_RMFAIL.
   
   [jcc][t4][2041][11392][3.63.123] Error executing
   XAResource.commit().  Server returned XAER_RMFAIL.
   ERRORCODE=-4203, SQLSTATE=null
   
   2nd global transaction was executing xa_start.
   The xa_start was failed XAER_RMFAIL.
   Because 1st transaction is in the xa_transaction.
   And local transaction was executed xa_commit, evenif this is a
   local transaction.
   
   The fix is to switch out of the xa transaction during xa_failure
   when the transaction is due to -911 error.
   
   After fixed, transaction was executed as below.
   
   1st global transaction was failed with -911.
   1st global transaction is switched out of the xa_transaction.
   Now, xa_transaction was completed.
   
   The local transaction was executed.
   No xa_commit was executed.
   Because 1st global transaction was completed,
   and this is not a xa_transaction.
   
   2nd global transaction was not failed in xa_start.
   2nd xa_transaction was successfully without xa error.
