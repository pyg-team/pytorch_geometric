Title: IBM Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) for Windows and 8.3 File Name Support - United States

Text:
 FORUM/DISCUSSION GROUP

ABSTRACT
 IBM Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) for Windows command line programs need the Windows 8.3 file name support to run when installed into a path containing spaces such as C:\Program Files\IBM\OnDemand\V9.5. 

CONTENT
IBM Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) for Windows ships with a number of command line programs. The command line programs require that CMOD be installed on a drive with 8.3 short names enabled or to a directory with no spaces such as C:\IBM\ondemand\V9.5. Otherwise, the following Windows message will be displayed when you try to run the command line programs, such as performing a load using the ARSLOAD program that calls other CMOD programs:


'C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

To check the current 8.3 file name settings for a drive, start a command window elevated with administrator privileges and enter:

fsutil.exe behavior query disable8dot3

Possible values are: 

 * 0: Create 8.3 short file names (default) 
 * 1: Do not create 8.3 file names 
 * 2: Set 8.3 file names on a per volume basis 
 * 3: Disable 8.3 file names on all volumes, except the system volume


To enable 8.3 file names on a global basis, enter: 

fsutil.exe behavior set disable8dot3 0 

The registry state of NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation of 0 means that 8.3 file names are enabled on all volumes. This operation takes effect immediately (no restart required). 

If CMOD is installed on a drive without 8.3 name support and in a directory with spaces, it must be reinstalled on a drive with 8.3 name support. If the folder in which you are trying to install CMOD is already created when 8.3 name support is disabled, then the short name is not created if you try a reinstall into the same directory. Windows short names are created during the directory creation, therefore you must install it into a new directory. If the directory is empty, you can delete the directory and allow it to be recreated during the install with the 8.3 name. 

To enable 8.3 name creation on all NTFS partitions, follow these steps: 

1. Start regedit.exe and locate the following registry key:  * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem 

2. Select the NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation entry. By default, the value for this entry is set to 0. 
3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD. Type a value of 0 in the Data field. 
4. Click OK and then exit regedit. 
5. Exit Windows, and then shut down your computer. 
6. Restart your computer and Windows.
