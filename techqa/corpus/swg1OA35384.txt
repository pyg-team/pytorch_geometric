ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer experiences an issue that's causing the system to hang
   due to spool file filling up because the SA Omegamon agent is
   attempting to re-register the agent.  If the System Automation
   subsystem is recycled while the SA OMEGAMON agent is still up
   and running the system stalls because the agent is spooling
   excessive amount of messages due to the agent was de-registered
   and attempts to re-register the agent. Within seconds hundreds
   of thousands of output is being spooled by the agent which
   causes the system to hang. Logs will show KAHM002I and KAHM012I.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Part KAHAGENT has been changed to not enter a loop when shutting
   down the SSI.
   Be aware that after recycling SSI also the KAHAGENT has to be
   recycled. Otherwise the agent stays in a Heartbeat retry loop
   of interval KAH_PPI_CHECK_UP_INTVL, issuing messages
   KAHM002I and KAHM012I.
