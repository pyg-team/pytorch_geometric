APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At v6.1 of WebSphere Message Broker, security was tightened
   on restricted objects administered by the configuration
   manager. However, we ignore the fact that the object is
   restricted and retry to get property information about the
   object. The number of unnecessary retries results in a
   large increase in the time taken for mqsideploy to
   complete.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker using  *
   *                 configmgr commands in a restricted domain.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: At WebSphere Message Broker v6.1, the   *
   *                      configmgr commands take much longer     *
   *                      to complete if there are restricted     *
   *                      objects in the configmgr domain.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In v6.1 of WebSphere Message Broker, security was improved on
   restricted objects administered by the configuration manager.
   This is the correct behaviour, however, the fact that the
   object is restricted is ignored and numerous attempts are made
   to get property information about the restricted object. This
   results in a significant increase in the time taken for the
   command to complete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that it does not
   keep retrying to obtain information for restricted objects
   administered by the configmgr.
