 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What information should be collected when you experience a problem during an IBM FileNet Content Engine (CE ) installation or upgrade? 
Collecting this information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

ANSWER
The installation, upgrade or migration of FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE) is a complex task and comprised of multiple steps. Depending on the step or phase of the install/upgrade being completed, different logs will be of use in troubleshooting any issues encountered. The major steps of a CE installation/upgrade can be broken down into 4 phases: 

 1. Content Engine Installation 
 2. Content Engine Configuration/Deployment 
 3. Creating the P8 Domain 
 4. Upgrading the Content Engine Data


The sections below outline the logs that should be reviewed and attached to a PMR if an issue is encountered at a given phase. 

Note: The default paths given below are in Unix format; they are essentially the same paths in Windows, just replace "/" with "\". Only in situations where the Windows path is a different location will the Windows path be specified. 

Content Engine Installation: Laying down the binaries  *  <CE_install_path>/ce_install_4_5_1.txt <CE_install_path>/ce_install_5.0.txt <CE_install_path>/ce_install_5.1.0.txt <CE_install_path>/ce_install_summary.txt 
 * 
 * 
 *  Windows  * C:\Program Files\Zero G Registry\.com.zerog.registry.xml 
    * C:\Program Files (x86)\Zero G Registry\.com.zerog.registry.xml
   
   Unix  * if logged in as root during install:  * /var/.com.zerog.registry.xml 
      
      
    * if logged in as userduring install:  *  <user_home_dir>/.com.zerog.registry.xml 
      
      
   
   

Content Engine Configuration/Deployment: Running the Configmgr tool CE_install_path/tools/configure/logs/P8ConfigMgr_Console.log CE_install_path/tools/configure/profiles/profile_name/<specific xml script of failing task> CE_install_path/tools/configure/profiles/profile_name/tmp_directory/<specific xml script of failing task>  * 
 * WebSphere Application Server (WAS)
 *  WAS admin console – can be used to verify if tasks completed successfully  * JDBC datasources created successfully and a test connection is successful 
    * LDAP configurations settings are configured as expected 
    * FileNetEngine application is listed under Enterprise applications and deployed to the expected application server
   
   SystemOut.log for dmgr WAS_install_path/profiles/dmgr/logs/dmgr01/SystemOut.log SystemOut.log for CEserver – if failing the deploy task WAS_install_path/profiles/profile_name/logs/CEserver_name/SystemOut.log 
 * Oracle WebLogic Application Server 
 *  Weblogic Administration console – can be used to verify if tasks completed successfully  * JDBC datasources created successfully and a test connection is successful 
    * LDAP configurations settings are configured as expected 
    * FileNetEngine application is listed under Enterprise applications and deployed to the expected application server
   
   CE_Servername.log - if failing the deploy task <Weblogic root>/<server-name>/<server-name>.log 
 * 
 * JBoss Application Server
 *  LDAP issues - check the login-config.xml server.log - if failing the deploy task <jboss install home>/server/default/conf/log/server.log
