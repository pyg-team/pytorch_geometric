APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you issue the CEMT INQ DB2CONN command your response now
   is different than what was returned in prior releases. This
   difference causes problems for Automated Operators which expect
   the output to be the same as before.
   In Release 3.2 of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, the response
   for CONNECTST was returned on line 10 and read:
   Connectst( Connected ) and the automation exec would perform the
   required action.
   In Release 4.1 of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, the response
   returned shows the CONNECTST is part of a second block of a
   multiline output message.
   Additionally, any changes to the output from the CICS commands
   should be documented in the Release Guide. This so that you can
   make modifications to resources like automated scripts.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Chapter 7 ( Changes to CEMT ) of the CICS Transaction Server for
   z/OS Version 4 Release 1 'Upgrading from CICS TS Version 3.2'
   manual ( GC34-6998-02 ) will have an additional section thus:
                                                                  .
   CEMT Format
   
   Prior to TS 4.1, a CEMT INQUIRE on certain resources
   ( eg DB2CONN ) would return the resource parameters on one
   screen with the data arranged in columns thus:
                                                                  .
   field name  field value     field name  field value
                                                                  .
   For this release, the data is arranged in the format:
                                                                  .
   Field name  field value
                                                                  .
   Field names and field values that were previously displayed
   in columns 3 and 4 are now accessible by use of the scroll key.
   
   In addition, the resource name is now appended to the top of
   the column.
