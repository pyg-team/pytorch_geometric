QUESTION
 I am trying to do scanning and display, and I am unable to send data TCP/IP reports. I am noticing an increase in errors relating to TCP/IP socket timeout, during workstation initialization (OINT). The error message is ECK0506A, RETCODE: 4, REACODE: FFFF2001. I am running ImagePlus速 3.1, OS/390速 V2.6, CICS速 4.1, DB2速 V5.1. What do you think is causing this? 

ANSWER
This error message is received when the timeout parameters for TCP/IP are not large enough for large documents. You can resolve this problem by resetting the timeout values. 

For scans requiring multiple pages, batches, or other actions that could delay the sending or storing of the object to the host, you will need to set a larger timeout value for TCP/IP in the WKCF. Try changing the timeout value, IWKCFTR from 30 to 60 seconds in the STOUT and RTOUT columns of the Workstation Configuration Table (IDWKCFTB). See
