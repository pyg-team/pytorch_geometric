---------------------------------------------------------- 

1. Download ibm-java-sdk-7.0-10.25-x86_64-archive.bin [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/IBM+SDKs+for+Java+Technology/Java+Standard+Edition+(Java+SE)&release=7.0.10.25&platform=Linux+64-bit,x86_64&function=fixId&fixids=7.0.10.25-JavaTech-JavaSE-Linuxx86_6464-ServiceRefresh10FP25&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=ddp] from Fix Central 

2. As the user that installed the Predictive Insights UI, e.g. scadmin, stop the UI server used by IBM Operations Analytics Predictive Insights
<UI_HOME>/bin/pi.sh -stop
where UI_HOME is typically /opt/IBM/scanalytics/UI 

3. cd <UI_HOME> 

4. Rename JAVA SDK installation folder
mv ibm-java-x86_64-70 ibm-java-x86_64-70_orig 

5. If necessary, make the .bin file executable:
chmod u+x ibm-java-sdk-7.0-10.25-x86_64-archive.bin 

6. Run the ibm-java-sdk-7.0-10.25-x86_64-archive.bin to install the SDK into the <UI_HOME> folder.
When prompted for “Where would you like to install?”, supply the full path 
<UI_HOME>/ibm-java-x86_64-70 
This will create a new ibm-java-x86_64-70 folder in <UI_HOME> 

7. As the user that installed the Predictive Insights UI, start UI server
<UI_HOME>/bin/pi.sh -start
