PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides explanation regarding whether the web services tools and wizards in IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD) version 7 use the emitters of a remote WebSphere Application Server (WAS) version 6, in the case when the local WAS 6.x servers available with RAD 7.x were not installed, but a remote WAS 6.x server is being used instead, to deploy and run the web service. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Even if the server you are using is "remote", you are always working with a local definition of that server runtime. When you create a remote server, you have to have the runtime defined in the preferences, and this runtime will [always] be a local definition (for example, either the stub or a local WAS install). So when you target a project to a runtime, you are using the local definition of that runtime, which means that for web services deploy, it will use the java2wsdl/wsdl2java from that runtime definition. The fact that a server is remote makes no real difference for java2wsdl/wsdl2java. 

The web services tools reference what is on the server target. For a remote server, you would typically point to a WAS stub directory (such as<RAD v7 Install Dir>SDP70/runtimes/base_v6[x]_stubs), if a local WebSphere Test Environment/WAS version 6.1 server was not installed as part of RAD 6.x or 7.x.

For specifics on which jars contain the emitters in RAD 7.x, consult this tech note under the Related Information section: How Rational Application Developer version 7 uses the WebSphere web services emitters.

Note: RAD 6.x users should consult the other linked technote:
