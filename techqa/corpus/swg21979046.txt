CAUSE
Customer ran into an issue where the ICC Configuration data got completely corrupted and does not have a automatic backup plan in place 

ANSWER
To backup your ICC configuration data, use the afuConfigStoreTool utility that is provided with the product. To include the Content Collector configuration store in a regularly scheduled corporate backup, define a scheduled task that runs on a Content Collector node and that uses theafuConfigStoreToolprogram to create a backup of the Content Collector configuration data in a directory that is located on the Content Collector node. Schedule this task to run in advance of the corporate backup. Configure the corporate backup to include the directory that contains the backup of the Content Collector configuration data.
