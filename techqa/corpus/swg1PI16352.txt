ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempts to generate a report using Rational DOORS source fails
   with 'CRRPE3095E Output processing could not continue due to an
   error. javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException' in Rational
   Publishing Engine.
   SYMPTOM:
   CRRPE3095E Output processing could not continue due to an error.
   javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: The reference to entity
   'ie' must end with the ';' delimiter.
   XHTML is <drml><u><a
   href='http://google.com?q=test&ie=UTF-8'?http://googl
   e.com?q=test&ie=UTF-8</a></u></drml>>
   CRRPE1064I Aborting engine execution...
   CAUSE:
   This issue is seen only if there is an '&' is in an attribute in
   the XML. To reproduce the issue you need a DOORS version that
   exports hyperlinks as hyperlinks and not as plain text. For
   example DOORS 9.5.2 can reproduce the error but not DOORS
   9.5.0.0 as this version does not export hyperlinks.
   WORKAROUND:
   Avoid XHTML processing in JavaScript for DOORS data attributes
   that contain '&' in the attributes.

   This is fixed in DOORS 9601 and its client side fix only.
