APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) map to
   extract data using the xmllib->XSLT() function may result in
   character truncation if the resulting string contains UTF-8
   2-byte sequences.
   
   An example of this data might be 'ÖÜÄ' which would potentially
   result in 4 bytes of truncation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

   PB / PB
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers who use XSLT
   external function
   
   Problem Description:
   Characters truncated from the output of the xmllib->XSLT()
   function, if the string contains UTF-8 2-bytes sequences
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Conclusion:
   Correct issues with XSLT external function.
   1. XSLT command line is now UTF-8, which allows WTX to pass all
   characters past to XSLT processor. Previously the command line
   was native and symptom was missing characters.
   2. Corrected length of data returned. Previously data was
   sometimes truncated.
   
   Applies to:
