APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   With the ITCAM for Transaction Tracking Reporter and Collector
   (KTO and KTU) agents installed.  The tacmd importNavigator
   fails because the custom Topologies for these agents are
   returned erroneously to the CLI as a topology matching the
   filter criteria.  This causes the CLI to fail.  These custom
   topologies should not be returned to the CLI given the filter
   it passes
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Install 622fp6 and the KTO and KTU agents. Run the tacmd
   importNavigator command without having an existing navigator.
   This should fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  "tacmd importnavigator" fails when ITCAM for Transaction
   Tracking (KTO/KTU) is installed.
   
   
   The "tacmd importnavigator" command fails when ITCAM for
   Transaction Tracking (KTO/KTU) is installed. It fails with the
   following error.
   
   KUICIN099E The importNavigator command failed because an
   unexpected error occurred.  Please consult the
   /opt/Tivoli/ITM/logs/TepImportExportCLI_0.log log file to
   determine the cause of the error.
   
   The tacmd importNavigator command first requests to see if the
   topology to be imported already exists in the portal server,
   then asks the user if they want to overwrite the existing
   navigator. When the ITCAM for Transaction Tracking (KTO/KTU)
   agents are installed, the portal server topology service
   erroneously returns the KTO/KTU custom topologies. This is the
   first indication of the problem, because even though the
   navigator does NOT already exist in the portal server, the
   following messages are displayed:
   
     KUICIN012I The custom navigator view "WRMTest" already exists
   on the server.  Do you want to delete the existing child nodes
   for the custom navigator view, and import the custom navigator
   view "WRMTest" to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server on
   http://tepshostname:1920? Existing user assignments for the
   custom navigator view will be maintained.
     Enter Y for yes or N for no: Y
   
   The TepImportExportCLI.log shows this error:
   
     com.ibm.tivoli.itm.workspace.cli.WorkspaceImportExportCLI
   deleteNavigatorChildNodes
     SEVERE: Could not delete navigator "navigator name" from
   server
   
   This occurs because it will try to delete the KTO/KTU nodes from
   the navigator which don't really exist.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to correctly filter out the KTO/KTU
   topologies.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The ITCAM for Transaction custom topologies can be disabled by
   commenting out the following env variables in the portal server
   configuration file:
   
   TOAGGREGATES__CLASS=com.ibm.itcam.transactions.ui.topology.evalu
   ator.TATModule
   TOAGGREGATES__CLASSPATH=path value
   TOINSTANCES__CLASS=com.ibm.itcam.transactions.ui.topology.evalua
   tor.TITModule
   TOINSTANCES__CLASSPATH=path value
   
   Once these environment variables have been commented out,
   restart the portal server. "tacmd importnavigator" will work,
   but KTO/KTU functionality is disabled.
