ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Are there any plans for Lotus/IBM to introduce an idle timeout
   for a Domino and
   WebSphere mixed SSO environment?
   
   Customer's environment:  Domino R6.5.1 & WebSphere 5.0.2, SLES
   8.1 SP3
   
   Customer states: If I logged into WebSphere application server
   first and went
   on to access a Domino resource, the token will expire if I do
   not touch the
   Domino resource for some time.  However, when I accessed the
   WebSphere secured
   resource, I am reauthenticated automatically.
   Somehow, WebSphere seem to know how to re-authenticate.  After
   that, I will be
   able to access the Domino resource with no problems.
   
   
   
   If I logged into Domino first, the session will expire no matter
   which resource
   was accessed.
   
   According to 6.5.1 release notes under Domino HTTP idle session
   timeout for SSO
   configurations:
   "SSO configurations may apply to both Domino and WebSphere,
   however, the idle
   timeout configuration will be most useful and easiest for users
   to understand
   if all participating machines in the SSO environment are Domino
   machines. In a
   mixed Domino/WebSphere environment, users may experience an idle
   timeout on
   Domino servers, but will not encounter an idle timeout when
   accessing
   WebSphere. Since WebSphere only supports the notion of fixed
   expiration, an
   idle timeout can't be supported with WebSphere SSO. Therefore,
   if the SSO
   configuration includes WebSphere, and if the user logs in first
   to WebSphere to
   obtain access to the SSO environment, then the idle timeout will
   not apply to
   the user's session."
