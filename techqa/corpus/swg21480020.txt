Title: IBM AMOS signs of  regression and covariance estimates seem contradictory - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have estimated a structural equation model in AMOS, but I am confused by some of the signs for the regression weights and covariances in the output. Suppose that there are two latent factors, W and X, which are independent variables in a regression with dependent variable Y. Suppose X has a large positive regression coefficient and W has a large negative coefficient. Is it possible for these two factors to have a large positive covariance? The result seems contradictory to me. Have I done something wrong in specifying my model? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In general, it is possible for the situation you describe (positive correlation between regressors with coefficients of opposite signs) to occur in regression. This is known as a suppressor effect in regression. The sign and magnitude of the regression coefficient for a predictor is a function of the partial correlation of the predictor with the dependent variable and the standard deviations of those variables. Suppose that dependent variable Y is predicted by W and X. The partial correlation of Y with X,
r(XY.W) is the correlation of X and Y with the effect of W partialled out. This partial correlation squared is the proportion of the variance of Y that is associated with X but not associated with W.

r(XY.W) = [r(XY) - r(XW)*r(WY)]/ [sqrt(1-r(XW)**2)*sqrt(1-r(WY)**2)] .

Note that the denominator of this formula will always be positive. If all 3 correlations in the numerator are positive, but the product of r(XW) and r(WY) is larger than r(XY), then the numerator of the formula will be negative. If r(XY) is close to 0 and the other correlations are large, then X and Y may have a substantial negative partial correlation, despite having a small positive zero-order (nonpartialled) correlation.
