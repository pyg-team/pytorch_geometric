APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CICS TG sends a request to CICS using IPIC.  A userid and
   password phrase are supplied.  The password phrase contains
   trailing blanks.  These blanks are being incorrectly removed
   by CICS before the password phrase is validated.  This leads to
   the password phrase being rejected by the ESM.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Message DFHXS1201 is issued when        *
   *                      requests sent to CICS have a password   *
   *                      phase that has trailing blanks.         *

   ****************************************************************
   CICS Transaction Gateway sends a request including user id and
   password phrase to CICS using IPIC. The password phrase
   contains trailing blanks. DFHUSAD calls DFHXSAD
   add_user_with_password to process this request. CICS Transaction
   Gateway masks the password before it sends to CICS, so
   DFHXSAD calls DFHXSUT to unmask the password before calling
   RACF to verify the password. After unmasking the password, any
   trailing blanks are truncated. Truncating the blanks is correct
   for passwords but not for password phrases.
   Then RACF validation of the password phrase fails.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHXSUT has been changed to check the length of the password.
   Trailing blanks are only truncated when it is a password and
   not when it is a password phrase.
