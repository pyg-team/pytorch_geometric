   custom properties to you Doc Class, ensuring several have the
   choice lists associated with same.

   a new Search Template.
   5. Specify the following in the designer:
    a) The Object Store you have used for the properties and for

    b) For the object Type - Specify the Doc Class used above and
   set the view value to hidden.

   your object store.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * WorkplaceXT user who uses Search Designer                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Use of Search Designer via WorkplaceXT is extremely slow in  *
   * responsiveness.                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * Checkout along with other functions of Search Designer takes *
   * a long time to complete simple functions.                    *
   *                                                              *
   * Example: Creation of a new Search Template, the criteria     *
   * tab, when adding a custom property.                          *
   * The real delay is seen when you have taken the time to       *
   * create a new Search Template via WorkplaceXT  and added X    *
   * number of custom                                             *
   * properties to the criteria (takes a fair bit of time to add  *
   * 20 custom properties via XT and Search Designer),  this same *
   * search                                                       *
   * template is then needed to be modified and you go to Search  *
   * Designer to checkout the template for modification.          *
   * The check out takes over 5 minutes just to get to the point  *
   * where you can start working on the template.                 *
   * Then making modifications, such as deletion/removing a       *
   * custom property from the Search Criteria tab takes may take  *
   * another bit of                                               *
   * a delay to complete.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Workplace XT version 1.1.3.7-WPXT-FP007           *
