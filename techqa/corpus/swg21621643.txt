PROBLEM
Unable to copy packages in Packaging Utility tool as Websphere Application Server (WAS) fixpack fails to find base offering

SYMPTOM
In the Copy Packages section, the following message is displayed:

"The update com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80_8.0.0.5 does not have its base offering(com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80_8.0.0.20110503_0200) in the open set of repositories"

The Packaging Utility will grey out the Next button preventing the user from proceeding.


CAUSE
The WAS Packaging Utility cannot create a new package out of an custom package. This is a limitation of the WAS Packaging Utility. The WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (ND) included with the Portal installation media is a custom package (com.ibm.websphere.ND.v80_8.0.3.20120320_0536). Thus, Portal's custom package of WAS ND cannot be included in a new custom package

ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8
WAS 8.0.0.3
WAS fixpack

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This exception will be encountered every time the Packaging Utility tool attempt to package a WAS fixpack with the WAS install package that is bundled with Portal.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The recommended solution is to use a base WAS ND 8.0 package and not the custom WAS package bundled with Portal 8.0 media.
