APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using IBM MQ V8 and queue statistics (STATQ) are enabled
   for dynamic queues, a
   large number of ghost queues get created. In the filesystem
   under the queue manager directory 'queues' more than thousand
   ghost queues like the following may appear:
   
   !!GHOST!4269DF61!0!1A11DF21!13608
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable STATQ for dynamic queues (via the associated model
   queues).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects MQ V8 customers with STATQ resolving to ON
   for a model queue, and therefore for the associated dynamic
   queues. Customers not using dynamic queues are not affected.
   The issue leads to a much larger pool of ghost queues, and
   therefore more file system objects being associated with a queue
   manager.
   It's not a true leak as such as the working set of ghost queues
   will stabalize. There will be a lower rate of reusing of ghost
   queues (to instantiate dynamic queues), but as the performance
   of creating dynamic queues is so much better in MQ V8 this may
   not have a noticeable effect on performance.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX, HP-UX Itanium, IBM iSeries, Linux on Power, Linux on S390,
   Linux on x86, Linux on x86-64, Linux on zSeries, Solaris SPARC,
   Solaris x86-64, Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When a dynamic queue is first created, a 'ghost' queue file is
   allocated an initialized to store the attributes and data
   associated with that dynamic queue. When the dynamic queue is
   deleted the 'ghost' queue file is not deleted, but added to a
   cache of such queues associated with the relevant model queue.
   When a dynamic queue is next created based upon that model then
   rather than re-allocating and initializing a new queue file, the
   pre-existing 'ghost' queue file is used to instantiate the new
   dynamic queue.
   
   A previously used dynamic 'ghost' queue cannot be reused until
   all references to the previously used instance of the dynamic
   queue have been released. A typical example of such a reference
   would be is some application had a handle (hObj) open on the
   dynamic queue. There are also a range of possible internal
   references to the dynamic queue, and one of these is related to
   the inheritance of STATQ from the associated model queue.
   
   The reference caused by an effective STATQ of ON was being
   released at the end of each statistics internal, rather than
   when all open handles (hObj's) had been closed (MQCLOSE). The
   effect of this unintended change in V8 was that each ghost queue
   could only be used once in each statistics interval, leading to
   a very large pool of ghost queues being required to effect any
   reuse of these objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The queue manager logic has been updated so that the ghost queue
   is available for reuse once all open handles have been closed,
   regardless of the effective value of STATQ.
