Title: IBM FileNet P8 Content Manager / Content Search Services "Index Failure Codes" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the indexation operation that takes place when using the FileNet P8 Content Manager (CM) platform with Content Search Services (CSS), a various number of documents can be returned by the same process with various Index Failure Codes, or Indexation Error Codes.

The following table describes what these codes mean, and what the usual reason for them to occur is. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Failure code Value Description OTHER 1 The indexing of object text failed for an uncommon reason. For information about the failure, search for the identifier of the object in the FileNetÂ® P8 server log. TRUNCATED 2 The indexing of some object text failed because of text truncation. For more information, see the following topic: Text extracted from a document during indexing is truncated [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.css.trouble.doc/p8pcs002.htm?lang=en-us]. ENCRYPTED 4 The extraction of text from a content element document failed because the document is encrypted. PASSWORD_PROTECTED 8 The extraction of text from a content element document failed because the document is password protected. MALFORMED 16 The extraction of text from a content element document failed because the document is corrupt. UNSUPPORTED_TYPE 32 Text extraction for a content element document failed because the document does not belong to an indexable document type. For information about indexable document types, see the following topic: Indexable document types and text extraction [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.ce.admin.tasks.doc/cbr/csscbr_indexable_documenttype.htm?lang=en-us]. NO_TEXT_EXTRACTED 64 The extraction of text from a content element document failed because the document is empty. UNRECOGNIZED_ENCODING 128 The recognition of the character encoding for object text failed. The text might use a mixture of encodings. CONVERSION_DISABLED 256 Text extraction for a content element document failed. PARTIALLY_INDEXED CONTENT 512 The indexing of some object text failed because of system resource constraints. MALFORMED_XML 1024 The parsing of the XML in a content element document failed because the XML is not well formed. FALLBACK_PARSER_INVOKED 2048 The parsing of some object text might have failed. SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 4096 The extraction of text from a content element document failed because the size of the binary or XML document exceeds a predefined limit. CONTENT_NOT_FOUND 8192 The retrieval of the content for the object failed. MARKED_AS_SKIPPED 16384 The object was marked as skipped for indexing. Object text was not indexed. For information about skipping indexing, see Skipping indexing for an object [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.ce.admin.tasks.doc/cbr/csscbr_index_skipping.htm?lang=en-us]. TIME_OUT 32768 Object text was not indexed because indexing was not completed within the index period as defined by the server parameter documentTimeout. For information about this parameter, see Configuration tool parameters [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGLW6_5.2.0/com.ibm.p8.ce.admin.tasks.doc/cbr/csscbr_configtool_parameters.htm?lang=en-us].
