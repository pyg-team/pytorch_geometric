PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All IMS R900 users running REXX             *
   *                  transaction programs.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: MSGCSV002I when running IMS REXX        *
   *                      transaction application programs.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: INSTALL CORRECTIVE SERVICE FOR APAR/PTF      *
   ****************************************************************
   MSGCSV002I occurs when the use count for module DFSREXX1
   exceeds 32767. A LOAD SVC is issued for module DFSREXX1
   each time an IMS REXX transaction application program is
   invoked. The module is not loaded for each call but the
   module use count is incremented for each LOAD call.
   The use count is decremented for each DELETE SVC call.
   Module DFSREXX0 issued the LOAD SVC but no DELETE SVC is
   ever issued. This caused the module use count to reach its
   maximum value and caused message CSV002I to be issued.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  AIDS: RIDS/SYS RIDS/CNTRL SYS CNTRL
     DEP: NONE
     GEN:
   
   *** END IMS KEYWORDS ***
   Module DFSREXX0 has been changed to not issue the LOAD SVC
   if module DFSREXX1 has already been loaded.
   DFSREXX0 now will use the CSVQUERY macro to locate a copy of
   DFSREXX1. If a return code of 0 is received from the CSVQUERY
   call (indicating the module has been located) then the LOAD SVC
   will not be issued.
