CAUSE
64-bit and 32-bit version installed resulting in a second IBM Installation Manager path with both installs sharing ProgramData 


ENVIRONMENT
Windows



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The installation should be 32-bit, not 64-bit. The first install was 32-bit and the second install was 64-bit. Two IBM Installation Manager executables now exist on the same PC. 

The first install is in c:\Program Files(x86)\IBM\ and is 1.8.4.
The second install is in c:\Program Files\IBM and is 1.8.4.
Neither installation will launch.

The registry error points to IBM Installation Manager is 1.8.4 at C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Installation Manager\eclipse which is the 32-bit version path. 
1.8.3 at C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager\eclipse which is the 64-bit version path. Both 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 are using c:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager. 

The Windows Registry shows: 
AppDataLocation c:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager 
Launcher c:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\InstallationManager\eclipse\IBMIM.exe Location c:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Installation Manager 
Version 1.8.4 

Installation Manager logs show: 
When the 11/12/17 update/install of RDz/RPPz/RTC occurred, it used 64-bit with 1.8.3, not the existing 1.8.4.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The first installation which was performed as a silent install and used a different bit version and Installation Manager version than the second install. 


To completely resolve, uninstall the current version and attempt to reinstall using the original 32-bit version.

Other possible workarounds include, but have not been tested:

1) IBMIM.ini and eclipse.ini point to the location for the launcher. 
For example, if in IBMIM.ini, the dll and jar point to a 64-bit location, change to 32-bit location. 
Change to C:\Program Files (x86)\... 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


and in eclipse.ini, change to C:\Program Files (x86)\  * 
 * 
 * 


2) Change the registry entry so that it points to 1.8.3 32-bit again.  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

The Launcher and Location would need to change to c:\Program Files\ and the version would need to be 1.8.3. 
The registry should be backed up in case it needs to be restored. Refer to http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678290 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21678290] 

3) Check Control Panel/Installed Programs to see if both IBM IM 1.8.3 and IBM IM 1.8.4 are listed. 
Uninstall the 1.8.4 version. 

4) Restore the old version of IBM Installation Manager 1.8.3. 
See http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21290142 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21290142] 
a) backup agentDataLocation in C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager\ 
b) Rename the IBM Installation Manager Install folder of C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager to something similar to C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager.old 
c) Reinstall IBM Installation Manager in the same previous location of C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager with the download from 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039631 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039631]

Clean up the .old when all is working successfully. 

To move the entire installation from a 32-bit version to a 64-bit version of IBM Installation Manager, use the following instructions:
