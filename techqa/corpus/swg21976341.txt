Edit the following file:
Windows - <installation directory>\runtime\java\jre\lib\security\java.security
Linux - <installation directory>/runtime/java/jre64/jre/lib/security/java.security
Mac - <installation directory>/runtime/java/jre64/Contents/Home/lib/security/java.security

Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property. For example:
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5

Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property. For example:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA

The MQ Light Server will need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
