PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of CICS Configuration Manager      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ISPF dialog receives 'Socket Init       *
   *                      failed' attempting to connect to the    *
   *                      CICS Configuration Manager Server SSL   *
   *                      port when the region specifies SIT      *
   *                      parameter ENCRYPTION=TLS12.             *
   ****************************************************************
   The customer is implementing SSL security in the Configuration
   Manager Server region. The SIT ENCRYPTION parameter is set to
   TLS12. When the ISPF dialog attempts to connect to the SSL port,
   the following ISPF dialog error occurs:
   
   CCVS020 Socket Init failed
   A Secure Socket Init failed. It could be:  connection closed by
   peer; incorrect message received from peer; Peer certificate is
   removed; Insufficient storage.
   
   The CICS region MSGUSR output contains the following messages:
   
   DFHSO0123 <date> <time> <applid>
             Return code 412 received from function
             'gsk_secure_socket_init' of System SSL.
             Reason: Unsupported operation.
             Peer: <ipaddress>, TCPIPSERVICE: CCVSSL.
   
   DFHWB0732 <date> <time> <applid>
              CWXN CICS Web attach processing encountered a sockets
              I/O error while receiving a client request.
              Host IP address: <ipaddress>.
              Client IP address: <ipaddress>.
              TCPIPSERVICE: CCVSSL
   
   The problem arises because the SSL socket handling routines are
   configured to handle TLS10.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS Configuration Manager is corrected. The SSL socket handling
   routines are now improved to handle TLS11 and TLS12 as well as
   TLS10. The correction applies to both the ISPF dialog client and
   the batch utilities CCVBMAIN and CCVBHKP.
