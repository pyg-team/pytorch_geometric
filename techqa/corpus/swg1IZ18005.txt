APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: jextract return code is 0 or 255
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   Customer is running jextract inside general-purpose scripts or
   tools. Their production environment consists of multiple JREs
   (31-bit mode, 64-bit mode, V1.4.2, V1.5.0, etc...). Dumps
   can be generated by any of these JREs.  They would like to have
   jextract return more specific error codes so that appropriate
   error handling can be performed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  jextract messages to stderr/out do give some indication of the
   specific error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  jextract provided only a single error return code of 255, needs
   multiple return codes for different errors
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR8
   .
   new return codes added:
   0 - OK
   1 - SYNTAX ERROR (command syntax errors eg wrong number of
   parameters etc. usage/help messages are written to stdout)
   2 - FILE ERROR (could not open file, or file is not a valid zOS
   system dump etc)
   3 - NOJVM ERROR (could not find a known/supported JVM in the
   dump, eg dump contains a 142 Sov JVM rather than a J9 JVM)
   4 - ADDRESS ERROR (found a supported JVM but at an address out
   of 31-bit range. this one will happen if they run 31-bit
   jextract on a 64-bit dump)
   5 - VERSION ERROR (found a supported JVM but the version is not
   an exact match for this version of jextract - ie wrong SR or
   iFix level)
   6 - INTERNAL ERROR
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20080509 or later
