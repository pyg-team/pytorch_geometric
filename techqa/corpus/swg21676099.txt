QUESTION
 Where can IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.x, WebSphere Process Server v7, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus V7 and V7.5.x, IBM Business Monitor V7.5.x, and WebSphere Business Monitor V7 customers download the Websphere Application Server version 7.0 fix pack repository images to upgrade their WebSphere Application Server installations using IBM Installation Manager? 

ANSWER
WebSphere Process Server Version 7.0, IBM Business Process Manager Version 7.5.x, WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Version 7.0 and 7.5.x, IBM Business Monitor Version 7.5.x, and WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0 products use IBM Installation Manager to install their binaries. To upgrade the WebSphere Application Server to a later version you will need the WebSphere Application Server fix pack as an IBM Installation Manager repository. 

If you have internet access you will be able to upgrade your WebSphere Application Server using the IBM Installation Manager live repository. If you do not have internet access then the following FTP site has the collection of all the WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 fix pack repositories which can be used with IBM Installation Manager. 


ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/bpm/repositories/downloads/was/ [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/bpm/repositories/downloads/was/] 

 

Each subdirectory contains downloadable .zip files of the IBM Installation Manager repositories for the WebSphere Application Server specific fix pack.

You can download the PART1 and PART2 fix pack repository which is for all supported systems and architectures, or you can download the sliced repositories for specific operating systems and architectures that you need.

Example : 

Directory name "70033 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/bpm/repositories/downloads/was/70033/]" contain the following images . 

 * Fix pack image for all operating systems and platforms:
   
   was.7.0.0.33.fp.all_Part1of2.zip ---- 2,073,768,159 bytes
   was.7.0.0.33.fp.all_Part2of2.zip ---- 2,078,505,024 bytes
   
   Extract both parts under the same directory, which includes all WebSphere Application Server offerings for all supported operating systems and architectures. 
   
 * Fix pack image for a specific operating system: 
   
   was.nd.7.0.0.33.fp.win.zip ----------- 1,083,512,033 bytes - contains both 32bit and 64bit for Windows
   was.nd.7.0.0.33.fp.linux.x86.zip ---- 1,050,139,800 bytes - contains both 32bit and 64bit for Linux x86 and x86-64
   
   
   Sliced for specific operating system is much smaller in size compared to the image for all operating system. It will be faster to download and require less hard drive space to extract and upgrade the product.
