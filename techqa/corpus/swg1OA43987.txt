   require all JAR files used in applet or Java Web Start
   deployments have the permissions attribute set in the JAR
   manifest file.  This requirement will affect the TEP client,
   both browser and Java Web Start modes.  Without compliance
   with this requirement, the TEP client may not start after
   downloading.
