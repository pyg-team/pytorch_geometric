QUESTION
 Is DB2 Purescale supported by Content Manager OnDemand Multiplatform? 

CAUSE
PureScale is a cluster feature from DB2 and you may want to use it with Content Manager OnDemand

ANSWER
PureScale is transparent for Content Manager OnDemand Multiplatform. 

 
OnDemand V8.5 and V9 were tested with DB2 PureScale a while back and both worked. But, OnDemand V8.5 is not able to take advantage of the Automatic Tablespaces. OnDemand V9 does support Automatic Tablespaces. 
The 8.5.0.9 fixpack has been currency tested with DB2 V10.5. 
The CMOD MP 9.0.0.5 fixpack will be currency tested with DB2 V10.5. No issues were found testing V8.5 and our expectation is that none will be found when testing OnDemand V9.

There are some things to note about OnDemand V8.5 and V9 with DB2 10.1 or above:

To answer the main question, yes, OnDemand 9.0 is supported with DB2 10.5 in a PureScale environment.
