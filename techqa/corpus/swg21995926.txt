3. Now this computer is no longer visible in the Console unless reactivated by the BigFix Client itself. 
However, all old information, such as action history, still keeps in database. You still can see the corresponding action history from Console -> All Content -> Actions, but lack of related action status and computer information.

4. Once the client gets reactivated and reports back to the Console, the computer with its old information will be restored intact. Computer will be listed in Console with the same computer ID and previous action history, relevant Fixlets and Task, and so on.
