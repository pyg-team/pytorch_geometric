Title: IBM Installing SFG to ISBI with an interim fix results in mixed up interim fix setup and IIM does not allow to reinstall the interim fix. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install IBM Sterling File Gateway (SFG) as extension for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI) that already has an interim fix applied results in the interim fix not being recognized anymore.
Attempts to install the interim fix again using the IBM Installation Manager (IIM) are completing without installing the interim fix. 

SYMPTOM
Pre installing SFG dump_info reported for example:
HotfixVersion: 5020603_2A 

After installing SFG using InstallService dump_info reports for example (no line for "HotfixVersion:"):
filegateway_HotfixVersion: 

Calling IIM's userinstc returns too fast just the following:
Installed fix_5.2.6.3_2A_1.0.0.20170703_1917 to the <isbi> directory.


CAUSE
When installing SFG using InstallService interim fixes are removed.
Interim fixes needs to be applied again after installing SFG using InstallService.
See IBM Knowledge Center for SFG 2.2.0: Applying Sterling File Gateway fixes in an interim fix [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4TGX_2.2.0/com.ibm.help.sfg_installation_226.doc/sfg_installing_sfg_component_interim_fix.html] 

But IIM only allows this after that interim is uninstalled (i.e. unregistered).


ENVIRONMENT
ISBI installed with IIM and with an interim fix applied but initially installed without SFG.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can use the IIM in GUI mode or in in console mode to unregister / uninstall an interim fix: 

To start the IIM console mode call:
~/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl -c 

or:
<installMedia>/InstallationManager/IM_Linux/tools/imcl -c 

In console mode please apply the following options to uninstall interim fix 5.2.6.3_2A:
-> 5. Uninstall - Remove installed software packages
-> N. Next
-> 2. [ ] fix_5.2.6.3_2A 1.0.0.20170703_1917
-> U. Uninstall 

This will only unregister the fix 5.2.6.3_2A from your IIM repository.
It is not changing the ISBI installation (i.e. the interim fix is de facto not getting uninstalled). 

Afterwards you can install the interim fix again. For example using a response file:
InstallationManager/IM_Linux/userinstc input <response-file>.xml -acceptLicense -log <logfile>.log
