RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

Installing FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2 with IBM Content Search Services 5.2 each text collection that is created contains a collectionConfiguration.xml file. Prior to version 5.2, this text collection configuration file was called collection.xml.

During an upgrade to FileNet Content Platform Engine 5.2 with IBM Content Search Services 5.2, the collection.xml file is retained while also creating a new collectionConfiguration.xml file. The values from the prior collection.xml are copied to the new collectionConfiguration.xml file. After the upgrade, continue the collectionConfiguration.xml is used and the collection.xml file is not.

If the index area path is updated after the application upgrade, the old index area path can exist in the new collectionConfiguration.xml file for each text collection. If this is the case, each text collection configuration file needs to be updated with the new index area path. The steps are: 

 

 1. Stop IBM Content Search Services (all instances).
    
    
 2. Locate the collectionConfiguration.xml for each text collection in the specified index area on the file system.
    
    
 3. Update the following line reflecting the new updated index area path:
    <physicalPath>/<index area path here>/<collection name here>/data</physicalPath>.
    
    
 4. When done, restart all IBM Content Search Services previously stopped in step 1.
