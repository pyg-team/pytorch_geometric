APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cobol OCCURS within OCCURS can result in message "IRX0041I Error
   running VIDMCPYB, line 771: Bad arithmetic conversion".
   Assembler packed decimal fields are interpreted incorrectly
   resulting in invalid DB2 column lengths.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  CICS VT auto mapper changed to process these statements
   correctly.
