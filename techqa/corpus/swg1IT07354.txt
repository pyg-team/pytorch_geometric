ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The StoredIQ Appstack configuration requires that the username
   and password be blank for the default configuration in order to
   send email notifications from the Appstack.
   
   In order to use an authenticated user with the StoredIQ
   Appstack configuration you must provide authority in Exchange
   and Active Directory.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following procedure has been created, tested and documented
   below:
   
   How do I configure the StoredIQ Appstack to use authenticated
   users for sending SMTP email notifications?
   
   The StoredIQ Appstack configuration requires that the username
   and password be blank for the default configuration in order to
   send email notifications from the Appstack.
   
   In order to use an authenticated user with the StoredIQ
   Appstack configuration you must provide authority in Exchange
   and Active Directory.
   
   While it is possible to use the default SMTP Receive Connector
   it is recommended that a custom SMTP Receive Connector be
   created and configured to work with the StoredIQ Appstack. If a
   custom SMTP Receive Connector is created and defined with the
   specific IP address of the StoredIQ Appstack, network traffic
   from the Appstack will utilize that connector.
   
   To create a custom SMTP Receive Connector follow these steps:
   
       In the Exchange Management Console navigate to the Server
   Configuration, Hub Transport section
       Select 'New Receive Connector...' from the menu on the
   right side
       Provide a name for the new SMTP Receive Connector and
   select 'Next'
       You may utilize the default port of 25. If you define
   another port be sure it is open on the Firewall of the Exchange
       Provide the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the
   Exchange Server in the field and select 'Next'
       On the Remote Network settings page select 'Add..' and
   enter the IP address of the StoredIQ Appstack and select 'OK'
       Select the IP address range of 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 and
   select the Red 'X' to delete it and then select 'Next'
       Review the configuration details and select 'New' to create
   the new custom SMTP Receive Connector
   
   
   Once this has been done there are two methods that can be
   employed to authenticate users.
   
   Method one: If you wish to configure the StoredIQ Appstack to
   authenticate on any existing domain user you should follow
   these steps:
   
       Log into your Exchange server
       Launch ADSI Edit
       In ADSI Edit navigate to CN=Configuration<domain>,
   CN=Services, CN=First Organization, CN=Administrative Groups,
   CN=Exchange Administrative Group, CN=Servers, CN=<Exchange
   Server>, CN=Protocols, CN=SMTP, CN=SMTP Receive Connectors
       Right click the custom SMTP Receive Connector you have
   created in the previous step. If you are using the default SMTP
   Receive Connector select that.
       Select the 'Security' tab
       In the upper section highlight 'Authenticated Users'
       In the Permissions section below select 'Allow' for the
   'Accept any Sender' and the 'Accept Authoritative Domain
   Sender' options
       Select 'OK'
   
   
   Method two: If you wish to configure the StoredIQ Appstack to
   authenticate with a single specific domain user and no other
   user, you should follow these steps:
   
       Log into your Exchange server
       Launch ADSI Edit
       In ADSI Edit navigate to CN=Configuration<domain>,
   CN=Services, CN=First Organization, CN=Administrative Groups,
   CN=Exchange Administrative Group, CN=Servers, CN=<Exchange
   Server>, CN=Protocols, CN=SMTP, CN=SMTP Receive Connectors
       Right click the custom SMTP Receive Connector you have
   created in the previous step. If you are using the default SMTP
   Receive Connector select that.
       Select the 'Security' tab
       In the upper section select the 'Add...' button
       Identify the single specific user you wish to allow
   authentication permissions for and select 'OK'
       In the upper 'Group or user names:' section identify the
   newly added user and highlight it
       In the Permissions section below select 'Allow' for the
   'Accept any Sender' and the 'Accept Authoritative Domain
   Sender' options
       Select 'OK'
   
   
   To configure the StoredIQ Appstack:
   
       Log in as root and launch the Appstack Configuration
   utility by executing the command /siq/bin/appstackcfg
       Provide the fully qualified hostname or short hostname for
   the Appstack in the Domain name field
       Provide the IP address for the StoredIQ Gateway server
       Provide the fully qualified hostname or IP address of the
   Exchange server
       Select the default Port of 25 or modify it to suit the port
   of your custom SMTP Receive Connector
       Provide the username of the user you wish to authenticate
   into the Exchange server with.
           If you used Method one above you may use any user name
   and password as long as they are a member of the domain
           If you used Method two, you must use only the user name
   of the single user you have granted permissions for
       Enter the password for the user selected in the previous
   step
       Select 'Enable TLS'
       Select 'Restart appstack services' (an alternative to this
   is to restart the Appstack services from the command line)
       Select 'Save and exit'
       Wait for all StoredIQ services to restart
   
   
   You should now be able to send email notifications from the
   StoredIQ Appstack when generating reports or when using the
   eDiscovery Matter Dashboard.
