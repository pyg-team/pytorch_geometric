Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile Version 6.1, 7.0 and 8.0 that is used by IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]

DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
· IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager versions 7.0 and 7.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES

IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager (TSPM) is affected through IBM WebSphere Application Server. If you are running TSPM with one of the affected versions of WebSphere, update your IBM WebSphere Application Server with the appropriate Interim Fix based on information in the WebSphere security bulletin:
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with RSA Export Keys may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-0138). [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613] 
After the application of the Interim Fix or Fix Pack for CVE-2015-0138 aka. “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys", the RC4 algorithm is disabled by default.

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
