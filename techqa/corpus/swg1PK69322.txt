PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects administrators who are    *
   *                  configuring a Microsoft Internet            *
   *                  Information Services Web server Version     *
   *                  5.0 with WebSphere Application Server       *
   *                  Versions 6.0.x and 6.1.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The "Configuring Microsoft Internet     *
   *                      Information Services (IIS)" topic       *
   *                      provides steps to configure IIS         *
   *                      Version 5.0. However, the topic does    *
   *                      not correctly list the IIS Web server   *
   *                      directory.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The IIS Version 5.0 section of the "Configuring Microsoft
   Internet Information Services (IIS)" topic needs to state the
   complete path to the IIS Web server directory. The complete
   path is plugins_root\bin\IIS_Web_server_name
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The configuration steps for IIS Version 5.0 in the
   "Configuring Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)"
   topic will be updated. The references to the plugins_root\bin
   directory will be replaced with references to the
   plugins_root\bin\IIS_Web server_name directory.
