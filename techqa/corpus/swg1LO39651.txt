APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The group name is not getting into the hNames list.  Set these
   additional debug variables on the server:
    DEBUG_GROUP_CACHE=1
    WEBAUTH_VERBOSE_TRACE=1
   
   Retried the policy test.  This showed that indeed the group was
   not getting into the hNames list.  The hNames list was being
   found in the group cache and we were using it.  So I edited the
   group, saved it, and checked that the change was reflected in
   the $ServerAccess view - and it was.  I disconnected from the
   server, re-authenticated, and got the same result.
   
   I checked and the server had been running since some time.  It
   appeared to me that for some reason the group cache is not
   getting updated.  The debug output kept saying it was
   up-to-date, even though I had made changes to groups.  So I
   restarted the server, which flushes the cache, and upon restart
   everything worked perfectly!
   
   I also tried setting GROUP_CACHE_UPDATE_SUPPRESS_TIME=1 in the
   INI to force it to refresh, but that didn't help either.
   
   ==========================================================
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   Create a Roaming Policy with Roaming Settings (Domino Roaming
   User)
   Create a test group with some test users
   Use the Assignment Tool to add the test group to the Roaming
   Policy
   Sign on to a client as one of the test users and you expect to
   get the policy pushed down to the local names.nsf...but it does
   not
   You also expect to receive the prompt to convert to
   roaming....but this does not happen either
