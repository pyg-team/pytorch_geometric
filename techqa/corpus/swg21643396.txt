QUESTION
 Missing values for PVU Full Capacity or PVU Subcapacity for IBM DB2 Workgroup Server Edition - Authorized User v9.7. 

CAUSE
In the Manage Software Inventory tab, the agents are not reporting back any values for PVU Full Capacity or PVU Subcapacity for IBM DB2 Workgroup Server Edition PVU Option, Part # D55TWLL. The agents are in OK status and no issues with software scan. The software catalog, PVU table and Tier Table are all updated with the latest version. 

Check to confirm if DB2 is actually installed and running with these two DB2 commands:

db2level command:


DB21085I Instance "db2srv1" uses "64" bits and DB2 code release "SQL09075" with level identifier "08060107". 
Informational tokens are "DB2 v9.7.0.5", "s111017", "IP23285", and Fix Pack "5". Product is installed at "/opt/IBM/db2/V9.7". 



db2licm -l command:


Product name: "DB2 Workgroup Server Edition" 
License type: "Authorized User Option" 
Expiry date: "Permanent" 
Product identifier: "db2wse" 
Version information: "9.7" 
Max number of Value Units: "480" 
Max amount of memory (GB): "64" 
Enforcement policy: "Soft Stop" 
Number of licensed authorized users: "5" 
Product name: "DB2 Connect Server" 
Expiry date: "Expired" 
Product identifier: "db2consv" 
Version information: "9.7"

ANSWER
Since DB2 product comes with a different types of license, depending which a type of license is registered the DB2 product. 



Based on the above outputs from db2licm -l command, the "DB2 Workgroup Server Edition" is registered as "Authorized User Option" license type. 

With this "Authorized User Option" license type, it does not report any PVU usage. It is important to know which license type should be used and ensure to use a correct activation license key file to activate the DB2 product.
