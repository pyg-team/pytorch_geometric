QUESTION
 Explain what the SOA node names are composed of and how to display them the way you want in the TEP view . 

CAUSE
Users want to be able to manage node names with unique names. Often times, lengthy host names and server names that exist are concatenated to make the SOA node name, resulting in duplicate names in the TEP view. This can be very confusing.
Being able to customize the name is helpful especially in the environment where there are many similar lengthy names.


ANSWER
Following are the rules that you should follow to customize the displayed node name to fit your specific needs. 

1. In this example, the displayed node names appear in the red box in the screen shot below.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667268&amp;aid=1]
2. Total allowed name length is 32 characters.
3. Total reserved character length is 13. 

 * The reserved fields/characters in the node name are (refer the node names in screen shot red box) : ("D4" + ":" + 8 (check sum length) + ":"+ "-") 
 * Note: The "check sum" is for internal usage. It is not visible in node name.


4. Total character length left for (host name + server name) is 19.  * Host name character length (min:1, max:14). If host name is longer, it is truncated. 
 * Server name length (min: 5, max: 18). Available Sever name length = (19 - host name length). 


It is possible to alias a long host name with a short alias (down to 1 character long). 
On the screenshot above, the first node "D4::pvt81010010001-serve" is the node name before aliasing, where the host name is pvt81010010001. 
The second node name - "D4::pvt8-server1" is the node name after the long host name was aliased with short string pvt8. (These 2 nodes are shown here together for demonstration purposes only. In practice, one of them (the second) would receive data while the first would shortly become inactive). 

For information on how to alias a host name see the second link below.
