APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a module is opened in Exclusive Edit for un-managed Changes
   . Changing the Edit mode to Shareable edit does not display the
   dialog to select Default RCR.
   
   Once in Shareable edit mode , changes can be made to the Managed
   Attributes , which are recorded in to the default RCR previously
   Selected for the User. If there is no default RCR for the user ,
   a message is displayed 'No default Requirement Change Request
   cannot record the changes'. All this while the module status bar
   will indicate that the module is open for un managed Changes.
   Even if changes are made to a unmanaged attribute , it is not
   saved . Changes are discarded with the error  'No default
   Requirement Change Request cannot record the changes'
   
   This behavior is confusing for the users. Also since it
   automatically records managed changes in to a previously
   selected default RCR , there is a risk of changes being recorded
   to a wrong RCR.
   
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce
   
   - Open a Module under Change Control for editing un-managed
   Attributes.
   - Change over to Shareable edit mode (Edit ? Mode ? Shareable )
   - No Dialog box to select Default RCR is displayed.
   - Make Changes to some managed attribute value
      - If there is a default RCR selected for the current   user
   in a previous session the changes will be written to this RCR.
   - Make Changes to a Un- managed attribute , Even these cannot be
   saved , Changes are discarded with the error 'No default
   Requirement Change Request cannot record the changes'

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a module is opened in exclusive edit for un-managed
   changes mode and the user changes the edit mode to Shareable
   Edit, once the user attempts to lock an object to edit, the
   Integration will display the following message to the user
   
   "The change management integration is unable to continue in
   Shareable Edit Mode without a default RCR.\nThis module will
   be opened in read-only mode"
   
   The module will be reloaded in read-only mode and users of
   the integration can change back to shareable edit mode,
   which will then prompt the user to select a default RCR.
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce
   
   - Open a Module under Change Control for editing un-managed
   Attributes.
   - Change over to Shareable edit mode (Edit ? Mode ?
   Shareable )
   - Make Changes to some managed attribute/unmanaged
   attributes by locking an object for edit.
