Title: IBM Unable to see icons in banner in TM1 Contributor/TM1 Applications - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User logs into Contributor/TM1 Applications and is missing icons in the banner. There is a red X where the icons should be.



See attached screenshots below. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the following directory and make sure there are 9 files in it:
C:\Program Files\IBM\cognos\tm1_64\webapps\pmpsvc\skins\corporate\shared\images

In that path, "corporate" is the default, so if using one of the other skins then it will be in whatever skin is being used.

This is the one for the Help icon:

This is the one for the Help drop down:
dropdown_arrow_banner.gif

This is the one for My Preferences:
icon_my_area.gif

If the files are there, then try having just one browser window open and delete the temporary internet files, then close the browser. Restart the TM1 Contributor or TM1Applications service and then open a new browser and test again.

If any of the nine files are missing, then there was likely some glitch in the install process and it is probably best to uninstall/reinstall the TM1 Applications (Contributor) portion. It may even make sense to reinstall the entire application because if all components were installed at the same time, and there was a failure in the install process, then there are likely other things missing that will cause a problem later.

If installing on a Windows 2008 or Windows 7 machine, make sure that the installation is done by an administrator on the machine and also right-click the executable and choose Run as Administrator.
