ABSTRACT
 The IBM Cognos TM1 Application Server (pmpsvc planning service) does not run with the standard Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you are using the Oracle JRE instead of the IBM JRE, you must download a file from the Apache Xerces site to fix this issue. 

CONTENT
To run Cognos TM1 Applications with Oracle JRE, complete the following steps: 

 1. From the Apache Xerces web site (xerces.apache.org), download the Xerces Java binaries file listed under the Binary Distributions section (for example: Xerces-J-bin.2.11.0.zip). 
 2. Extract the contents of the file to a folder on your system. 
 3. Copy xercesImpl.jar and xml-apis.jar to the webapps\pmpsvc\WEB-INF\lib folder for your Cognos TM1 installation.


Typical installation location is: 
C:\Program Files\IBM\cognos\tm1_64\webapps\pmpsvc\WEB-INF\lib
