APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Rational Developer for System z V8.5.x client may hang
   when using Software Analyzer
   
   If Software Analyzer it run on a COBOL program which contains
   COPYBOOK statements it may cause the client to hang.
   
   Steps to recreate:
   1. Open a COBOL file from your remote systems view with either
   LPEX or the COBOL editor.
   2. Right click in the editor and click Software Analyzer.
   3. Observe hang issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Using local projects may resolve the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If Software Analyzer is run on a COBOL program which contains
   COPYBOOK statements it may cause the client to hang.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code was updated to avoid downloading non-cached copybooks
   during code review parse. This change causes the code review to
   avoid the code path that causes the hang. Note that copybooks
   will not be updated during code review, so if a user wants to
   include copybooks in the code review analysis, the copybooks
   should be loaded and cached (for example, by opening the program
   that includes the copybooks in an editor) prior to running the
   analysis.
