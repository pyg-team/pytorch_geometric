APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario:
   - A user "userA" is logged on
   - A page "pageA" is created via XMLAccess (via the command
   line); the same user "userA" is used to execute the script
   - In the browser, the user triggers a re-rendering of the page
   (either by pressing F5 or clicking on a link)
   - As the new page was created by the very same user, the
   navigation is supposed to contain the new page
   
   Error:
   The page is not displayed until the user logs out and logs in
   again.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround is to log out and log in again. Updates are then
   visible.
