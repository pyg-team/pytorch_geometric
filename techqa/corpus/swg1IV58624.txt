APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: A SIGSEGV, GPF, or S0C4 ABEND is raised in an
   AOT-compiled Java method that has been loaded from the shared
   class cache. The shared class cache has previously been created
   with the Java "keytool" utility, which was invoked with class
   sharing enabled.
   .

   )
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue can be avoided by disabling AOT compilations with the
   -Xnoaot option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is caused by missing relocation records in the
   AOT-compiled method. The missing records cause a second JVM
   instance to skip required compatibility checks when loading the
   compiled code from the shared class cache. As a result, the JVM
   incorrectly concludes that the code can be loaded and executed,
   when the code is in fact invalid for that JVM instance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR will be fixed in the following Java Releases:
      6 R1 SR8       (6.1.8.0)
   .
   The JIT compiler has been updated to generate relocation records
   correctly in this case.
