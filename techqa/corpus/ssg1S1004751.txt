Title: IBM H207142: Host does not see LUN under Microsoft Windows Cluster Host type - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 RETAIN tip: H207142 

SYMPTOM
A Logical Unit Number (LUN) may not be recognized when one of the following two host types is selected: 

 * Microsoft Windows Clustered 
 * Microsoft Windows Server 2003/Server 2008 Clustered (supports Dynamic Multi-Pathing (DMP))


However, if the host type is changed to one of the following host types, the LUNs are able to be recognized by the same host servers:  * Microsoft Windows 
 * Microsoft Windows Server 2003/Server 2008 Non-Clustered (supports DMP)


This issue affects any IBM System Storage DS Storage Controller running 7.83.xx.xx firmware and one of the following Non-Volatile Static Random Access Memory (NVSRAM) files:  * N1818D37R0783V09 (for DCS3700) 
 * N1818P37R0783V09 (for DCS3700 Performance Module) 
 * N1818D51R0783V09 (for DS5100) 
 * N1818D53R0783V09 (for DS5300) 
 * N1814D20R0783V09 (for DS5020) 
 * N1814D50R0783V09 (for DS3950) 
 * N1746D35R0783V09 (for DS3512/DS3524) 
 * N1746D35L0783V09 (DS3512/DS3524 Simplex)

Affected configurations The system may be any of the following IBM servers: 

 * IBM System Storage DCS3700 Storage Subsystem, type 1818, any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS3512, type 1746, any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS3524, type 1746, any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS3950 Express, type 1814, any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS5020 Disk Controller (1814-20A), any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS5100 Storage Controller, type 1818, any model 
 * IBM System Storage DS5300 Storage Controller, type 1818, any model


This tip is not software specific. This tip is not option specific. 

The following system firmware level(s) are affected:
1. 83.xx.xx
Solution 

The fix for this issue is contained in the following 7.83 controller firmware NVSRAMs: 

 

N1818D37R0783V10 (for DCS3700)
N1818P37R0783V10 (for DCS3700 Performance Module)
N1818D51R0783V10 (for DS5100)
N1818D53R0783V10 (for DS5300)
N1814D20R0783V10 (for DS5020)
N1814D50R0783V10 (for DS3950)
N1746D35R0783V10 (for DS3512/DS3524)
N1746D35L0783V10 (DS3512/DS3524 Simplex) The previously listed NVSRAMs can be used in place of the older NVSRAM versions that were shipped with the 7.83 controller firmware. 

To resolve this issue, using the IBM Storage Manager Client, users can install the system appropriate NVSRAM at the current level of 7.83.xx.xx firmware. 

Workaround 

Install the appropriate NVSRAM level from the included list. 

Additional information 

This issue was caused by a field in the NVSRAM that was created at the incorrect offset. Loading the new NVSRAM noted previously either by itself or as part of a firmware upgrade will resolve the issue.
