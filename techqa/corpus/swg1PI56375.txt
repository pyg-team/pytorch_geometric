   ****************************************************************
   DISPLAY CHLAUTH(xxx) MATCH(yyy) should display all the channel
   authentication records that match the filter in the MATCH
   keyword. The "ALL" keyword is to request the display of all the
   attributes of the matching records.
   
   There is a problem parsing the ALL keyword that causes the MATCH
   keyword on the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command to be ignored resulting
   in no matching records to display.
   
   PCF command INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS fails because the definition of
   the command template for the parser is incorrect for keywords
   ADDRESS(MQCACH_CONNECTION_NAME) and
   CLNTUSER(MQCACH_CLIENT_USER_ID).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DISPLAY CHLAUTH(xxx) MATCH(yyy) ALL command has been
   modified to parse the MATCH and ALL keywords properly producing
   the correct output of the matching channel authentication
   records with all the attributes.
   
   The template definition for PCF command INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS has
   been updated with the correct flags for keywords ADDRESS and
   CLNTUSER.
