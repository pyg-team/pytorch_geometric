CAUSE
An incorrect upgrade of Datacap can cause the tabs.xml file to be missing.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, do one of the following: 

 * Copy the tabs.xml file, located at C:\datacap\tmclient, from a good system with an identical install to the same location on the problem system. 
 * Rerun the update with one of the following command line switches:  * If Datacap Studio is installed: Update.exe /V"DSACTION=3" - Installs the full access version of tabs.xml 
    * If Datacap Studio is not installed: Update.exe /V"DSACTION=2" - Installs the read-only version of tabs.xml
