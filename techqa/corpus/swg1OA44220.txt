APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

   reason "Set ASID Failed" (in message KMQMQ113E), the MQ agent
   can hang next time the same queue manager is monitored.
   You may see KMQMQ111I message indicating the collection
   initialization is in progress but no corresponding KMQMQ112I
   message following KMQMQ111I.

   *                      "Set ASID Failed" (in message           *

   *                      following KMQMQ111I for this queue      *

   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply this PTF.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The MQ agent code acquires lock when setting addressability
   to the queue manager. The lock is not correctly released
   if failed to set the addressability. When the MQ agent
   starts to monitor the same queue manager at next sampling
   cycle, it acquires the lock again even if it is already
   holding the lock. This results in the agent into the endless
   wait state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is modified to correct the flaw in the lock
   handling.
