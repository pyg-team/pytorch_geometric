QUESTION
 I have a SPSS (Sentinel RMS) License Manager installed and would like to add a new product or product feature or update a currently licensed product. How do I do that? 

ANSWER
The method for updating License Manager licensing varies by operating system. 

Windows Operating Systems 

 1. Open an Administrator Command Prompt.
    
    Note: The Command Prompt title bar must read 'Administrator: Command Prompt' or the procedure will not execute properly. 
 2. Change directory to the License Manager installation directory. If you do not know the location of the License Manager installation directory, please see TechNote 1989514 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21989514]. 
 3. Execute the following command replacing '<authcode>' with the authorization code of the product or product feature you wish to add or update. Do not include either < or > in the command.
    
    licenseactivator <authcode>
    
    OR
    
    Execute the following command replacing '<liccode>' with the license code of the product or feature you wish to add or update. Do not include either < or > in the command.
    
    licenseactivator <liccode>
    
 4. To apply multiple authorization codes at the same time, include a colon (:) between the authorization codes you wish to add, where '<authcode1>', '<authcode2>' represent different authorization codes. Do not include either < or > in the command. 
    
    licenseactivator <authcode1>:<authcode2>
    
 5.  Open Windows Services on the License Manager host.
