 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While using the BPC Explorer, you get this error message when you select an action, but the named function doesn't seem to be related to the action. 

SYMPTOM
The Business Process Choreographer (BPC) Explorer shows the error page, which contains the following tabs: 

Exception Error Message: 
This tab is selected by default. It contains the error message.

Exception Stack Trace: 
This tab contains the contents of the call stack at the point when the exception was thrown.

All Exception Error Messages: 
This tab contains the referred error message and all messages for any nested exceptions. This information can help you find the root cause of the error.

Complete Exception Stack Trace: 
This tab contains the call stack of the referenced exception and all nested exceptions. 


CAUSE
The BPC Explorer catches many different types of exceptions that the workflow engine can throw during an API call and wraps them into a referenced exception. The only information that the BPC Explorer can provide is the name of the internal function that threw the exception, which is often not the root cause of the problem.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On the error page, check the nested exceptions to identify the root cause of the problem. For example, an API call might fail because of a problem with the BPC database system. 

If studying the nested exceptions doesn't solve the problem, you can try searching for related information in the documentation repository of IBM WebSphereÂ® Process Server by clicking 'Search for more information' on the error page.
