QUESTION
The United States and parts of Canada are extending the period of Daylight Saving Time (DST) beginning in 2007. DST will begin March 11, 2007, three weeks earlier than usual. DST will end November 4, 2007, one week later than usual. 

In addition, New Zealand has also extended Daylight Saving Time. Clocks will go forward on September 30, 2007 (last Sunday in September) and put back on April 6, 2008 (first Sunday in April) instead of the third Sunday in March.

In addition, other countries are also revising or introducing Daylight Saving Time rules. 

How will this affect Lotus SmartSuite® and Lotus Organizer®?


ANSWER
DST changes are not expected to impact the functionality of Organizer or SmartSuite. No actions are required. 

The applications that comprise SmartSuite (Lotus Approach®, Lotus 1-2-3®, Lotus Freelance®, Lotus FastSite®, Organizer, Lotus SmartCenter®, Lotus Word Pro®) and Organizer standalone versions do not utilize Java-based dynamic time entries. If you enter a time function in an application, it is read from the operating system settings on your host machine and is entered as a static value. This value is not altered if the client operating system time settings are later changed.
