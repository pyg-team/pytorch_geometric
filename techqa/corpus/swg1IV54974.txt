APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Unix OS AGent, the File Info attrbiute group in a
   situation using the function "Compare Time to a Time +/- delta"
   send all the files to TEMA to evaluate them and let it filter
   them. If the comparison is maked with the Local_Time.Timestamp
   attribute, the TEMA doesn't evaluate the situation and send all
   the rows to TEMS. In this case the TEMS receives a great data
   size that can bring to performance degradation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS File Information attribute group
   sends the monitoring server more lines than necessary. For the
   File Information attribute group the agent sends the entire
   contents of the directory to the monitoring server in a
   situation with a single file and a time field compared with
   LocalTime.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The File Information attribute group now sends the monitoring
   server only the row related to specified file in the situation.
