 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The libxml2 library, used by IBM Streams may have security vulnerabilities. IBM Streams has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-9050 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9050]
DESCRIPTION: libxml2 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by a buffer over-read flaw in the xmlDictAddString function in dict.c. By sending a specially-crafted request, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126277 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126277] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-9049 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9049]
DESCRIPTION: libxml2 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by a buffer over-read flaw in the xmlDictComputeFastKey function in dict.c. By sending a specially-crafted request, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126276 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126276] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-9048 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9048]
DESCRIPTION: libxml2 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking of the strlen(buf) size in the xmlSnprintfElementContent function in valid.c. By sending a specially-crafted request, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126275 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126275] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-9047 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9047]
DESCRIPTION: libxml2 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the xmlSnprintfElementContent function in valid.c. By sending a specially-crafted request, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and cause application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVEID: CVE-2017-8872 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8872]
DESCRIPTION: libxml2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by a a buffer-over-read flaw in the htmlParseTryOrFinish function in HTMLparser.c. By sending a specially-crafted request, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a denial of service condition or obtain sensitive information on the system.
