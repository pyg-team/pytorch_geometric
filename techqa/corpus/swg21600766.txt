Title: IBM Job schedules fail with ORA-00942: table or view does not exist - United States

Text:
ORA 00942 942 table view exist modeler cads c&ds job fail TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to run jobs with Modeler streams in IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services sometimes fail with the error [SPSSOEM][Oracle JDBC Driver][Oracle]ORA-00942: table or view does not exist". 

SYMPTOM
When jobs with Modeler streams run over a large amount of data they can sometime fail with the above mentioned error. 


CAUSE
A table or view is unable to load due to a temporary space issue which results in the "table or view does not exist" error.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the job has run successfully in the past but is now failing or only fails when processing a large amount of data check the Modeler temp directory to see if there are abandoned temp files. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Temporary files are created by Modeler and used to store information for a short time; the file is then deleted after its use. However, some temporary files are sometimes left behind. This can happen when say the program crashes etc. These temporary files left behind accumulate over time and can take up a lot of disk space.

You can delete these accumulated left over temp files if its not related to an active Modeler session.
Alternatively, it maybe necessary to change the location to a folder with more space available (perhaps a separate file system from the Modeler Server installation). You can use the options.cfg file that can be found in the 
Modeler Server \config directory to specify an alternative location.

For Modeler client running in standalone:
These all write temporary files to the system temporary directory on your local pc by default. The processing will be performed on the local machine, so it is the options.cfg file that you will find in the 
Modeler client\config directory that you need to edit to specify an alternate location for the application's temporary files to be written. To do this follow these steps (you may need to get an administrator to do this):

1. Right click on the options.cfg file and uncheck the "read-only" checkbox.
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Specify the location that you want temporary files to be written to using the "temp_directory" parameter (the default value for this is an empty string).

Note: you must use forward slash directory delimiters in this path and you need to retain the double-quotes. Also the logged-in user must have RWX permissions to this new directory.

So for example, if you wanted to redirect the Modeler temporary files to E:\data\temp, you would have the following configured in the options.cfg file: temp_directory, "E:/data/temp"

4. Save the file and restart Modeler client.

=======================

For Modeler Server:

Modeler Server writes it's temporary files to the "tmp" subdirectory within its own installation directory by default. Sometimes it is necessary to change this to a location with more space available (perhaps a separate filesystem from the Modeler Server installation). You use the options.cfg file that you will find in the Modeler Server\config directory to specify an alternative location.

1. Right-click on the options.cfg file and uncheck the "read-only" checkbox (this step is applicable to a Windows platform only).
2. Open the options.cfg file in a text editor.
3. Specify the location that you want temporary files to be written to using the "temp_directory" parameter (the default value for this is an empty string).

Note: you must use forward slash directory delimiters in this path (even if you are using Modeler Server on a Windows platform) and you need to retain the double-quotes. Also the user(s) that are logging into Modeler server must have RWX permissions to this new directory.

So for example, if you wanted to redirect the Modeler Server on Windows temporary files to E:\data\temp, you would have the following configured in the options.cfg file: temp_directory, "E:/data/temp"

===============================
On Unix you may have something like this:
temp_directory, "/data/clem/temp"

4. Save the file and restart Clementine\Modeler Server

We do have an Enhancement Request submitted for a utility that would clean up the left over temp files.
