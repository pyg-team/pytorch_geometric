Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a vulnerability in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Version 6 and 7, that is used by IBM OS Images for Red Hat Linux Systems, IBM OS Images for AIX, and Windows. The issue was disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016 and this vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/UI:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 3.0.0.0 and earlier.
IBM OS Image for AIX Systems 2.1.1.0 and earlier.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Virtual machines deployed from IBM PureApplication Systems are affected. This includes RedHat Linux, AIX-based, and Windows-based deployments. The solution is to apply the following IBM PureApplication System fix to the deployed virtual machines.

Java Update for Windows

1. Import the fix into the Emergency Fix catalogue.
2. For deployed instances, apply this emergency fix on the VM. 
3. Restart the deployed instance after the fix is applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution.
