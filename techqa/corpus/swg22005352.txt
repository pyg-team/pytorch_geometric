Title: IBM Upgrade Rational Application Developer 9.6 to use Websphere Application Server ILAN - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customers see different content in the Rational Application Developer (RAD) Websphere Application Server (WAS) download compared to prior RAD releases.

During install of this new WAS ILAN version, customers now see explicit wording saying this a no cost, non-supported and non-warranted version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. While this has always been the case for this developer version, refer to evaluation software page & FAQ below, seeing these words during install may be a new information for some users.


CAUSE
New WAS packaged in RAD: 

Rational Application Developer for WebSphere packages WebSphere Application Server for development and test purposes. WAS recently renamed WAS for Developers (WAS4D) to WAS ILAN (see here [https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/WAS_traditional_for_Developers]). In response to this change, RAD 9.6 now packages WAS ILAN available in the RAD_WS_9.6_WASTE_9.0.zip file. It has the same capabilities and updates that RAD users expect. 

Support for this new WAS packaged in RAD:
New message during installation has worried users, however, users with an active support contract for their production WebSphere Application Server are entitled for support on the developer machine as long as an active support contract is in place for the production server.
