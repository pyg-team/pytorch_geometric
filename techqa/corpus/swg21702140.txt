Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
CVE-2015-2808; RC4; FREAK SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control version 8.2.1.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
To specifically resolve this issue, upgrade your server, broker and controller components. The fix pack can be downloaded from Fix Central. 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control 8.2.1 IV73326 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV73326] Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Interim Fix pack 8.2.1-TIV-TEMRC821-IF0012. 
For more information about 8.2.1-TIV-TEMRC821-IF0012, see http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040017 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040017]

Fix pack 8.2.1-TIV-TEMRC821-IF0012 will be released 4th June 2015. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Alternatively you can apply the following workaround on fix packs prior to IF0012. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. 

To check if RC4 is enabled in your server configuration, follow these steps:

1. If Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control is configured for compliance with FIPS 140-2, then RC4 can not be re-enabled.

2. If there are Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control brokers in the environment, open the broker configuration file, trc_broker.properties, and check DefaultTLSCipherList, as well as any TLSCipherList properties defined as part of a connection. The cipher list should always have !RC4 which disables all cipher suites that use RC4.

For example,
DefaultTLSCipherList = TLSv1+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

Inbound.1.TLSCipherList = TLSv1+HIGH\:\!SSLv2\:\!aNULL\:\!eNULL\:\!3DES\:\!DES\:\!RC4\:@STRENGTH

It is also recommended to disable RC4 in the Java Run-time Environment used with the Tivoli Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Controller. This can be done by adding RC4 to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property in the java.security file on the controller system.
