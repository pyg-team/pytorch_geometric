QUESTION
 I am using Daeja ViewONE and want to print an image with Header and footer in IBM Content Navigator. The Header and footer should not be displayed on view. How can I achieve this? 

ANSWER
The Daeja ViewONE contains a helpful but overlooked feature that allows you to add a header and a footer to documents rendered by it. More info please refer for link. http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248055.pdf [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248055.pdf]
Notes: The annotations file you supplied specifies that the footer should be 10.5 inches from the top of the page and 0 inches from the left of the page. 

To add header and footer, complete the following steps:
1. Under the root folder of the WAR file,for example C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\installedApps\P8520Cell01\navigator.ear\navigator.war\, 
create a new file to contain your header and footer content as below, name it headerfooter.jsp file.
[TEXT]
FONTTYPE = arial
FONTHEIGHT = 20
SEMITRANSPARENT = 0
BORDER = 0
TEXT = NOT AN OFFICIAL COPY
X = 0
Y = 0
PAGE = -1
TRANSPARENT = 1
LABEL = Text1
EDIT = 0
[TEXT]
FONTTYPE = arial
FONTHEIGHT = 20
SEMITRANSPARENT = 0
BORDER = 0
TEXT = This is copyrighted material owned by Company X. Please do not distribute.
X = 0
Y = 10.5
PAGE = -1
TRANSPARENT = 1
LABEL = Text1
EDIT = 0

2. Back up the filenetViewer_properties.jsp file and edit it. which is located in the applets sub-folder directly under the root of the deployed WAR file.
for example:C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01\installedApps\P8520Cell01\navigator.ear\navigator.war\applets\
Line 10, add the line as below:
annotationTemplate: "/navigator/headerfooter.jsp?noCache=" + Math.random(),
annotationSubstitution1: "1: <DOCNAME>=" + new Date(),
annotationSubstitution2: "-1: <DOCNAME>=<EMPTY>",
customAnnotationToolTip: "Created On: <createdate>",
alwaysShowCustomAnnotationTooltip: "true",
filenet: "false",

3. Re-open the Viewer, open a file in the Viewer, the header and footer appeared.
