Title: IBM Difficulties when enabling or disabling incremental updates for DB2 subsystems - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Enabling or disabling incremental updates for a DB2 subsystem fails. Message: "User ID and password combination is not valid." 

SYMPTOM
Enabling or disabling incremental updates for a DB2 subsystem fails with message "CHC0025 W. The User ID and password combination is not valid", even though user ID and password are correct.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If user ID and password are indeed correct, the message might refer to another DB2 subsystem that has already been enabled for use with the same accelerator. 

Resolution: Ensure that the credentials for all enabled DB2 subsystems are correct. If not, update these from the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator Console. To do so, proceed as follows:

1. Ask the network administrator or the person who did the TCP/IP setup for the IP address (virtual IP or wall IP address) of the accelerator. Make a note of this information. You need to enter it as you complete the steps that follow.

2. Start a client or emulator session (using, for example, IBM Personal Communications) to communicate with the z/OS® system on which your DB2® subsystem is located.

3. Log on to TSO/ISPF.

4. Enter the following command: 

tso telnet <hostname> 1600

where

<hostname>
is the IP address of the accelerator that is connected to the DB2 for z/OS data server.

1600
Is the number of the port configured for accessing the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator Console using a telnet connection between the DB2 for z/OS data server and the accelerator.

For example:
tso telnet 10.101.8.8 1600

5. When prompted, enter the console password. The initial password is dwa-1234. You must change this password at the first logon.

6. Press the Pause key, then Enter to display the following screen:
*****************************************************************************
* Welcome to the IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator Console
*****************************************************************************

You have the following options:

(1) - Change the Configuration Console Password
(2) - (Menu) Run Netezza Commands
(3) - (Menu) Run Accelerator Functions
(4) - (Menu) Manage Hardware 
(5) - (Menu) Manage Incremental Updates

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(x) - Exit the Configuration Console


7. Type 5 and press Enter to display the submenu:
main -> 5 
--------------------------------------------------------
You have the following options: 

(0) - Go back one level
(1) - Enable incremental updates 
(2) - Disable incremental updates
(3) - Update DB2 subsystem credentials 
(4) - Restart replication processes

(Default 0) >

8. Type 3 and press Enter.

9. Follow the instructions to change the password. Eventually, you return to this menu.

10. If necessary, repeat this step for other DB2 subsystems that use the same accelerator.
