ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: PRODSTRU : IN VPM CATPRODUCT,
   APPLYING CUT COMMAND ON CATPARTS LEADS
   TO RAPID
   
   INCREASE IN COMMIT CHARGE.
   
   Description:
   OPTION SETTINGS:
   
   
   Scenario:
   
   1. Launch 3dcom and define working Environment.
   2. Query for Full Vehicle and create a short-Cut in
   PSN TREE.
   3. Expand the PSN TREE to all levels.
   4. Launch Catia and connect to database.
   5. In 3dcom, select CATParts (documents) and
   using RMB select CATIA V5/Load.
   Note that all the selected CATParts data is loaded
   in DMU.
   7. Open Task Manager and note the initial Commit
   Charge. (In my case 375672 KB)
   6. Now select 10 to 15 CATParts using Shift or
   Control key for multiselection and using RMB
   apply Cut command.
   Note that DMU takes long time and Commit Charge
   keeps increasing fast.
   7. After waiting for 5 minutes Cut command is
   completed but Commit Charge is very High (In my
   case it is 1313052 KB i.e. 1.25 GB)
   
   Result: DMU takes long time and Commit Charge
   keeps increasing fast.
   
   Expected Result : Cut command should be applied
   in fraction of seconds.
