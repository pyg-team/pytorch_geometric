 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A seuence of actions is possible in Maintain > User > Personal Defaults that corrupts a table. Once this happens, all Java based functions fail and also lock up the Controller UI. 

SYMPTOM
1. With any Consolidation with AFC:


Error in AFC: Unknown LCID: 0!
or
Unexpected error. Something unexpected happened. You may have to
restart the application to continue.
Reason:
[SWTException] Failed to execure runnable
(org.eclipse.swt.SQTException: Widget is disposed) 


2. In Maintain > Jobs > Define
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
......
Caused by: com.ibm.cognos.ccr.common.ResponseException: !FAIL:!Unknown LCID: 0!! 


3. In Maintain > System Audit Log - hangs with 'Loading' on the screen,


CAUSE
An invalid value in the database for locale language for the user.

For example with user XYZ the xkonfig table will have a record like this:

Typ2 anvid konftxt
LLOCALE XYZ 0 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This can be fixed from the Controller UI by logging is as User XYZ. Go to ‘Maintain > User > Personal Defaults’. On the tab ‘Layout (2)’ under ‘Selection Language Codes’ tick the 'Local' box to activate the language selection and change to a different language. Then save and exit. After saving you can set the selection back to the settings you want.
