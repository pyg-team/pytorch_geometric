QUESTION
 How can I configure the searchForOne operation of the Content Foundation Content Platform Engine CE_Operations component with a search template that has an is like condition on a sting property? 

CAUSE
The wildcard character % has to be used before and after the search value input parameter. Otherwise, the search template will not find the expected Content Engine documents.

ANSWER
Use the % wildcard character before and after the search value input parameter. 

For example, in the following search template, we search on the Document Title property with an is like condition (click on the image to enlarge it): 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=1] 

The xml contents of the search template contains the following (click on the image to enlarge it): 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=2] 

The searchForOne operation can be configured similar to the following to find the expected documents (click on the image to enlarge it):
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21686400&aid=3]
Note: In the example above, ProcessType is a string type workflow data field, which has the string value you want to search on. Refer to the link below if you need help in determining search template item IDs
