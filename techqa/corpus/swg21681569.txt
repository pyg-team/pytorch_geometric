QUESTION
 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using RQM live reporting model over data warehouse model in IBM Rational Reporting for Development Inteligence (RRDI)? 

CAUSE
You want to decide between using RQM live reporting and data warehouse reporting models.

ANSWER
Advantages: 

 *  The data you see in the RQM live reporting is up to date with what you have in the tool.


Disadvantages:  * Because the data is generated in real time from the RQM REST API without using a database, you can encounter severe performance problems when the data volume increases
   
   
 * RQM live data model is more restricted than the data warehouse data model and offers limited possibilities for cross reporting with the other CLM applications. 
   
   
 * List of projects and the user credentials are hard coded in the xdc file, so every time you have a new project in IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) or the data collector user password is changed, you will need to generate a new xdc file.
