Title: IBM "output string" in ruleset execution result and how is it populated - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In ruleset execution traces, what does "output string" represent and how is it populated? Why it is empty in my result? 

ANSWER
As one of the execution results, OutputString represents messages that are issued during ruleset execution.
With rule engine API (IlrContext), the Context.out stream is automatically attached to System.out in a J2SE application, so the information is directly printed out. 

However with Rule Execution Server rule session APIs, output stream is considered as part of rule session execution result and captured by the session. It is stored in the outputString parameter, and you can retrieve it using: 

 * With JRules 6.x : ilog.rules.bres.session.IlrSessionExecutionResult.getOutputString(). 
 * With JRules 7.x : ilog.rules.res.session.IlrSessionResponse.getRulesetExecutionOutput()


For example, if you have a debug message to print in initial action of a rule task in your rulesets: out.println("****test****"); 

With rule sessions, this message will not be directly printed and it can be obtained with the outputString parameter. 

If Context.out is not used in your rulesets, you will not be able to see values for outputString in the result.
