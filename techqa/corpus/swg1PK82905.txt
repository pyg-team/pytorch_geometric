APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On all CQ clients, the time is not editing properly on existing
   date/time fields.
   
   For example, if I have a date/time field of March 19, 2009 1:00:
   00 PM and I try to change it to 12:00:00 PM, I cannot add the 2.
    It seems like it ran out of character limit.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Restore SQL Server 2000 databases from escalation #  RATLC012
   39294.
   The file is called ReproductionDatabase.zip
   
   Schema repository ? masterNan.bak
   User database ? userNan.bak
   Customer?s schema name: CQ_SCHEMA at version 166.
   
   NOTE: CQ superuser/password is cqadmin/rt!cqadm1n
   You HAVE to login to CQ using this user id.
   
   2. Run All Change Requests query.
   
   3. On any Change Request record, go to Development Phase, perfor
   m Admin-Modify action, add any date/time field and put 1 PM and
   save. Then, perform Admin-Modify action again, and try to edit t
   he date/time field (the one you just edited) by adding a 2 to ma
   ke it 12 PM. You will not be able to edit it.
   
   Workarounds:
   1. Increase the size of the field so that it can handle MM/DD/YY
   YY HH:MM:SS
   
   2. Enter the date as MM/DD/YY and then the full time - I tested
   this and after you hit submit, it will give the full date and ti
   me.
   
   3. Enter the time in miliary time. 23:11:12 will show up as 11:1
   1:12 PM after you hit submit.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The time is not directly editable on date/time fields on all
   CQ client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Eclipse client, the pre-7.1 Web client, and the 7.1 Web
   client all require use of the calendar control to modify
   date/time values.  This is the intended design and we do not
   plan to change that.   Because the Native Client for Windows
   will be discontinued in a future major release, we are not
   making further investments in this client.  The Eclipse and
   Web clients are our strategic clients going forward, so use
   them.
