Shared work items TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 By default, the shared work items function is enabled. Can you return to the "classic" work items mode? What is the impact of the change back to the classic work item mode (WS_MIGRATION_MODE) and how long does it take? 

ANSWER
If you encounter restrictions with the shared work items function and need to return to the classic work items mode, complete the following steps: 

 1. Stop the server or cluster.
    
    
 2. Open a command prompt and change to the admin directory using the following command: 
    cd $WAS_HOME/ProcessChoreographer/admin
    
    
 3. Use the following command to change to the classic work item mode (WS_MIGRATION_MODE):
    $WAS_HOME/bin/wsadmin.sh -conntype NONE -f migrateWI.py -tracefile /tmp/wsadmin.out -profileName profile_name-cluster cluster_name-dbUser
    database_user_ID-dbPassword database_password-setMode WS_MIGRATION_MODE
    
    
    The values for the profile_name, cluster_name, database_user_ID, and database_password variables are specific to your environment.
    
    
 4. Start the server or cluster.
    
    
 5. Open the /logs directory to confirm the change. For example, you might find your logs directory under the following path: profile_root/profile_name/logs/server_name
    
    
 6. Use the following command to locate the CWWBB0682I message in the log file: 
    fgrep CWWBB0682I SystemOut.log
    
    
    Within this log file, the last occurrence should contain a string that says 'WS_MIGRATION_MODE'.



For more information on the migrateWI.py script, see the Business Process Choreographer data migration script for shared work items [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.bpc.doc/doc/bpc/r0_migratedb_shared_wi.html] topic in the WebSphere Process Server product documentation. 


Note: If you are using an Oracle databases, the following interim fixes might be needed:  * IZ86250 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ86250] 
 * IZ86249 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ86249]



There might be a query performance impact when there are large number of work items 


Impact and time for the change 
Returning to the classic mode should not take long as the "classic" work items exist in the database. However, the duration of time for the change depends on the size of the database. RELATED INFORMATION
