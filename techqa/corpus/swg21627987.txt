QUESTION
 Can the login URL in TIP be customized or changed ? 

CAUSE
Customer would like to rebrand ( change "ibm" to "company name" ) 
" https://<IP address>:<port number>/ibm/console/logon.jsp

ANSWER
For TIP 1.x and 2.1: 

The URL cannot be customized, as the term ibm is currently hard coded within the compiled code. 


For TIP 2.2: 
"The following procedure can be used to change the context root value to a preferred value (like your company name). However, not all IBM products deployed in TIP support a non-default context root value. Open a support request for each product you have deployed in TIP to verify changing the context root for that product is supported, or thoroughly test the change in a lab environment before making the change in a production environment."

Edit the IAGLOBAL_CONSOLE_CONTEXT_ROOT variable in the sample_response.txt file:

#---- TIP console context root. 
#---- If no value is set for the property, the default context root /ibm/console will be used.
#---- Valid inputs:
#---- Should not include special characters, such as % & ^ ` * ( ) - + = @ ! ~ #
#---- Should not have double slashes such as //ibm/console
#---- Should not have space such as / ibm/console
IAGLOBAL_CONSOLE_CONTEXT_ROOT=/ibm/console

Please Note: 
The above procedure is only valid during the initial installation. To change the context root after the installation , during runtime, there are many files that would need to be manually updated.
