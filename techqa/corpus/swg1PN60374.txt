APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OPC/ESA suffered poor performance and eventually stopped
   submitting jobs.
   An operation had been submitted, transmitted to a test system
   and then the occurrance was manually completed.  The CP was
   extended and the application was added again for the next day.
   
   When the operation was sent to the test system an A1 was in the
   tracklog on that system.  This tracker was stopped and then
   another test tracker was started.
   The initiators were started and the job ran (while this second
   tracker was active).  Once testing had completed, the second
   tracker was stoped and the production tracker started.  Events
   from the second tracker were then copied to an events dataset
   (they dont want to send test events back to the production
   system) so all A2 A3J and A3P's were cleared for the operation.
   This meant that all that was sent back to the production system
   was the A1.
   .
   So, when the occurance reached it's planned start time it was in
   the ready list for the workstation with a status of * and a
   jobnumber from the previous days job.
   .
   The system then went into a slowdown and eventually stopped
   submitting. The diagnosis manual indicates that if there is a
   missing submit event, OPC/ESA will try and submit the operation
   with the missing event first.
   .
   QUELEN was set at a high value (100) so nothing else was getting
   in.  Once the operation was manually EXed, all other work was
   able to be submitted.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to detect that a job with submit=yes
   -- but the actual job is submitted outside and remains in jes
   input queue or is purged from the system -- will not cause a
   loop.
