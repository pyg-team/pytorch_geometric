   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When clearing the DESCR or CUSTOM parameters of a channel    *
   * authentication (CHLAUTH) record by settin it to blanks, a    *
   * subsequent DISPLAY CHLAUTH of the record shows residual data *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * None                                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   A CHLAUTH record's DESCR or CUSTOM fields should be cleared by
   setting the DESCR or CUSTOM field to one or more blank space
   characters with the SET CHLAUTH command.
   
   If the DESCR or CUSTOM field already contains a value prior to
   clearing the field, then some residual data from the previous
   setting may remain.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Processing has been amended to ensure that the DESCR and CUSTOM
   fields are cleared when set to blank characters.
