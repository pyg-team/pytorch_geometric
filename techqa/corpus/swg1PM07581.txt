APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   ============
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 4)
   ITCAM for WAS TEMA 06.20.05.00
   ITCAM for WAS DC v6.1 FP05
   ITM 06.10.05.01
   
   Problem Description:
   ====================
   (1) Select an application from the Application Health
   (2) Select the blue link icon to the left of the application
   name and select 'Selected Application - Request Analysis'
   (3) We would expect to see the results in the Request Analysis
   workspace filtered to only show entries relevant to that
   application
   (4) If the same action is performed on a different application,
   the resulting Request Analysis workspace shows the same results
   .

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:

   * workspace of ITCAM for WebSphere/Web Resources 6.2, to drill

   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * From the Application Health workspace, if the user clicks on
   * the link icon of a specific application and selects
   * "Selected Application - Request Analysis" menu item, the
   * Request Analysis workspace that is displayed will show the
   * URLs from all the applications instead of just the selected
   * one.
