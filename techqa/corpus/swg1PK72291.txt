ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using Rational Application Developer 7.0.0.6
   
   Given an EAR project with already built WAR and JAR files placed
    in the EAR project main directory, during deployment to a BEA W
   ebLogic server, the exported EAR is stripped of WAR and JAR file
   s.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create new EAR project:
     Name: EAR
     Target Runtime: Generic BEA WebLogic Server 8.1
     Facets: EAR 1.3
   2. Import -? J2EE -? Utility JAR file
     EAR Project: EAR (created in step 1)
     Select an existing EJB.jar module
     Check 'Copy Utility JARs into an existing EAR from an external
    location
     Notice that EJB.jar was copied to EAR project
   3. Edit EAR/META-INF/application.xml to contain:
     ...
     ?module?
       ?ejb?EJB.jar?/ejb?
     ?/module?
     ...
   4. In servers view, add project to WebLogic 8.1 and Publish
   5. Observe C:\bea\weblogic81\samples\domains\workshop\applicatio
   ns
     Notice that EAR.jar contains only
     META-INF  META-INF\application.xml
     META-INF\MANIFEST.MF
   
   I'd expect that exported EAR contains also EJB.jar module but it
   's not.
   
   I have noticed that if step 3 is omitted, EJB.jar is added to EA
   R, but as it is not a Mudule in the application.xml the ear is n
   ot usable.
