   ct1.
   He submitted several records for both record types. He saw DD000
   00001 was for Defect
   and DD00000002 was for Defect1. Then he created a query: query1
   is to get all Defect records.
   In this case he got record DD00000001. Then he would like to cha
   nge the state of the record  from Submit to Duplicate. Once he s
   elects Duplicate, a small window pops up asking for Duplicate id
   . He input 2 which refers to DD00000002.  In Eclipse client he g
   ot error saying this number is not in the database.
   But in windows client, the program was able to find the id.
