APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem occurs when loading a WSDL to the appliance, for
   instance in a WS-Proxy configuration.
   The WSDL contains a <wsdl:types/> section with a schema
   <xs:import/> line, but the thing the <xs:import/> imports
   is actually the same WSDL definition.
   -
   Additional Symptoms: Appliance hangs, no response to CLI,
   continous restarts of applaince.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The current work around is to avoid importing any schema where
   the schema file imports itself.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The appliance may restart during compilation of
   an XML schema if an <xs:import/> or similar statement imports
   a WSDL file rather than another schema.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DataPower firmware releases 3.7.1.11,
   3.7.2.7, and 3.7.3.6 will be updated to resolve this issue.
