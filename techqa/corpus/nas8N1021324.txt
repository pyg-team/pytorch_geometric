Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Node.js is supported by IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2515 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2515]
DESCRIPTION: Node.JS hawk is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the regular expression implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an overly long header or URI to cause the application to hang.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110819 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110819] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2537 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2537]
DESCRIPTION: Node.js is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the regular expression implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a regular expression to block the event loop and cause the application to hang.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110870] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)




CVEID: CVE-2016-3956 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3956]
DESCRIPTION: npm could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the unintentional leakage of bearer tokens from the command-line interface. By setting up an HTTP server and collecting token information, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to impersonate the user and do anything the owner of the information could, including publishing new versions of packages.
CVSS Base Score: 9.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112153] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-8851 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8851]
DESCRIPTION: node.js node-uuid could provide weaker than expected, caused by the use of Math.random() instead of a more cryptographically sound source of entropy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112166 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112166] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
