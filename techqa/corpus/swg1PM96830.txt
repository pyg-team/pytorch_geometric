PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When using an SSLPEER channel attribute *
   *                      to restrict access to a channel,        *
   *                      distinguished name attributes           *
   *                      containing commas may prevent a channel *
   *                      from starting.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using an SSL enabled channel and setting the SSLPEER
   attribute value to match a certificate whose distinguished name
   contains a comma in one of its attributes, MQ incorrectly treats
   the comma as a delimiter between DN attributes rather than
   treating it as a literal character as intended. This results in
   the channel failing to start with error CSQX636E being logged.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Parsing of SSL distinguished name attributes now takes embedded
   commas into account and permits them to be matched by the
   SSLPEER channel attribute.
