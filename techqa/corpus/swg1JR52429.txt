APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a work basket that contains more tasks than can be
   processed during the transaction timeout time is updated to
   assign a new task role assigned to a user for the first time
   (such as when no user had this role before), you might see a
   transaction timeout exception.

   00000001 has timed out after 120 seconds.
   [8/22/12 9:38:52:148 EDT] 00000008 TimeoutManage I   WTRN0124I:
   When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction
   is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer :
   6,5,main].
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Raise the transaction lifetime timeout.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This exception occurs for work baskets that contain numerous
   tasks because a role must be created and assigned to the new
   user for the first time for all tasks contained in the work
   basket. If the time required for processing exceeds the
   transaction timeout settings, the task role update fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.2 that introduces
   multi-transaction work-basket updates to prevent timeouts from
   occurring.
