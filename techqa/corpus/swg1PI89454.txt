   ****************************************************************
   IIDR for VSAM is getting stuck on an update record a VSAM
   cluster. This cluster is identified as an extended addressing
   ESDS.  The problem is that
   1. on restart the bookmark caused the log reader to position
   on the update and that forces the log reader to scan backwards
   in the log to find the corresponding read-for-update and
   2. the changes are from an extended ESDS and
   3. the changes were written by CICS VR.
   With that combination of variables, the code was not correctly
   matching the XRBA value and thereby would not find the
   read-for-update.  The log reader cannot continue without both
   the update and its corresponding read-for-update because IIDR
   always replicates using the before image.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Classic has changed code to fix problems locating a before image
   for extended addressing ESDS because the XRBA is recorded like
   a user key rather than in the RBA field (which is a 32 bit
   field).  There was also a problem with the records sent for
   XESDS because the key was duplicated in the internal record
   format.
