QUESTION
 When trying to install 7.1.1-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE-Windows-RP001 on a Windows 2008 R2 64-bit, the installation returns the following error popup message:
The Agent Compatibility Package in version 06230400 is required but unavailable.
How can I solve this? 

CAUSE
The Agent Compatibility Package is not bundled with ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1.
The Agent Compatibility Package is not installed on the involved server, or it is of a version older than the one required.
ITM 6.2.3 FP4 is the minimum prerequisite ITM version supported with ITCAM for J2EE agent v7.1.1.

E.g. if you have ITM 6.2.3 FP1 components installed, you will have this component installed:

AC 32/64 Bit Agent Compatibility Package
WIX64 Version: 06.23.01.00 Build: 201202220943

besides other Windows 64-bit ITM components, and you will get this error message.


ANSWER
The AC component can be found on the Agents DVD. 


Complete the following steps on the 64-bit Windows system where a 64-bit agent is installed: 
1. Locate the installation media for IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 FP4 (or later). 

2. From the WINDOWS subdirectory of the Tivoli Monitoring installation media, run setup.exe. The installation wizard starts. 

3. On the Select Features page, leave all of the existing check boxes selected. The following two components are selected by default: 

 

 * 32/64 Bit Agent Compatibility Package (x86-64 only) 
 * Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework (x86-64 only)


IBM recommends you install the AC component at the same version as the Windows OS agent (component code NT). 

4. Follow the instructions on the Tivoli Monitoring installation wizard to complete the installation of the agent compatibility package. 

5. Run the ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1 installation wizard to complete the installation of ITCAM for J2EE. 

Important: You can install the agent compatibility package from any media where it is bundled, but the version that is installed must be equal to or greater than V6.2.3 Fix Pack 4.
