Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM License Metric Tool v9 and IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis v2.2 and v9 are vulnerable to Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption  (POODLE) attack on SSLv3 connections (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 protocol used to secure a number of connection paths in IBM License Metric Tool and IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis is vulnerable to POODLE attack. This attack enables a man-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt and intercept communications, including user-server and agent-server messages. You are not vulnerable, if your environment is already FIPS or SP800-131 compliant. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
IBM License Metric Tool and IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis use SSLv3 protocol to secure connections between user interfaces (WebUI, API) and server, and to secure connections to associated IBM Endpoint Manager server(s). By manipulating SSL handshake, an attacker placing himself between server and one of the given elements can cause the connection to use a cipher suite which is easily to break, and in the result decrypt communications into plain text.
For the attack to be performed, the attacker needs to be able to read network requests exchanged between environment components and send to them his own requests (man-in-the-middle). An exploit would impact the confidentiality of data.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]
DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
