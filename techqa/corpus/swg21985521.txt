Title: IBM Is it necessary to have Report Studio Capability to connect to CAFE? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The requirement is to have access to CAFE and Workspace Advanced but not Report Studio. Is this possible? 

SYMPTOM
when removing the report studio capability the following error is returned. "The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error. when trying to connect to a BI server"


ENVIRONMENT
CAFE 10.2.2 and 10.2
Cognos Business Intelligence Server 10.2.2

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Both CAFE 10.2 and 10.2.2 do require Report Studio Capability. This is achieved by
being a member of the Express Authors role. which gives access to CAFE and Workspace Advanced but not Report Studio

"For full access to IBM Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel, you should
be a member of the ExpressÂ® Authors or Report Administrators role in
IBM Cognos Business Intelligence. An administrator must configure these
privileges using IBM Cognos Administration"
