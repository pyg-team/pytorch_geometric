APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The current TDWC 8.6 installation documentation makes the
   following statement regarding the user for which TDWC is being
   installed:
   
   "The only reference to the user for which TDWC is installed is
   found here:  The Dynamic Workload Console -> Installing ->
   Using the installation Wizard -> 7.
   
   "...
   7. Specify the user name and password of the Tivoli Integrated
   Portal user that you want to use as the Dynamic Workload Console
   administrator.
   Note:
   The user name and password must be operating systems
   credentials. If the user name and password you specify do not
   exist, a new operating system user will be created
   
   The User Name must be unique, 3 to 60 characters in length, and
   contain only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), hyphen
   (-), underscore (_), and double-byte character set (DBCS)
   characters.
   
   The password must be 5 to 16 characters in length and contain
   only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), hyphen (-), and
   underscore (_).
   
   Confirm the password and click Next.
   ..."
   
   A scenario in which custom PAM modules are used to authenticate
   to an external LDAP server if a local id is added and the same
   username exists in the LDAP server accessible by PAM then there
   will be an authentication failure in WebSphere during the
   installation with a message like this:
   
   "com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.EntityNotFoundException:
   CWWIM4538E Multiple principals were found for the '<user>'
   principal name."
   
   This message is returned because the participants of the
   federated repository include twaPAM and twaPAM is configued to
   query both localOS and custom PAM.  Following the guidance in
   the note that states that the user name and password must be
   operating systems credentials causes a potential install
   failure in environments that have custom PAM enabled. In an
   environment that is configured to authenticate both locally and
   at LDAP through PAM either a local operating system user or a
   PAM user can serve as the user for which the instance is
   installed providing that the same user name does not exist both
   locally and within PAM's LDAP.
   
   The "Planning and Installation" guide should be updated to cover
   this scenario as the current guidance creates the multiple
   principals issue.
