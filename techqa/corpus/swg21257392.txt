PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
CMS is one of the types of KeyFile formats that we support. The others are JKS & PKCS12. 

When you create/open a keyfile in the GSKit iKeyMan utility, you must specify the type. KeyFiles are databases that store, among other things, your certificates. So when you import an SSL Certificate, you need to open the KeyFile. CMS is a type of KeyFile. The certificate themselves have their own types of format. 

 

Note: ClearQuest did not use iKeyMan in versions of ClearQuest prior to v7, and instead used OpenSSL, which is a free key management tool that comes with Apache. In ClearQuest v7, your OpenSSL certificates will need to be converted to a format, such as CMS, that is supported by iKeyMan, prior to it's use with ClearQuest 7.0.
