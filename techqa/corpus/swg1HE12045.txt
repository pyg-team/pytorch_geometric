APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Content Collector Web Application service does not start
   if it is running on a computer that is located in a different
   forest than the Microsoft Exchange servers. In that case, the
   following entry is written to the file
   afu_services_sysout_0.log:
   
      <timestamp> <num> <thread>   SEVERE   Failed to initialize
   mail-interface [com.ibm.afu.services.ContextBean$StartDelegate:
   run]
      com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.MailException:
   javax.naming.AuthenticationException: [LDAP: error code 49 -
   80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903A9, comment: AcceptSecurityContext
   error, data 52e, v1db1
         at
   com.ibm.afu.mailinterface.mapi.MapiDirectoryService.<init>
   
   The problem did not occur with IBM Content Collector V3.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Move the computer that runs the IBM Content Collector Web
   Application service to the forest that contains the Exchange
   servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM Content Collector Web Application service ignores
   user-defined settings on the Active Directory tab of the Email
   Connector configuration. Therefore, the Web Application service
   uses the domain of the computer that runs the Web Application
   service to automatically derive the domain controller to connect
    to. However, because the account that runs the IBM Content
   Collector Web Application service does not have access rights to
    the Active Directory of the Exchange forest, the Web
   Application cannot be started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0 Fix Pack 2, the IBM
   Content Collector Web Application service respects user-defined
   Active Directory settings.
