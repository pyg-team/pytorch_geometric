APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With continued application utilization, browser continues to
   accumulate memory according to the memory usage statistic in
   Windows Task Manager.
   
   When using the Client Side Aggregation (CSA) theme, each time a
   portlet is refreshed memory utilization increases. It is most
   pronounced with a specific JSF portlet. Closing all instances of
   the browser releases the memory to back to the OS. Without
   periodic browser cycles, the memory footprint of the browser
   eventually climbs to the level where client side performance is
   seriously impacted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Close browser periodically.
