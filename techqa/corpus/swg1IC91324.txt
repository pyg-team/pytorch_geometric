APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Certificate Monitor issues expiration warnings for internal
   Crypto Certificate objects that are neither user visible nor
   user modifiable.  This is problematic because the user has no
   way to correct these certificates.
   
   There are two specific internal Crypto Certificate objects that
   are likely to trigger this problem called 'system-cert' and
   'system-ssl-ca-cert' that are used by default in the SSL
   configuration of the WebGUI and the XML Management Interface.
   
   
   Warnings about those certificates look like this:
   
   01:02:03 cert-monitor warn 383 0x806000e1 cert-monitor
   (Certificate Monitor): Certificate 'system-cert' is about to
   expire
   01:02:03 cert-monitor warn 383 0x806000e1 cert-monitor
   (Certificate Monitor): Certificate 'system-ssl-ca-cert' is about
   to expire
   
   Note: As long as the Objects>Crypto Configuration>Crypto
   Certificate Monitor option for Disabled Expired Certificates is
   turned OFF, the default setting, the certificate will continue
   to be used.  If the "Disabled Expired Certificates" is turned
   ON, then this APAR is required.
