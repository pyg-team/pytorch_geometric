APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The aggregation is "overwriting" the parms on the interface
   lines because there is bounding that says only one line on the
   interface of "switchport trunk allowed vlan add".  If you do
   the config change directly on the device, you can type in this
   same line once for vlan add 108 and then again for vlan 109 and
   the device consolidates them onto a single line.
   
    switchport trunk allowed vlan add 108,109
   
   This might be a better way for the customer to put in this
   change - putting both vlans in the switchport on a single line
   rather sending in aggregated command sets.  It's sort of a
   funky command since what you put in doesn't show up in the
   config the way you enter it.  The device adds the vlans are
   added into the existing line(s) based on numeric order and if
   there are too many to fit on the first line, it pushes them out
   to a second line in the config using the "add" keyword.  The
   way the schema handles this on import or sync is by putting the
   vlans of all the lines into a single line (without the "add"
   keyword).
   
   I've come up with a schema structure that works for putting in
   multiple "add" lines in a single UOW. Since the structure has
   changed, they'll have to recreate their command set.  This
   structure will allow them to put in a single vlan per command
   or multiple vlans either comma separated or ranges using dashes.
