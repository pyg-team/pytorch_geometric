CAUSE
This issue occurs due to a memory leak in internet explorer. Charts in functional dashboard are created using third party library c3.js, Charts creation in code leads to memory leak. If you watch the task manager, the memory of the browser in RAM will slowly increases and then start jumping up in larger increments. This will continue until the browser stops responding.
