ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Learning Tutorial video does not run via IE 7 (but does via
   
   Notes embedded Browser)
   
   When a user clicks on Help > Internet Resources > Learning
   Resources >
   Internet Explorer is launched (see issue 3) > Whats new in IBM
   Lotus
   Notes 8 (video)
   
   A screen is displayed "The launch process is complete.  You may
   close
   this window"
   
   Closing the window finishes the process and no video is ran
   
   If this process if followed with Notes preference set to run
   Notes
   embedded Browser the video plays correctly without issue.
   
   I have tested the issue using my Notes Client 8.5 and have the
   same results.
   
   If followed with Notes preference set to run Notes
   embedded Browser the video plays correctly without issue.
   
   If set to run browser using OS fault I've got the message:
   
   "The launch process is complete.  You may close this windows"
   
   This happens to IE7 or Firefox 3.0.8
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use Notes embedded browser
