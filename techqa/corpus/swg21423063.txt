PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are upgrading to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1. You receive message DFHXS1205 with a userid containing unprintable characters when users attempt to come into CICS TS from CICS Transaction Gateway for Windows Server 2003 version 7.1.00. Your external security manager (ESM) is RACF. 

SYMPTOM
DFHXS1205 The userid (unprintable characters) supplied in a verification request is not defined in the ESM. This occurred in transaction CPMI at netname ????????


CAUSE
The userid is in ASCII format and has not been converted to EBCDIC. You are using the base level DFHCNV table for CICS TS V4.1.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
CICS auxiliary trace shows:

AP 00C3 CCNV PC REQ(0D04) 

FIELD-A(00000056 ....) FIELD-B(128C8018 ....)

This is a request to convert RTYPE=PC. The address in FIELD-B, 128C8018, contains ASCII data "54534F3131303520" which would convert to EBCDIC "TSO1105" userid.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Re-assemble your DFHCNV for CICS TS V4.1.
