APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) with a Microsoft
   SQL Server database, starting case instances might fail with
   lock request timeouts when you start the case instance from IBM
   Process Portal, by using an API, or by posting a document from a
   type that is defined as a starting document type of a case type.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you start a case instance, several operations must be
   performed in the IBM BPM content store. One of these operations
   is the creation of the parent folder for the case folder.
   Creating the parent folder occurs in a separate transaction
   because multiple users might start case instances in parallel,
   locking folders. On Microsoft SQL Server, this separate
   transaction causes lock request timeouts.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that reorders the operations that occur when
   a case instance is created to prevent the locking issue. When a
   document starts a case instance, starting the case is split into
   two transactions; creating the case folder occurs during the
   second transaction. In addition, a database index is included so
   that a call against the IBM BPM content store uses an index
   scan.
