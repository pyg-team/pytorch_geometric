Title: IBM DataType incorrect on Secondary - United States

Text:
netcool; impact; netcool/impact; nci; data; type; datatype; .type; replication; cluster; sync; error; 500; mark; invalid TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The DataType is not being correctly replicated across the ImpactServer Cluster 

SYMPTOM
The .type file of the Secondary ImpactServer configuration is truncated with the error message: 

 * 
 * 


CAUSE
APAR "IZ81446: IMPACT 511 CLUSTER UNABLE TO REPLICATE DATATYPES WITH USERPARMETERS VALUES IN EXCESS OF 16,000 CHARACTERS." [link below] 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Additional comments associated with APAR IZ81446 release notes: 


"a new property is added to increase the file size limit:



 * 


Add the property to $NCHOME/impact/etc/<SERVERNAME>_server.props file 
where size limit can be 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.. " 

The property would have to be added to all ImpactServers in the Cluster and would require a restart to enable - ensuring that the ImpactServer started as Primary had the correct, uncorrupted .type file to be replicated across the Cluster. Also ensure that there are no trailing white-space characters on the property as these invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact. 

The APAR is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7, but one would still have to include this property with an appropriate value to handle a large character length for the USERPARAMETERS parameter. 

The character length includes the whole USERPARAMETERS property name as well as the definition. 

For example one would add the property: 

 * 


to the files: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


where one wished to allow the replication of a DataType between two ImpactServers called NCI1 and NCI2 in a Cluster where the USERPARMETERS property line were 20,000 characters long.
