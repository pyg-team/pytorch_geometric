QUESTION
 What are the benefits of collecting log files and error messages prior to opening an IBM Problem Management Record (PMR) ? 

CAUSE
This technote describes the background information that IBM Software Support needs for analyzing IBM FileNet System Monitor (FSM) issues. Collecting this information (also known as MustGather data) before you call IBM Software Support helps in problem determination and can save time when resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

ANSWER
Collecting data early, even before opening a PMR, helps IBM Software Support quickly determine the cause of the problem. With this information, IBM Software Support can determine if: 

 * this is a known problem (rediscovery) 
 * a new problem has been discovered and a fix is required



Collecting General Information 

To help IBM Software Support find a solution, collect information about the problem and your system environment. 
 1. OS type and FSM version  1. For FSM 4.5x Zip up the following 
        <FSM install dir>\.prodinfo\FSM_SERVER.settings and
        <FSM install dir>\.prodinfo\standard.settings 
     2. For FSM 4.0.1, 
     3. Go to the web console, 
     4. Click system configuration 
     5. Then select details 
     6. Send screenshot.
    
    
 2. FSM relational database type and version.


Collecting Data for Client/Monitoring Issues  1. OS of client being monitored. 
 2. What products are on the client machines which are being monitored, if any (e.g. Image Services, Process Engine, Content Engine, Application Enging, etc and the specific version). 
 3. If the issue involves monitoring, then get the .plusdebug files from the machine being monitored.  1. UNIX - create /tmp/.plusdebug and wait for monitors to run so the .sh debug files are generated (or restart cala client to force all monitors to run). 
     2. Windows - create <FSM install>/cala/temp/.plusdebug and wait for monitors to run so the .sh debug files are generated (or restart cala client to force all monitors to run).
    
    
 4. On the FSM server, provide all files in the following directory. <FSM install>/repos/config/
