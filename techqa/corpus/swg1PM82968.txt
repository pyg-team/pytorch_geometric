APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the WCM Authoring UI, in some cases you may see a
   'com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment' is not serializable
   exception such as:
   
   [1/30/13 5:10:20:038 CET] 00000087 WASSession E
   SessionContextMBeanAdapter findAttCausingNotSerializableExceptio
   n Miscellaneous data: Attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B
   1020746_tm" is declared to be serializable but is found to
   generate exception "java.io.NotSerializableException" with
   message "com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment". Fix the
   application so that the attribute
   "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B1020746_tm" is correctly
   serializable at runtime
   
   This defect is to handle the making of the
   'com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment' serializable so
   these errors don't occur.
   Opened for release 7002

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the WCM Authoring UI, in some cases you may see a
   'com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment' is not
   serializable
   exception such as:
   
   [1/30/13 5:10:20:038 CET] 00000087 WASSession E
   SessionContextMBeanAdapter findAttCausingNotSerializableExceptio
   
   n Miscellaneous data: Attribute "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B
   
   1020746_tm" is declared to be serializable but is found to
   generate exception "java.io.NotSerializableException" with
   message "com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment". Fix the
   application so that the attribute
   "PC_Z5_CGAH47L00GLG70IAH1UJA728B1020746_tm" is correctly
   serializable at runtime

   'com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec.CmpntFragment' serializable so
   these errors don't occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis: The class is question is referenced from within some
   of the WCM Authoring UI Portlet Model classes which themselves
   are referenced by the WCM Authoring UI 'Application-Model' which
   is stored in the session for performance. Thus, the class in
   question should be made serializable.
   Solution: Top-level interface com.aptrix.pluto.cmpnt.codec
   .Fragment was made serializable
