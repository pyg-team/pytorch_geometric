QUESTION
 Describe how the Robotic Response Time "T6" agent integrates with Rational Performance Tester (RPT) in order to playback RPT scripts, and produce response time and availability data in TEP portal. 

CAUSE
n/a

ANSWER
RRT T6 agent launches RPT based script/test playback engine in a Java Virtual Machine JVM, and each unique RPT runtime version (associated to each script) will get a new JVM. 

When tests/scripts are scheduled for playback, the scripts/tests get loaded into the JVM and go through the traditional playback process that would occur when a script is executed in RPT Workbench.

When the scripts/tests are getting played back, they report response time and availability data through ARM (Application Response Measurement) API calls and this data gets collected and processed by the RRT T6 agent. 

The ARM calls for the scripts/tests are directly made by the RPT playback engine through various RPT plugins (core plugin as well as the individual script/test related plugins like Citrix, SAP, HTTP etc). 

Once these response time and availability values are sent over, those get processed and persisted into the ITM "ODI" tables and gets presented through the TEP workspaces.
