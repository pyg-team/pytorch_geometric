APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The HL7DFDLInput node unconditionally validates the input
   message, causing a performance problem with large messages.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add a Compute node after the HL7DFDLInput node.
   Copy the entire input tree to the output without changing it
   Set the 'Validation' property to 'None' to switch off
   validation downstream of the input node.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus Healthcare Pack who require
   high message throughput and/or low CPU usage.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The HL7DFDLInput node parses and validates the entire HL7
   message before propagating it. This causes high CPU usage and
   can lead to low message throughput.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

   tools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bb23814_.htm]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Validation and Parse Timing options have been exposed as
   properties on the HL7DFDLInput node. You can now set Validation
   to 'None' and Parse Timing to 'On demand' to minimize CPU usage.
