APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The docs need to be updated that only Oracle java is supported
   with SSL, and that SSL isn't supported on AIX at all
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  install Oracle Java 1.6 and use it instead
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the Probe for Alcatel-Lucent 5620 SAM JMS.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * In the probe documentation, the summary table lists Java 1.5 *
   * as a minimum requirement but for SSL communications Sun Java *
   * 1.6 is a minimum requirement. In addition to this, Sun Java  *
   * 1.6 is not supported on the AIX operating system, therefore  *
   * SSL communications are not supported when the probe is       *
   * running on AIX.                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The probe documentation will be updated. Publication of the  *
   * updated probe documentation is planned for Q2 2012.          *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The summary table will contain two new notes under the minimum
   requirements section.
   
   Note: Sun Java 1.6 is required if you are configuring SSL
   communications.
   Note: Sun Java 1.6 is not supported on AIX, therefore SSL
   communications are not supported when running the probe on the
   AIX operating system.
