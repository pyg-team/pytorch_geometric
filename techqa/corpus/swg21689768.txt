RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Error in the trace file shows that the user defined in Federated Repositories is unable to connect to LDAP, hence no one is able to 
authenticate with LDAP. 

Do the following to resolve this issue: 

Login to SSC and then in left hand side pane click on 
1. Security -> Global security 

2. In Right hand pane besides the "Available realm definitions" you will see "Configure" button 

3. In the table you will see the column titled "Repository Identifier". 

Click on the LDAP entry that you have.

4. On right hand side of screen you would see "Bind distinguished name" field. 

5. The user name and password that you have defined here should have access to the LDAP. There is some issue either with the user name or credentials that you have defined there that are causing the issue. 

Please use a third party software LDAP client to see if you can use the same user name and password credentials to access the LDAP. 
e.g if you have are using Domino LDAP and Domino Admin is your user name, you can try putting in cn=domino admin,o=yourorgname and it should fix the issue. 
Restart SSC and Meeting Server after making these changes if it doesn't work immediately.

If the issue still persit then enable the following tracing on dmgr for SSC:

*=info: com.ibm.sametime.*=all

Reproduce the issue and send in the dmgr and SSC App profile logs for attention of IBM Support for further analysis.
