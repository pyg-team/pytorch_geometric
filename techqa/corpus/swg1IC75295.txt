APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Monitoring and Reporting, the Availability workspace
   in TEP may show INACTIVE under Object Status column even when
   the agent is working properly.  This occurs because the most
   recent request for data from the agent returned no new data.
   Initial Impact:
   Low
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   All 6.x Tivoli Storage Manager for Monitoring and Reporting
   Additional Keywords:
   ZZ61RM ZZ62RM inactive availability workspace attribute group
   null TEP
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If data is being seen in the Workspace for those listed as
   INACTIVE, ignore the Availability workspace.  Clicking on a
   workspace will sometimes force a refresh of new data, which will
   change the INACTIVE to ACTIVE.
