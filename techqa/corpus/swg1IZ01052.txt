APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  JSC hangs with a blank screen intermittently when the "All
   Schedules Job" view is opened either for the current or an
   alternate plan.  The problem only occurs when the test fix for
   APAR iy95687 is applied and the JSC trace log
   (com.tivoli.logging=true) is enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable JSC trace log (com.tivoli.logging=false).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See apar description. This problem
   can randomly occurs when
   (com.tivoli.logging=true) is enabled.The apar named into
   apar description did not have any relationship with this
   apar.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This apar has been created to mitigate
   this behaviour. More accurate trace path has been
   set into JSC code to better traces some path and avoid
   tracing on other path that are not relevant for problem
   determination. In this way we implement some mitigation
   of this hang that can occurs when JSC traces are on and that
   can occurs due to multiple threads that on JSC will traces
   at same time on the same file.
   This apar will be fixed into 8.3.0-TIV-TWSJSC-FP0004.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Disable JSC trace.
