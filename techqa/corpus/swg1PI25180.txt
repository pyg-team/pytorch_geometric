APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An application issues an EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD command
   which causes DFHESN to call DFHUSAD for new function
   VERIFY_PASSWORD.  DFHUSAD invokes DFHXSPW for function
   INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA which invokes DFHXSSB to call the
   external security manager (ESM).  The ESM fails the request
   with return codes of:
   .
   SAF_RESPONSE(8) SAF_REASON(0)
   ESM_RESPONSE(30) ESM_REASON(0)
   .
   The return codes mean  'not authorized to the port of entry' .
   Although the return codes are valid, they are not expected by
   DFHXSSB so an exception is raised for UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE.
   .
   Trace shows:
   .
   XS FE04 XSSB  *EXC* FUNCTION(INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA)
   RESPONSE(EXCEPTION) REASON(UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE)
   SAF_RESPONSE(8) SAF_REASON(0)
   ESM_RESPONSE(30) ESM_REASON(0) FASTPATH_AUTH(NO)
   .
   DFHESN is eventually returned to for handling of the EXCEPTION
   response. However, DFHESN checks for XSPW_UNKNOWN_ESM_ERROR
   (as it did in earlier releases when DFHXSPW was used for the
   INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA function) and  should be checking for
   USAD_UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE.  Because DFHESN is unable to map
   XSPW_UNKNOWN_ESM_ERROR to proper EIBRESP and EIBRESP2
   values, he abends with AEXZ abend code.  DFHESN should return
   to the application,  EIBRESP=16 (INVREQ) and EIBRESP2=13
   (unknown return code from the ESM).

   ****************************************************************
   An EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD is issued which fails a RACROUTE
   VERIFYX call with an ESM response of X'30'. CICS has no specific
   error handling for this type of error so DFHUSAD returns an
   exception of USAD_UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE to DFHESN.
   DFHESN should fail the EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD command with an
   INVREQ with RESP2=13. However, DFHESN fails to handle the
   USAD_UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE correctly and issues abend AEXZ.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHESN has been changed to return INVREQ with RESP2=13 when an
   EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD call fails with a
   USAD_UNKNOWN_ESM_RESPONSE exception.
