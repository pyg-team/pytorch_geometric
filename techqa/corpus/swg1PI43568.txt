APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 concurrent user license.
   The Sentinel RMS License Manager version 8.5.0.0021 is installed
   on a Windows 2008 R2 server 64 bit, installed on default program
   path
   The Statistics 23 software is installed on Windows 7 64 bit
   Clients, network license
   On Client installation you entered the host name of the server
   where License Manager is installed so that you see the line
   below when you open spssprod.inf on the Clients.
   
   daemonhost=<host name of your License server>
   
   Installation went fine and all Clients can retrieve a network
   license. Also you configured your license server to use commuter
   licenses. Clients can check out commuter licenses without any
   problem too and Statistics 23 starts normally using the commuter
   license.
   However, if Clients checked out a commuter license and switch
   the network cable off they start Statistics 23 and encounter an
   error:
   
   Cannot find network license server: <host name of your License
   Server>
   
   Also only 3 menus are shown on Data Editor: File, View and
   Custom and on welcome dialog you only see Python as installed
   module although your network license include all or a lot of
   modules which was working before.
   This issue was reported to IBM SPSS development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.  As a workaround do the
   following:
   On the Client computer open spssprod.inf in a text editor and
   change the daemonhost line such that it use the IP address of
   your license server and no longer the host name:
   DaemonHost=ipaddress
   Save the file with the same name
   another workaround is to to change the HOSTS file on Windows to
   map IP address with host names.
   On the Client where the issue occur go to
   C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
   Remove the read only flag for this file and open it in a text
   editor
   After last row in the file just enter the host name and the IP
   address of your license server:
   host name  ipaddress
   Save the file with same name
   After that Clients can check out a commuter license and the
   program runs also with network cable unplugged.
