APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Attempts to install 64-bit packages silently will show an
   UnsatisfiedLinkError on the command line output.
   
   Problem:
   
   You install a 64-bit Rational package which may or may not use
   the new Borrowed License feature. The installation loads the
   windows shared library that implements the licensing feature,
   however there is no 64-bit version of the library available. The
   installation writes an error message to the command line but the
   installation continues successfully.
   
   Local fix:
   
   The error can be ignored unless you require the Borrowed
   Licensing feature on a 64-bit software package.
