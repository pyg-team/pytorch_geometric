 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance MQ Manager Object's connections are not closed as expected. This can happen when the mq-qm object uses the default value which is an empty string. 

CAUSE
DataPower MQ manager object's idle connection is not closed when using default cache timeout.

ANSWER
Change the cache timeout on the IBM WebSphere DataPower MQ manager (mq-qm) object. You can start using a value of 60 seconds as the suggestion. The best practice is to use a value which should be less than the KeepAlive Timeout of the MQ Queue Manager (qmgr).
