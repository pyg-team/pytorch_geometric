ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DOORS 8.3.04
   DOORS/Change 5.5-08
   Change 4.7 with DS 5.5 pactch 6 installed
   
   Performing certain steps in DOORS, will cause the 'Requirements
   Management Request' to be greyed out. I
   have been able to reproduce this on my test installation in
   support. Below are the steps to reproduce.
   
   Login to DOORS
   Open a module that is under Change control
   On the Select Default RCR dialog, select the 'Open for Unmanaged
   Changes'
   Click the 'Open for Unmanaged Changes' in the 'open module for
   unmanaged changes' dialog.
   The module will open in exclusive Edit Mode, right click the
   module and the Requirement Management Request' is greyed out (to
   be expected.)
   Close module and re-open module in read-only mode, by right
   clicking module and selecting Open ? Read-only
   Right click the module and the 'Requirements Management Request'
   is greyed out.
   
   The expected behavior is to have the 'Requirements Management
   Request' enabled.
