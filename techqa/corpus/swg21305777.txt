QUESTION
 The probe properties file or <probe binary> -dumpprops output has a BeatThreshold and BeatInterval property. What do these properties do? 

CAUSE
These properties are used when two probes are running with Peer To Peer failover.

ANSWER
The BeatThreshold property is used with Peer-To-Peer probe failover. The BeatThreshold is the number of consecutive peer-to-peer heartbeats that must be missed for the slave to takeover from the master probe. By default, the BeatThreshold is set to 1, so failover occurs when the first heartbeat is missed. This can be used in conjunction with the BeatInterval which is how often in seconds the heartbeat is sent from the master to the slave. 

There is a maximum delay of BeatInterval + BeatThreshold + 1 seconds of missed heartbeats before the slave instance forwards its alerts.
