DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To check the permission of the DocVersion table, do the following in ACCE (Admin Console for Content Platform Engine): 

 

 *  In ACCE, go to Object Stores. Select your object store. In the new tab opened for your object store, expandClassesand selectDocument. In the new tab opened for the Document class,go toPropertiestab. Scroll down and findTable Definition. Double-click on the property value, which should show "DocVersion". In the new tab opened for Docversion, select the property value "1) Access Permission" forPermissions. In the new tab opened for Access Permission, review the settings on this page and ensure the administrator specified for ICC initial configuration has sufficient permission. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When running ICC initial configuration, supply the credentials for a Content Engine Administrator who has sufficient permission to create database index for the DocVersion table.
