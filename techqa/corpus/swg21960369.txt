QUESTION
 HEMDA0261I:[NCWBringUpWorker]:Cannot set the maximum number of supportable connections for the <host>:<port> connection pool to n. This value is greater than the maximum permitted value of 1,000. What does this mean? 

ANSWER
Web GUI has a maximum possible connection pool of 1,000 connections per datasource. See ncwDataSourceDefinitions.xml. If the value of the Connections property for an object server is set to a value greater than this, Web GUI will complain with the message above in ncw.0.log. There are also likely to be associated disconnection messages and a user may well see a DATASOURCE_ERROR in the GUI. 

An associated message is: 
DataSource query failed.com.micromuse.ncw.datasource.NCWDataSourceException: DataSource <name> unavailable.

The solution is to reduce the number of Connections in the ObjectServer to 1,000 or less and restart the object server.
