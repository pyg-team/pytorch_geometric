ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Defect was approved by escalation # RATLC01235188.
   
   This is a defect for CQ Designer.
   
   CQ 7.0.1.2 Designer does not set the web dependent field propert
   y if same fields on different tabs of the form are added.
   
   For example, let's say I have Severity and Priority fields in Ma
   in tab of my Base/Submit Defect form where Severity has a web de
   pendent property set to Priority. Then, I decide to add the same
    fields in another tab, Customer tab and forget to set the web d
   ependent on Serverity. In CQ Web, when I edit Defect record, the
    web dependent won't work right in the Customer tab (the Priorit
   y field would not populate).
   
   The workaround is to check for any duplicate fields on each tab
   and set the web dependency properly. Warren and I find this as a
    defect because you shouldn't have to set the web dependent fiel
   d property more than once and/or the web dependent field that yo
   u did set should work in CQ Web.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1.) Login to CQ Web using the attached MS_ACCESS sampl database.
   2.) Go to the customer tab and select a value from the severity
   drop down and notice that the priority list doesn't change as it
    should.
   3.) Login to CQ designer and on the main tab bring up the proper
   ties of the 'severity' field and add the 'priority' field to the
    web dependent field list.
   4.) Login to CQWeb and go to the customer tab and select a sever
   ity and notice that the priority drop down now displays the corr
   ect values in it's list.

COMMENTS
 *  This words as designed.  It is the responsibility of the
   administrator to set up forms and other schema elements
   consistently to do what the administrator wants.  If the
   administrator sets up two inconsistent specifications, as
   happened in this case, the Designer should not speculate on
   which one is right.
