APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   ---------
   FTP Adapter 7.5.0.5 import is handling operations towards a FTP
   server.
   
   OBSERVATION:
   ------------
   For certain outbound operations (like CREATE) the Adapter
   appears to hang.
   In case that it is attached to a transaction the according
   timeout can contain the following stack trace:
   
   TimeoutManage I   WTRN0124I:
    When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction
    is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[Default :
    4,5,main]. The stack trace of this thread when the timeout
    occurred was:
    java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)

     pache.java:2134)
    com.ibm.j2ca.ftp.FTPClientApache.doesFileExists(FTPClientApache
     .java:971)
   
   DETAILS / CAUSE:
   ----------------
   The issue happens if the Adapter does send a NLST FTP command
   for existence check of a file, and the file does not exist
   (which is expected for CREATE operation).
   
   If now the FTP server does answer with
    # 450 <file name> No such file or directory
   the Adapter remains in a loop until the timeout happens.
   
   If the FTP server does answer with
    # 550 <file name> The system cannot find the file specified.
   everything runs fine
