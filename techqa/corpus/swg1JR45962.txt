APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Process Portal, a user session may be terminated
   unexpectedly, that
   is not the result of an inactivity timeout or an LTPA token
   timeout.
   When this occurs, a basic authentication prompt dialog will
   appear; once
   user name and password are supplied by the user, a new session
   is
   started and any work that was in progress (for example,
   completing
   fields in the pages of a coach) is lost.

   BPM includes the Set-Cookie directive for the isBidi cookie on
   all responses from the Teamworks web application.  The
   repetitive directive appears to cause issues on the client
   browser resulting in multiple copies of the cookie being sent
   on subsequent requests and the loss of other cookie
   information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to only include the Set-Cookie directive for the
   isBidi cookie if it has not been previously set, or if the
   value of the cookie needs to be changed.
