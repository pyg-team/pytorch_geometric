Title: IBM Big-Endian to Little-Endian integer conversion - United States

MQIINFO big little endian conversion CodedCharSetId encoding TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to know how you can convert integers in a Big-endian input message to Little-endian in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If an application sending a message to an input queue has set the 'Encoding' field in the MQ message descriptor (MQMD) then conversion from Big-Endian to Little-Endian should be automatic. However, if the application does not do this and cannot easily be changed then the following steps should convert a Big-Endian input message to Little-Endian. 

For this example we assume the application is running on a UNIX platform (RS/6000, Sun) and is sending a message to a Message Broker input queue on Windows. 

 1. In the Toolkit, on the MQInput node properties dialogue there is an 'Advanced' tab. On this tab check the 'Convert' box and fill in values for 'Convert Encoding' and 'Convert Coded Character Set ID' (273 and 437 respectively for most UNIX). 
 2. Put the flow through a Compute node and in it set the MQMD Encoding field to the value appropriate for Windows.


Examples: 

 SET OutputRoot.MQMD.Encoding = 546; 

 SET OutputRoot.MQMD.CodedCharSetId = 437; 

 

Now you should be able to input a Big-endian integer, X'00000005', into a flow on Windows and it should be handled correctly.
