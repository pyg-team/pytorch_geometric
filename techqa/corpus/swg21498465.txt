Title: IBM Export to XLS merges cells in IBM InfoSphere Metadata Workbench - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Not able to export results of a Business Term query into MS Excel ( XLS) without merging cells, therefore, the columns cannot be sorted in Excel. 

CAUSE
This is current behavior and there are no plans to change it.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can, however, export results from the Metadata Workbench to CSV Format. The resulting file does not merge data, rather all data is written per row. Then, the CSV File may be imported into Excel. The CSV File should not be opened (File > Open, or double-click) directly into Excel due to formatting issues within Excel. 

In Excel:


 1. Open a new worksheet 
 2. Select the Data > Import External Data > Import menu item. 
 3. Browse and selected the exported CSV file. 
 4. The Text Import Wizard displays.
