APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliances
   
   Firmware version: 3.7.3.2
   
   Problem:
   When importing configuration backup from a remote location, the
   import of the first domain will fail intermittently.
   This problem is caused by an invalid DNS lookup result being
   cached and used during the retries.
   
   Error found in the logs:
   [network][error] dns(Service) Unable to initiate DNS request
   [-9] for remote.ibm.com
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround: Try restarting the failed domain(s) after network
   connectivity has been established
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Timing issues between loading the configuration for a remote
   domain and network access to the remote domain configuration can
   cause the loading of the remote domain to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Domains that failed to load will be reloaded after the network
   becomes available.
