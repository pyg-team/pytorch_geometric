PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The
   following Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the
   September 2012 update to the Information Centers. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 8.5 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: PM72402
   Problem:  In topic, Creating a fine-grained administrative
   authorization group using the administrative console, Step 6,
   associates a group to the new user role, and indicates that
   you should select the option EVERYONE if you want to select
   special subjects. However the option EVERYONE is not supported
   in Version 8.0 of WebSphere Application Server.
   
   Resolution:  References to the EVERYONE option will be removed
   from Step 6 of the topic, Creating a fine-grained
   administrative authorization group using the administrative
   console.
   
   This update also applies to the Versions 8.0 information
   center.
   ------------
   ID: 739255
   Problem: There is missing and erroneous help information for
   proxy settings in the WebSphere Application Server information
   center for the administrative console page located by
   navigating as follows:
   Servers > Server Types > Proxy Servers > server_name > HTTP
   Proxy Server Settings > Proxy settings
   
   Resolution: Topic, Proxy server settings, is updated to
   include the sections Static file serving and Workload
   Management. Also, terminology inconsistencies have been
   corrected.
   
   This update also applies to the Version 7.0, and 8.0
   information centers.
   -------------
   ID: 741497
   Problem: If, when attempting to use the Installation Manager
   to install ifixes on WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5,
   you select the "update All" option, you will get the
   following error:
   
   "No Updates or fixes were found for the packages that are
   installed in the selected locations"
   
   This error occurs even though the fix is included in the
   list of repositories that the Installation Manager reports to
   be searching.  The information center does not adequately
   explain this condition.
   
   Resolution: The topics:
   
   - Installing fix packs on the Web Server Plug-ins using the
   GUI
   - Installing fix packs on the WebSphere Customization
   Toolbox using the GUI
   - Installing fix packs on the DMZ Secure Proxy Server using
   the GUI
   - Installing fix packs on distributed operating systems
   using the GUI
   - Installing fix packs on IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology
   Edition Version 7.0 using the GUI
   - Installing fix packs for the Web 2.0 and Mobile Toolkit
   on distributed operating systems using the GUI
   
   will be updated to include the following TIP for the task
   step that selects the package  group to update:
   
   Tip: If you select Update all, Installation Manager will
   search all of the added and predefined repositories for
   recommended updates to all of the package groups that it has
   installed. Use this feature only if you have full control over
   which fixes are contained in the targeted repositories. If you
   create and point to a set of custom repositories that include
   only the specific recommended fixes that you want to install,
   you should be able to use this feature confidently. If you
   enable searching service repositories or install fixes
   directly from other live web-based repositories, then you
   might not want to select this option so that you can select
   only the fixes that you want to install for each offering on
   subsequent panels.
   ------------------
   ID: 741518
   
   Problem: Topic, Web server configuration, describes the Service
   name property for the Windows operating systems. The propety
   description is inaccurate.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Web server configuration is updated to
   include the following description of the Service name property:
   
   Specifies the Microsoft Windows operating system name for the
   web server service. The name is the "Display name" of the
   service and you can find it by opening the General properties
   tab of the web server service
   
   This update also applies to the Version 7.0, and 8.0
   Information Centers.
