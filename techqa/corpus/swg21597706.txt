 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you click Manage Services > Select a Service, and then search for a service, the Services table returns a list of services. If the hyperlinked name of a service in the table is very long, the rightmost characters in the name might overrun the right column boundary in the table. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is a browser limitation in which a long service name will fail to wrap within the column boundary.
