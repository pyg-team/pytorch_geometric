The links in this page go directly to the supported operating systems supported by each IBM Forms Server component. All software prerequisites, system requirements, and optional supported software are specified in these links. IBM has provided customers with a Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool where you can view detailed software and hardware system requirements. The SPCR tool also includes detailed system requirements for all 8.0 fix pack releases.

Engineering notes for IBM Forms Server 8.0, 8.0.0.1 and 8.0.0.2: 

 *  IBM Forms Sever can run as a 32-bit or 64-bit application. The following system configurations are supported:  * 32-bit version of Webform Server running on other 32-bit systems
    * 32-bit version of Webform Server running on other 64-bit systems
    * 64-bit version of Webform Server running on other 64-bit systems
   
   
 * The browser plug-in components of BM Forms Server - Webform Server run as 32-bit applications and will not work with a 64-bit browser.
 * Some features may not be available and performance degradation may occur when IBM Forms Server- Webform Server is deployed with Windows XP. This deployment configuration is recommended for non-production systems only.
 * IBM Forms Server - Webform Server can run with IBM Cloudscape but this configuration is recommended for non-production systems only.
 * To support PKI signatures and Authenticated Clickwrap signatures one of the following engines to be installed with the Webform Server component of IBM Forms Server. NSS signature libraries can be downloaded from the Mozilla web site or use the version included with Firefox/Mozilla. Refer to IBM Forms Server documentation to obtain instructions on how to use Java signatures on i5/OS.  *  CryptoAPI or NSS on Windows systems 
    *  NSS on Solaris, Linux or AIX systems
    *  Java cryptographic engine on i5/OS systems
   
   
 * Forms written in XFDL version 6.0 to 8.0 are supported. XForms and globalization features are supported in XFDL 7.x and 8.0 versions. 
 * Form View Portlet is an IBM Forms Server component that runs in supported versions of WebSphere Portal. Form View Portlet is a JSR 286 web component packaged as a WAR file. It is capable of rendering IBM Forms written in XFDL version 6.0 to 8.0 and Turbo 3.5.1 forms.
 *  Installed with IBM Forms Server - Forms Services Platform component is a set of private libraries. Included as part of the Forms Services Platform installation is Equinox 3.2.1 implementation of the OSGi R4 core framework specification.
 * The IBM Server products contained within IBM Forms Server Unlimited Viewer Edition 8.0 run on the same operating and software systems.
 *  IBM Forms Server - API can be used for application development in the following environments:  *  Windows C application development environment, such as IBM Visual Age C++ or Microsoft Visual C++. 
    *  Windows COM compliant development environment, such as Microsoft Visual Basic.
    * In a UNIX environment any development environment that can communicate with C libraries can be used for application development.
    * In a Java environment any 32-bit or 64-bit SDK with Java external routines can be used for application development.
   
   
 * When IBM Forms Server is used in concert with non-IBM portal offerings, such as with SAP or BEA, the form is launched in a separate window and runs within this window as an independent web application.
 * 
 * Engineering notes for IBM Forms Experience Builder 8.0 and 8.0.0.1: 
 *   * IBM Forms Experience Builder can run in a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
    *  IBM Forms Experience Builder runs on its own server; it does not require any other IBM Forms Server components.
    *  The IBM Forms Experience Builder portlet for WebSphere Portal can render any number of Forms Experience Builder solutions within a portal application. IBM Forms Experience Builder can be installed into WebSphere Application Server and be called by a portlet, but it is not available as a portlet WAR that runs on a Portal server.
