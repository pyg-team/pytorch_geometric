APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running dmpmqcfg -a locally against a queue manager fails with
   error:  "MQSC timed out waiting for a response from the command
   server"
   
   The command server is confirmed running, but the issue still
   occurs.
   
   The root cause of the problem was that the MQXR listener had not
   been started.  The error message that was output should have
   mentioned this, and then the user would have known what was
   causing the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure the MQXR service is started per the product
   documentation at:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.
   mq.ref.adm.doc/q083160_.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q083160_.html]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem only happens when the queue manager is MQXR
   component has been installed, and the queue named
   SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE exists but the MQXR listener is not
   running to service this queue.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The error being output was AMQ8416 "MQSC timed out waiting for a
   response from the command server."
   
   It should have been  AMQ8486 "The Telemetry Service
   'SYSTEM.MQXR.SERVICE' is not running."
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The error message in this case is now  AMQ8486 "The Telemetry
   Service 'SYSTEM.MQXR.SERVICE' is not running."
   
   A small correction is also made to the AMQ5703 error message, to
   include a mention of the object type "mqttchl" which can validly
   be used with dmpmqcfg.
