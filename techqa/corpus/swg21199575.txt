PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive an abend0C4 in module DFHPGHM. This is occurring if you have programs using pre-translated COBOL copybooks with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.1 or later. 

CAUSE
Support for OS/VS COBOL was removed in CICS TS V3.1. As a result, an attempt to call an OS/VS COBOL program will cause an ALIK transaction abend. However, it is possible that you have old pre-translated copybooks. 

If a copybook is copied into a program written using a supported version of COBOL, problems can occur. An EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION or ABEND LABEL command issued from an old copybook could result in a 0C4/AKEA in module DFHPGHM. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have pre-translated COBOL copybooks, you should either re-translate them or use the latest compiler with the integrated translator. If you use the latest compiler with the integrated translator, pre-translation of copybooks is not necessary.
