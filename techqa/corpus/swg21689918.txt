AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects some versions and releases of WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Business Compass, WebSphere Business Modeler, and WebSphere Business Modeler Publishing Server.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Business Compass, and WebSphere Business Modeler Publishing Server completely rely on WebSphere Application Server to provide HTTPS capabilities. 

IBM recommends that customers install an interim fix for the IBM JDK to disable SSLv3. For information on the required fix, refer to the the Remediation/Fixes section in the following bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

Note that other related products are also affected by this vulnerability. In the context of applying fixes, you will also want to update Installation Manager to version 1.8 or later.
