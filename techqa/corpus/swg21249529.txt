Title: IBM GDPS : unexpected GEO181E message when using NetView MRT - United States

Text:
MRT netview gdps geo181e route code routecode routcde TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Client added a CBR statement to netview MRT and received unexpected GEO181E message at GDPS initialization. Client needed assistance to resolve the error. 

SYMPTOM
GEO181E 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
GDPS customer defined NetView Message Revision Table (MRT) with the following statement: 

UPON ( PREFIX = 'CBR' ) 
REVISE("x1xxxxxx" FLGRTCD2) set additional routecde 10 

When GDPS started, it reported SDF alerts indicating messages CBR3785E and CBR3787E were not trapped, such as this example:

CBR3787E GDPS TEST MESSAGE 
GEO181E MESSAGE CBR3787E NOT TRAPPED IN MESSAGE TABLE 

The GDPS Install Guide section "3.3.2 Updating NetView parameters" has a section on the "GDPS Message Health Check" saying: 


When GDPS initializes, a program runs that issues a WTO with routcde=11 for all messages that GDPS expects to be trapped in the message table. 

 

Adding route code 10 to the CBR messages has the result that GDPS doesn't trap the test messages. The test messages must be route code 11, and only that route code. 

Customer needs to ensure GDPS required messages are excluded from MRT, or if defined in MRT that the route code is not altered. All messages checked in the GDPS Message Health Check should be exempt from MRT route code or text content modification. 

Clients must review section titled "MPFLST customization and message automation for GDPS" in the GDPS manual. 

Note: this is merely one potential cause of GEO181E. If problem is not solved after reviewing test message route codes, then other causes may exist.
