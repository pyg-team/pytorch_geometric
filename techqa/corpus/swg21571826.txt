 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In TSAM 721 I could create a resource pool per Cluster, and the resource pool would discover resources on, and provision to, only that single cluster. 
How do I achieve this in TSAM 722? 

ANSWER
You would need to go to the provisioning computers application (Goto -> Deployment -> Provisioning Computers) then search for the DCM object representing the virtual center, then for this object go to its variable tab and add a new property with name "ClusterName" and with value equal to the name of the cluster where you want to do the provisioning and save it.
If ESX hosts from the other cluster are already added to the resource pool, you can go to the resource pool (goto -> administration -> provisioning -> resourcepool) and remove the unwanted ESX hosts from the resource pool by clicking on the delete icon next to those hosts and save the resource pool thus leaving only the hosts from the desired cluster in resource pool.

Question:
How do we deal with multiple Clusters and multiple Resource Pools ?
If there is only a single Virtual Center object, and only a single ClusterName variable for the Virtual Center object, how do we manage multiple resource pools, each provisioning to a unique Cluster?

Answer:
You can have multiple Virtualcenter Objects representing the same Virtualcenters say VC1 , VC2 etc and each having its own ClusterName variable...so you are still able to manage multiple resource pools, each provisioning to a unique cluster 

Question:
Does the message above imply that we can only support a single resource pool with a single VMware cluster... or, that we require a unique Virtual Center and unique VMware Cluster pair per Resource Pool?

Answer:
Yes , but only in terms of virtualcenter object in DCM not physical. 

Question: 
Finally, how can we eliminate the need to go and edit the Resource Pools after every vCenter discovery? It is not intuitive, you may forget and experience failures as a result. 

After any vCenter discovery we need to edit all resource pools, and delete the ESX hosts not associated with that resource pool... this is unnecessary. 

Answer:
If you create multiple virtualcenter DCM objects and then assign this variable to each of them correctly, then it is a one time configuration.

Question:
I determine from this behavior, that from a provisioning perspective we only care which ESX hosts are associated with the backing Resource Pool?

Answer:
Yes(partially ) only the ESX hosts present in the backing resource pool are used for capacity and reservation planning starting from 722. So after discovery you can add and remove ESX hosts from the Resource Pool to add/remove them from capacity.The dependence on this variable is getting diminished with each successive release of TSAM.
