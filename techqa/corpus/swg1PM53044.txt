APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The issue is not significant (DS4) but this is a product defect
   from the following point.
   
   The online help describes How HTTP session timeout works ( This
   is a kind of design spec for this ).
   It tells that the change of HTTP session timeout takes effect
   immediately and affects the entire Rational ClearQuest Web site.
   However if you set a value less than 300 seconds, it does NOT
   take effect, so it fails.
   
   Input : a value more than 300 seconds  --? Result : PASSED/It
   works.
   Input : a value less than 300 seconds  --? Result : FAILED/It
   does NOT work.
   
   1. Add validation for input to prevent user from entering a
   value less than 300 seconds in the Site Administration/CM Server
   Options.
   2. Add statement ' Must be greater than or equal to 300 seconds
   (5 minutes)' in the Information Center Online Help like
   ccrcLoginSessionTimeout.

   Modifying the HTTP session timeout setting
   
   Any HTTP session in the Rational? ClearQuest? Web application
   that remains idle beyond a specified time period is terminated.
   After a session times out, you must log on to Rational
   ClearQuest Web again. This topic describes how to modify the
   HTTP session timeout setting.
   Procedure
   
      1. In the Rational ClearQuest Web application banner, click
   Site Administration ? Configuration.
      2. Click the CM Server Options tab.
      3. In the Session Timeout field, specify the timeout setting,
   in seconds. The default is 1800 seconds.
      4. Click Apply or OK.
   
   Results
   
   The change takes effect immediately and affects the entire
   Rational ClearQuest Web site.

   Modifying the CM Server MBean attributes for ClearQuest Web
   
   # ccrcLoginSessionTimeout[R,W] - The lifetime (in seconds) of a
   CCRC login session. When a session has been idle for this period
   the user is required to reauthenticate with the CCRC server.
   Default is 14400 seconds (4 hours). Must be greater than or
   equal to 600 seconds (10 minutes). This CCRC attribute is the
   only one that has an initial set value.
   
   # cqLoginSessionTimeout[R,W] - The amount of time in seconds
   that a ClearQuest? login session will persist before timing out.
   Default value is 1800 seconds (30 minutes). Each ClearQuest
   session employs a database connection, so setting this value too
   high may consume resources for longer than necessary. Do not
   change the default value.

   ****************************************************************
   ClearQuest Web 7.1.x Site Administration allows you to enter
   any value for the HTTP session timeout even though the
   minimum allowed is 5 minutes ( 300 seconds).  Validation
   should be added for input less that 300 seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Technote #1567032 has been created to warn users the minimum
   HTTP session time out value is 300 seconds.
   
   A priority decision has been made that this defect cannot be
   addressed in the next 18 months without neglecting issues of
   higher importance and less risk.  Thank you for your
   understanding.
