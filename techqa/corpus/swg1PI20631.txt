   01.There is no way for RDz client to know the actual server
      version. This can be a problem under some conditions.
   02.When the CRAALLOC/CRANDVRA exec substitutes system
      variables, like TSO prefix, it accepts that null strings are
      returned. This results in an invalid DSN due to a missing
      qualifier, and thus an allocation error.
   03.When CRASUBxx starts with a comment line instead of the CLIST
      PROC statement, CARMA cannot determine the correct number of
      arguments that ust be passed.
   04.host config utility workitem allocates sample RAM VSAM
      instead of Endevor RAM VSAM. Host config utility workitem
      defines ISPPROF as a sequential file in
      crastart.endevor.conf.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.There is a mechanism that DataStore client and server
      exchange their versions during the connection establishment
      phase. The DataStore server version is controlled by the
      property of DSTORE_VERSION. Now, RDz daemon picks up the
      server version from SMP information and sets the server
      version forcibly to the DSTORE_VERSION property.
   02.CRAALLOC/CRANDVRA now strips null-length qualifiers
   03.carma.startup.rex now searches for the PROC line
   04.Problems resolved
