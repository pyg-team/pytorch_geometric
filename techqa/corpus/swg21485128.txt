Title: IBM An unknown error has terminated communication with the processor when exporting to Excel and the subcommand /MISSING = RECODE is used on Windows 7 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19 on a Windows 7 operating system. I have a data file with numeric and string variables, all containing system missing values and user missing values code 1 for the missings in the string variables. I would like to export my SPSS data file as Excel XLS file by using the /MISSING = RECODE subcommand since I would like to recode the user missing values to blank strings in the resulting Excel file.
Example:
SAVE TRANSLATE OUTFILE='C:\Temp\MyFile1.xls'
/TYPE=XLS
/VERSION=8
/MISSING = RECODE
/MAP
/REPLACE
/FIELDNAMES
/CELLS=VALUES.

However, when I run my syntax the program crashes with the message below and I have to quit the program via task manager:

"An unknown error has terminated communication with the processor. The SPSS Statistics Processor is unavailable".

An Excel file was created but when i try to open this file in Excel I get the error:

"Test1.xls:: file format is not valid" 

This does not happen on a windows XP computer, why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available. It is expected to be addressed with the 19.0.0.2 FixPack (19.0.2 Patch).

As a workaround either remove the subcommand /MISSING = RECODE from your syntax or save the SPSS data file as Excel XLSX file with this syntax below. We apologize for the inconvenience.

SAVE TRANSLATE OUTFILE='C:\Temp\MyFile2.xlsx'
/TYPE=XLS
/VERSION=12
/MISSING = RECODE
/MAP
/REPLACE
/FIELDNAMES
/CELLS=VALUES.
