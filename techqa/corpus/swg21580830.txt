QUESTION
 How do I recreate all the Oracle Text indexes for the Atlas database 

ANSWER
There are situations where the Oracle Text indexes used by the application may need to be recreated. For example, after importing data from a production database to a test database, the Oracle Text indexes will not be transferred. This will require you to recreate them in order for certain functions in Atlas to work properly. 

If you have access to the Atlas release files from the version you are currently using you can follow these instructions. You will need the ability to access the Atlas database using the Oracle SQL Plus tool. 

 

 1. Shutdown the application server running the Atlas applications. 
 2. Locate the script drop_ctxsys_indexes.sql to drop the Oracle Text indexes from the following folder in the Atlas release:
    Atlas\Schema\Deploy\smf\db\etc\oracle 
 3. Open up a command window to that directory and execute the script using SQL Plus:
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @drop_ctxsys_indexes.sql 
 4. Locate the scripts, setup_ctxsys_objects.sql and create_ctxsys_indexes.sql, used to create the Oracle Text preferences and indexes from the following folder in the Atlas release. The <version> folder will differ depending on which version you are currently running.
    Atlas\Schema\Deploy\smf\db\release\<version>\oracle\create\schema 
 5. Open up a command window to that directory and execute the scripts using SQL Plus.
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @setup_ctxsys_objects.sql
    sqlplus <user>/<password>@<database> @create_ctxsys_indexes.sql 
 6. Start the application server running the Atlas applications.
