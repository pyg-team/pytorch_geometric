Title: IBM IDM Web 3.2a - MTS server utilizing IDMDT for pooled logins generates max cached - United States

Text:
IDM DESKTOP, MTS MICROSOFT TRANSACTION SERVER, ERROR -2147214718, THE MAXIMUM CACHED DOCUMENTS LIMIT TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IDM Web 3.2a - MTS server utilizing IDMDT for pooled logins generates max cached 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IDM Web 3.2a - MTS server utilizing IDMDT for pooled logins generates max cached documents reached error and the MTS application server must be RE-BOOTED. Number of document in cache is less then number configured in IDMConfigure.
Actual error:
Err.number: -2147214718 
Err.Description: The maximum cached documents limit has been reached, please see the administrator.

Problem is happening because site had configured greater than 32 IS for one MTS servers. 
In our code, we have a hard limit set for the maximum (32 IS / CS) number of IS servers. In other words, we only create a large enough cache table(FnCacheM - FileNET Cache Manager) for 32 IS (or CS) servers or less. 

This problem is fixed in patch 22. See DTS #DTS 72942
