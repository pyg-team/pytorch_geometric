Title: IBM Error: Access Denied - Non-admin user cannot start the WebSphere Test Environment 6.x server - United States

Text:
Access denied; WTE; non-admin; cannot start server ; 1307233 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
This Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Softeware technote explains why attempts to start the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server as a non-administrative user results in the error Access Denied and provides steps to resolve the issue.

SYMPTOM
Access Denied message displays in the WebSphere Application Server server's console view and users cannot start the product.

CAUSE
The problem commonly occurs with the environment where the main users do not have administrator privilege or do not have full access to their WebSphere® Test Environment v6.x profiles directory. 

By default, Application Server v6.x profiles are located in <Rational Application Developer 7 installed dir>\runtimes\base_v6x

Note: During WebSphere Application Server installation, its installer automatically create a profile (AppSrv01) and the profile belongs to the user who performed the installation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Warning: This technote is intended for users who do not have administrator privilege for their systems and who can not successfully startup WAS 6.x server. 


 1. Administrator user can give total access permission of the <SDP installed>\runtimes\base_v61\profiles\<profile name>\ directory, its sub folders, and it files to the non-admin users. If giving the permission does not help the non-admin users to start Application Server, Administrator can delete the default WebSphere Application Server profile that was created during the installation process and allow non-admin users to create a WebSphere Application Server profile by themselves (see below.)
    
 2. If the system is shared by multiple users, a backup must be made of the profiles inside <RAD7 installed dir>\runtimes\base_v6x. See Exporting and Import server configuration from WebSphere Application Server v6.x in RAD7’s help.
    
    
 3. Non-admin user creates a new WebSphere Application Server profile (see below).
