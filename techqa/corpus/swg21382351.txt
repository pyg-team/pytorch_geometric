PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User A clicks 'Company - Data Entry - Reported values'. User A opens a form (for example "XYZ"). Form works successfully (no problem).
User B access the same form (XYZ). User B receives error message indicating that the form needs processing. However, the form does not need updating. No other user is experiencing this problem 

SYMPTOM
The Form XYZ needs to be updated 


CAUSE
There are many different possible causes for this (or similar) errors. 

 * Search the IBM Technotes for more examples, for example #1639815.


However, this IBM Technote specifically relates to the scenario where only one (or some) user(s) receive this error message. In this scenario, the problem is caused by the 'bad' end user having old/out-of-date Controller cache files. 

More Information 
Controller stores cache files (inside the folder %APPDATA%\cognos\ccr) to speed up many of its functions. If a superuser makes changes to the structures of the system (for example a form) then the end users may have out-of-date information inside their cache folder, which causes the Controller client to not recognise changes made by the central superuser(s).  * TIP: For more examples, see separate IBM Technotes #1345944, 1346790, 1381197, 1378194.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clear Controller cache files on 'bad' end user's client device. 

 

Steps: 

The easiest method is to ask the 'bad' end user to click 'Maintain - Special Utilities - Clear Local Cache' (inside Controller).
