Abstract
IBM Service Management Unite is a systems management console that consolidates mainframe management information and tasks from disparate sources into a single environment. This portal will provide information about Service Management Unite as well as a link to download it. 

 

Function
IBM Service Management Unite is a customizable dashboard user interface that is available with IBM Service Management Suite for z/OS V1.5.0. Service Management Unite provides system programmers, operators, and administrators with a transparent view about the of system health status and allows for easy problem identification. The dashboard enables operators to see both monitoring and automation exception events together so they can identify critical problems. Operators can quickly and confidently analyze, isolate and diagnose problems by providing all relevant data in a single place. Service Management Unite also enables operators interact directly with the system by issuing commands and viewing results without going to a different console.

Service Management Unite also provides access to automation functions to start, stop or recycle business applications running on z (z/OS or Systems z), even from mobile devices. This flexibility helps system programmers, operators, and administrators by delivering more usable and efficient automation and system and network management capabilities. The integrated operations console can be used by operators to issue commands such as starting and stopping heterogeneous business applications on IBM z Systems and distributed platforms.
