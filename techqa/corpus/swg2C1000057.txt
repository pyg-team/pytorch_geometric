PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to replace SSL certificates in IBM Cloud Orchestrator results in the error "Validation failed: Unsupported certificate format or algorithm.". 

SYMPTOM
While replacing the SSL certificate, the step to receive the certificate generates the following error:

# /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/java/jre/bin/ikeycmd -cert -receive -db key.kdb.NEW -file cert_cs2.cer -pw <yourpw> -format ascii

Validation failed: Unsupported certificate format or algorithm. 


CAUSE
Ikeyman versions prior to version 8.0.399 may report this error message when receiving a certificate into the database.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error is not problematic and can be ignored. 

 * You can run the following cert list command to confirm the new certificate has been imported:
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/java/jre/bin/ikeycmd -cert -list -db key.kdb.NEW -pw <yourpw>
   
   
 * You can also run the following command to verify that there are no certificate requests:
   /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/java/jre/bin/ikeycmd -certreq -list -db key.kdb.NEW -pw <yourpw>



Note: A new version of ikeyman (8.0.399) is shipped in IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4.0.2 and 2.4.0.3.
