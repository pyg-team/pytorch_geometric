PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Image Services, a 32-bit application, can now run in a 64-bit Windows environment. 

SYMPTOM
Image Services now adds support for the 64-bit Windows Operating System. The supported 64-bit Windows Operating System versions include: Windows 2008 R2, 2008, 2003, and 2003 R2. These supported Operating System versions are the same as their counterparts on a 32-bit Operating System, with Image Services 4.1.2 FixPack 6 and up, and 4.2.0. 

All three relational database types (DB2, Oracle and SQL Server) are supported, which includes both 32-bit and 64-bit databases, remotely or locally with Image Services. The supported 64-bit database versions are the same as those on 32-bit databases for Image Services 4.1.2 and 4.2.0.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Image Services is supported on Windows 64-bit Operating System with the following restriction: Optical Storage Libraries (OSAR) are not supported; only MSAR and SDS are supported in a 64-bit Windows environment. 

Following is the information for each relational database type:
I. DB2: Only remote databases are supported, to align with the Image Services DB2 support policy. The DB2 client on the IS server can be either 32-bit or 64-bit, with version 8.2, 9.1, 9.5, 9.7, and up. The Fix Pack requirements are the same for both the 32-bit and 64-bit DB2 client. No special configuration is required to support Image Service with DB2 on a 64-bit Windows server.

II. SQL Server: The database can be collocated with IS on a server or be remote on another server. Both 32-bit or 64-bit versions of SQL Server are supported with Windows 2000, 2005, 2008, and up. The 64-bit SQL Server Service Pack requirements are the same as that for a 32-bit SQL Server on 32-bit Windows, for Image Services 4.1.2 and 4.2.0.

III. Oracle: The database can be collocated with IS on a server or be remote on another server.
· Remote Oracle databases can be located on any platform that Image Services currently supports. A 32-bit Oracle Client is needed because Image Services is a 32-bit application. The 64-bit Oracle client is not supported.

· Local Oracle database: Oracle only supports a 64-bit database server on 64-bit Windows. Oracle does not support a 32-bit Oracle database server on 64-bit Windows. In order for Image Services to work with an Oracle 64-bit local database, the following is required:

Oracle Instant Client for Microsoft Windows (32-bit) - Instant Client Package – Basic
Oracle Instant Client can be downloaded from the Oracle website:

http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/winsoft.html [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/winsoft.html]


 *  Image Services uses the same procedure that is required for a remote Oracle database. The “fn_util whichfn” command will return a status that Image Services is connected to a remote Oracle database even though it is actually collocated with Image Services. This is OK since fn_util whichfn is for informational purposes only and it will not impact any Image Services functionality. 


Below is a simplified procedure to set up Image Services with a local 64-bit Oracle database for 1 instance dedicated to Image Services: 

1. Install a 64-bit Oracle database server on an appropriate version of 64-bit Windows 
2. Create a 64-bit local database and needed tablespace, with a minimum of 1 permanent and 1 temporary tablespace, for Image Services 
3. Create an Oracle listener and startup the listener service 
4. Download the appropriate version of Instant Client Package – Basic for Microsoft Windows 32-bit, which is required to be the same version as the Oracle database server installed. 
 * [Note for Oracle 12c:
 * 
 * Oracle 11.2.0.x
 *  Instant Client
 * 
 * ]


5. Unzip the packages into a single directory such as " instantclient".  * 
 * C:\instantclient\instantclient_11_2
 * 

6. Set the library loading path in your environment to the " instantclient"directory. (For Oracle 11.2.0.x, it will be " C:\instantclient\instantclient_11_2"). On Windows platform, PATH is the appropriate environment variable; the Instant Client home should be before the 64-bit Oracle database home. 
7. Add a new system environment variable, LOCAL, with the value pointing to the TNS alias or connection identifier set on tnsnames.ora file, such as LOCAL=sitedb 
8. Add a new system environment variable, TNS_ADMIN, with the value pointing to the directory/path where tnsnames.ora and sqlnet.ora located, such as TNS_ADMIN=C:\app\Administrator\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1\NETWORK\ADMIN 
9. Create database users, f_sw, f_sqi, f_open, and f_maint, by simply issuing “create user <f_user> identified by <f_user_password>” and "grant create session to <f_user>" on sqlplus as sysdba 
10. Run fn_edit 
11. Run fn_setup_rdb –f 
12. Run fn_oracle setquotas 
13. Run following scripts "\fnsw_loc\oracle\ora_users.sql" and "\fnsw\oracle\FileNet.sql" on sqlplus as sysdba 
14. Run fn_util init 
15. Startup IS by initfnsw start 

There are special requirements for installing an Oracle database server on Microsoft Windows 2008 according to Oracle Metalink. The following is an excerpt from Metalink: 
· Use Oracle Database 11gR1 Release 1 (11.1.0.7.0) for Microsoft Windows 2008 Server. Do not install with the 11.1.0.6.0 version. 
· Do not install Oracle Database 10g Release 2 on Windows Server 2008 using the 10.2.0.1 version. You must use the 10.2.0.3 (32-bit) or 10.2.0.4 (x64) versions specifically created for Windows Server 2008 to install Oracle Database 10g Release 2 on the operating system. 

Please refer to Oracle release notes and installation guides for more information on the installation of different Oracle database versions.
