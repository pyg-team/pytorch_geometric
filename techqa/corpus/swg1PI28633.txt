APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z gets ERROR ServerThread:
   Exception when the hostname and the system name are not the
   same.
   
   This error is not informative about the cause.
   
   The root cause is a TCP/IP DNS setup error
   
   rseserver.log shows
   ERROR: java.lang.NullPointerException
   ERROR: java.util.Hashtable.put(Hashtable.java:567)
   ERROR: java.util.Properties.setProperty(Properties.java:175)
   ERROR: java.lang.System.setProperty(System.java:496)
   ERROR:
   org.eclipse.dstore.internal.core.server.ServerAttributes.getHost
   Name(ServerAttributes.java:97)
   ERROR:
   org.eclipse.dstore.internal.core.server.ServerAttributes.<init>(
   ServerAttributes.java:67)
   
   Additional Keywords:
   TCPIP
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add the following line to rsed.envvars where <hostname> is just
   the system name, so no .dsname,com, that part is specified in
   another TCPIP field. (DOMAINORIGIN is
   yourhostname.yourcompany.com)
   _RSE_JAVAOPTS="$_RSE_JAVAOPTS -Dhostname=<hostname>"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: 01.RDz server administrators who have DNS    *
   *                    issues on their servers and RDz users     *
   *                    who are concerned with too many           *
   *                    unnecessary log files.                    *

   *                 03.z/OS system administrator                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.When DNS settings are messed up, an  *
   *                         NPE can occur with the server        *
   *                         without a useful error message and   *
   *                         .dstoreHashmap log entries can take  *
   *                         up a lot of space.                   *

   *                         folder from RSE deletes the folder   *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.If a z/OS machine hasn't properly configured their DNS
      settings, an NPE can occur with the server. While there is
      already a workaround for this scenario, there is no message
      indicating to the administrator what might have gone wrong.
      The second issue is that .dstoreHashmap files can get
      frequently created in some scenarios and these files aren't
      very useful to users.
   02.Deleting a symbolic link for a folder from RSE deletes the
      folder contents.
   03.Rational Developer for System z enhancement to allow TLS
      v1.2 usage. To use TLS v1.2, define
      _RSE_JAVAOPTS="$_RSE_JAVAOPTS
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2" in rsed.envvars (host), and
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2 in eclipse.ini (client).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The RSE server will attempt to fall back to reading the
      hostname via a shell command. If that fails then, a error
      message will indicate a problem and suggest the workaround.
      For .dstoreHashmap log entries will not get created by
      default and older ones will be deleted after a two days.
   02.When a user deletes a symbolic link for a folder, the
      contents are not deleted.
   03.Rational Developer for System z enhancement to allow TLS
      v1.2 usage. To use TLS v1.2, define
      _RSE_JAVAOPTS="$_RSE_JAVAOPTS
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2" in rsed.envvars (host), and
      -DDSTORE_SSL_ALGORITHM=TLSv1.2 in eclipse.ini (client).
