Text:
 WHITE PAPER

ABSTRACT
 The objective of this technical document is to describe in detail how to view/alter the Aged Timeout and Maximum Connections properties in a WebSphere MQ JMS Connection Factory inside WebSphere Application Server V6, V7 and V8.


CONTENT
The attached PDF file provides screens from the WAS Administrative Console. 

Some screens for V6, V7 and V8 look the same, but others have differences. This document will make a note of the differences.

The properties that are shown under the "Connection Pool" settings are:


 * Connection timeout, in seconds 
 * Maximum connections 
 * Minimum connections 
 * Reap time, in seconds 
 * Unused timeout, in seconds 
 * Aged timeout, in seconds (highlighted below) 
 * Purge policy:  * EntirePool 
    * EntirePool FailingConnectionOnly 
   
   

This techdoc provides supplementary material that can be used when performing some recommendations from WebSphere MQ Support. Under some situations, MQ Support may provide the recommendation to set the "Aged timeout" value to 0 and to find out the value of the "Maximum Connections" attribute, which can be assigned to the MQ JMS connection pool property "MQJMS.POOLING.THRESHOLD"; The last task is described in the following techdoc: 

" Adding the MQJMS.POOLING.THRESHOLD property to connection pooling facility provided by WebSphere MQ JMS in WAS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023235]" 

Another situation is to match the value of "Maximum Connections" with the "Maximum sessions" property for a Listener Port. This is explained in the following techdoc: 

IBM Techdoc 7023471: View/Alter the Maximum Sessions property in a Listener Port in WAS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023471]
