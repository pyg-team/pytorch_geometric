Title: IBM Deletion of a resource or schema deletes resources across Contract Libraries that are referenced by the same schema - United States

Text:
xsd_delete; slm_xsd_delete; igc_xsd_delete TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If multiple contract libraries are created by importing the same XSD schema archive (.xsd or .zip) using Metadata Asset Manager, the following behavior is seen:

a) Deleting a schema using Information Governance Catalog results in all the resources referenced by the schema being deleted.

b) Deleting a resource using Schema Library Manager results in all other resources referenced by that schema and the schema being deleted. 

CAUSE
The identity of a schema is defined by its name and target namespace which cannot be changed while importing the same schema multiple times. So, resources created under multiple contract libraries would reference the schema. And hence, deletion of a schema or resource would remove all referenced resources in multiple contract libraries.

ENVIRONMENT
Information Server 11.5 Data Analyst UI

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is a known issue for which no work around exists.
