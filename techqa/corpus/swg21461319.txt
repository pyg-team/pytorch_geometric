QUESTION
 How do you test the pages requested with GET method for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities using IBM Rational AppScan Standard Edition (AppScan)? 

CAUSE
By default, AppScan only tests the pages that are requested with POST method for CSRF vulnerabilities.

ANSWER
In order for AppScan to test the GET pages:


 1. Open the Scan Configuration
    
    
 2. Click on the Advanced Configuration section
    
    
 3. Find the option #2050: Tests: CSRF: Pattern of meaningful request
    
    
 4. Replace the default value (^POST) with: ^POST|^GET
    
    
 5. Validate and close the Scan Configuration dialogue
    
    
 6. Re-run the complete scan
    


Now both the POST and the GET pages will be scanned for the CSRF vulnerabilities.
