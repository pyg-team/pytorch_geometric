   Installation and Configuration Guide 10.1.1 ??Architecture >
   Cognos TM1 Web architecture >??   ??Accessing multiple Cognos
   TM1 servers from Cognos TM1 Web??   ??IBM Cognos TM1 Web
   provides multi-database support, allowing users to access
   multiple Cognos TM1 servers that are registered on the same
   Cognos TM1 Admin Server and where users have the same user name
   and password combination.??   ??When you log in, Cognos TM1 Web
   displays the Navigation pane for the primary server that you
   selected on the login screen. However, if your user name and
   password combination matches other Cognos TM1 servers registered
   under the same Cognos TM1 Admin Server, then IBM Cognos TM1 Web
   will automatically log you in to these other servers on an
   as-needed basis. This behavior is different from Cognos TM1
   Architect and Cognos TM1 Perspectives where you have to log into
   other Cognos TM1 servers as a separate, manual step.??
   ??Multi-database support mainly applies to Websheets because
   they can contain Cognos TM1 formulas and references that point
   to other Cognos TM1 servers. For example, if you open a Websheet
   that does contain Cognos TM1 references to another server
   registered under the same Admin Server, Cognos TM1 Web will
   attempt to log you into this other server using your current
   user name and password.??   ??   ??So if there are four TM1
   server instances A, B, C and D which are all registered with the
   same TM1 Admin Server, and a user has the same TM1 username and
   password on all four instances, and in TM1 Web that user logs on
   to one of the four TM1 server instances, he can query all four
   TM1 server instance not only the one he logged on to.??   ??So
   the user can log on to the TM1 server instance A and in addition
   to the instance A also query the instances B, C and D.??Or the
   user can log on to the TM1 server instance B and in addition to
   the instance B also query the instances A, C and D.??Or the user
   can log on to the TM1 server instance C and in addition to the
   instance C also query the instances A, B and D.??Or the user can
   log on to the TM1 server instance D and in addition to the
   instance D also query the instances A, B and C.??   ??To
   summarize:??All TM1 server instances are equal. There is no
   hierarchy of TM1 server instances.??   ??   ??But that is not
   how it worked in my tests with TM1 Web Version 10.1.1 and 10.1.1
   FP1:??What I experienced was a hierarchy of TM1 server
   instances, an alphabetically descending order,  based on the
   servername of the instances.??When the servername of a TM1
   server instance I queried (using a DBRW formula in a websheet)
   was before the instance I logged on to, the query returned
   results.??When the servername of a TM1 server instance I queried
   (using a DBRW formula in a websheet) was behind the instance I
   logged on to, the query did not return results.??   ??   ??When
   a user logged on to the TM1 server instance A and queried the
   instances B, C and D he got no results from the instances B, C
   and D.??When a user logged on to the TM1 server instance B and
   queried the instances A, C and D he got results from the
   instance A, but he got no results from the instances C and
   D.??When a user logged on to the TM1 server instance C and
   queried the instances A, B and D he got results from the
   instance A and B, but he got no results from the instance
   D.??When a user logged on to the TM1 server instance D and
   queried the instances A, B and C he got results from the
   instances A, B and C.
