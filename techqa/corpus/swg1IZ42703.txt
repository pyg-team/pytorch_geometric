APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When multiple listeners are configured on an Oracle server,
   default situation Oracle_Listener_Crit becomes true only when
   all listener processes are down.
   As soon 1 listener starts, the situation goes in closed state.
   
   If one defines a situation to monitor a single listener by name,
   such as:
   
   *IF *VALUE Oracle_Listener_Detail.Listener_Status *NE Active
   *AND *VALUE
   Oracle_Listener_Detail.Listener_Name *EQ LISTENER
   
   unexpected behavior is reported when listener names begin the
   same way.
   
   E.g., if you have two listeners named LISTENER and LISTENER1,
   the situation above will become true again only when both of
   them is down (while just LISTENER would be enough).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Don't use listener names beginning with the same substring.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Oracle_Listener_Crit situation not fired if listener "LISTENER1"
   alive but listener "LISTENER" is stopped.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Change codes to check the listener name more strictly.
