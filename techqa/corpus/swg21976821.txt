Title: IBM The Transformation Extender Management Console is not able to communicate with the Launcher using IPv6 communication - United States

Text:
LINUX_GETADDRINFO socket 97 221 unable management console status TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Transformation Extender Management Console is not able to communicate with the Launcher using IPv6 communication. 

SYMPTOM
Management Console is unresponsive and socket errors are listed in the Compound System log file.


CAUSE
Transformation Extender (TX) customers running the Launcher on Linux operating systems that do not support the IPv6 protocol.


On some Linux systems that do not have IPv6 support, the TX Launcher is failing to open server sockets needed for TX monitoring tools. In particular, the Getaddrinfo system call returns addrinfo for the IPv6 AF family but socket system calls can fail with a 97 or 221 error (EAFNOSUPPORT).


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When using the Management Console, it may become unresponsive or the Status entry will display Not Responding. 

 

Review the LauncherLog<date-time>,log, located in the logs subdirectory and search for entries similar to the following that are displayed every 30 seconds: 


Cannot recognize if the system <system_name>.msl has started. Reason: Server is unable to get the status of the system on port number 7,002. 

 

If this "Server is unable to get the status of the system" error is observed, view the associated Compound System log file, also in the logs subdirectory and search for the error: 

Socket error : error 97 

or 

Socket error : error 221



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If he above socket error 97 or 221 is observed, set the environment variable, LINUX_GETADDRINFO to a value of 1. 

export LINUX_GETADDRINFO=1 and restart the Launcher. 

 

If LINUX_GETADDRINFO is set, it will force additional checks and will force IPv4 sockets to be used.
