APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When multiple threads try to add an indexed property to an
   SDOComplexType, a HashMap might be accessed concurrently, which
   causes hung threads (WSVR0605W) messages and high CPU usage on
   the JVM.
   
   The following Java stack is included for the WSVR0605W message:
   
   [11/21/17 13:04:33:353 EST] 0000009b ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W:
   Thread "SIBJMSRAThreadPool : 13" (0000033e) has been active for
   619277 milliseconds and may be hung.  There is/are 14 thread(s)
   in total in the server that may be hung.
