ABSTRACT
 ODM Spatial Extension provides BOM and XOM for dealing with geospatial information in business rules. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Rapid expansion of mobile technologies is transforming the way businesses work making them adopt new processes and utilize new kinds of information. Location data is an example of information type that has become easily available with the recent spread of mobile devices; being utilized properly in business decisions and processes, it provides huge opportunities for business growth and optimization. While bringing new opportunities, location data also presents new challenges which hinder its full adoption and very often lead to partial or incorrect solutions that do not fully leverage the potential. 

ODM Spatial Extension simplifies development of business rule applications by providing a business object model (BOM) for common geospatial data types and the corresponding executable model (XOM) that implements geospatial computation algorithms (e.g. distance, containment). Thus, the application developer can focus on the business logic while leaving the complexity of modelling and processing geospatial data to the extension modules.

Possible Uses
Create geospatial objects in a java application; calling geospatial operators in business rules; calling geospatial functions in java applications.
