PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   CATIA
   Incident Diagnosis
   The given document is corrupted. In front view,
   there is a badly corrupted dimension that is not
   visible. To get it, you have to:
   1- Get to to the no-show space, select everything
   there and delete it
   2- Go back to visible space, edit/search: you'll
   get only 1 dimension left (Dimension.165), select it
   3- You can delete it or rebuild it by setting its
   font to bold.
   You can see that this dimension (that used to be a
   generated dimension) is now non-updatable. The
   force rebuild of this dimension solves the problem
   (if you close the drawing without save, re-open it
   and select and rebuilt the faulting dimension, you
   can keep all the drawing contents) when you
   isolate the view.
   Restriction Explanation
   As said above, this drawing is corrupted on one of
   its dimension, but we can't easily locate it,
   because the faulty one could be mistaken with a
   good one. So we can't take risk to act on it.
   Away, we could probably do something if we had a
   scenario that leads to this type of corruption.
   Especially, we would like to know if the customer
   uses different platforms (windows, sun...) and if
   he has special processes that lead to such a
   corruption. How many drawing does the customer
   have that present this kind of behavior ?
   By-Pass
   1- Get to to the no-show space, select eveerything
   there and delete it
   2- Go back to visible space, edit/search: you'll
   get only 1 dimension left (Dimension.165) select it
   3- You can delete it or rebuild it by setting its
   font to bold.
