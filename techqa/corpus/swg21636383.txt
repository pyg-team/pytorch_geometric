QUESTION
 Which IBM Security devices are strict SP800-131A capable? 

CAUSE
NIST's Special Publication 800-131A

ANSWER
The IBM Security devices that are SP800-131A capable are: 

 * IBM Security SiteProtector System 3.0 or greater 
 * IBM Security Network Protection XGS product line (XGS 5100, XGS 4100, XGS 3100) 
 * IBM Security Network Intrusion Prevention Systems product line with 4.6.1 firmware or higher


The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-131A (SP800-131A) standard strengthens algorithms and increases key lengths to improve security. The SP800-131A standard also provides for a transition period to move to the new standard. The transition period enables a user to run in a mixed environment of settings not supported under the standard along with those that are supported. The SP800-131A standard requires that users be configured for strict enforcement of the standard. See the National Institute of Standards and Technology web site at http://www.nist.gov/index.html [http://www.nist.gov/index.html] for more details. To conform to the SP800-131A standard, devices must meet the following criteria. 

 * Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) over the TLS v1.2 protocol. 
 * Use SHA-256 or stronger hashing functions. 
 * Use 2048-bit strength or stronger RSA keys. 

IBM Security devices define the following convention:  * Strict means complying with SP800-131A by using only protocol TLS v1.2, SHA-256 or stronger hashing functions, and 2048-bit strength or stronger RSA keys. 
 * Compatible means using protocols TLS v1.0, TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2, SHA-1 hashing functions, and 2048-bit RSA key strength. 


SiteProtector 3.0 and greater can be installed in either Strict or Compatible mode. Depending on your deployed devices, there are two encryption scenarios:  * Compatible – SiteProtector supports all devices not configured for the SP800-131A standard 
 * Strict – SiteProtector supports only devices configured for the SP800-131A standard

Note: A mixture of strict and compatible modes is not supported.
