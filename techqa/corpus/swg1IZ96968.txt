   ABSTRACT:             DOC: How to disable TEP LDAP
   Authentication
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   TEP LDAP authentication can't be disabled by just setting
   KFW_LDAP_ENABLED = NO.
   
   disableLDAPRepository.sh has to also be run.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   ITM Documentation only references disableLDAPRepository.sh in
   the troubleshooting guide.  We need to add steps on how to
   disable
   the TEPS LDAP authentication to the Users or Admin Guide.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  run disableLDAPRepository.sh
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Documentation needed to explain how to disable LDAP
   authentication at the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Troubleshooting Guide to the Admin Guide. See the section
   "Disabling LDAP authentication on the portal server"
