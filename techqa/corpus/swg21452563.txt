Title: IBM Setting SelfMonitoring memory events Severity threshold values - United States

Text:
nci; netcool; impact; netcool/impact; selfmonitoring; memory; events; threshold; ratio; severity TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The SelfMonitoring properties of the style "impact.selfmonitoring.severity.5=1.1" are not working. 

CAUSE
The original TechNote reported the syntax to achieve this incorrectly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The correct syntax for the properties is:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


These are to be used in conjunction with the property: 

 * 


in the file: 

 * 


For example: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


and they require an Impact restart to become effective. 

Also when allocating a specific value for memory usage Impact will add an extra 150MB to this in the output reported. The extra 150 MB is overhead and it's just reporting that, even though you've allocated 2000MB, Impact still is expecting 2150MB to function.
