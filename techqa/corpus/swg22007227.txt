 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have R 3.2.2 installed and have installed R Essentials. When I run a stream that has an R syntax node, I get an error that says, "Can not find R plug-in, please install the IBM SPSS R plug-in". 



CAUSE
The R installation path and version of R.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
- Ensure the version of R aligns with the what IBM SPSS Modeler is expecting. This can be determined by generating a compatibility report through this link.

- Install R into a path that does not contain a space. For SPSS Modeler version 18.0 this error may arise when installing SPSS Modeler Essentials for R and R project is installed into a path containing a space (C:\program files).
