QUESTION
 Why does DotScans' VScan not use my rules in Datacap Studio VScan, and how to have VScan choose the images each time? 

CAUSE
A setting in TMweb for VScan Setup is set to a setting that does not use RuleRunner and therefore does not use the rules in Datacap Studio. Manual scans that allow you to choose the folder and amount of pages to scan in, do not run VScan rules

ANSWER
A setting in TMweb for VScan Setup is not set to Default under DotScan settings; follow the instructions below.

In TMweb > VScan > Setup under DotScan, change VScan to Default. Using Default will allow rules to be run on a manual scan. However, you will be unable to select files and number of images to scan in like you would under VScan. 

Note: Making this change will remove your ability to manually select the images to scan in and to select the amount of images to scan in.

Detailed instructions: 

 1. Open up Internet Explorer 
 2. Navigate to localhost/tmweb.net 
 3. Login to desired application 
 4. Select the Administrator tab 
 5. Workflow sub-tab should be selected 
 6. Expand job that is using scan and change VScan to Default
    For example, expanding Main Job
    selecting VScan
    selecting Setup
    scroll down to DotScan
    for User Interface Panel 
    change VScan to Default
    Click Save 
 7. DotScan will now use rules you have assigned to the VScan Task in Datacap Studio
