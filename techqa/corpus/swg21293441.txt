PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM MQ is logging error messages or writing FFSTs (FDC files), and you need to collect MustGather data to find a solution. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions apply only to IBM MQ V9.0 and V8.0, and WebSphere MQ V7.5, V7.1, V7.0 and V6.0 on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and Windows, to IBM MQ V9.0 and V8.0, and WebSphere MQ V7.1, V7.0 and V6.0 on IBM i, and to the IBM MQ V8.0 and WebSphere MQ V7.1 clients for HP Integrity NonStop Server. Refer to the IBM MQ Read First page for instructions on other operating systems:



 * IBM MQ Read First [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21229861]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please answer these questions about the problem and then follow the steps below:



 * What unexpected error messages or FFSTs did you observe on the system?
 * What time did the error messages or FFSTs start and when did they stop?
 * Were there any changes made to the system before the problem started?



STEP 1: GENERATE DATA

If the error message or FFST problem is reproducible or is happening right now, generate data to provide more information about the problem:



 1. 
 2. Generate a trace of the queue manager while error messages or FFSTs are being logged. Consider generating a high detail trace if you have plenty of disk space:
    
     * Linux and UNIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665357]
     * Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666876]
    
     * IBM i [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664990]
     * HP Integrity NonStop Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667396]

 4. 
 5. On Linux and UNIX systems, save the output from the mqconfig command [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21271236]. If you are running IBM MQ V9.0 or V8.0, or WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.2 or later, or V7.1.0.3 or later, the mqconfig command is already available as part of the MQ server installation.
 6. 



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA
 1. 
 2. On UNIX and Linux, place the mqconfig data from Step 1 directly in the top-level MQ errors directory. Both the runmqras automation tool and the manual collection steps below collect files found there.
 3. 
 4. 
 5. Collect data automatically with the runmqras command [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21624944] if you are running IBM MQ V9.0 or V8.0, or WebSphere MQ V7.5, V7.1.0.1 or later, or V7.0.1.8 or later. Be sure to collect the runmqras trace section and the defs section from queue managers, and to specify your PMR number:
 6.  
    COLLECTING RUNMQRAS OUTPUT FROM QUEUE MANAGER QMA
    
    runmqras -section defs,trace -qmlist QMA -pmrno 12345,67R,890 
    
    COLLECTING RUNMQRAS OUTPUT FROM A CLIENT
    
    runmqras -section trace -pmrno 12345,67R,890 
    
 7. 
 8. 
 9. Alternatively, collect the MQ data manually.
    
    COLLECTING MQ DATA MANUALLY
     1.  
     2.  If your system has more than one MQ installation, use the setmqenv command to choose the one with the problem before proceeding:
         
         LINUX AND UNIX
         
         sh> . /path/to/mqm/bin/setmqenv -n InstallationX
         
         WINDOWS
         
         C:\> "C:\ProgramFiles\IBM\MQ\bin\setmqenv" -n InstallationX
         
     3.  
     4.  
     5.  Record the MQ version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621707].
     6.  
     7.  
     8.  Record the operating system version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634678].
     9.  
     10. 
     11. Save the MQ configuration information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621003], for example registry keys and ini files.
     12. 
     13. 
     14. If your system has more than one MQ installation, record your MQ installation details:
         
         LINUX AND UNIX
         
         sh> dspmqinst > /tmp/dspmqinst.txt
         
         WINDOWS
         
         C:\> dspmqinst > %TEMP%/dspmqinst.txt
         
     15. 
     16. 
     17. On MQ V7.1 and later server installations, use dmpmqcfg to record the queue manager configuration:
         
         LINUX AND UNIX
         
         sh> dmpmqcfg -m QMA > /tmp/QMA.config.txt
         
         WINDOWS
         
         C:\> dmpmqcfg -m QMA > %TEMP%\QMA.config.txt
         
         IBM I QSHELL
         
         ===> /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/DMPMQCFG.PGM -m QMA > /tmp/QMA.config.txt
         
     18. 
     19. 
     20. Otherwise, on MQ V7.0 and earlier server installations, use runmqsc to record the queue manager configuration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621085]. If any command gives an error, carry on with the others:
         
         DISPLAY QMGR ALL
         DISPLAY Q(*) ALL
         DISPLAY SUB(*) ALL
         DISPLAY TOPIC(*) ALL
         DISPLAY CHANNEL(*) ALL
         DISPLAY SERVICE(*) ALL
         DISPLAY PROCESS(*) ALL
         DISPLAY LISTENER(*) ALL
         DISPLAY NAMELIST(*) ALL
         
     21. 
     22. 
     23. Manually package your files for IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21671892], including files containing the output from the commands listed in Step 1 and 2.
     24. 
    
    


STEP 3: SEND DATA TO IBM
 1.  
 2.  Send your data to the IBM ECuRep repository [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/send.html] by email to websphere_support@ecurep.ibm.com, by standard or secure HTTP or FTP. or by using the IBM Secure Diagnostic Data Upload Utility (SDDUU) Java application.
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  While the data is transferring, send an email or use the IBM Service Request tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to update your PMR with your description of the problem and of the data you are sending.
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Please do not send data without providing a description!
 9.  
 10. Contact your country representative [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/] if you need to speak to an IBM technical support representative, or in the US call 1-800-IBM-SERV. Refer to the IBM Software Support Handbook [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/handbook/home.html] for more information on working with IBM.
