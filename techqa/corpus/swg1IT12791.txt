APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using either the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS or classes
   for Java and configuring an invalid CCSID value (such as 9000)
   to be used by the Java client, a java.lang.NullPointerException
   is thrown to the application when an attempt to establish a new
   connection is made.  The top of the Java call stack of the
   exception is as follows (there may be differences in line
   numbers depending on the maintenance level of the Java client in
   use):
   
   java.lang.NullPointerException

LOCAL FIX
 *  Only use a valid CCSID value that corresponds to an ASCII
   compliant codeset that is to be used by the WebSphere MQ classes
   for JMS and classes for Java when establishing a connection.
   The default value is 819.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users who have configured an invalid CCSID
   value (that does not represent the CCSID of an ASCII compliant
   codeset) for the WebSphere MQ v7.5 classes for JMS and classes
   for Java clients.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The CCSID used by the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS and classes
   for Java clients, which affects the way in which a queue manager
   translates information in WebSphere MQ headers, can be
   configured.  For WebSphere MQ classes for JMS applications, this
   involves setting the character set CCSID value on a JMS
   ConnectionFactory.  Programmatically this can be achieved using
   the following method:
   
     com.ibm.mq.jms.MQConnectionFactory.setCCSID(int)
   
   As documented in the Knowledge Center:
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.i [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.i]
   bm.mq.javadoc.doc/WMQJMSClasses/com/ibm/mq/jms/MQConnectionFacto
   ry.html?lang=en-us#setCCSID_int_
   
   
   For WebSphere MQ classes for Java applications, the CCSID used
   can be configured by changing the CCSID field on the
   MQEnvironment object.
   
   The default value for both the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS and
   classes for Java is 819 and this value is suitable in the
   majority of situations.
   
   
   When the CCSID value used by either the WebSphere MQ classes for
   JMS and classes for Java clients was configured with an invalid
   value, a connection attempt (e.g., by calling createConnection()
   on an MQConnectionFactory or instantiating an MQQueueManager
   object) resulted in a java.lang.NullPointerException being
   thrown to the application.  This was because the invalid CCSID
   value could not be mapped to a valid Java Character Set,
   resulting in a null internal object.  When attempting to call a
   method on this null object, the java.lang.NullPointerException
   was thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS and classes for Java clients
   have been updated such that, if an invalid CCSID value has been
   configured which does not map to a valid Java character set, the
   default CCSID value of 819 is used instead.  This prevents a
   java.lang.NullPointerException being thrown to the application.
