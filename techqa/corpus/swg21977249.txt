AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
To fully mitigate these vulnerabilities, an additional fix (JR55223) is required for the following product versions:


 * WebSphere Integration Developer V7.0.0.x [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FWebSphere+Integration+Developer&fixids=7.0.0.5-WS-IID-IFJR55223] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V7.5.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=7.5.1.2-WS-IID-IFJR55223] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.0.1.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.0.1.3-WS-IID-IFJR55223] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.0.1-WS-IID-IFJR55223] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.5.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.5.0-WS-IID-IFJR55223] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.6.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.6.0-WS-IID-IFJR55223]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

For IBM Integration Designer V8.5.0.0 and higher, CVE-2015-7575 can be addressed by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required):

1. Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property, for example, jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5
2. Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property, for example, jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA

For versions of IBM Integration Designer earlier than V8.5.0.0 and for WebSphere Integration Developer V7.0.0.x, Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution.
