ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Worklight Stuido in an Eclipse installation that has
   other plugins installed which use the org.apache.commons.io
   package, errors such as this occur:
   
   An internal error occurred during: "Worklight application
   builder".
   loader constraint violation: when resolving method
   "org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.iterateFiles(Ljava/io/File;Lorg
   /apache/commons/io/filefilter/IOFileFilter;Lorg/apache/commons/i
   o/filefilter/IOFileFilter;)Ljava/util/Iterator;"
   the class loader (instance of
   org/eclipse/osgi/internal/baseadaptor/DefaultClassLoader)
   of the current class,
   com/worklight/builder/skins/impl/SkinBuilderImpl,
   and the class loader (instance of
   org/eclipse/osgi/internal/baseadaptor/DefaultClassLoader)
   for resolved class, org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils,
   have different Class objects for the type
   leUtils.iterateFiles(Ljava/io/File;Lorg/apache/commons/io/filefi
   lter/IOFileFilter;Lorg/apache/commons/io/filefilter/IOFileFilter
   ;)Ljava/util/Iterator;
   used in the signature
   
   And the Worklight application can not be built successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Move the commons.io plugin from the Eclipse plugins folder and
   restart Eclipse.  Shut Eclipse down, move the commons.io plugin
   back into the Eclipse plugins folder, and restart Eclipse.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Developers using plugins in Eclipse that use the same 3rd    *
   * party libraries as Worklight Studio.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Worklight Studio is bundling 3rd party libraries and when    *
   * other plugins are installed that use a shared copy of those  *
   * conflicts occur.                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *
