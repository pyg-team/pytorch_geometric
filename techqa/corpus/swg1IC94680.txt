APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a Problem when a lot of records come in at once (or at
   least a lot of activity is monitored); the database seems to
   hit a limit and start over on the seq_num, causing "duplicate
   record" errors.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 388036
   SF / SF
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue: SCC is not pulling all the statistics
   information from C:E/UNIX node on a consistent basis. C:E Unix
   has no way to uniquely identify a statistics record, so SCC
   attempts to cover this by assigning seq numbers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix: Increased the sequence number range (for
   each second) from 10,000 to 100,000 for each CE Unix record
   category (ACD, RCD, OFF) and revised the logic which requests
   stat records from CEU to properly maintain record positioning
   between requests.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX

   information from C:E/UNIX node on a consistent basis.  C:E Unix
   has no way to uniquely identify a statistics record, so SCC
   attempts to cover this by assigning seq numbers.
