APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Maximo 7.1.1.4 SQL server 2005 Web Sphere on windows 2003
   Maximo Transportation
   Development
   
   When using the Move/Modify option from the select menu of the
   asset
   application, I tried to change the attributes of one asset and
   then
   multiple asset.
   By doing so I expected the asset description to change according
   to the
   changes made to its attributes. However the asset description
   did not
   change.
   
   
   
   
   Being reported against the core applications and NOT any
   Transportation
   applications.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Changing the attribute directly from the Specification tab of
   the asset
   does change the description but not when using the move/modify
   window.

   USING THE MOVE/MODIFY ACTION, A CHANGE OF AN ATTRIBUTE DOES NOT
   MODIFY THE ASSET DESCRIPTION.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <Why the description was not changed was because the AssetSet
   was marked NOSAVE when there was no move involved.  If you had
   moved the Asset to a new location and changed one of the
   attribute values, it would have updated the description of the
   Asset.  However, we cannot assume that attribute and custodian
   changes depended on the Asset move changes. Fixed the
   probloem.>
