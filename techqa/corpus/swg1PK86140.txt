ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using Rational Application Developer V7.5.1 and V7.5.2
   Getting multiple ResourceExceptions written to the log during Va
   lidation - ResourceException: Resource does not exist
   
   Log messages that look like this:
   
   org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Resource
   'some resource lcoation' does not exist.
    at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkExists(Unk
   nown Source)
    at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkAccessible
   (Unknown Source)
    at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkAccessible
   AndLocal(Unknown Source)
    at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.setSessionPrope
   rty(Unknown Source)
    at org.eclipse.wst.validation.internal.ValManager.putValPropert
   y(Unknown Source)
   
   Found that this workaround can/may clear the validation errors:
   
   1. Run Validation on all projects till no errors (typically 5+ t
   imes)
   2. Do Project Clean on all projects (at least twice)
   3. restart RAD
   4. sometime the workspace will be now be without validation erro
   rs
   If not go back to 1. and repeat till no validation errors.
   
   This can take up two hours out of their development day.
   It affects all of the clients development machines randomly (eve
   ry 2 weeks or every 2 days) on large 2 GB workspace
