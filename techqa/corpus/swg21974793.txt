Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in MD5 Signature and Hash Algorithm affects IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor (CVE-2015-7575) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The MD5 “SLOTH” vulnerability on TLS 1.2 affects IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank] 

DESCRIPTION:The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.1 

CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank]for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.2
IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.1
IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v4.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
For IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.2: 

To avoid the described security issues the following configuration changes are required:
Edit the file <ECM-SM-InstallationDirectory>/jre/lib/security/java.security on each ECM-SM server
1) Add MD5 to jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms - e.g.jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5
2) Add MD5withRSA to jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768,MD5
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the MD5 signature hash will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 signature hash and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.


For IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor v5.1 & v4.5 :

To avoid the described security issues the following configuration changes are required:
Edit the file <InstallationDirectory>/jre/lib/security/java.security on each ECM-SM / FSM server
1) Add MD5 to jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms - e.g.jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5
2) Add MD5withRSA to jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768,MD5

Edit the files <InstallationDirectory>/gui/cfg/gui-cfg.xml and <InstallationDirectory>/server/cfg/server-start.xml on the FSM / ECM-SM server and add or adjust the following line to the file right after the entry <arg value="-Djava.awt.headless=true"/>)
<arg value="-Dhttps.cipherSuites=SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA"/>

Edit the files <InstallationDirectory>/gui/cfg/finca-cfg.xml and <InstallationDirectory>/server/cfg/finca-cfg.xml on the FSM / ECM-SM server and insert the following block to the file right after the end of the <security>-Tag:
<hashcodeservice>
<algorithm name="SHA-1"/> 
</hashcodeservice>


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the MD5 signature hash will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 signature hash and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
