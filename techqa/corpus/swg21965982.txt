QUESTION
 How to interprete IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports related to Hypervisors ? 

ANSWER
If you want to find out the support requirement and compatibility of DB2 produce on Virtualization Hypervisor environment, you can find on Hypervisors supported by a specific product [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/vesForProduct.html] page.
Following picture is the example of searching for a specific DB2 version and edition.
And for the first search filters, you can check the operating system(O/S) type.
These operating system is the target O/S where DB2 will be installed.

NOTE : Usually there is two hypervisors types which is native bare metal and hosted.
( For the detail information, refer to the hypervisors wiki page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor]. )

And the operating system on this page does not mean the host O/S and hypervisor layer software.

From the generated PDF document, you will see the section on left window like below picture.
The top section is 'Hypervisors' but the listed O/S at third top section also means the final target O/S where DB2 will be installed as the result of search filters from above page.
Under each O/S item, the various supported hypervisors are listed up including bare metal and hosted hypervisors.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21965982&amp;aid=2]

For example, on AIX WPAR is the operating system level virtualization technology and PowerVM provides the virtualization of adapters and storage subsystems to the target AIX O/S from other logical partitions.
Regarding Linux, VMWare ESXi is bare metal type and Microsoft Hyper-V is a type of the hosted hypervisors.

Therefore when you refer the document, select the target O/S for DB2 installation and the hypervisor you are using or planning to use.
