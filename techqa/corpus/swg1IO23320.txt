IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1 Fix Pack 4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FDatacap+Taskmaster+Capture&fixids=8.1.0.4-Datacap-Taskmaster-WIN-FP004&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1) If I add images to the \Images folder, the MVScan would keep
   adding images to the batch as long as the wait_time is not
   reached.  This works as expected.
   2) If I create a sub folder under the \Images folder, for
   example: ..\Images\Test, MVSCan would complete the scanning but
   does not wait based on the "set_wait_time" hence any new images
   coming into the sub folders are not being picked up and added to
   the batch.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * apply updated mvscan.dll + mvscan.rrx modules                *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  updated mvscan.dll in tree mode, set_min_age prevents ingesting
   any files in folder until all are aged enough
