APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A class in Apache Commons FileUpload contains code that triggers
   code execution as part of deserialization. The Apache Commons
   FileUpload library exists in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)
   and makes this class available on the class path. If any code in
    IBM BPM deserializes Java objects from an ObjectInputStream,
   this code is vulnerable to remote code execution.
   Deserialization can occur implicitly in various data handlers
   and even explicitly in your own code in your process
   applications.
   
   CVEID: CVE-2016-1000031
   DESCRIPTION: Apache Commons FileUpload, as used in Novell NetIQ
   Sentinel and other products, could allow a remote attacker to
   execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by deserialization
   of untrusted data in DiskFileItem class of the FileUpload
   library. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
   execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
