VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2017-6056 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6056]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a programming error in the servlet and JSP engine. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/122312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-5647 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647]
Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the processing of pipelined requests in send file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the wrong response.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124400] for more information

CVEID: CVE-2016-6816 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-8735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error in the JmxRemoteLifecycleListener. By sending specially crafted data to a JMX port, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119157 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119157] for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2016-0762 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762]
DESCRIPTION:Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to process the user supplied password if the specified user name does not exist by the Realm implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct a timing attack and determine valid usernames on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118407 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118407]for the current score
