 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed SPSS for Windows successfully and attached the dongle to the parallel/USB port. Upon launch of SPSS, I encounter the following alert:

The current license does not permit this job to continue.

When I click OK, the following error is reported in the SPSS Viewer:

Error # 2063
The hardware key device driver was not found. Please verify that the
correct device driver has been installed.
This command not executed.

What is the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The above error indicates that the driver for the dongle has not been installed properly. 

Please do the following to correct the problem:
If you are using Windows or Linux, you need to install the system drivers. These steps are not
necessary if you are using Mac OS.
- Browse to the \Sentinel\SystemDriver directory on the Disk 2 CD-ROM.
For Windows: Double-click the executable (.exe file) located in that directory and follow the
instructions that appear on the screen.
For Linux. Untar the file to a temporary directory and run the extracted install script.
- Attach the hardware key to any USB port or any parallel printer port of your computer.

For versions prior to 17,
- Browse to the \Sentinel\SystemDriver directory on the CD-ROM.
- Double-click the executable (.exe file) located in that directory.
- Then follow the instructions that appear on the screen.
- Attach the hardware key to any USB port or any parallel printer port of an IBM-compatible
computer.
Note for the 25-pin connector: If you are using the 25-pin connector hardware key and there are
several devices or hardware keys to be attached to the same port (cascaded), the hardware key
should be first in line, attached to the port of the computer. This hardware key may not work
correctly if other devices or hardware keys are between it and the computer. The hardware key
will not interfere with a printer or other devices attached to the same port. If the computer is
close to a wall or other obstacle, you can attach an extension cable to the port, and then attach
the hardware key to the cable. Use a straight-through DB-25 male-to-DB-25 female cable. Be
sure that all 25 pins are connected
