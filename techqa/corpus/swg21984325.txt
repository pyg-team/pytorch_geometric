RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Technote provides the solution using JDBC driver as an example. This apply for any driver that can be used for the connectivity to any supported datasource.

In Preferences, under Data Management, Connectivity, there are a number of drivers available. Please add available driver(s) to the list and check if after this the JDBC driver drop-down menu is populated.
Actually you can add some newer version of the JDBC driver (newer that the version we ship with the Data Studio product). 

You can find steps to add the JDBC driver to the list of drivers from the following technote:
