ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Debugging CICS MicroFocus COBOL program with animator fails on
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Debugging CICS MicroFocus COBOL program with animator fails on
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Micro Focus COBOL Animator functionality was not working
   with TXSeries for debugging CICS-COBOL applications on Windows
   platform.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix requires changes from both Micro Focus COBOL and
   TXSeries code. The TXSeries code has been fixed through this
   APAR. In addition to this APAR you need to apply the MF COBOL
   hot fix RPI 1079882 for enabling debugging feature through
   Animator.
