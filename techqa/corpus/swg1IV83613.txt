APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Hybrid gateway is used in an ITM environment to bridge
   data from itmv6 to APM v8, excessive cpu in the IBM Tivoli
   Portal's ewas will occur when sending data from ITM6 to APMv8.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None. Internal defect 216549 was opened to address this
   performance problem. This apar will reference that internal
   defect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the Hybrid Gateway feature of APM 8.x is used to connect an
    APM 8.x system to ITM, the CPU utilization of the Tivoli
   Enterprise Portal Server can spike, possibly affecting the
   throughput of other ITM workloads associated flowing through the
    Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server.
   
   
   This CPU utilization problem can sometimes be observed when the
   Hybrid Gateway is used to retrieve agent metric information from
   agents at different version levels.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The APAR fix optimizes the algorithm used by the Tivoli
   Monitoring Dashboard Data Provider component supporting metric
   requests to agents at different version levels.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0007
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The only workaround that would not require this APAR fix to be
   applied would be to ensure that all of the Tivoli Monitoring
   agents being polled by the Hybrid Gateway are at the same
   version level within their respective application family.
