QUESTION
How does IBM Rational ClearCase clearmake decide among several equivalent candidate derived objects (DOs), which one to winkin during a new build? This technote answers whether shared DOs are preferred over unshared and whether newer DOs are preferred over older DOs.

ANSWER
 

Clearmake [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m1/topic/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ref.doc/topics/clearmake.htm]will shop for DOs in the following way:


 * A shared DO [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_admin.doc/topics/c_typeadm_shrdo.htm]is preferred to an equivalent unshared DO.
   
 * A more recent DO is preferred to an equivalent older DO. 
   


So if there are two shareable DOs, DO1 and DO2, here are the possible scenarios and resulting winkin [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ref.doc/topics/ct_winkin.htm]order:  *  DO1 is shared and DO2 unshared: DO1 would be winked-in, regardless of whether 
   DO2 is newer or older than DO1.
   Both DO1 and DO2 are shared: Whichever is newer is winked-in.
   Both DO1 and DO2 are unshared: Whichever is newer is winked-in.
