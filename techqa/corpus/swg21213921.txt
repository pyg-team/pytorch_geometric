QUESTION
 The ITIM API's can be run on a different WebSphere Application Server than where the ITIM Server Application is run. If there is a firewall between the two WebSphere Application Servers, what ports must be open to allow for successful communications? 

ANSWER
There are two ports that must be opened: 

 1. The IIOP Port as defined for the Client WebSphere Server 
 2. The ORB Listener Port as defined for the WebSphere Server where the ITIM Server Application is found


Identifying the IIOP port is simple. This is the BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS port as defined in the <WAS_HOME>/AppServer/config/cells/<cell>/nodes/<node>/serverindex.xml file for the WebSphere Application Server where the Client Application is installed. 

But identifying the ORB Listener Port is not as simple. This is because by default, this port is assigned dynamically at WebSphere Application Server start-up time for the WebSphere Application Server where the ITIM Server is installed. Thus, it is dynamic and changes from start-up to start-up. 

To specify a fixed port assignment for the ORB Listener Port, you would use the WebSphere Admin Console and do the following: 

 1. Go to the Servers -> Application Servers and select the server that you want to specify the fixed port assignment for. Again, this would be the server where the ITIM Server Application is installed. 
 2. In the Additional Properties, go to "End Points" ("Ports" for WAS 6.x). 
 3. First of all, make sure that the End Point of ORB_LISTENER_ADDRESS is already not defined. 
 4. If it is not, select NEW. From here, specify the End Point name as ORB_LISTENER_ADDRESS, the Host as "*" and the Port as any unused port. 
 5. Click OK 
 6. Save the WebSphere Configuration 
 7. Restart the WebSphere Application Server


If you review the <WAS_HOME>/AppServer/config/cells/<cell>/nodes/<node>/serverindex.xml file on the WebSphere Application Server where the ITIM Server Application is installed, you will see that the ORB_LISTENER_ADDRESS has been added. Now it's just a matter of opening up the two ports through the firewall.
