APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - After a JMS application has created the durable subscription,
   the queue manager is shut down and restarted.
   - The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS detect this and throw a
   JMSException to the application.
   - The application reconnects to the queue manager, and attempts
   to reopen the durable subscription.
   - The durable subscription is reopened successfully.
   
   - The queue manager is then stopped and restarted again.
   - Once again, the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS detect that the
   queue manager has been stopped and throw a JMSException back to
   the application.
   - The application reconnects to the queue manager, and tries to
   open the durable subscription for a third time.
   - This time, the attempt to open the durable subscription fails
   and the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS throw a JMSException
   containing the WebSphere MQ Reason Code 3155:
   
       MQRCCF_SUBSCRIPTION_IN_USE
   
     back to the application.
   
   A queue manager trace will show

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of WebSphere MQ V8 queue managers with JMS applications
   which open durable subscriptions and attempt to reconnect to the
   subscription following queue manager restart.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If a JMS application opens a durable subscription to a queue
   manager and that queue manager terminates then the application
   could only reconnect to that durable subscription the first
   time.  A coding error prevented the queue manager from accepting
   the request to reopen after subsequent terminations, returning
   rc=3155 (MQRCCF_SUBSCRIPTION_IN_USE).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ queue manager code that handles reconnection requests has
   been corrected to allow multiple reconnection attempts for
   durable subscriptions.
