Title: IBM Installation Issue: Patching Sterling B2B Integrator Fails Because of Custom Database Index - United States

Text:
Install failure; patch; upgrade; ORA-01418: specified index does not exist; Failed to execute: DROP INDEX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Sterling B2B Integrator: Unable to install 5.2.6.x interim fix on existing 5.2.x due to custom database index added to SB2BI database. 

SYMPTOM
[saneSqlExec] Executing resource: /var/opt/IBM/SI-5.2.6/install/repository/scripts/EFrame_IndexDrops.sql 

[saneSqlExec] Failed to execute: DROP INDEX IDX$XXXXX
[saneSqlExec] java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01418: specified index does not exist
[saneSqlExec] 24 of 25 SQL statements executed successfully


CAUSE
The initial error is:
[saneSqlExec] Executing resource: /var/opt/IBM/SI-5.2.6/install/repository/scripts/EFrame_IndexDrops.sql
[saneSqlExec] Failed to execute: DROP INDEX IDX$XXXXX
[saneSqlExec] java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01418: specified index does not exist

This is causing the patch to fail out.

The patch is failing trying to remove the index IDX$XXXXX. 
This is not one of our indexes and most likely it was added by the database administrator (DBA) or others. From the name it's probably one that was suggested by one of the Oracle tools. It is fine, but the patch is having a problem dropping it.

This is a custom index created by the customer and not from
our out of the box install. It is deemed proprietary to the customer.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the Installxxxxxxxxxx.log from the Sterling B2B Integrator log location.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
We suggest having the DBA restore the database and then look at that index. Make sure that the Oracle account that Sterling B2B Integrator is using has permission to see that index. You may want to consider just dropping the index entirely and adding it back in if needed after applying the patch.
