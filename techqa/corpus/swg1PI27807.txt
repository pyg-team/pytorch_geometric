APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running your CICS region and attempting to use a CMCI
   connection and connect with the CICS Explorer. When you attempt
   to connect, you receive the following message in the CICS
   Explorer
   .
   IZE0106E Connect failed with error "Not Found"
   .
   In the CICS region, you receive a message similar to the
   following:
   .
   DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset
             X'FFFFFFFF' in module DFHWUIPG.
   .
   The S0C4 actually error occurred in program DFHTRPX on a MVCL
   R10,R14. In DFHTRPX, we'd have been trying to move parms from a
   call to write a trace entry. The parm we'd have been dealing
   with was DATA7. So DFHTRPX got called with the TRPT_DATA7_X
   existence bit turned on, and apparently there isn't a DATA7 to
   put out.
   .
   If the MVCL doesn't actually cause an S0C4, you may also
   receive a DFHTR0112 abend with an Overlength Entry message.
   .

   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all System Managed Single Servers      *
   *                 must be recycled to pick up the new code.    *
   *                 Note that the restarts do not need to be     *
   *                 done at the same time.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   Module DFHWURSF is called when connecting the IBM CICS Explorer
   to SMSS regions using CMCI connection. If component WU trace
   level 2 is on, when attempting to connect, module DFHWURSF calls
   trace put routine to write out summary trace entry. The trace
   put routine expects seven pairs of parameters, however, only six
   pairs of parameters are passed. Unpredicatable storage is
   referenced as the seventh parameter, which causes problems,
   including, but not limited to, AKEA/S0C4 abends or exception
   trace entry with POINT_ID('A3B9').
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Module DFHWURSF has been updated to pass seven pairs of parame-
   ters when calling trace put routine.
