   ################################################################
   
   Task Name: Configure Event Adapter
   Task Endpoint: systemX_X20_00 (mySAPAppServer)
   Return Code: 1
   ------Standard Output------
   ABH0711I Log file created:
   "/opt/Tivoli/lcf/a/dat/1/LCFNEW/ABH/logs/trace_configure_event_a
   dapter_1 598.log".

   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   Start the 'Configure Event Adapter' task and try to change any
   setting for the CCMS adapter.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Change the shell script 'sap_configure_event_adapter.sh' at
   the managed node:
   Change line 51 and add one more line of code:
   
   51c51,52
   <         "$CCMS_AlertRed" "$CCMS_AlertYellow"
   ---
   >         "$CCMS_AlertRed" "$CCMS_AlertYellow" \
   >         "$MessageServer" "$SAPLogonGroup"
   
   2. Update the ITM task with the changed shell script:
   wsettask -t "Configure Event Adapter" -l "mySAP Configuration
   Tasks" -r r3_senior:r3_admin -i default <MANAGED_NODE_NAME>
   /usr/local/Tivoli/bin/generic_unix/TME/ABH/sh/sap_configure_even
   t_adapte r.sh
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The sap_common_adapter_edit.sh shipped with
   5.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0018 contained changes for the
   SAP Logon Group and message server support for the CCMS adapter,
   however the remaining supporting files were not included.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle:
