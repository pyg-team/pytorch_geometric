PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 8 *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Channel authentication records          *
   *                      with invalid profile names may          *
   *                      be created.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Attempting to create a Channel Authentication record with
   a profile name that is prefixed by blanks or consists
   entirely of blanks succeeds.
   
   The rules for naming MQ objects states that leading blanks
   are not permitted for names so the attempt to define a
   Channel Authentication record with such a name should fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Processing has been amended to ensure that attempts to define
   Channel Authentication records with profile names containing
   leading blanks are rejected.
