Title: IBM How to temporarily disable Extended FAP (for troubleshooting purposes) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer gets an error when trying to run an Initial Publish.

To try to troubleshoot this, IBM Support has asked the customer to temporarily disable the 'Extended FAP', and instead simply perform a 'standard' FAP publish.

How can the customer disable extended FAP, and (instead) change the system to only run a 'standard' FAP publish? 

CAUSE
For more information about Extended FAP, see separate IBM Technote #1960923.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IMPORTANT: Extended FAP is a customisable method of modifying FAP in order to meet the exact needs of the customer. 

 * Therefore, every customer's implementation (of Extended FAP) will be slightly different.


For this reason, it is impossible to give perfect instructions that will exactly match each customer's environment.  * Therefore, the instructions below may need to be amended slightly for your implementation.


Steps: 
1. Launch TM1 Architect 
2. Expand your cube (for example 'DemoV2') 
3. Expand 'Processes' 
4. Locate the first process (alphabetically) which starts 'CCR_IP': 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991785&amp;aid=1] 

5. Double-click on this process (for example: ccr_ip_after_A1 ) 
 * 
 *  Specifically, these processes are told to execute after the FAP process finishes publishing security (on the initial publish), but before it starts trickling data. 


6. Click on the tab: Advanced 
7. Click on the tab: Prolog 

8. Add a character '#' at the beginning of the 'execute' command, for example: 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21991785&amp;aid=2] 

9. Save changes 

10.. Test (perform an initial publish). 

NOTE: The Initial Publish will now probably work OK.  * However, your customised ("extended") FAP cube will now have been replaced with a 'standard' FAP cube. Therefore, your custom reports will no longer work 
 * However, by performing the above tasks you will have proved that the Extended FAP process was the one that was causing the initial publish to fail.
