APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an IBM Content Collector task route is configured to archive
   email or files with the DocumentTitle property mapping set to an
   expression that is not guaranteed unique, FileNet P8 Content
   Engine performance might be degraded during archival if the
   document is also filed into a folder. A warning like the
   following appears in the FileNet P8 Content Engine error logs:
   
   ENG FNRCE0000W - WARN The filing operation with containment
   name 'RTF_except apatite side ' is experiencing high numbers of
   uniqueness violations (XXX). This indicates the application is
   using non-unique containment names in a manner contrary to the
   auto-unique feature's intention and should be modified
   accordingly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If an IBM Content Collector task route is configured to archive
   email or files with the DocumentTitle property mapping set to an
   expression that is not guaranteed unique, FileNet P8 Content
   Engine performance might be degraded during archival when
   documents are filed into folders.
   The performance degradation occurs during archival because
   exceptions are generated on the P8 Content Engine server if too
   many containment name collisions occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 2.2.0.3 LA008 and
   IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 3, the P8 File
   Document in Folder task was changed to attempt to generate a
   unique FileNet P8 containment name to use in conjunction with
   the built-in P8 Content Engine autounique containment naming. A
   unique GUID is generated and appended to the first 15
   characters of the document's Name property value to guarantee
   unique containment names for each object. If the Name
   property value consists of less than 15 characters, the full
   name is used. Thus, the risk of naming collisions and therefore
   the need for autounique naming are reduced, minimizing the risk
   of performance degradation.
