APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   The mediation flow engine parses the component flow at runtime
   and if a wires source and target terminals have different types
   then an exception occurs:
   
   Caused by:
   com.ibm.ws.sibx.scax.mediation.model.loader.EFlowSimplifierExcep
   tion:
   
   CWSXM4013E: Error parsing the Mediation Flow definition:
   Terminal types do not match.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.2 and v7.0   *
   *                 who wish to implement subflows with          *
   *                 different types on the input and output.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The mediation flow engine parses the    *
   *                      component flow at runtime               *
   *                      and if a wire's source and target       *
   *                      terminals have different types          *
   *                      then a runtime exception will occur:    *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   *                      Due to weakly typed schema support      *
   *                      and subflows it is beneficial           *
   *                      to surpress this exception from         *
   *                      causing the flow to terminate           *
   *                      as in many situations processing        *
   *                      could continue without any              *
   *                      issues.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If for example you attempt to invoke a subflow that has
   undefined inputs and outputs a runtime exception will occur.
   This APAR is required to enable the runtime to surpress this
   exception from causing the flow to terminate.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the protection around
   different types has been removed
   
   There are no known side effects associated with this fix. This
   code fix was targeted to be included in the following fix
   pack:
         6.2.0 Fix Pack 4 (v6.2.0.4)
         7.0.0 Fix Pack 2 (v7.0.0.2)
