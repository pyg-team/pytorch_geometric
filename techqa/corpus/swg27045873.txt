v2101rlsnotes RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 When using the System Monitoring shared service in external mode, the Monitoring Agent for DB2 application support files are not automatically installed into enterprise ITM servers. 

CONTENT
Problem: The Monitoring Agent for DB2 Version 7.1 shipped in the DB2 agent plug-in does not currently support the self-describing agent (SDA) feature. Consequently, when using the System Monitoring shared service in external mode, the agent application support files cannot be automatically uploaded and installed into the upstream enterprise ITM servers (for example, HubTEMS and TEPS).

Resolution: Manually install the IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) for DB2 Version 7.1 application support files on the HubTEMS/TEPS in the enterprise ITM infrastructure.
