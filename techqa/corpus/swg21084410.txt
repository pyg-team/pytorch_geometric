QUESTION
In Notes, a user attempts to delete a hierarchical certificate, however, the "Delete from ID file" option is unavailable (grayed out).

ANSWER
This issue has been reported to Lotus Quality Engineering; however it was determined not to be a software problem. Notes is functioning as designed. 
You can delete flat certificates and Internet certificates from your User ID. You cannot delete your Notes hierarchical certificates.

To delete certificates from your User ID in R6.x:
1. Choose File -> Security -> User Security.
2. Click Your Identity -> Your Certificates.
3. Select "All Certificates" from the drop-down list.
4. Select the certificate you want to delete, and choose Other Actions -> Delete from ID file on the right side of the dialog box. Note: If you are not allowed to delete the selected certificate, "Delete from ID file" is grayed out. 

To delete certifcates from your User ID in R5.x:
1. Choose File -> Tools -> User ID.
2. Choose Certificates.
3. Click the Delete button. Note: If you are not allowed to delete the selected certificate, the Delete button is grayed out.
