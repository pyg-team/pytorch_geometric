SUMMARY
 OpenSource GNU Glibc is used by IBM Netezza Host Management. IBM Netezza Host Management has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-8776 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8776]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service. By passing out-of-range time values to the strftime function, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault or obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Netezza Host Management 5.4.1.2 - 5.4.9.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Mitigation of the reported CVE for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) applies to the following platforms only: 
PureData System for Analytics N1001
IBM Netezza High Capacity Appliance C1000
IBM Netezza 1000 
IBM Netezza 100

Inspect and qualify time values before they are passed to strftime, or preferably call strftime only with struct tm values computed by gmtime or localtime. 

Programmers should qualify each time value specifically passed to the strftime function. Use strftime only with a second parameter qualified value such as localtime or gmtime. See the following example: 

strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S", localtime())
