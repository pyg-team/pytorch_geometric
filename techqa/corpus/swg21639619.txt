Title: IBM SDK Active Report outputFormat to be set to HTML only - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do I receive a failure message when SDK API is requesting the output format of MHT for an Active Report ? 

CAUSE
It is impossible to select any other type of output format than HTML for an Active Report, both in Cognos Connection and via the SDK.

ANSWER
 The SDK is a Software API used with the Cognos System, and provides parameters and options within the code to select any type of output format for any report. 

When within the code any other format than HTML is selected, and the code is run to retrieve the output from an Active Report, you will receive an Error or Exception in that request.
The only outputFormat supported with an Active Report is HTML, and this should be selected for outputFormat value through the SDK.

Active Reports were first introduced with IBM Cognos 10.1.X. In that system the output is shown to be HTML. In Cognos 10.2.X the output is shown to be XHTML as this is Extended HTML.
In both cases the output delivered in a file will be in MHT format, which is MHTML a web archive format, and stands for Mime HTML, the native format internally for Cognos Connection run and delivered reports to a Browser user.

Please find attached a link to the Mime Retrieval of Report Output with the SDK, that has been modified to do this for an Active Report as well.
To be able to run the code , modify Dispatcher URL, Logon information and Report searchPath appropriately.
