ABSTRACT
 Apple has announced that starting February 1, 2015, all new iOS applications uploaded to the app store must include 64-bit support. Interim fixes address this requirement. 

CONTENT
The following Apple announcement [https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=10202014a] affects customers who intend to build applications to be uploaded to the App Store: 
Starting February 1, 2015, new iOS apps uploaded to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8.1 SDK, included in Xcode 6.1 or later. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code. 

IBM has already released IBM Worklight interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684538] to support iOS SDK 8.1. The IBM Worklight Platform has support to build native 64-bit iOS applications starting with V6.2 and IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation V6.3 includes the support for hybrid applications as well. 

If you are building 64-bit native/hybrid applications with IBM Worklight Versions 6.0 or 6.1, or IBM Worklight Foundation 6.2, the interim fixes are now available. After you apply these fixes, you must rebuild your applications. The interim fixes are available for download from IBM Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]. 

After installing the interim fixes, there are two approaches to make this effective for existing applications: 

 * (Preferred approach): Delete and Add the iPad/iPhone environment to the application and rebuild. 
   
   
 * If there is a custom iPhone/iPad native code and you do not want to remove/add the environments, then delete the Frameworks directory, which is located under the apps/iphone/native or apps/ipad/native directory, and rebuild the project.

The interim fix actually adds the support for arm64. The following screen shot show the valid architectures that are supported:

Additional Information  * For IBM Worklight V5.0.6 and earlier, upgrade to V6.0 or later (preferably to the latest version). 
   Note: IBM does not intend to support 64-bit code for IBM Worklight V5.0.x releases. If you are using older versions and intending to build new iOS applications to be uploaded to Apple App Store, you need to migrate to V6.x to comply with Apple mandatory guidelines 
 * For IBM Worklight V6.0.x, the Teamleaf client library does not support iOS 64-bit code. You need to remove the Tealeaf library in the IBM Worklight-generated Xcode project if Tealeaf is not used in the application. After applying the interim fix, you can remove the Tealeaf library by completing the following steps:  1. Remove Tealeaf/libTLFLib.a 
    2. Go to wlprojWlappIphone-Info.plist or the equivalent file in your project. That file depends on the project and application name chosen; in the example, the project name is 'wlproj' and the application name is 'wlapp'. 
    3. Remove the following key and value pair: Principal class | TLFApplication.
