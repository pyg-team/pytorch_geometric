Chapter 1: Introduction to your WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Machine Type 9235, 4195, 7199 and 7198. 

These technotes are provided to help you reference materials in our product library to perform the basic installation and configuration of the Machine Type, M/T, 9235, 4195, 7198, and 7199 WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance. In this document you will find suggestions, worksheets, and examples. 

On opening the shipping carton you will notice that this is an appliance and not a computer or server. IBM® WebSphere® DataPower SOA Appliances are powerful business solutions, which represent an important element in IBM's holistic approach to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). These appliances are purpose-built hardware ESB for simplified deployment and hardened security. IBM SOA appliances are easy-to-deploy network devices that simplify, help secure, and accelerate your XML and Web services deployments while extending your SOA infrastructure. These new appliances offer an innovative, pragmatic approach to harness the power of SOA while simultaneously enabling you to leverage the value of your existing application, security, and networking infrastructure investments. 

You will notice that the M/T 92335 appliance is in a sealed case. The appliance is a highly secure, tamper-resistant device. One of the security features is that the case is sealed with a limited number of customer replaceable parts (Customer Replaceable Units, CRU). The M/T 7198 and 7199 case is not sealed as there a few parts which can be replaced by and IBM SSR. The intrusion detection can be disabled and enabled as required to allow for service. 

Important: Opening or tampering with the M/T 9235 case triggers tamper detection features and the appliance will no longer operate. As a reminder the appliance has a label noting "Warranty Void if Removed". This label would have to removed or torn to open the appliance case. This protects your business solution and keeps your warranty intact. 

In Chapter 8 of this document we will describe how the appliance is supported as a business solution by IBM software support. The IBM WebSphere DataPower team provides a "single point of contact" to debug problems with the appliance including the appliance chassis and Customer Replaceable parts (CRU parts). This document has links to important additional information on the web. 

Be sure to review our document on critical actions and updates for the latest information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2362&uid=swg21390112] before setting up your appliance.
