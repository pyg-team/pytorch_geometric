QUESTION
 Are items that are marked as "Noise" in IBM Security AppScan Standard included in the results of the XML export? If so, are there tags in the XML that distinguish which items are "Noise"? 

ANSWER
Yes, items marked as noise are included in the export, and each issue has a tag attribute called Noise with either a False or True value.
This example shows a tag with the True attribute:
