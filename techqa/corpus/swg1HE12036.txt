APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an IBM Content Collector cluster with more than two nodes is
   running in a VMware environment, the IBM Content Collector
   installer and the afuClusterTool might not be able to detect
   other cluster nodes and add them automatically. If the nodes are
    added to the cluster manually, configuration host failover does
    not work.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the virtual machines are configured to use an E1000 NIC
   adapter, try configuring them to use a VMXNET 3 adapter instead.
    Depending on the VMware environment, this might fix the
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the configuration backup host in an IBM Content Collector
   cluster detects that the configuration host is no longer
   visible, the configuration backup host takes over if it can see
   a majority of other nodes in the cluster. To check this, the
   configuration backup host exchanges multicast packages with the
   other nodes in the cluster. If this packet exchange is not
   possible because multicast network traffic is being dropped, the
    configuration backup host does not take over for the
   configuration host.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0 Fix Pack 2, the
   configuration backup host uses TCP instead of multicast when
   attempting to contact the other nodes in the cluster.
