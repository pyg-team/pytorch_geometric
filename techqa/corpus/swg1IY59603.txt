ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description: Unable to manage LDAPx accounts. When
   loggin in as
   a regular ITIM user that manages an LDAPX account, you are
   unable to
   change the password and do other changes to the account even
   though an
   ACI is in place granting all permissions. In fact the account
   doesn't
   even show up under 'Manage Passwords' at all. To debug this
   issue both
   I and the customer ran DocTool and when we looked at the ACI for
   the
   LDAPX account type the only attribute given read/write
   permissions was
   'labeleduri'. Even though the GUI shows all permissions being
   granted.
   Customer Recreate: See steps below.
   Desired Behavior: That ACI permit ITIM users to manage their
   LDAPX
   accounts.
   Your Steps to Duplicate:
   1. Install LDAPX agent 4.5.5 build 4.5.1011
   2. Install profile on ITIM server. I recreated on 4.5.1 FP16
   IF19
   3. Go to 'My Organization'->'Control Access'. Then 'Add' a new
   ACI.
   4. Select 'Account' and then make the Customer Class '
   XLdapAccount'.
   6. IN the ACI make the scope 'Subtree', under operation grant
   everything
   and under 'Attribute Permissions' grant everything for read and
   write.
   7. Make sure "Allow Self' is set to 'Yes' and then save.
   8. Do recon to get accounts with the agent and then adopt orphan
   account
   to an ITIM user.
   9. Login as the ITIM user that adopted one of thes LDAPX
   accounts.
   10. You should not see the account under manage passwords, you
   may see
   it undermanage accounts.
   11. Run DocTool and then look at the info for the ACI you
   created.It
   will show that only the 'labeleduri' attribue has any
   permissions set.

LOCAL FIX
 *  s13213
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   This is a documentation change for the ITIM
   Configuration Guide.  Please use the following information:
   The "CustomLabels.properties" in "$ITIM_HOME\Data" folder needs
   to be modified to correct this problem.  The LDAPX Agent has
   two password attributes, erpassword and userpassword.  Only one
   exists in the CustomLabels.properties file  To correct the
   problem, edit the CustomLabels.properties file in
   <ITIM_HOME>\Data" folder and find the line:
   userpassword=Password           and change that to:
   userpassword=User Password      also look for the line
   erpassword=Password             and ensure erpassword=Password
   Note: The solution shown above has been provided only for the
   English language. If a different language pack is installed on
   the system, then user needs to edit the
   words to accomodate the language used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   The ITIM Configuration Guide will be updated
   to provide the configuration information needed.
