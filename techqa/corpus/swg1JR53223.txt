APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V8.5.6, the
   /rest/bpm/wle/v1/processApps REST API requires admin rights to
   query for the process application data. Before IBM BPM V8.5.6,
   all IBM BPM users had access to this API.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This change on IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 might cause application failures
    that have been migrated from previous IBM BPM versions.
   Previously, all users could call this API to query for process
   application data and parse the response for further processing.
   However now runtime non-admin users no longer have access to
   obtain that information and might experience unexpected runtime
   exceptions.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0. With the fix applied,
   if you enable the enforce-rest-admin-auth property, users in
   the admin group can use the processApps API on an IBM Process
   Server environment only. On an IBM Process Center environment
   only, users who are part of the admin group or part of the
   project authoring group can use the processApps API. By default,
    this property is disabled (false) and all authenticated IBM BPM
    users have access to this API. This is the behavior on versions
    earlier than IBM BPM V8.5.6.0.
