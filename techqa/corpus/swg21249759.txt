PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Review the list of JTZU known problems and workarounds. If you do not find a solution to your problem, follow the instructions to collect the information that will be needed for further assistance. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

Common JTZU problems 


 * JTZU failed to update a single JVM on Windows 
 * JTZU cannot find JTZU.jar 
 * JTZU exits with the message 'TimeZone info not found' 
 * JTZU fails to load a library, either <something>.lib or <something>.a 
 * JTZU fails to patch a VM, the log reports failure to copy 'TimeZone.class' 
 * After running JTZU under superuser permissions, a lower-privileged user can not use the SDK or JRE

Note: IBM SDK, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0 is no longer supported unless you have an extended support contract with IBM. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

JTZU failed to update a single JVM on Windows 

 * 
 * 
 * 



JTZU cannot find JTZU.jar  * 



JTZU exits with the message 'TimeZone info not found'  * 
 *  JTZU is not installed correctly. There should be a TimeZoneInfo sub-directory within the JTZU installation directory. If the TimeZoneInfo sub-directory is missing, re-install JTZU. Check that your extract tool is set to extract sub-directories. You are not running JTZU using runjtzu.bat (Microsoft速 Windows速) or runjtzu.sh (other platforms). This script sets up the correct environment for JTZU to find the data it needs. Run JTZU using the supplied script. 


JTZU fails to load a library, either <something>.lib or <something>.a  * 
 * runjtzu.bat
 * 
 * runjtzu.sh
 * 



JTZU fails to patch a VM, the log reports failure to copy 'TimeZone.class'  * 
 * runjtzu.bat
 * 
 * runjtzu.sh
 * 



After running JTZU under superuser permissions, a lower-privileged user can not use the SDK or JRE  * 
 * To restore the correct ownership, group access, and permissions to the newly patched content, change the permissions to match the parts of the SDK or JRE that were unchanged. 
 * Alternatively, when performing the patching of JREs, use the user account that owns that JRE instead of patching under the identity of the superuser profile. Where possible, run JTZU under the superuser account to discover all the SDKs and JREs on the system, then partition the SDKList.txt to patch JREs and SDKs using account of the SDK or JRE owner.







Collecting information required for further assistance

To diagnose JTZU problems, obtain the following files from the JTZU directory and email this information to jtzu@uk.ibm.com [jtzu@uk.ibm.com].


 1. The JTZU log fileLogfile.log. 
 2. The directory search file DirectorySearch.txt. 
 3. The SDKList.txt file, if present. 
 4. The JTZU settings file, runjtzuenv.bat (Microsoft速 Windows速) or runjtzuenv.sh (other platforms). Copy and paste the contents of this file into the email because batch and script files are often stripped from emails. 
 5. The output of java -version, run from the JTZU directory.
