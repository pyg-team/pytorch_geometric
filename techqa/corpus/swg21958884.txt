QUESTION
 How do you monitor SharePoint through IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Microsoft Applications and IBM Rational tools? 

CAUSE
You are using IBM Rational Functional Tester to monitor SharePoint, but ran into recording or playback issues.

ANSWER
Replace IBM Rational Functional Tester (RFT) with IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT).

Unlike RFT, RPT works with standard network protocols. RFT works with GUI elements. These elements can cause object recognition issues.
