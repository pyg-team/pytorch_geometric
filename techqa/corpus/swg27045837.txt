Before you begin 

Ensure that you take the following precautions: 

 * Back up your data before you begin any software upgrade. For more information about backup and recovery, see the IBM Security QRadar Administration Guide. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/security/products/qradar/documents/71MR2/QRadar/EN/QRadar_71MR2_AdminGuide.pdf] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038118] 
 * To avoid access errors in your log file, close all open QRadar sessions. 
 * The fix pack for QRadar cannot be installed on a managed host that is at a different software version from the Console. All appliances in the deployment must be at the same software revision to patch the entire deployment. 
 * Verify that all changes are deployed on your appliances. 
 * The patch cannot install on appliances that have changes that are not deployed. 


About this task Fix packs are cumulative software updates to fix known software issues in your QRadar deployment. QRadar fix packs are installed by using an SFS file. The fix pack can update any appliance that is attached to the QRadar Console that is at the same software version as the Console.
