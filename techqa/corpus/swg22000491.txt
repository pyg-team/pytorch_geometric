QUESTION
 What are the concerns about stopping my database for maintenance and leaving IBM TRIRIGA JVMs (JBOSS, WebLogic, WebSphere) up and running at this point? Will they be reconnecting automatically after database is up and running again? 

CAUSE
Need to programmatically schedule database maintenance for my IBM TRIRIGA system.

ANSWER
When the database is down, the Application Server (JBOSS, WebLogic, WebSphere) will be receiving connection issues to the JDBC component and JVMs will stop responding after that. 

If the database comes up again, the Application Server will not reconnect the JVM automatically again, and the JVM needs to be restarted manually after that. 

The best practice for database maintenance requiring database shutdown will always be to shutdown all applications and sessions connected to it BEFORE shutting down the database itself. It gives systems the time for closing the on-going transactions gracefully. 

If you need to coordinate database maintenance and JVMs automatic restarts, you need to create a batch script for managing that. 

This is a customized script (not under IBM TRIRIGA support) that will be stopping the JVMs first, then starting the database maintenance itself (likely stopping the database first), then restarting the database and firing commands for restarting the Application Server IBM TRIRIGA JVMs.
