APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a remote Connect:Direct PNODE configures TLS 1.0, 1.1 and
   1.2 and attempts to connect to the CDSA, (which is configured
   for TLS 1.2) the session fails.
   
   Instead of choosing TLS 1.2 (which is the
   highest configured protocol in common between the PNODE and the
   CDSA),the CDSA fails as though the PNODE only supports
   TLS 1.0 (the CDSA ignores the PNODE's support for TLS 1.2).
   
   
   This is because the CDSA does not support the extended
   Secure+protocol feature.
   Consequently, only the lowest protocol in the range is
   recognized by the CDSA.
   The extended protocol feature was introduced in the other
   Connect:Direct platforms when support for TLS 1.2 was released.
   
   The CDSA needs to support multiple Secure+ protocol selection
   to so that it is able to successfully connect in the scenario
   above.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   B2B Integrator Users V5.2
   
   Problem Description:
   TLS connection with TLS 1.2 from SSP to IBM Sterling B2B
   Integrator CDSA does not work when SSP is set to use SSL-TLS 1.2
   
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution Summary:
   The CDSA now supports the extended Secure+ protocol feature.
   Users can now configure more than one security protocol for a
   session.  Session negotiation will select the highest protocol
   in common.  In addtion, a new "Connection Policy" option is
   available for handling inbound secure connections.  The policy
   may be set to "Restricted" (default) or "Open."  If
   "Restricted" the CDSA requires the remote PNODE must specify at
   least one of the securtiy protocols at the CDSA in order to
   connect.  If "Open" the CDSA will allow a PNODE to connect
   using any TLS protocol.
