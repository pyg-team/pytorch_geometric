 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the mails are in other than RichText type the stubbing does not work. ICC stubbing works only on RichText due to this, mails do not get stub. 

AFUL0009E: An unrecoverable error has occurred: This message could not be stubbed due to an unsupported item type 

ENVIRONMENT
ICC 4.0.1 FP2
Domino 9.0
CM 8.5 FP2 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This error can be removed by performing the following steps

Change their domino Administrator configuration that convert incoming mail to RichText as follow:
IBM Domino Administrator --> Domino Directories -->By People --> By Organization
--> Select User Mailbox account --> Mail Section -->Format preference for incoming mail field--> Select Prefer RichText in format preference. 

Please note this setting will be for only the future incoming mails, for the emails which are already in the mailbox have to be treated manually.
