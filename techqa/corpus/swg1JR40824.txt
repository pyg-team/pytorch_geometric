APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some data types of MySQL Physical Data Model are missing from
   Data Type Map and get unexpectedly transformed into CHAR(10)
   during Physical to Logical transformation.
   "Output" page of "Transform To Logical Data Model" wizard
   reports the following problems encountered during the
   transformation:
   "Attribute <COLUMN> - could not resolve data type <TYPE>. Using
   default data type."
   where <COLUMN> is the fully qualified name of a table column and
   <TYPE> is the data type which was transformed into CHAR(10).
   The following data types are missing from Data Type Map for
   Physical to Logical transformation of MySQL Physical Data Model
   in InfoSphere Data Architect:
   INT, REAL, LONGTEXT, ENUM, YEAR, LONGBLOB, FLOAT UNSIGNED,
   BIGINT
   UNSIGNED, INTEGER UNSIGNED, DECIMAL UNSIGNED, MEDIUMINT
   UNSIGNED, TINYINT UNSIGNED, DOUBLE UNSIGNED, SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
   REAL UNSIGNED
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually fix Data Type Map for Phsysical to Logical
   tranformation of MySQL Physical Data Model which is available at
   "Window / Preferences / Data Management / Transform / Data Type
   Map / Physical To Logical"

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Some data types of MySQL physical models get unexpectedly    *
   * transformed into default CHAR(10) type during the physical   *
   * to logical data model transformation.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Please upgrade to InfoSphere Data Architect v8.1             *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem is fixed in InfoSphere Data Architect v8.1. The
   following MySQL data types are now properly transformed into
   their logical data model counterparts:
   
   1. BIGINT UNSIGNED
   2. DECIMAL UNSIGNED
   3. DOUBLE UNSIGNED
   4. FLOAT UNSIGNED
   5. INT
   6. INTEGER UNSIGNED
   7. MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED
   8. SMALLINT UNSIGNED
   9. REAL UNSIGNED
   10. TINYINT UNSIGNED
