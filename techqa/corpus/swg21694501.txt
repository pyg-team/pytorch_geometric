Text:
TPAEINVENTORY; Database error 2601; invreserve; requestnum; invreserve_ndx1 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error when attempting to approve work orders. 

SYMPTOM
"BMXAA4211E data base error number 2601 on INVRESERVE Bedford=<siteid> Request=20000. [SQLDatabase]Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.invreserve'
with unique index 'invreserve_ndx1'. The duplicate key value is (<siteid>, 20000).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error typically happens in a SQL Server environment. 

Run the update statement below to increment the MAXRESERVED value in the MAXSEQUENCE table

Update maxsequence set maxreserved =(select isnull(max(REQUESTNUM),0)+1 from INVRESERVE) where sequencename = 'INVRESERVESEQ'; 

If the field type is VARCHAR, it can be converted to integer as follows:
select max(convert(integer,requestnum)) from invreserve

Restart the Maximo application server after updating the MAXRESERVED to reload the cache so that the same number will not be reused.

If there are a large number of records in the invreserve table, it's possible that the users have forgotten to use the reserved items for work order. Please ask the users to issue the reserved items or return the items to the storeroom via the front end to clean up this table.
