APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR enables support for the AssuredOnceDelivery property
   on the JDEdwards Input node.
   
   The JDEdwards event store is used to support assured once
   delivery of real-time events. It is a persistent cache where
   events are saved until the message flow can process them. In the
   event of a broker crash the stored event will be re-delivered to
   the message flow.
   
   Previously a customer trying to use AssuredOnceDelivery would
   see a BIP3411E error message:
   
   BIP3411E: An attempt to set the property ''AssuredOnceDelivery''
   on adapter component ''AssuredDeliveryMSApp.IBM WebSphere
   Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne'' failed because the
   property is not supported.
