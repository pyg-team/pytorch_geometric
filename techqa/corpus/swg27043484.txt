 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 By creating a plug-in to integrate IBM Content Navigator with IBM Watson Content Analytics, you can enhance the search capabilities of IBM Content Navigator. New search functions are available if you integrate a plug-in with Watson Content Analytics Version 3.5 Fix Pack 1. 

CONTENT
The IBM Content Navigator plug-in supports the same functions that are provided by Watson Content Analytics stand-alone search applications and analytics applications. In addition, two functions are provided specifically for the IBM Content Navigator plug-in: Global Search and Actionable Search. 

Global search shows the Watson Content Analytics search box in the Content Navigator banner, which allows users to enter queries at any time and see the search results provided through the plug-in.

When viewing the search results, if a user selects a document that comes from IBM FileNet P8 or IBM Content Manager, then the Content Navigator Action menu for documents is shown. If a user selects another type of document, the document actions match the actions provided by a Watson Content Analytics application.

A typical use case for the plug-in might be: 

 * Using Content Navigator to manage the FileNet P8 or Content Manager repository. 
 * Using Watson Content Analytics to crawl documents in those repositories. 
 * Installing the Content Navigator plug-in to support the ability to do full text search and run Content Navigator actions when working with the plug-in results.


A common environment for the plug-in includes FileNet P8, Content Navigator, and Watson Content Analytics, all installed to use WebSphere Application Server. You can configure LTPA SSO in WebSphere Application Server to support secure search across the three products.  

To set up the IBM Content Navigator plug-in: 

 

 1. Install Watson Content Analytics Version 3.5 Fix Pack 1. Verify that the icaplugin.jar file is in the ES_NODE_ROOT/lib directory (such as opt/IBM/es/lib/icaplugin.jar on Linux). 
 2. Copy the icaplugin.jar file to the plugin directory of the IBM Content Navigator installation path. 
 3. Log in to the the IBM Content Navigator Administration desktop. 
 4. Create a new plug-in entry. In the JAR file path field, specify the fully qualified path for the icaplugin.jar file, and then click Load. 
 5. Specify the URLs for the Watson Content Analytics master server and administration console (such as http://<WCA_server_name>:8393 and http://<WCA_server_name>:8390). Copy and paste the REST API security token from the Watson Content Analytics administration console into the Administration REST API token field. To copy the token, you can either create a token in the administration console or edit an existing token. Click Save to save these changes. 
 6. Create another desktop. On the Layout tab, enable either the Content Search Feature or Content Analytics Feature. You cannot enable both features at the same time. Click Feature, and then specify the application name of the Watson Content Analytics search application or analytics application that you want to use with the plug-in. Save your changes. 
 7. To access to that desktop, specify the name of the desktop that you created, such as http://<ICN_server_name>:9080/navigator/?desktop=<desktop_name>. You should see the search application or analytics application that you configured for the desktop feature.
