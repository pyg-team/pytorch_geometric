ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Could you please log an enhancement request/defect regarding enh
   ancing the reverse engineering dialog to allow entry of drive le
   tter?
   
   Client only raised informally (not through support). However, th
   is problem is demonstrable in the fbr files that the client sent
    on 14/04/2010 (see email chain):
   
   
   
   I think that it is important that they are logged in the defect/
   enhancement tracking system. Essentially the workaround is that
   they have to go to the properties and add the drive letter direc
   tly. This represents a laborious and manual step that we could r
   emove from their process. I would suggest raising as a level 2 d
   efect/enhancement.
   
   If you can let me know the tracking number I'd be grateful. Cust
   omer is SELEX Comms, Liverpool (Peter.Lambert@selex-comms.com)

   Hi Fraser,
   
   I looked on the movies. I have no advice regard simpler way to p
   repare the model, looks like they already familiar with the prop
   erties. Though this sample demonstrate the drive letter issue (D
   :) and not the information that they want export to take from th
   e VS solution. The drive letter should be logged as a defect..
   
   The second movie is not the real scenario, as they connect the m
   odel to a new VS project and the file are regenerated, as we tal
   ked they should avoid of.
   I also mention they changed DMCA to be only CG direction, not su
   re why. But it does not affect specific issue.
   
   As for the enum issue - I found the email I talked about, but I
   see it was all based on a guess as we missed some information th
   en, it is pointless to resend it, so as we discussed this mornin
   g, we need scenarios to reproduce all the issues.
   
   
   Best
   - Amit

   Here is the fbr files that Peter sent showing the steps to RE. N
   ote that he has a problem with the capture of files from a D: dr
   ive and has to manually enter this in.

   Hello,
   
   I've repeated the scenario with all files included in the projec
   t (including those that were just referenced before).
   Video captures should show:
   Export41a.fbr:
   - Rebuild in VS (30 sec)
   - Import preparation
   Export41b.fbr:
   - Generation of new VS solution
   - Code generate
   - VS compilation of code
   paused
   - Adding the new directory set to VS so it can find the generate
   d header files
   - (Also verified directories showed some not existing but I went
    back and checked the original and the same directory set was di
   splayed there too, so it shouldn't matter).
   - VS compilation of code 2
   
   Guess it is important that we understand the issues involved in
   the compilation failures.
   
   
   Many thanks

   It doesn't look that easy to repeat in my environment. Is there
   any chance you can record a short flashback movie using Rhapsody
    to illustrate the key steps that show the problem?

   se Engineered code not compile?
   
   Hello,
   
   I have constructed a standalone sanitised Visual Studio project
   that will compile.
   
   I exported it (RE) into Rhapsody.
   
   I then generated code from it but it didn't compile.
   
   It provides a first stepping stone along the path via model merg
   e to see where problems creep in.
   I haven't had much time to look at it and assess which symptoms
   it exhibits.
   
   The whole project: lib__InputFiles__Compiles.zip
   This compiles on my machine.  it forms the basis for the other s
   elections.
   
   The files selected for RE from all others present: lib__InputFil
   es__Only.zip
   These are the files selected for import by Rhapsody from the pro
   ject.
   
   The Rhapsody model created by the RE procedure: ExportFromVisual
   Studio__39.zip
   
   Generated files (DefaultConfig/Generate Configuration): lib__Gen
   eratedFiles__Only.zip
   
   Generated project and files into Visual Studio: Export_39__Gener
   atedFiles.zip
   
   
   Many thanks
