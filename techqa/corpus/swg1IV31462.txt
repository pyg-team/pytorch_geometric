APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  AA 8.2
   Citrix Xenapp 6.5
   
   We are using ESSO on Windows workstations, then Citrix thin
   client to access other hosts. (These other hosts also have ISAM
   ESSO AccessAgent   installed)
   
   Single Sign-On these other hosts with the thin client only works
   some of the time. Getting it to work, or to fail, is not
   predictable.
   
   Successful outcome:  Open Citrix client and log in to host
   through ESSO  GINA. User must enter password once.
   Unsuccessful outcome: Open Citrix client and log in to host
   through ESSO GINA. After this, with Windows GINA is shown. User
   must enter password twice (as AA is not entering Windows
   password)
   
   
   Detailed test cases:
   Case1,
   -> Log in to cisco VPN on laptop
   -> RDP to test workstation (x.x.24.251)
   -> Log in as sitauser1 (through ESSO GINA)
   -> Connect to the same workstation or another one, using Citrix
   -> Go to Start > Lock
   > Unlock
   -> Enter ESSO password
   -> MS GINA is displayed, password is NOT injected by AA
   -> Have to enter password into MS GINA to log in
   
   Case2,
   
   1>     User1 logon to critix.
   2>     Then close the connect to critix directly, not log off.
   3>     Next time logon back, unlock will have issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
