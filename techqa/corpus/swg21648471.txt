QUESTION
 Does IBM Content Navigator support Workplace XT created stored searches and search templates? 

ANSWER
Workplace XT created stored searches are supported in IBM Content Navigator (ICN). 
ICN can be used to only run these stored searches with the following restriction: 
- stored searches that return both documents and folders are not supported.
These stored searches cannot be edited in ICN.

Workplace XT created search templates are also supported in ICN with the restriction that the search template cannot be edited in ICN.

Please also note that ICN can only create native search templates, but not stored searches.
