PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Replication tab of the TEM Admin tool is the way to properly verify successful replication between Servers. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


The TEM Admin tool, Replication tab, will report important information such as Server, Distance, Expected Latency, Last Replication Time, and Last Error Message each of which can be used to troubleshoot any issues.

 Note: The text in the Replication tab, server list; will remain as red characters until the replication completes.

If you believe you are experiencing an error you can further troubleshoot by referring to the Filldb.log located in the following location (Default): C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\FillDBData

Notes: 

 * Please be patient as initial replication can and will take time depending upon database size and latency between Servers. 
 * Please review the following related URL's below.
