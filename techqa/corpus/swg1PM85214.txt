APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using Content Navigator 2.x, to create a sibling with a
   name starting with Test1 and not Test or Testb, DB2 is producing
   a -330 saying that the data in question for Child Name attribute
   is not compatible with its attribute definition.   We believe
   this is Unicode and EBCDIC related and _atoe()  was not called
   or invoked when it should for this data.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This works if the prefix of the child name does not have a
   numeric in it.  Test, Testb etc work, Test1 fails.
