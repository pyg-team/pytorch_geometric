Title: IBM Cannot access Decision Center or Rule Execution Server console (ODM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing Decision Center and Decision Server, I try to access the Decision Center and Rule Execution Server (RES) consoles, and get a 'Page not found' error 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

1. From the application server console, check if the application EAR files for the Decision Center and the RES Management are deployed and have been started. 

2. From the application server administration console, check the HTTP port number. Make sure you use this port number to access the console. For example, by default, the HTTP port number for WebSphere Application Server is 9080, but it might be configured to 9081 for the profile on which the ODM application is installed. 

3. Check that the HTTP port is not being used [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21264632] by another process. If it is, stop the other process and try to access the console again.

4. Examine the server logs. If they contain the following exception:

com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: 
[Servlet Error]-[/moduleVersion/versioninfo.jsp]: 
com.ibm.ws.jsp.translator.JspTranslationException: JSPG0227E: Exception 
caught while translating /moduleVersion/versioninfo.jsp: 
java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException at 
com.ibm.ws.jsp.translator.JspTranslator.processVisitors(JspTranslator.java:139) at 
com.ibm.ws.jsp.translator.utils.JspTranslatorUtil.translateJsp(JspTranslatorUtil.java:254) at 
com.ibm.ws.jsp.translator.utils.JspTranslatorUtil.translateJspAndCompile(JspTranslatorUtil.java:121) at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.translateJsp(AbstractJSPExtensionServletWrapper.java:548) 

Ensure that the <WAS_install>/temp and <WAS_profile>/temp directories have sufficient read and write privileges for the non-root user. If possible, grant the user full access to the entire application server installation directory. Note that on Windows, you can check if you have the required privileges by right-clicking on the folder, choosing Properties, and going to the Security tab.

Also ensure there are no JSP files which were compiled by another user in the above-mentioned directories. 

This error could also be due to the APAR PI09545 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI09545], in which case apply the appropriate fix. 

 

5. Ensure there are no firewall settings which are preventing access to the Decision Center or Rule Execution Server consoles. 

6. Ensure that the Class loader order property is set to Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last), for the ILOG Rule Execution Server Console module of the Rule Execution Server EAR. See Step 17 of the documentation at 
Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Configuring > Configuring Operational Decision Manager on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring Rule Execution Server on WebSphere Application Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.distrib.config.was%2Fconfig_ds_res_was8%2Ftsk_was_deploy_mgmt_ear.html]

7. Ensure that the Class loader order property is set to Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last), for the teamserver module of the Decision Center EAR. See Step 5 of the documentation at 
Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 > Configuring > Configuring Operational Decision Manager on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring the Decision Center consoles on WebSphere Application Server > Configuring the Decision Center consoles on WebSphere Application Server for distributed platforms > Step 4: Deploying the Decision Center EAR file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.odm.distrib.config.was%2Fconfig_dc_websphere%2Ftsk_zlinux_change_class_load_seq.html]

8. Examine the server logs (including FFDC logs if working with WebSphere Application Server) and address any additional errors such as authentication errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21578192].

9. After making the above changes, restart the server and try to access the console for the Decision Center and/or the Rule Execution Server again.
