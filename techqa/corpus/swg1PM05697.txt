APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With the WebSphere Transformation Extender Launcher running,
   WebSphereMQ produces AMQ6118 and AMQ6184 errors and a launcher
   crash.
   
   
   There is a problem on HP-UX in shared bindings mode in that MQ
   uses pthread process shared primitives to pass control between
   the application and the queue manager  The HP-UX implementation
   of pthread process shared does not support the concept of robust
   mutexes, which means that a shared binding application on HP-UX
   that ends abruptly can lead to subsequent problems
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00033013
   TR / TR
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   Websphere Transformation Extender existing MQ users will not
   encounter any changes to their existing MQ connection or
   processing functionality.  Only users that set a newly defined
   environment variable will invoke the new binding functionality
   when connecting to MQ Series.
   
   Problem Description:
   The WTX MQ adapter is unable to set binding options when
   connecting to MQ.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WTX MQ adapter can now set binding options when connecting
   to MQ Series.  In order to do this, the environment variable,
   WTX_ADAPTER_MQS_CONN_OPTION, needs to be set to the appropriate
   value.
   
   The syntax for doing this is as follows:
   WTX_ADAPTER_MQS_CONN_OPTION=<decimal value> or 0x<hex value>
   
   For example, in order to use isolated binding, define the
   following environment variable with a hex value before starting
   WTX on a UNIX platform:
   export WTX_ADAPTER_MQS_CONN_OPTION=0x00000200
   
   When this environment variable is not set, the trace file (if
   enabled) will indicate how to enable it.  The message is output
   only once if and only if the first connection has tracing
   enabled.
