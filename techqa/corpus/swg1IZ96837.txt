APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upon change of system hostname, WebSphere MQ will continue to
   operate successfully, but will lose some of its fault-tolerance
   in relation to semaphore ID clashes.
   
   After a hostname change, WebSphere MQ code will use another
   scheme for allocating semaphore IDs, but if there is a clash
   with a semaphore ID in use by other software on the machine,
   then WebSphere MQ trace functionality can become disabled.
   
   The semaphore IDs in question are only those used in relation
   to WebSphere MQ trace. It is only the functionality of MQ
   trace that is potentially affected by this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Systems on which the hostname has changed since installing
   WebSphere MQ.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The path /var/mqm/sockets/@SYSTEM/qmgrlocl should contain a
   directory named after the hostname of the local machine.
   
   The said directory was checked and created only at the time
   WebSphere MQ was installed on the machine. But during strmqm,
   there was no check that the directory existed.
   
   If the system hostname does not change, there is no problem at
   all. But if the system hostname is changed, WebSphere MQ code
   will not check the path containing the new hostname directory
   or attempt to create it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ code has been changed. During strmqm, there
   is now a check for the existence of the directory named above.
   If the directory does not exist, an attempt will be made to
   create it.
