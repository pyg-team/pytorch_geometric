APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deployment of a ruleapp and and its Java XOM libraries to an
   ODM 8.6 z/RES with file persistence repository using either Ant
   task or the z/RES console fails with exception  "ilog.rules.res.
   model.IlrRepositoryException: Could not get information from
   the XOM DAO".
   In ++HBRXOMFILEPATH ++, ++HBRWORKPATH++/res_xom by default, jar
   files of size 0 can be found and are missing the corresponding
   sha1 file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1- Make sure that enough free space is available in the
   ++HBRWORKPATH++ file system.
   2- Delete in ++HBRWORKPATH++ the jar file with size 0.
   3- Use a dedicated file system for ++HBRXOMFILEPATH ++ and
   ++HBRFILEPATH ++ separate from ++HBRWORKPATH++ containing the
   logs file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The RES console does not handle properly XOM jar that are
   empty. Although it is not a valid file and it should not have
   existed, the XOM management must handle the case.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
