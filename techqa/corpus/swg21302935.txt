PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) or IBM Integration Bus (IIB) and are having problems with the HTTP Listener (the biphttplistener process). 

This MustGather document explains how to troubleshoot this problem by yourself, how to generate diagnostic data when the problem is happening, how to collect the available data from your system, and how to share that data with IBM support. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions are for WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus on z/OS systems.
Return to the WebSphere Message Broker MustGather index [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21209857] for other systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



STEP 1: SELF-GUIDED TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Consider following the Troubleshooting and support [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu03830_.htm] guide.
 2. 
 3. Read more about Working with HTTP flows [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ac20450_.htm] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.etools.mft.doc%2Fbu03830_.htm].
 4. 
 5. Check for known issues:
    Resolving problems when you use HTTP and SOAP nodes [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu43710_.htm].
    



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA

 1. Execution Group (EG) joblog for the EG where flow is running.  * Joblogs contain runtime messages, environment settings, version details and other useful information.
       See: z/OS:Viewing broker joblogs [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an20101_.htm] 
       
       
    
    
 2. 
 3. Project Interchange files for the problematic flow.
     * You can export your Message Flow and Message Set project(s) into an archive file for easy transmission to IBM Support.
       See: Importing resources from previous versions [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc23545_.htm] for details on how to create a project interchange(PI) file. 
    
    
 4. 
 5. Traces
    Tracing the component will allow IBM Support to gain a better understanding of the problem.  * An HTTPListener Trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21178415] can be used to capture a problem during runtime.
     * An HTTP Listener Startup trace [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg21313282]can be used to capture problems that occur during the initialization of the component.
    
    
 6. 
 7. Abends It is possible that the component is abruptly ending.
    Check for abend files in the /MQSI_WORKPATH/common/errors directory.
    See: Abend files [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14190_.htm]
    
    
 8. 



ATTENTION: A good problem description is one of the most important tools IBM needs to analyze your data!
When sending data to IBM, be sure to update your PMR or send a note with the following information:

 *  Tell us what errors you saw, where you saw them, and what time they happened Let us know if you made any changes to WebSphere Message Broker or the system before the problem Share any other observations which you think will help us to better understand the problem 



STEP 3: SUBMIT DATA TO IBM

 * Use IBM Service Request [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to open or view a problem record with IBM.
 * Send your data to IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21392217] for further analysis.
