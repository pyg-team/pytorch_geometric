APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is possible that a WMB/IIB thread might be away in a callback
   function in MQ when another thread abends and issues a signal to
   kill/abort. The first thread would return from MQ and having
   missed the signal, would not terminate. This can result in a
   hung thread and will prevent the EG from shutting down as part
   of the abend recovery process.
   
   If an abending EG does not complete shutdown and appears to be
   hung, then another of its threads might contain the following
   traceback stack:
   
   CSQBBspiREQ
   ImbCbfWorker::processRequests()
   ImbCbf::launch(ImbOsThread*,int)
   ImbCbf::Worker::run(ImbOsThread*)
   ImbThreadPoolThreadFunction::run(ImbOsThread*)
   ImbOsThread::innerThreadBootStrapWrapper(void*)
   ImbOsThread::threadBootStrap(void*)
   threadBootStrapWrapper

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   It is possible that a WMB/IIB thread might be away in a callback
   function in MQ when another thread abends and issues a signal to
   kill/abort. The first thread would return from MQ and having
   missed the signal, would not terminate. This can result in a

   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  After all callback functions to MQ, the product now tests for an
   interrupt signal when the thread returns from MQ.
