 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Drawbacks of using Rule Execution Server in Java SE instead of Java EE 

CAUSE
Based on your requirements, you need to decide which architecture best fits your needs.

ANSWER
Running Rule Execution Server on Java SE has the following advantages: 

 * You can run Rule Execution Server on any web container, whereas in Java EE only a limited number of application server versions are supported (see the JRules 7.1 hardware and software requirements page [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018135] and the Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067]). 
 * You avoid the overhead of an application server.


The drawback is that you do not take benefit of some features that are provided on Java EE:  * The eXecution Unit (XU) is not shared and therefore consumes more memory. 
 * You can configure XU pooling only through the ra.xml file, which requires to redeploy the application. 
 * Only Java SE rule sessions are available: EJB and MDB execution components are not available, which means:  * No remote calls. 
    * No JMS support . 
    * No transaction support: you must implement the transaction management logic, if necessary.
   
   


In addition to the above, if you use Java SE in a web containers other than Tomcat, the limitations are the following: 
 * No Rule Execution Server Console (only provided for Tomcat), which means:  * No deployment from Rule Studio/Rule Designer or Rule Team Server/Decision Center: you must use the Ant tasks connecting directly to the database (res-write-db/res-delete-db, see Operational Decision Manager V8.5 > Decision Server Rules > Reference > Rule Execution Server reference > Ant tasks > Ant tasks for RuleApp management [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.ref.res/ant_tasks/tpc_ant_tasks_ruleapps_intro.html]). 
    * No clustering support. 
    * No execution statistics for monitoring.
   
   
 * No Hosted Transparent Decision Service. 
 * No Scenario Service Provider, that is, no testing with Decision Validation Services.
