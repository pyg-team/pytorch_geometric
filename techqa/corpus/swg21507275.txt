installshield TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install result in [could not determine central location: use "-enginehome" to set manually ] when using IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator. 

SYMPTOM
When executing the command './install_tdiv70_zlinux.bin -console' 

 * 
 * 
 *  
   Launching InstallShield Wizard........ could not determine central location: use "-enginehome" to set manually
   
   


CAUSE
-enginehome is an undocumented command line option which will only be used occasionally in the event that the original engine.jar can not be found. The engine.jar should be located in the temporary ismp directory unpacked by the installer.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To debug the issue further, you can do the following: 

 * Create a text file named "install_tdiv70_zlinux.sp" in the same directory as the "install_tdiv70_zlinux.bin" launcher. In this text file put the following line:  * is.debug=1
   
   
 * Save the file, open a command window, change to the directory where the TDI Installer is located, and run the command "install_tdiv70_zlinux.bin -is:javaconsole".

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The installer may experience problems if a pre-existing 'ismp00#' exist in %temp%. For example, the /tmp/ismp001 or /tmp/ismp002 may cause the installer to fail with the above error. 

You should clear all references of 'ismp00#' from the system's %temp% directory before the next installation attempt.
