APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempts to open a diagram in IBM Rational System Architect XT
   (SAXT) results in a Security Warning dialog.
   
   CONFIGURATION
   SAXT 11.4.3.3 build 60
   Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 32 bit
   Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 9.0.39
   Oracle JRE Version 8 Update 45 (build 1.8.0_45-b15)
   
   SYMPTOM
   The full error message is:
   Security Warning
   Do you want to run this application?
   (!) An application is requesting permission to load a resource
   from location below.
   Location: http://SERVER [http://SERVER]
   More Information
   Click Cancel to block loading such resources or Run to allow it
   to allow them to load.
   [Run] [Cancel]
   
   Additional Information:
   No message with Oracle Java 7.
   The message is coming from Oracle Java 8.
   If you press Cancel then look at the Java console it states:
   "user declines loading unsigned boxcursor.png and magnifier.png"
   
   If you click on "more information" you get a dialog as follows:
   Clicking Run allows the application to run with limited
   access that is intended to protect your personal files and
   other resources on your computer. The application
   cannot access these resources (for example, the web
   cam and microphone) without asking for your permission.
   Clicking Cancel prevents the application from running.
   The publisher name is unknown. It is recommended not
   to run this application unless your are familiar with its
   source.
   There is no digital signature for this application.
   
   Notes:
   - The diagram will still load and open regardless of clicking
     Run or Cancel.
   
   - For the very first time you login to SAXT and open a diagram
     there is first the usual Java dialog about trusting and you
   tick
     that and press OK.
     This gets bypassed on subsequent attempts, just leaving the
     error as described, Security Warning (aka the second dialog)
     which shows next.
   
   - On subsequent attempts the error as described occurs only for
     opening diagrams that you did not open before. That is, just
     one dialog, the Security Warning as described.
   
   - The the pie charts from the Commercial Questions or Health of
     Architecture reports are also impacted by the issues
   described.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Set up as above
   2. Login to SAXT
   3. Open the XT Explorer
   4. Expand the diagrams
   5. Click on a diagram
   
   Expected Result:
   The Diagram to open with no dialogs.
   
   Unexpected Result:
   The Security Warning dialog as described.
   
   CAUSE
   Everything is signed as expected, but not image files as
   described. IBM Cannot sign the images, it would have to be built
   into a jar file and signed, that is not possible here.
   
   WORKAROUND
   Procedure:
   1. Go to SAXT install "\IP" folder
   2. Rename boxcursor.png and magnifier.png to something else
   3. Test following the steps to reproduce
   
   Note using the Workaround: This doesn't hurt functionality. It
   just keeps the mouse from turning into a box instead of a
   pointer in the pan & zoom box.
