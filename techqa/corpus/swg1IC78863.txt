You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a user is installing the TSM server for the first time
   and they want to be at the latest fixpack or interim fix, they
   can start by installing the server at that fixpack or interim
   fix level.  There is no need to first install the base release
   server for that level.  Installing the base release first may
   expose the user to issues that have been fixed in later
   levels.  Once that fixpack or interim fix server has been
   installed the customer just needs to install the license from
   the base release level.
   
   Platforms Affected:  AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A user should install the TSM server at the level they want to
   run.  There is no need to start the server installation at the
   base release level.

   Problem Description:

   Problem Summary:
   *
   
   Problem Conclusion:
   In the Tivoli Storage Manager installation guides, in the
   section titled "Installing a fix pack," the following text was
   added:
   
   "To install a fix pack or interim fix to the server, install
   the server at the level on which you want to run it. You do
   not have to start the server installation at the base release
   level. For example, if you currently have V6.1.2.1 installed,
   you can go directly to the latest fix pack for V6.3. You do
   not have to start with the V6.3.0 installation if a
   maintenance update is available.
   
   You must have the Tivoli Storage Manager license package
   installed. The license package is provided with the purchase
   of a base release. After the fix pack or interim fix is
   installed, install the license for the server."
   
   A similar text was added to sections "Applying a fix pack to
   Tivoli Storage Manager V6 in a clustered environment for AIX"
   and to "Applying a fix pack to Tivoli Storage Manager V6 in a
   clustered environment for Windows." The following text was
   added:
   
   "To install a fix pack or interim fix to the server, install
   the server at the level on which you want to run it. You do
   not have to start the server installation at the base release
   level. For example, if you currently have V6.1.2.1 installed,
   you can go directly to the latest fix pack for V6.3. You do
   not have to start with the V6.3.0 installation if a
   maintenance update is available. "
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows.
