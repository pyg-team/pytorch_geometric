APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After installing or upgrading the Security Guardium v10.
   Modifying any S-TAP from the GUI interface can result in that
   S-TAP showing a yellow 'sync' status. If the S-TAP is restarted
   the parameters are not updated and the guard_tap.ini will
   revert to the original state. Similarly. when issueing a grdapi
   cli command, to modify the S-TAP parameters. It too can fail
   with an 'ERR=1' or 'ERR=403'. As with the GUI update, the S-TAP
   will remain in a yellow 'sync' status. Any restart of the S-TAP
   will result in the S-TAP loosing all modifications
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make any required S-TAP parameter changes directly to the
   guard_tap.ini file (locally on the DB server) and restart the
   S-TAP.
   Note that this defect is fixed in patch v10.0p34 and later GPUs
   (eg v10.0p100 and higher)
