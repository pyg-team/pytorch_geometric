 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability (CVE-2015-0138) may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers.

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
