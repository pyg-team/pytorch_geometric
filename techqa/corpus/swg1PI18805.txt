   java.io.IOException: EDC5124I Too many open files.
   
   Depending on what IBM BPM was trying to do at the time, various
   other error messages might occur, related to files not being
   able to open due to too many open files in the JVM.

LOCAL FIX

   number gets close to limit value, restart server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   members, resulting in an "EDC5124I Too many open files" error
   message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V8.0.1.2 is available that fixes the error by
   properly closing out the file handle when appropriate.
