ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer upgraded to WebSphere MQ V701 from V6.0 and now
   they receive and abend0c4 in their receive exit.

   12.49.21 IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED:
            DUMPID=031 REQUESTED BY JOB (CSQ1CHIN)
            DUMP TITLE=CSQ1,ABN=0C4-00000011, C=R3600.701.CHIN,
            M=CSQXDISP,LOC=.........????????+C9196

   12.49.22 +CSQX053E CSQ1 CSQXFFST Error information recorded in
   .
   Reviewing the dump, I found that AgentBufferLength was used
   to parse the AgentBuffer. It goes off the end of a 4K block
   which is not owned and thus causes the abend0C4.
   .
   CSQSNAP data set contains
   *                X...XFFSrstMVSAs*
   *yncConsumerThread.......MOVR....*
   *.....R..X...XINS................*
   .
   Based on analysis of the supplied dumps, the change team has
   identified an error with the way the AgentBufferLength is
   calculated for receive exits on multiplexed channels.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 1.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Abend S0C4 in a channel receive exit    *
   *                      which uses the whole of the supplied    *
   *                      AgentBuffer.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using a SVRCONN channel with SHARECNV greater than 1 and a
   receive exit defined, the AgentBufferLength parameter passed to
   the receive exit may be larger than the storage allocated for
   the buffer.
   
   If the exit accesses part of the AgentBuffer beyond the original
   DataLength, then the storage may be inaccessible.  This results
   in an 0C4 abend in the user exit.  The CHINIT issues messages
   CSQX111E and CSQX599E and terminates the channel.
   
   If the exit updates the buffer beyond the original DataLength
   and the storage is accessible, then it could overlay chinit
   storage being used for other purposes.  This would result in a
   range of error symptoms, depending on exactly what storage is
   overlaid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQXREXT has been updated to correctly calculate the storage
   available for use by the receive exit, and set the appropriate
   value for the AgentBufferLength parameter.
