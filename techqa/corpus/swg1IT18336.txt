ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The MQv8 client code on HP NonStop Server (NSS)  running under
   the application's user id
   attempts to log an error in the MQ error logs on the local
   client platform.  However it appears that the default file
   settings, do not allow access to the error log resulting in the
   following FDC.
   -----------------------------------------------
   Operating System  :- HP NonStop J06.17, NSE-AF 077876
   LVLS              :- 8.0.0.4
   Product Long Name :- WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server
   Probe Id          :- XC405067
   Component         :- xeeCallWriteMsgProgram
   Effective UserID  :- 32510
   Real UserID       :- 32510
   Program Name      :- MQ_Client_Application_Name
   Addressing mode   :- 32-bit
   Major Errorcode   :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC
   Probe Description :- AMQ6119: An internal WebSphere MQ error
   has occurred ('4206 - Non-OSS process has requested a service
   available' from fork.)
   Arith1            :- 4206 (0x106e)
   Comment1          :- '4206 - Non-OSS process has requested a

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are 2 workarounds:-
   1) Modify the permissions for the MQ error logs to be writable
   for every user.
   or
   2) Add application's user id to the MQM group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the standalone MQ v8 client supportPac (MQC8) on the HP
   NonStop Server (NSS) platform.
   
   
   MQC8 on other platforms is not affected.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   This issue is a functional restriction of the standalone MQ v8
   client supportPac (MQC8) on HP NSS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Users should follow the guidance in the Local Fix section of
   this APAR to avoid this functional restriction of the standalone
   MQ v8 client supportPac (MQC8) on HP NSS.
   
   IBM has withdrawn the MQC8 supportPac for HP NSS, and as a
   result no further releases or functional enhancements for this
   supportPac are expected.
