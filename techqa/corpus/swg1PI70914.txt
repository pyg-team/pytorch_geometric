APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  R_Password service validates password and returns 12/13
   because of password length issue. CICS checks password length
   and returns PASSWORD_REQUIRED response from DFHXSSB and
   DFHXSPW.  DFHESN has no code to handle this specific error
   response so issues an AEXZ abend instead of returning NOTAUTH
   with RESP2=1.
   The exception trace entry shows return codes passed back as

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A transaction issuing an EXEC CICS      *
   *                      VERIFY PASSWORD or an EXEC CICS VERIFY  *
   *                      PHRASE command abends AEXZ.             *
   ****************************************************************
   A transaction issues an EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD command or an
   EXEC CICS VERIFY PHRASE command with a BLANK or NULL password.
   The transaction is abended with abend code AEXZ.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For a BLANK or NULL password the module DFHXSSB Verify Password
   routine has been changed to return 'Invalid_Password' rather
   than 'Password_Required'.  This is interpreted by DFHESN as
   RESP=00000046 'Notauth' and RESP2=00000002 'Invalid Password'
   which is returned to the user program.
