APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer can't get the standard 8.5 client to run on citrix for
   users who are
   not admins.
   
   The basic client will start but the setup doesn't seem to create
   the workspace
   folder correctly for a standard
   client.
   Even if the user runs setup as an admin and the standard client
   starts ok, the
   next time the user tries to start notes standard without admin
   rights it fails,
   the splash screen comes up and disappears after a while.
   Error message on the eclipse logs is "CLPDN0016E: Error starting
   RCPApplication
   com.ibm.rcp.personality.framework.RCPApplication"
   Customer reproduced this on his customers citrix server and on
   his own windows
   2003 terminal server.
   
   Customer tried multiuser install and single user and both show
   the same
   issue
   
   
   I did not reproduce this on my win 2003 server for multi user or
   single user
   install, the standard client starts every time.
   We were also unable to reproduce on Citrix.
   Enabled extra logging DEBUGGINGWCTENABLED=4294967295
   
   The difference seems to be that in the logs the issue where the
   client does not
   start is much shorter than when it runs
   correctly.
   It ends in the line
   
   DeskSendStatusBarUpdateToWCT>  ENTER=
   
   The correct run moves to the following at the same spot
   
   NNOTESWC::InitMQ  > ENTER
   
   Have you any idea what the DeskSendStatusBarUpdateToWCT>  ENTER=
   line
   represents?
   
   Also from the trace logs

             <continued...>
   
   To understand the cause of this exception need to get help from
   the XPD team.
   
   
   Errors did not give me any clue to why the standard client does
   not
   start
   
   Did an AOS with the customer and he seems to be doing everything
   
   correctly.
   
   Customer installed notes using the install instructions of
   appendix H in the
   whitepaper below
   
   http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/lotus/Note [http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/lotus/Note]
   s85XenApp45Final
   .pdf
   
   
   Suggested workaround in SPR EDMO7GESS2 which has a similar issue
   but this was
   only on 64 bit, the customer is using 32 bit, this did not have
   an affect
   
   1. The data directories are on the Citrix server.
   2. The install is a clean install, it happens for all new users
   he sets up on
   the Citrix server.
   3. There is a workspace directory on ecurep notes_data.zip (a
   good and a bad
   setup)
