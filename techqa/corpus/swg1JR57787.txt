APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you start an exposed heritage human service by using IBM
   Portal, the Process Admin Console, or a custom client, the
   service sometimes fails immediately and you see an error stating
    "The service you are trying to access is no longer available."

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a heritage human service is exposed as a dashboard,
   startable service, administration service, or URL, it can be
   started as a stand-alone service even if it doesn't have task
   context. The runtime state of such a stand-alone service is
   stored in the memory. Because users might simply close their
   browser and, therefore, not necessarily finish the service, the
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) runtime environment has a
   cleanup mechanism that removes the state of stand-alone services
    from the memory after it has not been used for a configurable
   time (the default is one hour).
   
   When the IBM BPM runtime environment starts a new service, it is
   added it to an internal registry of running stand-alone services
   without the current time as the access time. Until the access
   time is set to the current time, a concurrent thread cleans up
   the stand-alone service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that will be included in
    IBM BPM V8.5.7.0 cumulative fix 2017.06 that corrects the
   initialization logic of a stand-alone service so that it is
   added to the internal registry with the correct access time so
   that concurrent threads no longer clean it up.
   
   A fix is also available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.2 (also know as
   8.5.6.0 cumulative fix 2 or CF02).
