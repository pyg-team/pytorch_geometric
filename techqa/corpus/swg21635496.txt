QUESTION
 How do I enable logging for DotEdit in Datacap TaskMaster Capture 8.1? 

ANSWER
These are the steps to turn on logging for IBM Datacap Taskmaster DotEdit versions 8.1 or higher. Although there are logging configuration options that can be used for different levels of logging, these steps are specific to providing maximum logging to troubleshoot DotEdit issues when they occur. If desired, logging may be left on continuously for a test or development system, but should be set to minimum on a production server, as it will negatively impact performance.
To enable DotEdit logging: 

 1.  
 2. Enable executable logging.  1. Navigate to the \Datacap\DotEdit folder and edit DotEdit.exe.config. 
     2. In the User Settings area, set the following:  * WriteLog = True 
         * LogSeverity = 5 
         * LogPath = DotEdit.log 
         * LogOverwrite = True 
         * LogFlushBuffer = True 
         * LogShowTime = True
        
        
     3. Save the file.
    
    
 3. Enable Rulerunner (rrs) logging.  1. Run Taskmaster Web, log in to the application to be run, and select the Administrator tab. 
     2. Expand the Workflow and highlight the task for which logging is needed. 
     3. In the Rulerunner settings section, Rulerunner service log settings subsection, set Rulerunner service log to 5 and check Flush Buffer. 
     4. Scroll to the bottom and click Save.
    
    
 4. Run DotEdit and generate the error or perform the action for which logging information is needed. 
 5. There will be two log files generated.  1. X_rrs.log where X is the task name. Located in the batch folder it logs execution of the actions by the Rulerunner engine. 
     2. DotEdit.log.Y.log where Y is the log sequence number. Located in the \Users\(username)\AppData\Local\IBM\IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture\8.1.0.11 folder, it contains logging for the DotEdit executable.
    
    


Additional Information 

DotEdit Rulerunner logging can be turned off by changing WriteLog to False. Executable logging cannot be completely turned off, but minimum logging can be created by setting Rulerunner service log to 0 and unchecking Flush Buffer.
