ABSTRACT
 Members of the Software Asset Management Project Office and IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) support team shared information on the benefits of ILMT and the expectations of using it. This was not a technical presentation. The audience was the project leaders, decision makers, and middle management, rather than technical personnel. After a presentation, attendees were given an opportunity to ask our panel of experts questions by phone. Throughout the event, attendees also commented and asked questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting group web chat. 

CONTENT
This Open Mic session was the third webcast provided by IBM License Metric Tool Technical Support. This open mic session was not intended as a technical presentation. It was aimed more at the project leader, decision makers, and middle management than at technical personnel. We discussed the reasons for using ILMT and Sub-Capacity pricing. We also talked about what the customer can expect from ILMT and what ILMT expects from the customer. 


Throughout the event, attendees were encouraged to comment and ask questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting (formerly known as IBM SmartCloud Meetings) Web chat. We welcomed questions from the audience by phone after the presentation. It was an interactive, educational, lively session.
