   ****************************************************************
   WebSphere Application Server usually sets the system
   property "com.ibm.itp.location needs to be set" in the
   non-default part of System properties. In some rare
   environment it is set in the default part of the System
   properties which is not searched.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  EJBDeploy will now search both the default and non-default
   System properties to locate the com.ibm.itp.location system
   property.
