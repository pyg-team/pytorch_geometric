DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM Rational Business Developer is designed to meet the needs of business-oriented developers by providing a comprehensive development environment for the EGL Language. It provides tools to define, test, and debug EGL applications and services. It also provides a generation engine that transforms the EGL source into Java or COBOL code that is optimized for deployment across various supported platforms. 

This version of Rational Business Developer expands the EGL language to include the development of Web 2.0 applications, which can invoke remote services and interact with public Web sites. This interface is called EGL Rich UI. Rich UI applications are converted automatically to JavaScript.
