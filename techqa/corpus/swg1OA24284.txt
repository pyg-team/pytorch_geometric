APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OMEGAMON XE for Storage on z/OS does not support the
   KDEB_INTERFACELIST parameter for the OMEGAMON II interface
   address space.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Apply PTF
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of OMEGAMON XE for Storage         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: OMEGAMON XE for Storage on z/OS must    *
   *                      support the KDEB_INTERFACELIST          *
   *                      parameter for the OMEGAMON II interface *
   *                      address space.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   When using the Configuration Tool to configure the
   OMEGAMON II address space, there is no place to specify the
   value for KDEB_INTERFACELIST.  Users running on a z/OS image
   with more than one IP interface must specify this value in
   KDFENV to ensure proper communication.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The configuration tool will now insert into KDFENV the same
   value that was specified for KDEB_INTERFACELIST during TEMS
   configuration. In other words, it will copy the value for
   KDEB_INTERFACELIST from KDSENV to KDFENV.
