APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using SFTP e.g. on a LogTarget, the encrypted space might
   be completely used up, by an internal file (sshprocess.stderr)
   which increases constantly, until "Free encrypted space:" is 0.
   
   This situation in turn can lead to serious issues with the
   functionality of your DataPower services.
   
   
   To check that you're not affected by this issue, perform the
   "show filesystem" cli command and check the available "free
   encrypted space" occasionally to ensure that this will not
   decrease significantly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A rollback to a previous working release might help.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is use of SFTP in DataPower, e.g. on a LogTarget.
