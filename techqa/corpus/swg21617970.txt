Title: IBM DateFormat for WCM history component displayed in the wrong locale - United States

Text:
WCM; date format; time; locale; history; component TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You have WCM history components which are defined to use date format "DATE_TIME_SHORT".
On one node in a cluster, you see dates display in the format DD/MM/YY HH:MM (example 15/03/12 14:05), but the other node in the same cluster displays the date as DD.MM.YY HH:MM (example 15.03.12 14:26). Why is this?



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you use format="DATE_TIME_SHORT", you are using a standard date format from the java.util.Date package, which is dependent on the locale of the JVM, which is in turn dependent on the locale of the Operating System.
If you wish to continue to use DATE_TIME_SHORT, then you should either ensure that the Operating System of the servers the WebSphere Portal nodes are installed on are set to the desired locale, or use generic JVM properties to set the locale and language.
A better solution could be to set user-defined formats for both dates and numbers, as described in the Workplace Content Management InfoCenter [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v6101/wcm/wcm_reference-dates.html]
