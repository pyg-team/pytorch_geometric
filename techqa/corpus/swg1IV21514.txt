ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Workflow hangs when you try to use a Set Value Action to set the
   description of a related WO record if one does not exist.
   
   I escalated this to L3 who replied saying it was a bug so I am
   creating this APAR.
   
   I reproduced it in 7.5.0.2.    In 6.2.5, 7.1.1.7 and in 7.1.1.10
   it works correctly, if there is not a
   related WO it just proceeds on to the next node in the WF
   process.
   
   I know the SR Application is effected but it is probably all
   apps.
   
   Steps to replicate
   
   1. Create this Action:
        Object:     SR
        Type:       SET VALUE
        Value:      'Workflow Test'
        Parameter:  RELATEDRECORD.RELATEDRECWO.description
   
   2. Create this WF process:
   
         Start--------->Tasknode----------->Stop
   
   3. The Task node just needs a simple Assignment to Originator.
   4. Put the Action created in Step 1 on the Action Arrow between
      Start and Tasknode.
   5. Save, Enable and Activate the WF process.
   6. Go To the Service Request app.
   7. Create a new SR, give it a description and a Site.  Save.
   8. Start it into the WF process created in Step 2.
   
   This shows the problem.   Instead of going to the Tasknode and
   creating the Assignment, nothing happens.  It won't proceed
   through the Action Arrow
   since there is no Related WO to Set Value on.   In 6.2.x and
   7.1.1.x this
   works fine, it ignores the Action and goes to the Task node and
   creates the Assignment.   In 7.5.0.x it hangs up on this and
   won't proceed in WF.
   Maximo is not hung, just the movement through the WF process.
   
   If you go to Select Action - Create - WO and create a Related WO
   you can then
   start the WF process and it set the Related WO's description and
   create the Assignment as specified in the Task Node.
