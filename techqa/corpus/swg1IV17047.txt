APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SNMP gateway guide and gateway package description.txt file list
   common-libngobjserv-1_6 and common-libngtk-1_3 as prerequisites.
   
   From Summary page in gateway guide
   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v8r1/topic/co
   m.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc/gateways/snmpgw/snmpgw/wip/reference/s
   nmpgw_summary.html):
   
   IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2.0 (and above)
   Installations on Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2.0 require
   common-libncrypt-1_0.
   Installations on Solaris, HP-UX PA-RISC, HP-UX Itanium, AIX, and
   Linux operating systems require the following libraries:
   common-libngtk-1_3
   common-libngobjserv-1_6
   
   From SNMP gateway package description.txt file:
   Patch Dependencies
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This patch requires OMNIbus version 7.0 and above.
   
   The package common-libncrypt-1_0 is required for Omnibus version
   7.1 to Omnibus
   version 7.2 inclusive. It is not required for Omnibus 7.2.1 with
   fixpack.
   
   The patch common-libncrypt-1_0 is required for Omnibus version
   7.0.
   
   UNIX:
       common-libngtk-1_3 common-libngobjserv-1_6
   ZLINUX:
       None
   WINDOWS:
       None
   
   There is no common-libngtk-1_3 or common-libngobjserv-1_6
   package provided for Omnibus. These were very old packages
   needed with Omnibus 7.0 which is no longer supported. With 7.2,
   the latest fixpack should be installed, and with Omnibus 7.2.1,
   7.3.0 and 7.3.1, these are included in the base installation.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The next version of the SNMP Writer Gateway (SC-23-7804-06) will
   have the correct requirements information.
   
   The obsolete information regarding Omnibus V7.0,
   common-libngtk-1_3 and common-libngobjserv-1_6 is now removed
   from the guide.
   
   These are the current correct requirements for the SNMP writer
   Gateway:
   
   IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2 (and above)
   Note: Installations on Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2.0 require the latest
   fix pack.
   Installations on Netcool/OMNIbus 7.2.1, 7.3.0 and 7.3.1 have all
   requirement installed with the base installation.
