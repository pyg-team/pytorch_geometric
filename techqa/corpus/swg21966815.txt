 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to troubleshoot when duplicate Sentinel fixlet ID causes SCA import failure? 

SYMPTOM
You will see such error in import log: 

2015-07-08 01:37:00 (+0:08:01.236) ERROR: Sequel::DatabaseError: Java::ComMicrosoftSqlserverJdbc::SQLServerException: Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'scm.sentinels' with unique index 'scm_sentinels_datasource_site_id_remote_id_index'. The duplicate key value is (240, ace5df23b48f6f65cd10eb3df1f2253b). 


CAUSE
This can happen if you create a custom site with two or more fixlets called "Applicability-...." with the same x-fixlet-scm-sentinel-id value in the fixlet contents as below;



<Name>x-fixlet-scm-sentinel-id</Name>
<value>2d61df90</value>

This is not allowed by the SCA product design and will cause SCA import failures. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Click on console "Security configuration"->"All Security Configuration"->"Sites"->"Customized sites", Check in all your customized site one by one and search the fixlet called "Applicability-..." , to see if there are two or more fixlet called "Applicability-...". If there are many such fixlets for one customized site, export these fixlets and open the exported fixlets to see if their "x-fixlet-scm-sentinel-id " is the same. If so, delete others and only leave one for a site.
