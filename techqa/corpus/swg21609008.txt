[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21609008&amp;aid=1]



CAUSE
The incorrect version of the Windows Administrative Tools - Data Sources (ODBC) utility was used to define the ODBC connection. By default, on 64-bit Windows platforms, the Data Sources (ODBC) defines data source entries that can only be referenced by 64-bit programs The WTX Database Interface Designer is a 32 bit application.



ENVIRONMENT
Windows 64 bit Operating Systems



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To define 32-bit data source entries that are accessible by 32-bit programs, from a Windows DOS Prompt or Windows Explorer, use the C:\%windir%\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe utility to define the ODBC connection.
