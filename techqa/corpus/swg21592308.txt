QUESTION
 How are the Deviant Fields are used in EventReaders? 

ANSWER
The Impact EventReader retains details of captured events in a cache (ReadBuffer**).
These details reside in the cache for only three polls of the EventReader.

Each captured event is compared against the details stored in the cache.

If the values of certain fields (Deviant Fields*) match the details stored in the cache, Impact assumes the event has previously been processed and discards the event.

If the Deviant Field values differ or there is no prior record of the event in the cache, Impact classes the event as a "New Read"** and places the event context in the EventReader EventQueue for the EventProcessor to then action.
