QUESTION
 When a utility JAR file is needed to develop an application, you cannot add the JAR file to the Javaâ„¢ build path because the classpath entry will be removed during builds. What is the correct way to add a utility JAR file to a project?

You can use the dependency editor in WebSphere Integration Developer to maintain project dependencies. You should use the dependency editor to add utility JAR files.

ANSWER
To add a utility JAR file to your project, complete the following steps: 

 1. Create a Java project. 
 2. Copy the JAR file into the Java project. 
 3. Set up the Java build path of the Java project to contain this JAR file. 
 4. Open the dependency editor from the module or library. 
 5. Add the Java project in the Java section of the dependencies. Do not change the Java dependencies for modules and libraries outside of the dependency editor. 
 6. Make sure that the Deploy with module or Deploy with library check box is selected.
