Title: IBM InfoSphere Streams graphical user interface (GUI) applications do not launch. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The InfoSphereÂ® Streams First Steps application, Commodity Purchasing sample application, or any other InfoSphere Streams application that requires an X Window System cannot be launched. 

SYMPTOM
When the user attempts to launch an InfoSphere Streams GUI application, the application does not launch. 

There are no error messages to indicate the reason for the problem.

CAUSE
The user who is attempting to run the GUI application is not authorized to use the X Window session. 

This problem typically occurs in the following situations:

-- A user logs on to the system as user root, switches to a non-root user, and then attempts to run a GUI application.

-- A user logs on to the system as user root, installs InfoSphere Streams using the GUI installation method, and then selects to launch the First Steps application from the Postinstallation Tasks panel. The installation program attempts to launch the First Steps application behalf of the installation owner.

In these situations, the non-root user cannot launch the GUI application because the X session was started as user root when the user initially logged on to the system as root.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

1. Enter xclock from a command prompt. Messages similar to the following example are displayed:

[streamsadmin@f0401v27 ~]$ xclock
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

2. Enter firefox from a command prompt. Messages similar to the following example are displayed:

[streamsadmin@f0401v27 ~]$ firefox
Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: No protocol specified

Error: cannot open display: :0.0

3. For the First Steps application, look in the 
<user-home-directory>/.streams/logs/firststeps/workarea/instancearea/.metadata/.log. 
The following messages will be at the end of the log:
