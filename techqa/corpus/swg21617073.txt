Title: IBM Running the script to create the tables for the InfoSphere DataStage and QualityStage operations database in Oracle fails when you do not use the default (DSODB) schema name - United States

Text:
operations console oracle create database failure errors table does not exist TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The InfoSphere DataStage and QualityStage operations database can be created manually by running generated scripts. 
When the generated scripts for creating the database in Oracle are run, the script to create the database tables (dsodb_table_creation.sql) fail if a non-default schema name is provided. The failure occurs because some tables or views do not exist. 

SYMPTOM
When the table creation script for the operations database on Oracle is run, it fails for a non-default schema name. The failure produces an error message such as: 

FROM DSODB.JobRunUsage u,
*
ERROR at line 8:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist


CAUSE
When the scripts are generated, parameters in the script are replaced with the registered schema name. If this schema name is personalised by the user at registration time, then the script fails because the generation fails to insert the personalised schema name in all of the required places.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Complete the following steps to resolve the problem. 

1. Navigate to the directory that contains the generated scripts. You specified the location for generated scripts as part of the setup steps. 

2. Open the script "dsodb_table_creation.sql" in a text editor. 

3. Search for the string "FROM DSODB.JobRunParams" and replace 'DSODB' with the user-specified schema name. 

4. Search for the string "FROM DSODB.JobRunUsage" and replace 'DSODB' with the user-specified schema name. 

5. Search for the string "Trunc(DSODB.RunElapsed" and replace 'DSODB' with the user-specified schema name. 

6. Save the changes. 

7. Run the script "dsodb_drop_tables.sql" and ignore any errors this produces. 

8. Return to the setup documentation and continue the steps from the point where you run "dsodb_table_creation.sql".
