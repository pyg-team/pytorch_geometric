APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Setting Get Updated Events in the Impact Services is
   checked --> then the associated RB is executed each time the
   event is coming, and the journal entry is done for each RB
   invocation.
   
   For customers with Automated RBs, this behavior is ok, since
   each execution should be recorded.
   
   
   For manual RBs this behavior is not desired, since the RB has to
   be executed only one time by Operator (probably to solve a
   problem). The operator may want to make a notice in the Journal,
   that can be associated with the coming event. There is not
   desired, that the journal is full with the same event info,
   coming e.g. with a minute frequency.
   
   Therefore question / proposal:
   
   Can RBA policy be modified the way, that for Manual and
   Semi-automated RBs only one first event entry is recorded in the
   journal? (Get Updated Events in the Impact Services is checked )

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All Impact Users                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * when Get Updated Events is set in the RBA_Eventreader, then  *
   * journal entries                                              *
   * are made for events that have been previously associated     *
   * with a manual runbook.                                       *
   * This is not desired,as the journal was filling up with the   *
   * same info coming with high frequency.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Add a check in RBA_EventsProcessing.js when a manual run     *
   * book is being executed.                                      *
   * Check if the event has RunbookStatus=Runbook set for manual  *
   * execution,                                                   *
   * If Yes, Do nothing as the event has previously been          *
   * associated with a runbook.                                   *
   * If No, then add this information into the event now, and     *
   * write an entry into the event journal.                       *
