APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Validation of XPath statements can take minutes when associated
   message flow project references multiple global elements with
   the same name but with different namespaces.
   
   
   This performance problem can be seen when clicking on a node in
   the message flow editor that uses XPath statements such as a
   route node and in general when the message flow project is
   building.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit who use XPath
   expressions in the message flow editor and who have global
   elements under different namespaces.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Toolkit Platforms (Windows, Linux x86 and Linux x86-64)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When XPath validation was running, all global elements within
   the referenced message sets were being considered regardless of
   namespace. This caused a performance problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit has been modified to ignore
   global elements that are not in namespaces referenced by the
   XPath expression being validated.
