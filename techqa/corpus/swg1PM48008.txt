 *  WTXCQ - WTX00038696
   GK / GK
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers using Xerces XML
   parser
   
   Problem Description:
   Corruption of XML data when processing encoding does not match
   file encoding. Xerces will produce warning message " Warning
   [line: 1 column: 40] Encoding (utf-16, from XMLDecl or manually
   set) contradicts the auto-sensed encoding, ignoring it "
   
   Platforms Affected:
   ALL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed code to use same encoding as Xerces is using, in this
   case what Xerces auto-sensed. Prevents corruption of data by
   insuring that encoding matches data.
