QUESTION
 I would like to know what are the supported Macintosh Operating system versions for IBM SPSS Statistics versions? 

ANSWER
Please see the list below. It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. 

A) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. 

NOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). 
The top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. 
The official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. 

 

B) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] 

No older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. 

 

C) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. 

Full documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. 

 

Also, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] 

 

D) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) 

Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

 

Note: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: 

**** 

In some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform

Download and re-install Apple Java 6 

- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.
- The Java dialog has a "More Info" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:
http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]
- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.
- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.
