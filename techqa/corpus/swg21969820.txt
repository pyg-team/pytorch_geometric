Tip: Beginning with Version 4.1.3, IBM Tivoli Storage FlashCopy® Manager is now IBM Spectrum Protect™ Snapshot. Some applications such as the software fulfillment systems and IBM License Metric Tool use the new product name. However, the software and its product documentation continue to use the Tivoli Storage Manager product name. To learn more about the rebranding transition, see http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963634. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963634]
