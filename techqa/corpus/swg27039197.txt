ABSTRACT
 IBM Ask the Experts discussion about HA Manager in WebSphere Application Server on 12 September 2013 at 11:00 AM EDT

A high availability manager provides several features that allow other product components to make themselves highly available. This webcast covers various types of questions on HA Manager in WebSphere Application Server.

Ask the Experts session 
12 September 2013 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 General introduction 03:17 Technical introduction 05:33 What should be the heap size of core group co-ordinator? 09:55 At times I've seen some HA-enabled JVMs take quite a long time to start up. What is the cause of this, and how can this be remedied? 12:25 CWRLS0030W message continuously logged in SystemOut. How do I resolve the issue? 21:33 I've a question in regards to HA manager recovery due to network 'instabilities' .... 27:25 How do I know when the core group co-ordinator is on a CPU-constrained system? 31:11 What are the advantages and disadvantages of disabling the HA Manager ? 34:01 How do I decide which Application Server process should be a core group co-ordinator? 35:50 What is the recommended way to disable HA? 37:08 Open lines for live question and answer period 37:13 Where is the heap size of the heap coordinator set? 37:58 CPU starvation messages on VMWARE, are these platform-specific? 39:23 Would the Node Agent be a good candidate for running the coordinator? 40:41 We have over 130 JVMs in one core group. During server startup, I often see "waiting for HA Manager to activate Recovery processs". Can this be tweaked somehow? 44:14 There are two tuning parameters available for the core group, to enable protocols. Why are those protocols not enabled by default? 46:35 What is the recommended maximum JVMs for a single core group? 49:00 If you don't have a preferred coordinator set, what happens? 49:44 I get JVM errors, which are continuously spooled unti I kill the JVM with the problem. What causes that behavior? 54:12 Is there any downside to having a large number of coordinators? And can you explain more about setting the transport memory size? 56:45 Is there a way to track how much transport memory is being used? 58:47 How to add one more coordinator? 59:57 Is Core Group Coordinator also one of the application JVM clones in the cluster or is this a separate JVM? 60:43 When you say meme\bers in the core group, what are these members? JVMs? 61:04 If I have only Web Services in the Application JVM Clones, and the EJBs are all accessed locally, can I disable HA safely? 62:17 What is core group? 62:36 What is the fix, if a member is not able to join a coregroup, apart from moving all members to a different coregroup? 63:15 Can core group bridge connect the core groups in different cells? 64:00 Why does there have to be a nodeagent or dmgr in every core group? 64:45 How does the authentication happen when two core groups across different cells needs to be linked? 65:20 Can we disbale HA manager, if we are not using memory-to-memory replication? 66:40 How do you know at any one time which is the coordinator? 67:17 Where to set the heap size for coregroup? 68:01 We don't use any of the features like Memory-to-memory replication or Tran log on shared storage or On-demand routing. Then do you think is it better to diable HA manager? 61:08 We have 193 members. what is the recommende max memory? 69:49 I have read somewhere that you cannot have more than 50 JVMs per coregroup. Is that true? 70:43 If we can have more than 50 JVMs in a single coregroup, do we need to have multiple coordinators? 71:43 Is there a webcast that explains the HA Manager and how it works? 72:34 What is the function of the core group services Thread Pool properties? 73:10 For "checking the view change msg in the sysout logs", which log? SystemOUt, dmgr,or JVM? 74:00 IBM recommends setting the preferred coordinator property. Where can we set this property in a JVM? 74:59 Is there any policy for setting preferred coordinator? 75:40 If I have a preferred coordinator and that is taken down, presumably coordinator swaps to a different JVM. When I bring the preferred one back up, does it become the coordinator again (ie swaps back)? 76:13 In case we have no preferred server defined in the coregroup, how and which server would be chosen to perform the operation? 76:47 Once I have dedicated a jvm as preferred coordinator, do I need to make any configuration changes related to coregroup services for other JVMs? 77:09 Where can you disable HA Manager setting? 77:49 In logs I see view size is 27 (AV=28, CD=29, CN=29, DF=31). Could you pls elaborate what each value is meant (AV, CD CN DF)? 78:39 What has to be considered for electing preferred coordinator? Such as load on JVM, etc. Can you explain more? 80:53 Closing remarks 82:59 End of Call
