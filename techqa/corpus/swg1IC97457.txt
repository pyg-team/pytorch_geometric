APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After deploying the bundle com.ibm.mq.osgi.java_7.5.0.2.jar in
   the OSGi environment, the application gets a ClassNotFound
   exception when connecting to a WebSphere MQ queue manager.
   
   Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
   javax/net/ssl/HandshakeCompletedListener
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use IBM JRE. (from L3)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the com.ibm.mq.osgi.java_7.5.0.2 (or
   earlier fixpack version) WebSphere MQ Classes for Java OSGi
   bundle with an Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) who are
   attempting to create a connection to a queue manager.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Applications using the com.ibm.mq.osgi.java_7.5.0.2 bundle (or a
   different version of the same bundle) could not connect to a
   queue manager when running with an Oracle JRE. The Oracle did
   not by default load a number of required packages, this resulted
   in the packages not being available to the application at
   runtime which resulted in the ClassNotFoundException being
   thrown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The packages not loaded by default by the Oracle JRE have been
   added to the WebSphere MQ Classes for Java OSGI bundle
   imports, to request that these dependencies are loaded using
   this bundle with the Oracle JRE.
