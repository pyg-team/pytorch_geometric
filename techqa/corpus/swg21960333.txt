Title: IBM Debug logging entries - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I suddenly seeing debug entries similar to this:


3008 [] DEBUG 2015-06-12 15:15:09.330 TM1.Lock.Exception
Contention encountered attempting to acquire lock (0x00000000112C9938)
on object [Cube "Sales", addr=0x00000000123C9010, index=R-739] in
WRITE mode at ..\tm1_r7s\CommitActionLog.cpp:2738 during function
'Unknown'.
Entering wait state 'WR'.
Blocked by the following 1 thread:
Thread 9460 holds the lock in READ mode 

ANSWER
Debug logging has been enhanced, in the fall of 2014, so all versions put out after that time and using debug Lock.Exception logging will see similar entries.
