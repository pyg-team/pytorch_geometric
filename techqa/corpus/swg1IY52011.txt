APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The channel in use FDC shows that our
   recently-introduced delay of 20s has
   taken place, without change to the
   channel status. It looks to me that
   even though we are delaying for the
   channel to change state, we have potential
   changers locked out.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TBD
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The delay to allow a "channel in use" to become not in use was
   ineffective because the channel status table was locked for the
   duration of the delay.
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users getting a "channel in use" error message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Ensured the channel status table was unlocked whilst we delayed
   to see if it changed.
   
   The fix will be included into:
   websphere MQ v5.3 CSD07
