Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities were disclosed on Nov 1, 2017 and Dec 6, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSl is used by IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX. IBM Sterling Connect:Express for UNIX has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]

Description: An unspecified vulnerability in multiple Oracle products could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and high availability impact.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077] for more informationCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]

Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078] for more information
