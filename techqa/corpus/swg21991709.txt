VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6302 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6302]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length by the tls_decrypt_ticket function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a ticket that is too short to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117024 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117024] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2177 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the incorrect use of pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. By leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an integer overflow and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113890] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2179 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2179]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending specially crafted DTLS record fragments to fill up buffer queues, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to open a large number of simultaneous connections and consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116343 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116343] for the current score

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the DTLS replay protection implementation. By sending a specially crafted sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause valid packets to be dropped.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker that can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plain text data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
