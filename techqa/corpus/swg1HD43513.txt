COMMENTS
 * THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   ENOVIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 14.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   ENOVIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 16 GA LEVEL
   AND ON V5R15SP04.
   .
   ALSO UR ON V5R14SP08.
   .
   EXPLANATION:
   THE PARAMETER "SHAPESOURCE" DOESN'T MEAN
   ANYTHING WHEN YOU CREATE A XML FILE THAT
   USES PIECES COMING FROM VPMV4.INDEED,
   THE PARAMETER "SHAPESOURCE" CONTAINS THE
   PATH WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE FILE THAT
   CONTAINS THE GEOMETRY OF THE PART INVOLVED
   IN THE CLASH.IN STANDALONE MODE, THE FILES
   ARE ON YOUR COMPUTER.IF THERE IS A PART
   INVOLVED IN A CLASH AND IF YOU EXPORT THIS
   CLASH USING XML EXPORT, WE ARE ABLE TO FILL
   CORRECTLY THIS PARAMETER AND WE DO IT
   CORRECTLY. (EG:SHAPESOURCE"E:\USERS\XYZ\123
   \R16\PART2.CATPART"). WHEN YOU ARE
   CONNECTED TO VPM,THE FILE ARE NOT ON YOUR
   COMPUTER. SO IF THERE IS A PART INVOLVED IN A
   CLASH, WE CANNOT SAY WHERE THE FILE IS.THAT
   IS WHY YOU CANNOT FIND THIS PARAMETER.
   .
   NO CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE IN THE
   DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE THIS PARAMETER IS
   NOT MANDATORY IN THE DTD CLASHSUG.DTD.
