QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM Case Manager to support single sign-on (SSO) authentication through IBM Security Access Manager for Web? 

ANSWER
Before you configure SSO support, you must complete the following tasks: 

 1. Install, configure, and verify the deployment of your IBM Content Navigator environment with IBM Security Access Manager for Web by completing the pre-deployment tasks [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27027367#predeploy]. 
 2. Install, configure, and verify the deployment of IBM Case Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.2.0/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmin000.htm].

The steps described in this document should be considered as guidance only. The steps might be different in your environment and you might have to modify them depending on your requirements. Consult with your administrator for your environmental requirements and modifications. 

To configure SSO support for IBM Case Manager by using Security Access Manager for Web:  1. Configure the permissions for IBM Case Manager users.  1. Log in to the Security Access Manager for e-business web console and navigate to IBM Security Access Manager > Web Portal Manager > Groups > Create Group. 
     2. Enter a group name for your IBM Case Manager users, for example, icm-users and a valid Registry GUID for the group, for example, cn=icm-users,cn=SecurityGroups,secAuthority=ISAMDomain,dc=local. 
     3. Add your IBM Case Manager users such as administrator, testid, and any others to the newly-created icm-users group. 
     4. Navigate to Object Space > Browse Object Space. 
     5. Expand the object tree to locate the default access list for Webseal, default-webseal. 
     6. Under Groups, click Create Group, and create a group named icm-users. 
     7. Add the permissions for the IBM Case Manager users. 
     8. Open the default-webseal access list and click Create to create an ACL entry. Check all required permissions for the entry type group and the icm-users group.
    
    
 2. Create junctions to the IBM Case Manager IBM HTTP Server. Start the pdamin utility and create transparent junctions for all the paths for IBM Case Manager. At a minimum, create junctions for all of the following paths:  * CaseForms/ 
     * CaseBuilder/ 
     * CaseManagerHelp/ 
     * CaseManager/ 
     * ICMClient/
       For example, the following pdadmin command creates the junction to IBM Case Manager:
       pdadmin server task instance1-webseald-iamdemo.tivoli.com create -t tcp -h 9.119.90.107 -p 80 –c iv_creds,iv_user,iv_user_l –b supply –x /CaseManager
    
    
 3. Restart the application server where IBM Case Manager is deployed. Restart the WebSEAL server instance.



Verifying your IBM Security Access Manager SSO deployment 

After you configure IBM Security Access Manager single sign-on, verify that it has been set up correctly by connecting to systems and ensuring that no additional login credentials are requested. 

To verify that IBM Case Manager was successfully deployed in your IBM Security Access Manager SSO environment, enter the following URLs in your web browser:  *  http://fully_qualified_ISAM_server_name/Case Builder http://fully_qualified_ISAM_server_name/navigator/?desktop=icm http://fully_qualified_ISAM_server_name/navigator/?desktop=icmadmin 


Important: You must provide the Tivoli Access Manager credentials to access the link. 

Note that login to IBM Content Navigator repositories from the administration desktop is manual, and repositories will not get logged in to automatically as part of SSO.
