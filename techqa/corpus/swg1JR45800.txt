APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The functionality allows filtering some elements during rule
   authoring. It is based on the category property.
   An artifact of the BOM (Business Object Model) that belongs to
   a specific category only appears for rules that belong to the
   same category.
   Category management in ODM (Operational Decision Management) is
   fully described in the Decision Center Documentation.
   
   Steps to reproduce the defect:
   
   1.) in MDMCE (IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management
   Collaboration Edition)  choose a category this category is not
   associated with the BOM for example the 'The Closing Date'.
   2.) Add secondary spec to the category e.g C-ELI-0000000000402
   3.) Add item to the category C-ELI-0000000000402
   4.) In Decision Center create a Rule in Project
   'demo-eligibility-rules' Branch 'main' in Category
   ELI-0000000000402.
   This rule needs to be assigned to Categories
   'C-ELI-000000000402 and  'isCommon property needs to be set to
   'FALSE' to allow for editing in the Workflow Step.
       Also reference the product ID to the ID 'MB repro 1'.
   5.) click 'Finish'
   6.) In MDMCE you should see now see the rule as an 'ACTION
   RULE' when you click on the Manage Decisions Tab for the item
   just created.
   6.) Now check the item out into the Collab Area e.g. 'Sample
   Collab Area'
   7.) In the Step 'Edit Eligibility' select the item and go to
   'Manage Decisions'  tab.
   8.) Click on <Select a condition>
   9.) You will see 'the closing date of <product> ' which should
   not be there.  This is the defect
   10.) If you select the rule 'MB repro 1 rule' in Decision
   Center, then you don't see the condition 'the closing date of a
   <product>' which is correct, as this has been only available
   for categories per BOM defintiion in the Product Java Class.
