QUESTION
 What's the difference between cputime and runtime? 

ANSWER
Runtime is wall time from start to finished while cputime reflects the usage of cpu resource which is allocate by OS to a running process through cpu time slices. 

For example, for a sleep job of 60 seconds. The runtime is around 60 seconds but the cputime is very small almost zero because it doesn't required cpu resource to run the sleep job.
