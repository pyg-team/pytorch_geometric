QUESTION
 What Gentran:Director files should I try to retrieve if my hard drive has failed and I don't have backups? 

ANSWER
The most important files to try to retrieve when the hard drive has failed and there are no backups are as follows. For any directory names which do not include the complete path, assume the base install directory of that software. That will be C:\Program Files\Commerce Connection32 if you are on version 5.3.01 or 5.4 of the software, or C:\DirectorConnection if you are on version 5.5. 

 * In order to be able to process new inbound and outbound data as before, you must have:  * the GentranDirector.mdb file in the Database directory 
    * any files in the RegTransObj directory that either were purchased individually or created (Default system templates, such as interchange build and break templates, would be put in place again when a new installation is done to new machine. However, it is probably much faster to retrieve the entire RegTransObj directory than to figure out which files in it were purchased or created.) 
    * If you connect to another VAN using an Asynchronous, Bisynchronous, or TCP/IP type of communication profile, you would need the script files for that VAN, which are stored in the Bin\Commscr directory. (As above with RegTransObj, it would probably be much quicker to retrieve the whole Commscr sub-directory than to determine which files are script files for the other VAN.) 
    * any hotfixes that you have applied from the Bin directory (These can be obtained from IBM if you know what fixes you had before.) 
    * any hotfixes that you have applied from the base directory (These can be obtained from IBM if you know what fixes you had before.) 
   
   
 * In order to be able to view and/or copy old data, and translator reports, in addition to the above files, you would need the below:  * all files in the Documents directory 
    * all files in the IntIn directory 
    * all files in the IntOut directory 
    * all files in the TranRpt directory
   
   
 * If you use Process Control, you would need all files in the Unattend directory to continue to use that function as before. 
 * If you have purchased and used Application Integration, all files in the Maps directory 
 * If you have purchased and used Forms Integration, all files in the Forms directory (The directory will not exist if you did not purchase and install Forms Integration.) 
 * If you use the Director FTP Utility, all files in the GentranFTPClient directory that contain either "FtpSnd" or "FtpRcv" as part of the file name, and any batch files in the FTP directory. 
 * If you use Gentran:Director in conjunction with third party FTP software and/or third party AS2 software, the batch files associated with that. If IBM helped develop those, they would likely been in the C:\Scripts directory. Otherwise, check with the providers of the FTP and/or AS2 software. 
 * If you use the IBM Sterling B2B Collaboration Network as your VAN, and need to keep old network reports, all files in the CMailMsg directory.
