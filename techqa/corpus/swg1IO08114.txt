ERROR DESCRIPTION
 * CMVC 15408
   ODU IN STD IPL DOES NOT UNLOCK P: DEVICE. I AM USING A 783 WITH
   MULTIRECORDER DEVICE. I DO A STANDARD IPL. I WAS DOING AN ODU
   BACKUP FILES TO CD-RW MEDIA. I BACKED UP ALL THE FILES FROM C:
   WITH OPTION TO EXCLUDE FILES BEING UPDATED. 1300+ FILES WERE
   COPIED, BUT THERE WERE ERROR MESSAGES FOR OVER 20 FILES THAT
   WERE "IN USE". AT THIS TIME, I TRIED TO OPEN THE MULTIRECORDER
   AND THE LIGHT DOES NOT LIGHT AND IT DOES NOT OPEN. I MUST GO
   INTO COMMAND MODE TO DO AN UNLOCKP COMMAND TO UNLOCK IT.
   NORMALLY, AFTER ODU ACTIONS HAVE COMPLETED, THE MULTIRECORDER IS
   UNLOCKED BY THE ODU. I GOT THE SAME RESULT WITH "INCLUDE FILES
   BEING UPDATED". BUT WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL IPL, SAME OPTIONS, ALL
   THE FILES ARE BACKED UP AND THE MULTIRECORD WILL OPEN.
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 * WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR USING THE ODU TRYING TO BACKUP
   A FILE, THE TRAY OF THE DVD IS NEVER UNLOCKED.
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 * VERIFY IF THERE WERE FILES SKIPPED AND EXECUTE THE
   UNLOCKP COMMAND TO UNLOCK THE DVD TRAY.
