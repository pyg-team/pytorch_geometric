ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When configuring the product to use WebSphere MQ, you might
   encounter during Appserver startup errors like
   [9/18/15 16:05:36:910 CEST] 00000001 RALifeCycleMa E
   J2CA0128E: An Exception occurred while trying to start
   ResourceAdapter WebSphere MQ R
   esource Adapter. The exception is:
   com.ibm.mq.connector.DetailedResourceAdapterInternalException:
   MQJCA1008: An incorrect version of the Web
   Sphere MQ classes for JMS was found. Deployment failed.
   ...
   in the Websphere Application Server System.out log file.
   This happens when WebSphere MQ client version does not match
   the WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter (RA) shipped with WebSphere
   Application Server.
   Infocenter should be updated to document setup approach to
   avoid this error:

   ....
   Resolving the problem
   WebSphere MQ client jars are required to be included in
   InfoSphere MDM Collaboration Server classpath. To configure
   this environment follow the steps as detailed below:
   1. Ensure that the WebSphere MQ client is installed. The client
   should be of the same version as the WebSphere MQ server.
   <additional instruction>
   If the WebSphere MQ client version does not match the WebSphere
   MQ Resource Adapter (RA) shipped with WebSphere Application
   Server , then you should create symbolic links as outlined
   below, so respective jar files are loaded into the classpath
   from WAS resource adapter directory. This helps to avoid
   errors  MQJCA1008: An incorrect version of the WebSphere MQ
   classes for JMS was found. Deployment failed  during
   Websphere Application server startup due to MQ version
   missmatch in between MQ files included in Websphere Application
   server installation and MQ client installation.

   $TOP/jars/com.ibm.mq.jar
   ln -s

   $WAS_HOME/installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar/com.ibm.mqjms.jar
   $TOP/jars/ com.ibm.mqjms.jar
   </additional instruction>
   2. Stop all of the InfoSphere MDM Collaboration Server services
   using the stop script:
   cd $TOP/bin/go
     ./abort_local.sh

   ...
   8.Configure the $TOP/bin/conf/env_settings.ini file to enable
   MQ:
   in env_settings.ini:
   [mq]
   enabled=yes
   #home will default to /opt/mqm if not set
   home=/opt/mqm
   After you have applied the changes to the env_settings.ini
   file, ensure that you run the $TOP/bin/configureEnv.sh script.
