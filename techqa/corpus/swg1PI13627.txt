APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You first need to generate a keystore.
   
   To generate this keystore, run a gskit command with the key
   database filename (.kdb file, certificate label and paswword
   that was used to configure SSL for IBM SPSS Modeler, . For
   example:
   
   gsk8apicmd.exe -cert -export -db <keystore_filename>.kdb -pw
   <password> -label <certificate label>  -target
   <keystore_filename>.p12 -target_type pkcs12 -target_pw
   <target_password>
   In this example,  <keystore_filename>.p12 is the name of the
   PKCS-12 keystore to be used with IBM SPSS Modeler text Analytics
   Server.
   (see page 3 of the Modeler Admin Console Book here :
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038316) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038316)]
   Also: when you generate the certificate, you need to enter a
   valid "fully qualified hostname" in the CN field"
   You will need to connect to the TA server through the admin
   console by using this fully qualified name otherwise connection
   will fail.
