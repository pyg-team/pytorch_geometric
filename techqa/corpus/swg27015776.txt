Component APAR number Description Compare and sync JR32423 When comparing two models, selecting one change for a merge, results in the automatic selection of other dependent changes, even if the dependent changes are not required for the merge. Compare and sync JR32780 Order of ALTER TABLE statements to add columns should be consistent with the column order. Compare and sync JR32124 Differences are seen when comparing a data model with the original source immediately after reverse engineering. Compare and sync JR32928 Incorrect deltas are shown when comparing and merging two logical data models that contain multiple diagrams. Compare and sync/physical data modeling JR32082 Columns are being removed during compare and synchronization of Informix 11.5 physical data models. DDL Generation PK83421 If you try to generate DDL for a physical data model schema that was created from reverse engineering from a DDL file, and that targets DB2 Version 9.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows, you might see an error that states "DDL Generation did not complete successfully". No output gets written to the .log file. DDL Generation JR32837 For DB2 for z/OS indexes, PADDED or NOT PADDED keywords are generated during DDL generation even if index does not contain VARCHAR columns. DDL Generation JR32422 PARTITIONED statement is missing from the generated DDL for a partitioned unique index if key columns are included in the properties for a key column but a column is not included in the table's key columns properties. DDL Generation PK85379
PK85378 No support for fully qualifying the index name in a LABEL ON clause. DDL Generation/Physical data modeling JR32361 If a column is deleted from a physical data model, and the column is included in an index, the column is not deleted from the index and DDL generation does not completed successfully. Data extract and load PK83951 Loading data that includes Spanish characters from a .data file causes an error. Data extract and load PK84883 When loading data from a .data file, existing data is replaced whether or not you check the "Replace existing data" check box in the wizard. Data design project JR33074 Opening a Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel file from the Data Project Explorer causes an error. Data model diagramming JR33221 Undo of 'Show Implicit Relationship' does not clean up properly. Data model diagramming JR25540 New Overview Diagram wizard should change the default setting of 'Infer Implicit Relationship' to unchecked. Data model diagramming JR33125 Deleting a diagram after merging diagrams from two models into another model results in parts of the original diagrams being unexpectedly deleted. Data diagramming JR32414 Korean translation for "Many-To-Many" relationship in the data diagram palette is translated incorrectly in Korean. Data model diagramming JR31708 Non-identifying relationship with an optional foreign key relationship is not created properly. Data model diagramming JR23891 Cannot reference a column of a table to the primary key column of the same table when using UML notation. Data model diagramming JR31201 Diagram surface does not update after changing the "Required" option for an attribute. Data model diagramming/Data model reporting JR31257 Text from a note on a data model diagram is not included when you generate a data model report. Data model import and export JR32927 CA ERwin SQL Server 2005 physical data model is imported as a DB2 model. Data model import and export JR32870 CA ERwin IDS physical data model import to IDA: Columns with data type SERIAL are importing as INTEGER Data model import and export JR32954 Cannot import an XSD file to a physical data model. Data model reporting IC61085 Generating a report from a large glossary model imported from Business Glossary results in a blank report and an "Out Of Memory" error is written to the log file. Data model reporting JR32976 Product freezes when generating a BIRT report for a large schema in a physical data model. Data mode reporting JR32979 BIRT reports do not contain all of the columns for a primary key. Data model transformation JR32985 When transforming a logical data model to an existing physical data model, the target for a dependency on an attribute is lost, even if the "Generate traceability" check box is checked. Data model transformation JR31274 When performing physical-to-logical data model transformation for an entity with two foreign key attributes that reference the same parent entity results, duplicate foreign key constraint names are generated for the two attributes when using the "Use Title Case" or "Use Lowercase" options. Data model transformation JR31608 LDM-to-UML transformation result using a Japanese locale is missing the LogicalDataModel profile. Data model transformation JR26132 Data server preference on Data Type Map preference page is not persisted. Data model transformation JR27254 Specified source for LDM-to-UML transformation does not persist. Data model Web publishing JR32986 HTML links for a data model that contains DBCS characters that has been published to the Web do not work. Data model Web publishing JR32020 Cannot publish an Informix or Teradata physical data model to the Web. Data model Web publishing JR32951 HTML Web published in Korean shows unicode values instead of Korean characters. Data Source Explorer PK80163 Error when you select a filter for an Oracle stored procedure that is contained in the Packages folder. Database connections JR31431 Default driver path is wrong when connecting to an iSeries database if you do not have local DB2 installation. Domain data modeling JR32136 Exception when opening a model that references a domain model that is not in the workspace. Help Contents PK76867 Connection to remote information center fails. Logical data modeling JR32959 Data Project Explorer does not show the attributes that are contained in an entity in a sorted or ordered manner. Logical data modeling JR29814 The Cancel button in Key Migration dialog does not cancel the entire Add / Delete relationship process. Logical data modeling JR31994 Opening a logical or domain data model from EME results in the product freezing. Logical data modeling JR32105 When a primary key attribute for an entity is deleted from a model in the Data Project Explorer, it is not deleted from corresponding diagrams. Logical data modeling JR32533 The product needs to update the foreign key in a logical data model where information is missing. Logical data modeling JR31743 Clicking elements with external references displays an error. Logical data modeling JR32504 Order of a primary key cannot be changed when a child entity has a relationship with another entity. Logical data modeling JR32198 Copy/paste is not working for multiple attributes. Logical data modeling JR32690 When an attribute that is part of a primary key for an entity is deleted, it should be automatically removed from the primary key. Logical data modeling JR32452 Properties view error when drawing relationships between entities that were created from an XSD-to-LDM transformation. Logical data modeling/Data model transformation JR33079 After UML-to-logical data model transformation, cannot add new objects to the generated overview diagram. Mapping modeling JR27928 Creating a mapping model takes too long to complete. Mapping modeling JR31230 Error indicators are seen in the mapping model editor if an entity or attribute name contains a slash character ("/"). Physical data modeling JR30557 Errors are seen when reverse engineering a physical data model from an Oracle 10g DDL script. Physical data modeling JR33214 Table space definitions are lost when moving tables from one schema into another schema Physical data modeling JR33173 DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows version 8.2 table space does not appear in a physical data model in the Data Project Explorer after being dragged and dropped from the Data Source Explorer . Physical data modeling JR33087 When you reverse engineer an Oracle v10g database into a physical data model, only RANGE partitions are created. Other types of partitions show an error. Physical data modeling JR33081 When you reverse engineer an Oracle v10g database or DDL script into a physical data model, synonyms are not included in the model. Physical data modeling JR32685 Table not found when reverse engineering a physical data model from a DB2 for z/OS or DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows database. Physical data modeling JR32768
JR32916 Problem setting 'Generated' and 'Primary Key' properties for a DB2 Version 9.5 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows column in the Properties view. Physical data modeling JR32323 Unable to delete schema and no error message given. Physical data modeling JR32332 When reverse engineering from a DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows Version 8.1 database, the DEVICE keyword is replaced with FILE. Physical data modeling JR32461 Oracle package bodies that are created in a physical data model or created through reverse engineering are not persisted in the physical model. Physical data modeling JR31971 Creating a DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows physical data model by reverse engineering a DDL file that contains CREATE TABLE statements with nested SELECT statements results in an error.
