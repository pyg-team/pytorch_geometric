PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 get_mrb timed out messages in pureScale environment when CF_NUM_WORKERS value too low 

SYMPTOM
You may notice messages such as these in the db2diag.log:

2018-03-10-03.44.59.637905-300 I947663163A644 LEVEL: Severe

If a CF return code is displayed above and you wish to get
more information then please run the following command:
db2diag -cfrc <CF_errcode>


CAUSE
These are expected in cases where the CF_NUM_WORKERS value is either set too low or not set to Automatic (default). When there are less workers servicing those connections, it is possible to get a timeout on the connection. Retry logic will work when a worker becomes available to minimize the impact, it will only cause an FODC failure if it retries for more than 6 minutes and get no response.

ENVIRONMENT
pureScale

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set CF_NUM_WORKERS value to Automatic
