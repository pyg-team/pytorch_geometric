CAUSE
The Controller application is trying to read the size of the paper/layout that the printer can print to. However, it has received an error because there is a missing/invalid Windows printer.
Any change to the printers in use and the default can be the cause.

TIP: Several functions in Controller require the client device to have a valid printer installed. For more examples, see related Technotes listed at the end of this IBM Technote.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the client device has a valid printer in their Windows session. 

 

In other words, make sure:: 

 * There is a printer defined in Windows, for Controller to print to 
 * The Windows user (running Controller) has permission to print to their Windows session's default printer 
 * check that the default printer is the correct one for Controller work, changing to a different one may be needed.


TIP: If you are deploying Controller via Citrix (or Microsoft Terminal Services) then you will probably need the assistance of your Citrix administrator to help ensure that the user's Citrix session has a valid default printer defined, and that the permissions are correct. RELATED INFORMATION
