   Go To Prevetive Maintenance
   Create a new PM
   Populate location field = BR200
   Populate Route field = 1002
   making sure all assets are in Operating status

   the past

   From the More Actions > Generate Work Orders
   Take note of work orders created
   Go To Work Order Tracking
   Filter for the parent work order
   Note: the GL Account on the parent work order
   Click on Plans tab
   View details for the child work orders and notice that the GL
   Account is the same as the parent work order GL account even
   though they have different assets and locations.
   Children work orders have inherited the parent work order GL
   account.
