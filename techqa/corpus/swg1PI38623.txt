ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to synchronize with a BusinessWorks (BW) project
   with TIBCO Runtime Architecture (TRA) 5.9 you see the following
   error message:
   
   An internal error occurred during: "SyncWorker"
   
   The JVM console shows the following:
   
   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.w3c.dom.ElementTraversal
                   at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassImpl(Native
   Method)
                   at
   java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:306)

   org.eclipse.osgi.baseadaptor.loader.ClasspathManager.defineClass
   (ClasspathManager.java:607)
   
   
   WORKAROUND:
   
   Add the file xml-apis.jar to your Library Manager TIBCO
   BusinessWorks configuration.
   On Windows this is typically found at:
   C:\tibco\tpcl\5.9\lib\xml-apis.jar.
   
   Note that jakarta-regexp-1.2.jar has moved location.
   On Windows it is typically at:
   C:\tibco\tpcl\5.9\lib\jakarta-regexp-1.2.jar
