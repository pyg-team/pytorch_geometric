Title: IBM GSKit version compatibility between Cognos BI and IBM HTTP Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you accessing password masking pages on Cognos BI Connection (ie datasource sign-on definition), the gateway component shows an error "The IBM Cognos gateway is unable to connect to the IBM Cognos BI server."
However, there are no issues accessing other pages such as; Public Folder, Welcome, Administration pages 

SYMPTOM
CAM-CRP-0012 The cryptographic engine is not initialized.


CAUSE
Unmatched version of GSKit combination with Cognos and IHS, you will see the error described in other technote document.

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos MOD gateway and IBM HTTP Server.


Cognos 10.2.2 GA (GSKit 8.0.50.56) 

IBM HTTP Server v8.0.0.6 (GSKit 8.0.14.22)


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The following are several gwmod2.log encryption errors 


13:01:19 - 30931 FATAL t:140379175167744 isOpen() returned false after new CCLCrypto
13:01:19 - 30931 FATAL t:140379175167744 passwordEncrypter::passwordInitialize() - failed to get CCLCrypto pointer. 
13:01:19 - 30931 FATAL t:140379175167744 Cannot encrypt password. Unable to initialize crypto. Check the log for previous errors.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Match the GSKit release version of both Cognos, IHS, and Application server (WebSphere). 

You can find the GSKit version number of Cognos in <cognos_install_location>\cmplst.txt like;
GSKITGATE_version=GSKITGATEWAY-AW32-ML-RTM-8.0.50.66-0 

In this case, you need to match the 8.0.50.x release level. You can apply the IBM HTTP Server (IHS) updater v8.0.0.6 Fixpack 11, which contains GSKit 8.0.50.41.
