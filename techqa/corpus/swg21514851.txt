Parascript icr/p icrp icr TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading a Datacap Taskmaster application to 8.0.1, Parascript (ICR/P) actions are missing and the ICR_p actions library is missing. 

CAUSE
Due to both licensing and technical issues, Parascript is not certified or shipped with 8.0.1. It is tentatively planned for addition to a future release.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Rewrite the application to use the Recostar (ICR/C) actions.
