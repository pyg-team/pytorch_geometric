IO26092; Favourite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When use the "Favourites" function in IBM Content Navigator (ICN) to add CM OnDemand (CMOD) documents to favourites, we found that some documents are disappeared from "Favorites" list after either 
1) clicking "Refresh" button in ICN or 
2) logout and re-login ICN.

After further check we found that for documents which "do not disappear", after clicking "Add to Favorites" button, a record is added to ICN database table "configuration". Therefore no matter clicking "Refresh" or Login/Logout, the record is still found in Favorites list. For documents that will disappear, the record is never added to ICN database table "configuration".

In WAS SystemOut.log and SystemErr.log, it shows error SQL -302, but there is no error on ICN desktop.

CAUSE
CMOD V9.5+ changed the encryption for their docid to much longer than ICN default sizes. It needs a code fix in ICN.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The fix included in ICN 3.0.1 IFix 6, 3.0.2 IFix 4, 3.0.3 IFix 2 and the future releases.
