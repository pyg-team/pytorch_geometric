APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z Software Analyzer hangs when
   analyzing a program with many copybooks.
   
   There are two scenarios:
   Common is that the default COBOL rules are selected. The use
   of custom rules is not significant.
   1) Start Software Analyzer while the copybooks were
      downloading - hang with the large number (e.g. 2147483647%)
      at the (bottom right) status area.
   2) Wait until all the status message are done (copybook
      downloads and COBOL syntax parser) in the status area
      (bottom right) and then start Software Analyzer - hang
      with the Running Software Analyzer 100% status at the
      bottom right.
   
   Cause:
   This problem is caused by a deadlock that occurs when
   Software Analyzer is running while the copybooks are being
   loaded
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The locking of copybook resources collided with resource locking
   of concurrent jobs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified code to avoid resource-locking collisions with
   concurrent jobs.
