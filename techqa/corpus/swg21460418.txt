QUESTION
 Q3 : Siemens SwitchCommander : Multiple instances : What Q3 settings need to be unique? 

ANSWER
 

There are three main configuration settings to ensure are unique:- 

 

1. The ConsolePort property must be unique. 

2. The manager and agent must have unique descriptions [AE/AP Titles] for each host. 

3. The manager.cfg configuration files must have unique identifiers;
managerIdentity 
name manager-id 

.... 

agentIdentity 
name agent-id 
... 
agentController 
name agent 
managerIdentity manager-id 
agentIdentity agent-id 
agentSendControl 
timeout 60 
end 
end 

As well as these, the probes need to be configured to use unique files and P2P ports, where used.
