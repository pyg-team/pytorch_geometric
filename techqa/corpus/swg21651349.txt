Title: IBM Unable to configure a WebSphere Data Collector when all of the WebSphere files are not located under the same WebSphere home directory - United States

Text:
CAMADINST CAMADALL config configuration CFG5013E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the he WebSphere files are not located under the same WebSphere home directory, the ITCAM comfigurator cannot find all of the files necessary to configure the WebSphere Data Collector by default. 

SYMPTOM
The Data Collector fails to configure with errors such as CFG5013E explanation: Explanation: Invalid user response in prompting routine or messages in the log indicating that the wsadmin.sh command cannot be found.


CAUSE
The WebSphere files are located in multiple directories.

ENVIRONMENT
 WAS binaries are in <WAS_BIN> e.g. /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer
WAS profiles are in <WAS_PROF> e.g. /opt/wasprofile/profiles/myProfile 


 WAS profileRegistry.xml is in <WAS_HOME>/properties 

 

 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are 4 pieces of information that the ITCAM configuration tool requires when configuring an ITCAM Data Collector. These are: 

 * WebSphere profileRegistry.xml file 
 * WebSphere profiles 
 * WebSphere version 
 * WebSphere executables (including the wsadmin.sh command)


Prior to running the ITCAM configuration tool, you will need to set the following symbolic links so that the configuration tool will be able to find everything it needs by looking in the <WAS_HOME> directory:  * Set a symbolic link from <WAS_HOME>/properties/version to <WAS_BIN>/properties/version 
 * Set a symbolic link from <WAS_HOME>/bin to <WAS_BIN>/bin 
 * Note that the profiles directory will be defined in the profileRegistry.xml so it doesn't have to be defined separately.


When you run the ITCAM configuration tool, you only get to pass in one WebSphere Home directory. The one you want to use is the one that the WAS profileRegistry.xml file is based out of. So, if profileRegistry.xml is in <WAS_HOME>/properties, pass in <WAS_HOME> when prompted for the WAS home directory.
