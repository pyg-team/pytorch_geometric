APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The default value for 'PersistentJmsId' is : "netcool@127.0.0.1"
   The default value for 'JmsFilter' is : "ALA_clientId in
   ('netcool@127.0.0.1','') and ALA_category not in ('STATISTICS',
   'ACCOUNTING')"
   Note that the default value of the 'PersistentJmsId' is part of
   the default value of the 'JmsFilter' (in red above). This is to
   allow all notifications intended to 'netcool@127.0.0.1' to be
   received by the probe.
   
   If the default value of the 'PersistentJmsId' property is
   updated, it is important to update the value of the 'JmsFilter'
   accordingly otherwise the probe will miss some events (typically
   the start-up SystemInfoEvent) and as a result won't behave
   correctly.
   A symptom of such behaviour will be the regular appearance of
   this debug message in the logfile : "Debug: SAM: Sleeping until
   receiving the Sam server's data?.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set JMS filter and JMS ID to have the same IP or host name and
   not a combination of local host and ip/host
