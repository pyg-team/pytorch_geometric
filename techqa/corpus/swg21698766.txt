QUESTION
 How do you block traffic for specific protocol and port? 

ANSWER
For any rules designed to filter traffic only by port or IP address, we strongly recommend by using a firewall device instead of the IPS for this functionality as it will negatively impact the packet inspection and processing overhead on the IPS. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to use an IPS for this purpose. 

All that you need to do is create a new Non-web Application Object. Give it a name, but do not make any other selections on the General Configuration tab. We will only specify the port on the Restrictions tab. You can use commas or dashes here to specify multiple ports or a range of ports.

After saving the new object, simply include it in a Network Access policy rule with the Reject action.
