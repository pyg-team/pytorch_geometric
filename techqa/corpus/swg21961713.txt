Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Potential security vulnerabilities relating to IBM Forms Server using Apache HttpComponents (CVE-2014-3577, CVE-2012-6153) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Forms Server's use of the Apache HttpComponents open source library could expose a system to an information disclosure vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]

DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks. This is caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a web site containing a specially crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95328 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95328] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Note: Before installing this update, you must first install the WebSphere Application Server fix for APAR PI50993 [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Application+Server&release=All&function=aparId&apars=PI50993]. Installing the Forms Server update without the WebSphere AppServer fix will cause Forms Server to fail.
