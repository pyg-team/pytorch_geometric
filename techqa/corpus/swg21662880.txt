QUESTION
 Error code E-GOB-102-063: [ngobjserv]: Failed to create and setup a command structure for SQL '<statement>'; What is this error telling us? 

ANSWER
The ObjectServer gateway is unable to create a command structure for transferring data to certain tables or fields in the destination ObjectServer. 
Typically this occurs where the gateway map file contains tables or fields that do not exist in the destination ObjectServer. This might occur where a gateway with default mappings attempts to connect to an ObjectServer that has been extensively customised, or when a gateway with default mapping for one version of OMNIbus is connected to a destination ObjectServer on a different version. The error can also occur if the connection from the gateway to the ObjectServer fails for some other reason (e.g. ObjectServer connections limit exceeded). 

Examples:

Error: E-GOB-102-063: [ngobjserv]: Failed to create and setup a command structure for SQL 'UPDATE iduc_system.iduc_stats VIA ['NCOMS','failover_gate',2] SET AppName='GATEWAY',LastIducTime=1303583426;
