Q&A written transcript 
Q: Are there any plans for using authentication or SSO tokens for the local offline encryption anytime in the future? 
A: We have been discussing that since the beginning :-). The online authentication requires a network connection but when the user is working offline we can't know that there is a network connection. And, some customers require the online authentication to be done via a VPN which makes the possibility more complicated. 

Q: Are there any plans to get access to attachments in offline mode? 
A: Attachments support is on the list :-) Attachments is a frequent request. 

Q: Can the users control how much offline data is stored? Last 90 days only? 
A: Not currently, but we do plan to allow the amount of data to be more than 7 days and also controllable by user. 


Q: Is it possible for two users to use the same machine and same browser to go offline? I mean, both will have their own data stored on the browser/machine without any conflict. Is that the correct understanding? 
A: Yes, that is correct. Just to add to that, each user has his/her own local database encrypted using his/her own encryption key. 


Q: Is there any plan to have IBM Verse as a Desktop Client like Outlook? 
A: Verse is a browser based client. Currently there is no plan to have a Verse desktop client. We plan to continuously enhance the Verse offline support. The gaps between a web app and desktop app are becoming smaller and smaller. 

Q: Do browser logs show synching done? 
A: We do log sync progress in the browser console. 

Q: Is there any unforeseen issue with edits on repeating meeting in offline mode? 
A: I haven't seen any issues with edits on repeating meetings, if you have a use case that's causing problems can you report an issue? 

Q: Where do we look for logs for offline setup failure? 
A: Just regular browser console logging is used. So if there are problems, if users can collect the browser log that can be helpful to Support in diagnosing problems. 

Q: Is this feature [offline] forseen for the future Verse on-premises? 
A: No, we do not currently have a plan for an offline feature in an on-premises version of Verse.
