Title: IBM Encrypting SQL connections to SQL server via ForceEncryption = true - United States

Text:
Force Encryption = true; SQL Server; Encryption; Replication down TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why did CDC replication end when I choose ForceEncryption=true on SQL Server. 

CAUSE
Setting Force Encryption in SQL Server Network Configuration, mandates all the clients connecting to SQL server use encryption. CDC as a standalone application does not support encryption and therefore replication halts. 


ANSWER
CDC as does not support built in encryption. The functionality on encryption offered by CDC is to use SSH tunneling, which encrypts the connections coming from CDC via SSH tunnel.
