PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CRJAZ1143I errors are shown in the command console as well as repotools logs when attempting to execute any repotools commands in in IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM). 

SYMPTOM

2015-12-31 01:27:21,347 CRJAZ1143I Failed to register OSGi services for descriptor: ServiceProviderElementDescriptor@28152815, implementationClass="com.ibm.team.repository.service.internal.XFrameOptionsService", bundle="com.ibm.team.repository.service", componentId="com.ibm.team.repository", startPolicy=<EARLY>.
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net.jazz.ajax.IXFrameOptionsService

CAUSE
The error may be caused by one of two things:

1) An iFix was applied to the server and repotools was not reprovisioned
2) An incomplete/corrupt installation of the software


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem can usually be resolved by executing the repotools-<app> -clean command for the application returning the error. For example: 

 

Windows: 


repotools-rm.bat -clean 

repotools-jts.bat -clean 

repotools-ccm.bat -clean 

repotools-qm.bat -clean




 

Linux/UNIX: 


./repotools-rm.sh -clean 

./repotools-jts.sh -clean 

./repotools-ccm.sh -clean 

./repotools-qm.sh -clean




 

If the problem is not resolved after running repotools -clean, a new installation may be required to resolve the problem. 

Usually if the problem is related to an incomplete/corrupted installation directory, it will prevent you from completing a successful configuration. If you believe the installation is corrupt on a system that has previously been configured successfully and contains important data, please contact support [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/contact.html] for recommendations before attempting an uninstall/re-install.
