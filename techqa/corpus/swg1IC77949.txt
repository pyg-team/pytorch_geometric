APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When having a qualified access policy for an object, the WebGUI
   prevents the user from editing the object and only displays the
   content of the object.  For example,  if the access policy
   specifies that only certain fields can be updated as long as
   other values in the object match, the WebGUI prevents the object
   from being updated.  However, the object can be updated through
   SOMA.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected DataPower customers are those users that may have very
   specific access policies on objects and attempt to use
   the WebGUI to edit the object.
   
   The WebGUI may only give read-only access to the
   objects with the specific access policy and not allow users to
   edit the object.  The object can be updated through the SOMA
   interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 4.0.1.3.
