APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Websphere Message Broker V6.0, the HTTPRequest node throws
   the following error:
   
   BIP3150S: A socket error occurred. Operation:
   ::connect::select().
   Error Code: 22. Error Text: Invalid argument
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  While not a fix, this may help alleviate the
   restriction by keeping the sockets open longer for reuse. The
   broker set the maximum socket age to 4 seconds by default. If
   you increase the age, the socket will not close and can be
   reused. The command to make this change is:
   
   
   mqsichangeproperties <BrokerName> -e <ExecutionGroupName>
     -o ComIbmSocketConnectionManager -n maxSocketAge -v 60
   
   (this will set the age to 60 seconds)
   The broker must be restarted as this is a broker wide property.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All WebSphere Message Broker V6.0 users, who work with
   the HTTPRequest node.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   In Websphere Message Broker V6.0, it is seen that the broker is
   restricted to use the default 1024 sockets by the HTTPRequest
   node. If the opened sockets exceed 1024, the HTTPRequest node
   throws the following error:
   
   BIP3150S: A socket error occurred. Operation:
   ::connect::select().
   Error Code: 22. Error Text: Invalid argument
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been changed to override the
   restriction of 1024 sockets to 65536.
