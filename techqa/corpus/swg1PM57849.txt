APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running an interconnected CPSM environment with three
   Maintenance Points, all of which are initially at CICS/TS 4.1
   and any of the 4.1 WUI servers can be used to see and manage
   resources in any of the CICS regions regardless of the CICSPLex
   the WUI server or LMAS are in.
   
   Two of the MPs on the same sysplex and their associated CMAS
   and WUI servers are progressively upgraded to CICS/TS 4.2.
   
   Naturally, as each CMAS is upgraded, it is not longer able to
   be assigned to the CICSPLex(es) managed by the remaining 4.1 MP
   residing on a different Sysplex but the 4.1 CMAS regions remain
   assigned to the CICSPlexes managed by the 4.2 MPs.
   
   Attempting to use the 4.1 WUI browser continues to operate
   without any noticable problem but attempting to use the CICS
   Explorer (versions 1.0 and 1.1) using CMCI correctly shows the
   CICSPLexes and the number of MASes both defined and active but
   problems arise when further exploring.
   
   Regions still running CICS 4.1 and CPSM 4.2 agent code are
   fine.  However, those running totally 4.2 produce the following
   error:
   
      CNX0595E: An unexpected failure occurred: Format error
      encountered processing data" when trying to view various
      items of information such as CICS region information.
   
   Using the Explorer through the data interface gives the same
   error message with just those CICSPLexes managed by the 4.1 MP
   displayed.
   
   In the CICS trace of the local WUI the following exception
   occurs:
   
      AP A3C2 WURSF *EXC* - i2eAbend
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): KIXREVGJT

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: CICS Explorer users using CMCI connections   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:    Your CICSplex is managed by CMASes   *
   *                      running different levels of CPSM code.  *
   *                                                              *
   *                         You start CICS Explorer and connect  *
   *                      to a WUI server that is connected to    *
   *                      one of the lower-release CMASes, using  *
   *                      the CMCI.  If you try to display        *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all MASes which are configured as      *
   *                 CMCI servers must be recycled to pick up     *
   *                 the new code.  Note that the restarts do     *
   *                 not need to be done at the same time.        *
   ****************************************************************
      When a CMCI request is made through the CICS Explorer to get
   information about a resource from a higher-level system,
   resource records and/or resource attributes may be returned that
   are unknown by the lower-level system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been changed to allow display of known attributes and
   provide additional diagnostic trace entries if requested.
   
   DFHWUINT has been updated to define two new trace points.
   
   DFHWUI2E and DFHWURSF have been updated to allow a lower-level
   system to handle table differences from a higher-level system.
   
   DFHWUTRI has been updated to format new trace entries.
   
   The following additional trace entries have been added:
   
   ID      Module    Lvl  Type          Data
   AP A4A7 DFHWUI2E  EXC  badCicsRel    1-CICS Name
                                        2-Release level data
                                        3-Release level max
   
   AP A3D7 DFHWURSF  EXC  i2eAbendData  1-Output Buffer data
                                        2-Length of buffer data
