APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A delivery failure notice displays the route server information,
   but if you do
   a View, Show, Page Source the routing information is lost.  The
   customer thinks
   this should display all of the routing information, not just the
   route
   servers.  When we loose this routing information troubleshooting
   delivery
   failures is more difficult.
   
   My testing
   I tested this issue and I do not get the full delivery failure
   path
   either.  When I send an email to my name with one
   
   character off I just get my one mail server .  It does not give
   me the
   full path.  When I send to my name (again with one character
   off) to
   hotmail.com I get back the list of Domino servers the message
   took to
   try and deliver the message in the delivery failure report:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When I go into the delivery failure report and do a View- Show-
   Page
   source I get the complete information.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Open the message individually - making trouble shooting failed
   mail hard.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A programming error was found but will not be corrected. It
    will be a permanent restriction.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

    will be a permanent restriction.
