APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Propertybroker relies on the global sessionid as a unique key.
   Upon failover, this global session id changes due to WAS
   appending clone ids and therefore property broker didn't find
   the appropriate session parameters.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Propertybroker relies on the global sessionid as a unique key.
   Upon failover, this global session id changes due to WAS
   appending clone ids and therefore property broker didn't find
   the appropriate session parameters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed the key to be the sessionid only, without the clone ids.
   This makes the key unique.
