APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During startup of an application server, the servant hangs
   after sending a request to the control region waiting for a
   response.
   
   A dump of the servant in the hung state shows a TCB with the
   following stacktrace

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Application Server    *
   *                 V6.1 for z/OS                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dotted-decimal IP address in            *
   *                      BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS target causes         *
   *                      unnecessary TCP/IP requests.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS host value is specified with a
   dotted-decimal IP address instead of a hostname,
   resolve-initial-reference (RIR) requests sent from the
   WebSphere Application Server for z/OS servant ORB, targeted for
   the controller ORB, are sent outbound over TCP/IP and loop back
   into the controller's TCP/IP listener.
   
   Since the RIR request is targeted for the servant's own
   controller, the request should not be sent outbound over
   TCP/IP; it should be handled directly by the controller.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Corrected the RIR code to detect when a dotted-decimal IP
   address resolves to the local system's hostname.  The
   controller is then able to recognize that the RIR request is
   targeted for itself, and can handle the request directly rather
   than sending the request outbound over TCP/IP.
   
   APAR PK65397 is currently targeted for inclusion in Service
   Level (Fix Pack) 6.1.0.19 of WebSphere Application Server V6.1
   for z/OS.
