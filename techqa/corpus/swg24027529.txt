Fixes for Business Space are also included; please refer to Fix/Update list for Business Space powered by WebSphere: Version 7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=802&uid=swg27019647] (fixes in all releases prior to and including V7.0 Fix Pack 3 for Business Space are included in this Fix Pack).

In addition to fixes, the following features are included in V7.0 Fix Pack 3.



Feature Description Updated Information Center The IBM WebSphere Business Monitor 7.0 Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.doc/home/home.html] has been updated for V7.0.0.3.

If you have a locally installed version of the documentation, see Updating the local information center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.inst.doc/inst/ic_update.html]. Alphablox 9.5.7 build 55 WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.3 updates Alphablox 9.5.7 to build 55. This addresses the following issues in Alphablox:
 * The duration format mask does not handle an Arabic locale number. 
 * The Alphablox BloxBuilder service causes log4j plug-in collisions with other applications that use log4j.

Windows 7 support WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.3 includes support for the Windows 7 operating system. (Note: This support was originally included in V7.0.0.2.) Microsoft SQL Server support SQL Server is supported as a database for WebSphere Business Monitor in V7.0.0.3. See MSDN Library: Microsoft SQL Server [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb545450.aspx] for details.

Also refer to this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21445276] which describes a solution for an issue with service integration buses failing to start with SQL Server. WebSphere Portal Version 7 support for portlet-based dashboards The portlet-based dashboards in WebSphere Business Monitor V7.0.0.3 support WebSphere Portal V7. 

Business Object Runtime Framework Version 7 partially available for production use in Version 7.0.0.3 The version 7.0.0.3 Fix Pack for WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus provides partial support for the business object runtime framework version 7. A terminology change has also been introduced: the business object runtime framework is now known as the business object parsing mode. There are two business object parsing modes: 

 * The eager parsing mode, which corresponds to the business object runtime framework for all previous version 6.x releases. 
 * The lazy parsing mode which corresponds to the business object runtime framework for version 7 and later releases.


The eager parsing mode continues to be the default. After applying the version 7.0.0.3 Fix Pack, the lazy business object parsing mode is also available. The lazy parsing mode is partially supported for production use in WebSphere Process Server version 7.0.0.3 and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus version 7.0.0.3. Before you use the lazy business parsing mode in a production application, read the details of the support statement here [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2307&uid=swg21445191]. Feedback and questions regarding the lazy business object parsing mode can be directed to the WebSphere Process Server forum [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=820].
