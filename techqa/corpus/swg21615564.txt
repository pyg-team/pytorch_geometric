SYMPTOM

/appl/ibm/websphere/procsvr/BPM/Lombardi/tools/process-installer/installProcessAppPackage.sh
-host HostName -port PortNumber -profileName [ProfileName]
-nodeName [NodeName] -serverName [AppTargetServerName] [ApplicationName]

CAUSE
When the script is executed, the value of the ${WAS_HOME} environment variable is added to the ${path} variable as ${WAS_HOME}:${WAS_HOME}/bin. If the ${WAS_HOME} environment variable is undefined, the system cannot find the scripts files.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, ensure that the ${WAS_HOME} environment variable is defined correctly when the profile attempts to deploy an application to an offline process server instance.
