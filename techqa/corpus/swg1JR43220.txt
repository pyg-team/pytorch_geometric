APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Statement of the Problem: ActionManagerNotification Interface
   for WebServices Notification does not work.
   ActionManagerNotification - Interface
       receiveActionManagerEvent - Operation (one way)
           situationEvent - SituationEvent Type DO/BO/XSD
   
   The above interface notification works only with SCA
   Notification Alert. The above does not work for WebServices
   Alert. Instead WS Notification requires implementation of the
   following interface (undocumented). Also the implementation
   needs to be JAX-RPC and not JAX-WS (also not documented).
   
   ActionManagerNotification - Interface  receiveActionManagerEvent
   - Operation (req/resp)
           input - string
           output - string
   
   L3 was also able to confirm with John Alcorn that Monitor's web
   service support is rather limited and as client had found out.
   It's not very well documented.
   
   The fix needs three changes: a)correct information
   
   for Web Service Action Handler Implementation in InfoCenter
   documentation b) packaging of Web Service Action handler in
   WBI-ActionManagerLibrary (which currently has correct
   interface/BO to SCA Action Handler) c) reference to Eric/John's
   developerWorks article from InfoCenter so that we do not need to
   provide an Example (SCA action handler has an Example).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There's a DeveloperWorks article authored by one of our
   architects that illustrates how to use the Web Services
   notification.
   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ar-bam10/index.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ar-bam10/index.html]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Documentation needed on how to implementing Web Service Action
   Handler and packaging of Web Service Action handler.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Information was added to InfoCenter 8010.
