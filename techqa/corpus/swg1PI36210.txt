PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the
   December, 2014 update to the Information Centers. To access
   the latest on-line documentation, go to the product library
   page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 8.5 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: PI36210
   Problem:  Creating the first cluster member using scripting
   removes any JDBC Providers previously created at cluster
   scope.  The description in the knowledge center is unclear and
   confusing and should be updated.
   
   Resolution: Topic, ClusterConfigCommands command group for the
   AdminTask object, is updated.  The createCluster and
   createClusterMember functions are updated in this topic.
   Specifically. The resources scope described in the optional
   -firstMember option is changed for cluster and both to read:
   
   cluster: Specifies that server resources are moved to the
   cluster level. The cluster scope resources are set from the
   resources in the server. The server scope resources are removed.
   both: Specifies that the server resources are copied to the
   cluster scope. The cluster scope resources are set from the
   resources in the server. The server scope resources remain
   unchanged.
   
   This update also applies to V7.0 and V8.5 of the knowledge
   center.

   ID: 762650
   Problem:  the WASPreUpgrade command
   must be run from the "Target" WebSphere release.  Since the
   "Source" machine will not have that version of the
   WASPreUpgrade command, the customer must either:
   1) install the "Target" release on the "Source" machine.
   
     OR
   
   2) create the remote migrtion jar - which is really the
   WASPreUpgrade command and files needed to support running
   (including command collected from the "Target" installation.
   The archive is then sent to the "Source" machine and expanded.
   Once expanded the "Target" WASPreUpgrade command is
   available.
   The Knowledge Center does not explain this adequately and
   customer errors can occur.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Migrating cell configurations to new host
   machines using the command-line tool, iis updated.  In the
    ?? ?bout this Task ??  ? the following text is added:
   
    The WASPreUpgrade command must be run from the "target"
   WebSphere Application Server release. The "source" machine
   will not have the version of the WASPreUpgrade command,. You
   must either OPTION 1: Install the "target" release on the
   "source" machine or OPTION 2: Create the remote migration jar
   (which is really the WASPreUpgrade command and files needed to
   support running ,including JAVA, collected from the "target"
   installation). Once you have the remote migration jar, you can
   run it on the "source" machine.
   Note: This OPTION 2 is easier as a full install is not needed.
   Once the archive is created it can be used for many "source"
   machines. However, if the "target" and "source" machines are
   on different operating system architectures ( Linux, WINDOWS,
   AIX, HP, or Sun and with the architectures being 32 or 64
   bit), then option 1 is required since the remote migration
   archive is operating system architecture specific.
   
   When the multiple "source" machines all have the same
   operating system architectures but different from the "target"
   machine, then only one "source" machine needs to have the
   "target" release installed. From that one "source" machine,
   the remote migration jar can be created and used on the other
   "source" machines.

   ID: 762947 and 764535
   Problem:  The property,
   com.ibm.ws.websvcs.logOperationExceptionAsDebug, introduced in
   V8, is not documented in the Knowledge Center.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Java virtual machine custom properties, is
   updated with a description of the property,
   com.ibm.ws.websvcs.logOperationExceptionAsDebug as follows:
   com.ibm.ws.websvcs.logOperationExceptionAsDebug
   
   SOAP fault exceptions are always written using log.error, which
   is written to SystemOut.log as well the Trace.log.
   Use this property to ensure that SOAP fault
   exceptions are logged to ONLY Trace.log when tracing is
   enabled, and NOT to SystemOut.log. The property does not
   distinguish the type of SOAP fault exceptions logged in
   SystemOut.log.
   
   Note: SOAP fault exceptions are only seen in Trace.log when web
   services traces are turned on and when
   com.ibm.ws.websvcs.logOperationExceptionAsDebug=true.
   
   If you decide to use this custom property, you must specify it
   as an application server JVM custom property.
   
   This update also applies to version 8.0 of the Knowledge Center.
