APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary
   1) Create two libraries called LibA and LibB
   2) Create a user with Component access to LibA but no component
   access to LibB
   3) Create a authoring template with a rich text area in LibA
   4) Create a content in LibA using the newly created authoring
   template, save and read (keep this content open in the tab)
   5) Go back to main repository browser, switch to LibB
   6) Go back to the newly created content by click on the opened
   tab
   7) Click edit, click insert image in rich text area, the check
   box for add image to library with anonymous access is not
   available
   
   - the problem is because wcm uses the currently selected library
   in the main repository browser instead of the library of the
   currently opened item
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  make sure we use the currently opened item library instead of
   the currently selected library in main repository browser if the
   rich text area is embedded as an element
