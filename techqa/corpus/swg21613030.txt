 How to verify a successful install of the ITCAM 7.1.x Managing Server Installation 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. For MS, log onto the MS console (e.g. URL <hostname>.com:9080/am/home
where 9080 is the default port) 

2. Go to the Administration Tab > Managing Server > Self-Diagnosis

3. Here you should see the following components connected and running,
- 1 Kernel
- 2 Archive Agents
- 2 Publish Servers
- 1 Global Publish Server
- 1 Message Dispatcher

4. An alternate way to verify installation is to open up a terminal and navigate to the MS_HOME/bin directory and run 'am-status.sh'
