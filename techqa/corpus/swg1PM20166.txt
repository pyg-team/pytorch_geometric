APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A map that heavily uses the xmllib->XSLT function can be shown
   to take much longer to finish when compared to a similar
   transformation using the external Saxon transformation
   processor.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WTXCQ - WTX00034956
   PB / EJ
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers using the
   xmllib->XSLT function rule to produce sizable XSLT
   transformations
   
   Problem Description:
   xmllib->XSLT shows dramatic performance degradation when large
   data is processed.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Implemented the xslt4c team's suggestion to reserve the size of
   the XalanDOMString to avoid expensive memory copies. The
   behavior is strictly related to the xslt4c's implementation of
   the XalanVector::insert method.
