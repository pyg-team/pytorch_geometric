APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When updating the AIX WebSphere MQ client to version 7.0.1 not
   all needed symbolic links are created.  Running simple C
   programs report that they cannot find the runtime libraries.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the commands dltmqlnk then crtmqlnk to allow the runtime
   libs to be found.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users installing WebSphere MQ v7 client on AIX
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The AIX install scripts were executing the command to create the
   symbolic links too early in the install process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The AIX install process has been updated and the code to create
   the symbolic links has been moved to the correct point in the
   install process.
   
   The fix is within the install scripts and an interim fix cannot
   be provided.  If a user experiences this problem, they should
   run the /usr/mqm/bin/crtmqlnk command to re-create the missing
   symlinks.
