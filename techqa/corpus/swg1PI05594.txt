ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DOORS 9.5.x (those versions which have the new DOORS Tables
   features added example: Merge/split etc) doesn't allow DOORS
   Table Properties to be accessed in Shareable Edit Mode.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   =============
   1? Launch a DOORS 9.5.x Client, say DOORS 9.5.1.2
   
   2? Have a Module which contains DOORS Table in it and is setup
   for Shareable Edit Mode.
   
   3? Open the above said Module in Shareable Edit Module and right
   click on any Table Cell ? Table properties.
   
   4? A DOORS pop-up window appears, asking you to 'Switch to
   Exclusive Edit?'. With 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' buttons. If you
   click on 'Cancel' a DOORS message pops-up stating 'Module must
   be in Exclusive Edit mode to use this feature'.
   
   5? Instead of clicking on 'Cancel' if  you click on 'Confirm'
   the editing mode of the Module is switched from Shareable to
   Exclusive edit mode ? subsequently Table properties are
   displayed.
