APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   .
   Regular expressions are not fully supported when using them
   in adapter filter statements. There are common shortcuts
   like (?i) for case insensitive matching that will not work
   in the adapter filter statements.  Suggested approach to
   this issue would be:
   
   - Remove the following statement "For more information
     about Tcl regular expressions, see a Tcl user's guide." .
   
   - Add the following statement: Meta syntax, such as ?i for
     case-insensitive matching, is not supported by the Tivoli
     Event Integration Facility (EIF) or Adapter Filters that
     use regular expressions.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TEC users or regular expressions in
   *   adapter filter statements.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The TEC EIF uses an exception to the Tcl
   *   regular expression syntax for adapter filter statements.
   *   Meta syntax, such as (?i) for case insensitive matching, is
   *   not supported.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Read the documentation update below.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The note about reqular expression filter statement syntax on
   page 21 of the TEC Adapters Guide and page 33 of the EIF
   Reference manual should be updated with the following statement:
   
     "Meta syntax, such as ?i for case-insensitive matching, is not
   supported by the Tivoli Event Integration Facility."
   
   Also, the following statement should be removed from both
   manuals:
   
     "For more information about Tcl regular expressions, see a Tcl
   user's guide."
   
   For more information on the Tcl regular expression syntax used
   by TEC, see APAR IY56192 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY56192] and the 'regtest' sample shipped in the
   EIFSDK.
