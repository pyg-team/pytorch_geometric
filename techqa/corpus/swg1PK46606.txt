APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The documentation for the directory to install an application
   needs to be updated in the Information Centers for WebSphere
   Application Server Versions 6.0.x and 6.1.
   
   When you install a non-enhanced enterprise archive (EAR) file
   the Applcation Server adds the the earName suffix unless the
   APPDEPL_INSTALL_DIR_FINAL option is specified. In this case,
   the value that is specified for this option is the final
   value for the location of the application binaries.
   
   When you install an enhanced EAR file, the embedded
   deployment.xml file contains a binaryURL defintion. The
   Application Server does not add the suffix. If you specify
   $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/CELLNAME in the "Directory to install
   application" field within the Administrative Console, the
   Application Server installs the EAR file in the
   $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/CELLNAME directory and overwrites the
   other applications in that location.

   If you install an application on an application server, the
   product installs the application files in a subdirectory of
   the directory that is specified in the Directory to install
   application field in the application installation wizard. The
   subdirectory has the same name as the application enterprise
   archive (EAR) file. If you export the installed application
   and then reinstall it onto an application server, a
   subdirectory with the same name as the EAR file, is not
   created. This information on the target directory is not
   clearly stated in the Version 6.x Information Centers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The description for the Directory to install application field
   within the following help topics in the Version 6.x
   Information Centers more clearly describes the options for the
   field and the target directory:
   -"Select installation options settings"
   -"Application binary settings" (V6.1)
   -"Enterprise application settings" (V6.0.x)
   The following information applies to these topics:
   
   Directory to install application
   Specifies the directory to which the enterprise application
   (EAR) file will be installed. By default, the EAR file is
   installed in the profile_root/installedApps/cell_name/
   application_name.ear directory.
   
   Setting options include the following:
   
   -Do not specify a value and leave the field empty.
    If you do not specify a directory for Directory to install
    application, the default value of APPDEPL_INSTALL_DIR is used.
    The default value is APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name, where the
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT variable is profile_root/installedApps. A
    directory having the EAR file name of the application being
    installed is appended to APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name. Thus, if
    you do not specify a directory, the EAR file is installed in
    the profile_root/installedApps/cell_name/application_name.ear
    directory.
   
   -Specify a directory.
    If you specify a directory for Directory to install
    application, the application is installed in
    specified_path/application_name.ear directory. A directory
    having the EAR file name of the application being installed is
    appended to the path that you specify for Directory to install
    application. For example, if you are installing Clock.ear and
    specify C:/myapps on Windows machines, the application is
    installed in the myapps/Clock.ear directory. The
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT variable is set to the specified path.
   
   -Specify ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for the initial
    installation of the application.
    If you intend to export the application from one cell and
    later install the exported application on a different cell,
    specify the $(CELL) variable for the initial installation of
    the application. For example, specify
    ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for this setting. Exporting the
    application creates an enhanced EAR file that has the
    application and its deployment configuration. The deployment
    configuration retains the cell name of the initial
    installation in the destination directory unless you specify
    the $(CELL) variable. Specifying the $(CELL) variable ensures
    that the destination directory has the current cell name, and
    not the original cell name.
   
    Important: If an installation directory is not specified when
    an application is installed on a single-server configuration,
    the application is installed in APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name.
    When the server is made a part of a multiple-server
    configuration (using the addNode utility), the cell name of
    the new configuration becomes the cell name of the deployment
    manager node. If the -includeapps option is used for the
    addNode utility, then the applications that are installed
    prior to the addNode operation still use the installation
    directory APP_INSTALL_ROOT/cell_name. However, an application
    that is installed after the server is added to the network
    configuration uses the default installation directory
    APP_INSTALL_ROOT/network_cell_name. To move the application to
    the APP_INSTALL_ROOT/network_cell_name location upon running
    the addNode operation, explicitly specify the installation
    directory as ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) during installation.
    In such a case, the application files can always be found
    under APP_INSTALL_ROOT/current_cell_name.
   
   -If the application has been exported and you are installing
    the exported EAR file in a different cell or location, specify
    $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/cell_name/application_name.ear if you did
    not specify ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for the initial
    installation.
   
    The exported EAR file is an enhanced EAR file that has the
    application and its deployment configuration. The deployment
    configuration retains the value for Directory to install
    application that was used for the previous installation of the
    application. Unless you specify a different value for
    Directory to install application for this installation, the
    enhanced EAR file will be installed to the same directory as
    for the previous installation.
   
    If you did not specify the $(CELL) variable during the initial
    installation, the deployment configuration uses the cell name
    of the initial installation in the destination directory. If
    you are installing on a different cell, specify
    $(APP_INSTALL_ROOT)/cell_name/application_name.ear, where
    cell_name is the name of the cell to which you want to install
    the enhanced EAR file. If you do not designate the current
    cell name, cell_name will be the original cell name even
    though you are installing the enhanced EAR file on a cell that
    has a different name.
   
   -Specify an absolute path or a use pathmap variable.
    You can specify an absolute path or use a pathmap variable
    such as ${MY_APPS}. You can use a pathmap variable in any
    installation.
   
    A pathmap variable is particularly needed when installing an
    application on a cluster with members on heterogeneous nodes
    because, in such cases, there might not be a single way to
    specify an absolute path. A WebSphere Application Server
    variable ${CELL} that denotes the current cell name can also
    be in the pathmap variable; for example, ${MY_APP}/${CELL}.
    You can define WebSphere Application Server variables on the
    WebSphere Variables console page, accessed by clicking
    Environment > WebSphere Variables.
   
    This Directory to install application field is the same as the
    Location (full path) setting on an Application binaries page.
   
    Date that information will be available externally to
    customers: The modified documentation will be available in the
    3rd quarter update to the Information Centers, which is
    scheduled to occur on or before September 30, 2007.
