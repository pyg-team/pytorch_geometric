Ask the Experts session 
15 March 2012 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 03:54 Technical introduction 05:00 I have installed a feature pack on WebSphere Application Server V8, what additional steps are required for my profile to use this? 08:49 Can WebSphere Application Server V8 be installed without Installation Manager? Once installed can I use Update Installer to apply fixpack? 09:52 My production system cannot access www.ibm.com, how can I update my repositories in the Installation Manager? Do I need to copy repositories across all servers? 12:56 Can I install WebSphere Application Server V8 remotely? 13:48 I used to install silently using Update Installer in WebSphere Application Server V7, can I install silently using Installation Manager in V8? 16:28 If there a reason why the Installation Manager is now being utilized over the Update Installer? 19:13 With WebSphere Application Server V6.1 reaching the end of support in September I was wondering if there will be any kind of support beyond that point? 21:30 How would I upgrade directly from WebSphere Application Server V6.1 to V8? 23:35 How should the permissions be set when do perform an installation on a Linux or Unix box? 26:40 What is the difference between a local repository and a shared repository? How should I set up my repository if I have separate domains that are isolated? 30:58 What are the different options I have when migrating from WebSphere Application Server V6.1 to V8 (i.e. building from scratch)? 32:30 Is there any documentation on using the Installation Manager on WebSphere Application Server V8 which also shows the differences between this new installer vs the old installer? 35:11 I am currently using Jyphon and some Windows batch scripts to perform my install and post-installation configurations. Are there any significant changes in WebSphere Application Server V8 that will prevent these scripts from working? 38:11 I use aliases in all my installations and never any actual server names in any of the installation methods. Can you comment on this technique, and will this continue to work in WebSphere Application Server V8? 41:43 Some of my environments are secured by firewall, and I use secure copy to copy components of the repository to each target server as I need them. I then use my basic local repository technique when I do perform my install or update. What this means is that each server must have adequate space for repository. I'm currently considering a shared repository within each secured environment - is it expected that the size of the repository will increase significantly? 44:53 Do you have any comments on us running a single cluster that span across two data centers and two different states? 47:35 We are running a BPM server on top of WAS V7.5.1 and we have about 12 cells in our environment. This makes it difficult for us to push changes to these cells, and what was suggested to us was the Rational Automation Framework. What are your stands on this as it relates to installing and maintaining all these different levels across different cells? 50:17 We have a number of applications in a mix and match environment consisting of WAS V6.1 and V7.0. Is there any migration script we can run or migration path we can follow if we decide to move to WAS V8? 53:38 Using Installation Manager can we record a custom WebSphere response file from the command line without using the graphical interface? 57:35 Can the Installation Manager be used on profiles as well? 59:38 We currently have WAS V7.0 with several Fixpacks on it. Our process of installation is very automated with scripts. We also customize our profiles with Jypthon and other scripts. Will my old scripts continue to work after migrating to WAS V8? 62:26 Is there a way we can add an existing JVM to a new cluster group? 64:30 Is it possible to migrate a profile from one cluster group to another cluster group? 66:19 When installing WebSphere plug-ins I've noticed that the default location is now different than the default location in the previous version, which was in the web server directory. Is there any reason why the default location has changed, and is there a way we can change it to be installed under the HTTP server directory, similar to the previous version? 69:12 Closing remarks 70:44 End of Call
