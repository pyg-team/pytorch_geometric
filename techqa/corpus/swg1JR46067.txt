ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When doing migration from BPM Standard V7.5.x, Teamworks 7, or
   WebSphere Lombardi Edition to BPM Advanced V8.0.0 or V8.0.1, we
   need to configure Common database by creating a new Common
   database
   and running configCommonDB command. In the V8.0.0 and V8.0.1
   info center, they only state to configure a new Common database,
   but lack steps on how to configure the database. It is a new
   area for
   BPM Standard, Teamworks, and WLE users, so these steps should be
   added to documenation.
   
   "Installing IBM BPM V8.0 for migration"
   (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.0/com.
   ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/upgrade/topic/installing_80.html?cp=SSFPJS_8.0
   .0)
   - Step 3 in sub-section under "Installing and migrating to IBM
   Business Process Manager V8.0 stand-alone environment":
   "If the target is an IBM Business Process Manager Advanced
   Process Center or IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Process
   Server installation, configure the common database as described
   in Upgrading existing databases"
   - Step 2 in sub-section under "Installing and migrating to IBM
   Business Process Manager V8.0 network deployment environment"
   "If the target platform is IBM Business Process Manager Advanced
    Process Center or IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Process
    Server, either enable the option to initialize the database for
    the deployment manager profile or configure the common database
    as described in Upgrading existing databases after the
   deployment manager profile creation.
   
   "Upgrading existing databases"
   (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.0/com.
   ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/upgrade/topic/upgrading_existing_dbs_80.html?c
   p=SSFPJS_8.0.0)
   The last sentence under "Upgrade tips":
   "Because you unchecked the initial database during profile
   creation, after you upgrade the existing database, you must
   configure a new Common database and Business Process
   Choreographer database. Refer to "Installing IBM BPM V8.0 for
   migration.""
   
   We need to add detailed steps about how to configure the new
   Common
   database after profile creation.
   
   1. Go to the directory containing the configCommonDB script, the
   configCommonDB.sh script on Linux and UNIX platforms, or the
   configCommonDB.bat script on Windows platforms. You specified
   its location in the Database script output directory field on
   the Database configuration panel in the Profile Management
   Tool. By default, this location is:
   On Linux and Unix platform:
     profile_root/dbscripts/CommonDB/db_type/db_name
   On Windows platform:
     profile_root\dbscripts\CommonDB\db_type\db_name
   
   You must pass the createDB parameter to the configCommonDB
   script if you want to create a new local database; otherwise an
   existing database will be used.
   Note: For Oracle, the batch file creates tables on an existing
   schema, so the createDB parameter should not be specified.
   
   For example:
   configCommonDB.sh createDB - create tables in a new database
   configCommonDB.sh - create tables using an existing database
   
   2. Use your standard database definition tools, native commands,
    and procedures to create the required tables by running this
   script. The script contains only basic statements for creating
   databases, tables, and indexes.
