APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are attempting to run the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS
   Discovery Library Adapter program EYU9XDDA.  In the SYSPRINT
   output you may see the following messages repeated over and over
   
   .
   EYUXD1017I I mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss  API command(FEEDBACK) for
      object(                ) returned RESPONSE(INVALIDPARM)
      REASON(THREAD).
   EYUXD1017I I mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss  API command(FEEDBACK) for
      object(                ) returned RESPONSE(INVALIDPARM)
      REASON(THREAD).
   EYUXD1017I I mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss  API command(FEEDBACK) for
      object(                ) returned RESPONSE(INVALIDPARM)
      REASON(THREAD).
   ... and so on
   .
   This can happen if the CMAS you are trying to connect to in the
     SET CMAS xxxxxxxx
   command is not running or not available at the time, or if you
   have specified
     SET FEEDBACK VERBOSE
   for diagnostic purposes.
   .
   If left running long enough, the job may abend with an S878.

   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS   *
   *                 Discovery Library Adapter program EYU9XDDA   *
   *                 must be rerun from a library to which this   *

   ****************************************************************
      When you specify SET FEEDBACK VERBOSE in the command input
   file for program EYU9XDDA, detailed diagnostic information will
   be written to the SYSPRINT file.  This includes FEEDBACK data
   for any API command which returns any response other than OK,
   including NODATA.  However the thread token and result token
   passed to the CPSM API FEEDBACK command were not initialized,
   so the FEEDBACK command returns a RESPONSE of INVALIDPARM and
   a REASON of THREAD.  The error analysis subroutine is called
   recursively to analyze the failure of the FEEDBACK command,
   causing FEEDBACK to be called again.  This results in the ob-
   served cascade of EYUXD1017I messages.
      The logical record length of the SYSPRINT file was 133 bytes
   but the message staging buffer was defined to be 132 bytes long.
   This caused the character following the buffer in storage to be
   appended to each message written to SYSPRINT.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *     Module EYU9XDDA was modified to insure that the proper
   thread and result set tokens are available to the FEEDBACK
   command.  In addition, FEEDBACK will not be called for an API
   response of NODATA since the resulting FEEDBACK data provides
   no useful information.
      Include file EYUBXDDA (DLA Common Subroutines and Variables)
   was modified to increase the size of the staging buffer for the
   SYSPRINT file to 133 bytes.
