QUESTION
 What is the procedure to enable trace logging to troubleshoot TIP runtime issues/errors? 

CAUSE
You can use trace logging to assist in monitoring system performance and diagnosing problems. Since trace logs can be quite verbose and include many unrelated errors, resetting the logs and then reproducing the problem issue can reduce the time required for log analysis for specific issues. 

ANSWER
The PD Collect Tool can be used to easily collect logs and files from the server. Instructions for using the PD Collect Tool are available in the following technical note:

To manually set TIP traces use the following steps: 

Enable trace logging. 

 1. Log into the Tivoli Integrated Portal console. For TIP 2.x releases, after logging in navigate to Settings > Websphere Administrative Console. 
 2. Navigate to Troubleshooting -> Logs & Trace 
 3. Click on the Server1 -> Select Diagnostic Trace Service. Increase the Maximum Number of Historical Files from 1 to 10. 
 4. Click Apply, then select Change Log Detail Levels. 
 5. Click on Runtime tab to enable tracing for the TIP process that is currently running. Enabling tracing from the Runtime tab will keep tracing active until the next time the TIP server process is stopped. To make tracing persistent even after stopping and restarting the TIP server process click the Configuration tab instead. 
 6. Clear the trace string in the Groups box and replace it with the following:
    
    *=info: com.ibm.isc.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.*=all: com.ibm.iscportal.*=all
    
    Note: For chart related issues add the string ": com.ibm.tivoli.*=all" 
 7. Click on the Apply button. 
 8. If you enabled tracing from the Configuration tab in step 4, then click the "Save" link that appears at the top of the page. ("Save to master configuration")


Stop the TIP server 
This procedure is only required if tracing was enabled from the Configuration tab in step 4 above.

   c:\<TIP home>\profiles\TIPProfile\bin\stopServer.bat server1
   


Clear the TIP system logs directory 
This is an optional step, and it can only be performed if the TIP server process is not running. Resetting the logs can be helpful to reduce the log file size and exclude extraneous log history. Remove the contents of the following directory: 

.<TIP home>profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1 
Restart the TIP server 
This procedure is only required if tracing was enabled from the Configuration tab in step 4 above.

 * 
 * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21437655&amp;aid=4]
   c:\<TIP home>\profiles\TIPProfile\bin\startServer.bat server1 
 * 


Once tracing is enabled, reproduce the TIP runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. Collect the logs from <TIP home>profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server1 and attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR). Include the time the issue was reproduced in the PMR update.
