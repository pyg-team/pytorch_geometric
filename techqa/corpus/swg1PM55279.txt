ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you drag Rational Software Architect model elements into a
   Requisite Pro project after a number of iterations, you will get
   the 'IRJQ0054 Error creating requirement...' error message and
   you will not be able to complete the action.
   
   The following steps reproduce the problem:
   
   1. Open RequisitePro and create 10 RequisitePro projects named
   'Test_charge_X_rqp', with an Microsoft Access database, where
   the variable 'X' is a number that increases after each created
   project
   
   2. Create a RequisitePro project named 'Test_fixe_rqp', with an
   MS Access database
   
   3. Open RSA and create a model project named 'Test_fixe_rsa'
   
   4. Remove the projet 'Test_fixe_rsa' from workspace by
   right-clicking the project and selecting 'Delete' from the
   context menu.  Make sure that you do NOT delete the contents of
   the project
   
   5. Switch to the 'Requirements' perspective in RSA and go
   through the following steps:
   
   a. Import the model project 'Test_fixe_rsa'
   b. Open the corresponding RequisitePro project 'Test_fixe_rqp'
   c. In the 'Test_fixe_rsa' project, create a usecase, a class, an
   operation in this class, and a sequence diagram
   d. Save the model
   e. Drag and drop the usecase, operation and interaction from the
   model project to a package of the corresponding RequisitePro
   project 'Test_fixe_rqp'
   f. Remove the projects 'Test_fixe_rsa' and 'Test_fixe_rqp' from
   workspace without deleting the contents of the projects
   g. Create a model project named 'Test_charge_X_rsa', where 'X'
   is a number that increases at each iteration of the loop
   h. Open the corresponding RequisitePro project
   'Test_charge_X_rqp'
   i. In the 'Test_charge_X_rsa' project, create a usecase, a
   class, an operation in this class, and a sequence diagram
   j. Save the model
   k. Drag and drop the usecase, the operation and the interaction
   from the model project to a package of the corresponding
   RequisitePro project 'Test_charge_X_rqp'
   l. In the 'Test_charge_1_rsa' project, create a usecase, a
   class, an operation in this class, and a sequence diagram
   m. Save the model
   n. Drag the usecase, operation and interaction from the model
   project to a package of the corresponding RequisitePro project
   'Test_charge_1_rqp'
   o. Repeat the Steps 5a. to 5o. at least eight times
   
   Expected result: The drag & drop action at the eighth iteration
   completes without errors.
   
   Actual result: The drag & drop action at the eighth iteration
   terminates with the following error message: 'RequisitePro
   Error: IRJQ0054E Error creating requirement - Reason: Exception
   occurred. Reason: Exception occurred'. No output is written in
   the .log file. If you click 'OK' on the error dialog box and
   try to drag the model elements into the ReqPro project again,
   the error message will reappear and you will not be able to drag
   the model elements into the ReqPro project successfully.
   
   WORKAROUND
   
   After you get the error, the following steps enable you to
   workaround the problem:
   
   1. Save any changes and close RSA
   
   2. Reopen RSA
   
   3. Reopen the project
   
   4. Drag the model elements to the Requisite Pro project

   ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of Rational RequisitePro integration for Rational
   Software Architect creating links to Rational RequisitePro
   projects based in access.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The Requirements perspective in Rational Software Architect
   allows to open a number of RequisitePro projects as opposed
   from other RequisitePro clients.
   When the projects being opened has Microsoft Access as back
   end database, you will not be able to create links to more
   than 7 RequisitePro projects opened in the Requirement
   Explorer at the same time. When you try to create the link
   to the 8th project you will get an error message:
   
   IRJQ0054E Error creating requirement.Reason: Object variable
   or With block variable not set.
   
   This is because the integration can't handle more Access
   connections.
   This issue only happens when RequisitePro projects reside in
   Access.
   
   Other error messages that may appear:
   IRJQ0054E Error creating requirement.
   Reason: Error retrieving the database key.
   Reason: [ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Cannot open any more
   tables.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It is a limitation of the RequisitePro integration for
   Rational Software Architect (RSA). You can not create links
   to more than 7 projects opened in the Requirement Explorer.
   To workaround this problem, remove one or two projects from
   the Requirement Explorer by right click - Remove Project
   (you can add them later).
   If the problem persists, restart RSA and open less than 8
   RequisiteProjects.
   If you plan to use RequisitePro extensively it is
   recommended to use an Enterprise Database back end such as
   IBM DB2.
