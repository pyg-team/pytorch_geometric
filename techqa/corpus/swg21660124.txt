PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to capture a SOAP request message as a string in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB)?


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can enable a SOAP debug trace to capture the SOAP request as a string:

1. Find the mqsiprofile file in the MQSI install path (MQSI_InstallPath/bin/mqsiprofile) 
2. Edit and save the mqsiprofile file, adding the following two lines:
MQSI_SOAP_DEBUG=1
export MQSI_SOAP_DEBUG
3. Restart the broker by using the updated mqsiprofile
4. You can check that the SOAP request and response is a string in the stdout file, which is located in the directory $MQSI_WORKPATH/components/<my_broker_name>/<EG_UUID>/stdout
