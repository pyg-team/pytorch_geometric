   Additional Closure Information:
   Technical explanation of the defect:
   The part document has links pointing to a catalog. The
   catalog has been deleted from outside CATIA, but still the
   link for the catalog is shown in File->SendTo Directory.
   This Ghost Link is observed in a CATPart.
   Technical explanation of the correction:
   A new CATDUA rule FTA_16 has been written to check/clean such
   external link (Catalog Link) that are pointing to the non
   existing document.
   Thus the rule will check if there is any link pointing to a
   catalog and whether the catalog exists. If it is not the
   case, the external link to the catalog will be deleted and
   the problem is fixed.
