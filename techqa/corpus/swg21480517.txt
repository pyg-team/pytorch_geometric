Title: IBM SPSS Custom Tables does not appear in the Analyze menu - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have IBM SPSS Statistics installed. I purchased the Custom Tables module and installed that module. When I pull down the Analyze menu, though, I don't see a menu item for Tables? Why is this? I ran SHOW LICENSE and it shows that the Custom Tables module is installed. How can I get the Custom Tables dialog box? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the directory where SPSS is installed you'll find a file called SPSSPROD.INF. This is a text file that you may edit. You'll find a line that says [setup] and a list of the modules that SPSS has installed. 

For example:
[Setup]
Setup=BasTabProAdvTrdCytCatMvaConMapMsaCspTreVldPrgViz 

 

If you do not see Msa on this line add to that list of modules Msa.

This refers to Mesa, a "code-name" for SPSS Custom Tables. Save this file, exit SPSS if it's already open, and start SPSS. You should then see the Tables item in the Analyze menu. This is a one-time fix as well, so you shouldn't have to do this every time you start SPSS.

If Msa is already in the file, make sure the code was generated as "10" for the feature code of the Custom tables module.
If you have IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0, the correct feature code for Custom Tables would be "1210"
