APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  tacmd login fails intermittently on distributed platforms due
   to calling a non reentrant function to get the password for
   validation.
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Not recreatable locally
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  tacmd login sometimes fails on distributed platforms
   
   
   The "tacmd login" command sometimes fails on distributed
   platforms.  There are two prerequisites for this APAR to occur :
   
   (1) hub monitoring server has been configured with 'Security:
   Validate User ?=yes'
   (2) hub monitoring server must be running on AIX, Solaris or
   Linux operating system
   
   If above two prerequisites are present then invocation of ==>
   
       # tacmd login -s <tems host name> -u <userID> -p <password>
   
   may fail because another process, tacmd or otherwise, that is
   running on hub monitoring server machine is at the same time
   also retrieving password for a different userID, per operating
   system API.  The resulting effect is tacmd is comparing the
   entered password against different userID's password and thus
   the failure to authenticate entered <password> for entered
   <userID>.
   
   Here is example of the message that will occur when tacmd login
   fails [ note, there are other reasons that can cause tacmd login
   to present this same message] :
   
   ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
   tacmd login -s abcxyz -u bozo -p clown
   
   Validating user...
   
   KUIC00006E: The specified user name or password is incorrect.
   
   You are not logged in because you specified an incorrect user
   name or password or you do not have permission to log in.
   
   Verify the correct user name and password and that you have
   permission to log in.
   
   KUIC00003E: Cannot connect to a hub monitoring server at
   addresses: https://abcxyz:3661 [https://abcxyz:3661]
   
   Make sure the hub monitoring server on abcxyz is available and
   configured for the specified protocols and ports.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A correction was made to use reentrant version of operating
   system APIs to prevent the retrieval of wrong password.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
