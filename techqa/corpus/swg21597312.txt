Title: IBM Application not found on Solaris Zone - United States

Text:
Zone Websphere Weblogic whinham applications lsof zonecfg TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Applications running on Solaris Zone, such as WebSphere or Weblogic, are not discovered by TADDM 

CAUSE
Since lsof does not run on Zone machines, the parent of the Zone machine must be discovered in order to correctly discover applications running on the virtual Zone machines.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the GenericServerSensor for the target contains "isVirtualZone=true" and there is no ZoneGeneric sensor, then the target is a child Zone and the parent has not been discovered. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the parent to the scope of machines discovered.
