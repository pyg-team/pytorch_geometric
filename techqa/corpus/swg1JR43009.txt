APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Process Portal, clicking on the Task Priority column header
   (to sort the list of process instances by priority) results in
   alphabetical sorting of the priority values, instead of sorting
   based on the actual priority levels.
   
   The priority levels should be sorted in this order (highest to
   lowest):
   
   Highest
   High
   Normal
   Low
   Lowest
   
   Instead, they are sorted in alphabetical order:
   
   High
   Highest
   Low
   Lowest
   Normal

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In Process Portal, clicking on the      *
   *                      Task Priority column header             *
   *                      (to sort the list of process            *
   *                      instances by priority) results in       *
   *                      alphabetical sorting of the priority    *
   *                      values, instead of sorting              *
   *                      based on the actual priority levels.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   With user triggered sorting (i. e. triggered by clicking on a
   column header), sorting of any column is alphabetical.
   Sorting of priority values should not be handled in this
   fashion.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Associating a numeric value with each priority value (in order
   of priority level) and sorting the Task Priority column based
   on the numeric value resolves the issue.
