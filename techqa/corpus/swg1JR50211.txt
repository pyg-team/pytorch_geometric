ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you created an inbound web service in IBM Business Process
   Manager (BPM) V7.5.1.x, the namespace for the complex types
   should contain the snapshot name. For snapshots, the namespace
   is
   http://<application_name>/<snapshot_name>/<web_servicename>. [http://<application_name>/<snapshot_name>/<web_servicename>.]
   For the tip, the namespace is
   http://<application_name>/<web_servicename>. [http://<application_name>/<web_servicename>.]
   
   However, if you create a snapshot in IBM Process Center and
   access the WSDL for that snapshot and then access the tip
   snapshot, you find that the WSDL for the tip snapshot &#65442;&#65506;&#65410;&#65452;&#65506;&#65412;&#65442;s
   complex type namespace wrongly contains the name of the
   last-created snapshot.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The last-created snapshot in Process Center has the same
   snapshot ID as the tip if no modifications have been made to
   the tip. Therefore, the web service cache for the SOAP WSDL
   wrongly considers the last-created snapshot and the tip to be
   the same and shows that the wrong complex type has been used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V7.5.1.1 that fixes the code in
   the inbound web service so that the cache determines which is
   the tip from last-created snapshot and fixes the WSDL complex
   type namespace.
