Title: IBM Cannot be computed because there is insufficient memory. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS 15 and run a crosstab with SPSS Exact Tests but I receive the message that the test cannot be computed: "b. Cannot be computed because there is insufficient memory.". I have 2GB RAM on my machine, how is it possible to compute Pearson Chi-Square's Exact Sig. (2-sided). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This part of the syntax:

/METHOD=EXACT TIMER(5).

tells SPSS to try to calculate for 5 minutes before quitting. You can increase that number for SPSS to try longer. However, if you keep increasing it and it still doesn't finish, it can be very time consuming to keep trying, so it might be a better idea to switch your method to Monte Carlo because it has a 99% confidence interval and it's not likely to be off by that much. In the end, you have to decide whether or not it's worth the time to get the exact value
