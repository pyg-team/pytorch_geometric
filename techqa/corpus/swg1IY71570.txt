ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title:  ITIM: read only fields not working properly
   
   Problem Description:   Here is what's going on.  I created a
   person
   entry form which includes
   some read-only attributes and some attributes allow to modify
   from the
   customization interface.  Few of the allow modify attributes I
   set the
   constraint.  For example pager must be 10 digits in length no
   '-'.  When
   I go in modify a record enter an invalid pager and hit submit
   button an
   error message is presented, I hit OK then the form allow me to
   modify
   read-only attributes.  Here are some of the screen shots in
   sequence.
   
   open a record:
   
   <screenshot of a person record.  many of the attributes are read
   only>
   
   Go to Contact Tab Enter invalid pager number then hit Submit:
   
   <screenshot of a person record.  customer is updating an
   attribute with
   incorrect constraints>
   
   An error message box, hit OK:
   
   <screenshot of a dialog box.  The form contains the following
   validation
   errors.  The Pager Number field in Contact Information tab is
   Number
   only, non-numeric characters were found.>
   
   Now you see the screen below allow to modify read-only
   attributes
   
   <screenshot of all the attributes (even read only) able to be
   writeable>
   
   
   All screenshots are saved in
   \PMR_Attachments\BellSouth\43487\screenshots.doc
   
   Customer Recreate: Yes, and so can I
   
   Desired Behavior: don't want read-only attributes to be
   writeable.  this
   is a security risk!
   
   Business Justification (enh):
   
   Steps to Duplicate: In user interface customization, make one
   attribute
   READONLY, and one attribute with a constraint.  Then when you
   modify
   that user, violate the constraint for that one attribute and
   Submit.  It
   will give you a dialog box saying to fix the constraint.  Now,
   the form
   updates and you can see that ALL ATTRIBUTES are NOT readonly and
   they
   are writeable
   
   Feel free to contact me fkwok@us.ibm.com and use my ITIM server
   to
   validate this if you cannot reproduce.
   
   
   Environment: ITIM 4.5.1 FP36 (customer). ITIM 4.5.1 IF47 (my
   lab)
