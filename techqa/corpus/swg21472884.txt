QUESTION
 You have a CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) IP interconnectivity (IPIC) connection to CICS Transaction Gateway (CICS TG) defined with USERAUTH set to VERIFY on the IPCONN definition. You run the sample transaction EC01 using EciB1 from CICS TG, passing the correct USERID and PASSWORD. Although processing is otherwise nomal, you receive message DFHIS1027 with the USERID as "????????". If an incorrect USERID or PASSWORD is supplied, you see 4 DFHIS1027 messages, with the USERID field showing the actual value in the second message, and "????????" in the USERID field for the other 3 messages. You want to know, why is the DFHIS1027 message occurring with the sample EC01 transaction? 

ANSWER
The EciB1 process with connectivity to CICS TG through IPIC to CICS TS and USERAUTH=VERIFY security is working as expected from a Batch job.

EciB1 has no "knowledge" that the CICS TS region it is connecting to requires security so it attempts to start the EC01 transaction with no USERID or PASSWORD; this maps to an IPIC flow that does not contain an IS8 header. This will trigger message "DFHIS1027 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhis/IS1027.html] Security violation has been detected using IPCONN ipconn and transaction id EC01 by userid userid"and MISMATCH_MESSAGE_VERIFY with sense 080F6051 in the CICS TS region if security is required, and an error will be returned as expected. Once the security error is returned and the USERID and PASSWORD are supplied on the next call, the IPIC flow will contain an IS8 header and it should work appropriately, based on the credentials supplied.
