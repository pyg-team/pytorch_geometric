APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When testing a connection to a standby instance of a WebSphere
   MQ v7.0.1 queue manager, this fails with a 2059 error.  The
   documentation states "Set the listener CONTROL to Queue Manager
   or Queue Manager start to start the listener running when the
   queue manager starts running, even in standby mode".
   
   WebSphere MQ Explorer

   The listener starts as part of the active queue manager
   instance start up, but not the standby instance. In a multi-
   instance queue manager configuration the standby queue manager
   requires manual starting of the listener. The manual will be
   updated to clarify listener start up procedures on multi-
   instance queue managers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Start listener at command line with runmqlsr.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using multi-instance queue managers
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere MQ Explorer manual suggests setting the listener
   CONTROL to Queue Manager to start the listener when the queue
   manager starts running, even in standby mode. This fails as the
   standby queue manager does not have access to queue manager
   data and so the listener can not be started automatically.
   However the listener can be started manually.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ Explorer manual will be modified as shown
   below.
   
   Section:  e_managingmultiinstancequeuemanage
   
   WebSphere MQ Explorer
   Configuring WebSphere MQ using WebSphere MQ Explorer
   Managing multi-instance queue managers
   
   The fourth paragraph which explains about starting the
   listener will be modified as shown below.
   
   It is important you test the connections to all the instances
   of the queue manager when they are in standby as well as active
   status. Make sure that the listener is running on both the
   active and standby instances of the queue manager. A standby
   instance queue manager does not have access to the queue
   manager file system and does not automatically start listeners
   until it becomes the active instance. In order to be able to
   test the connections to both active and standby instances, it
   is easiest to start the listener for both instances from the
   command line.
   
   Note you should not have listeners started manually as well
   as being configured for start up along with the queue manager.
   Doing this will result in errors at queue manager start up as
   the listener service will fail due to the port already being in
   use.
