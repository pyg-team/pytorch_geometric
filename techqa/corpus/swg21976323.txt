Title: IBM Extending the classpath of selected InfoSphere MDM Collaboration Server services with custom jars - United States

Text:
custom jar deployment TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I extend the classpath with custom jars for selected InfoSphere MDM Collaboration Server services only as using the default custom jar deployment mechanism causes conflicts with IBM WebSphere Application Server classes and prevents the appsvr service to start (ADMU3011E: Server launched but failed initialization). 

CAUSE
There might be the need to use IBM Websphere Application Server jar files within the scheduler or workflow context. But when using the standard custom jar deployment mechanism as documented in the Knowledgecenter, these jars will be added to the appsvr service context as well and might then prevent a successful start of the IBM Master Data Management appsvr service. 

ANSWER
To add the desired jar file to the scheduler (or other selected services) only, apply the following steps: 

1) Create in directory $TOP/bin/conf/classpath/ a new jars-<yourname>.txt file containing the desired jar file names (do not use the full path name):

jars-sched.txt
com.ibm.ws.ejb.thinclient_8.5.0.jar

2) Add a new entry under the# extensions section in file $TOP/bin/conf/env_settings.ini. The extension name sched must match with the suffix you used in the new file jars-sched.txt,


 * [extension 
 * sched
 * ]
 * 
 * enabled=yes
 * 
 * services=scheduler,
 * 
 * home=
 * /opt/WebSphere/85/AppServer/runtimes/
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3) Run $TOP/bin/ updateRtClasspath.sh to update the classpath 

4) Restart InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaborative Edition 

You can open $TOP/logs/scheduler_<HOSTNAME>/svc.out to check whether the classpath has been updated with the desired jar files. RELATED INFORMATION
