ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After installing/upgrading to MobileFirst 6.3, many
   "java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for
   bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle" messages may be printed
    into trace.log and SystemErr.log
   
   00000902 SystemErr     R java.util.MissingResourceException:
   Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle,
   key could not piggyback configprofile due to invalid or
   incomplete headers sent from client

   Additional Keywords:
   
   Worklight Versions Affected: 6.3
   
   Initial Impact: Medium
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can resolve the problem by adding this to your trace
   specification:
   com.worklight.gadgets.serving.ClientConfigProfileServlet.*=sever
   e
   
   You can leave any other "com.worklight.*" part of the trace
   specification as it is, it's OK to have both.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users may see incorrect warning message printed to           *
   * java.util.logging output (console or file) as a result of    *
   * basic usage of the WL client API.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * An internal method call is incorrectly attempting to produce *
   * a warn message for conditions that are expected in the       *
   * ClientConfigProfileServlet.  When the warn API is called, a  *
   * message is passed as a parameter when a properties file key  *
   * should have been passed.  This results in an internal        *
   * exception, which in turn prints a stack trace and error to   *
   * the log.                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Install the ifix that contains this APAR, which changes the
   internal API call to call debug instead of warn, which reduces
   the verbosity of the log, and is an API call that permits a
   message rather than requiring a properties file key.
