APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a fast way for CICS and RACF to verify a password.
   And there is a slower way for CICS and RACF to verify a
   password.  For valid passwords, the fast way ought to work.
   But with a 7 character ( or less ) valid password, CICS doesn't
   do the fast way correctly and so has to also do the slow way.
   Having to do the slow way causes more IO to the RACF datasets.
   And it causes RODISPT time to increase, potentially enough such
   that the RO TCB could become a bottleneck.
      You can tell that this is happening with a trace.  There
   will be a trace entry like this:
   XSSB  EXIT  FUNCTION(INQUIRE_PASSWORD_DATA) RESPONSE(OK)
    SAF_RESPONSE(0) SAF_REASON(0) ESM_RESPONSE(0) ESM_REASON(0)
    FASTPATH_AUTH(NO)
   This trace entry shows that the Inquire_password_data call
   completed with an OK response and all SAF and ESM response
   and reasons codes were 0.  This means that the password was
   valid.  But the FASTPATH_AUTH(NO) means that CICS was not
   able to verify the password using the fast method.  When
   the call completes OK, FASTPATH_AUTH should say YES.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use 8-character passwords

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS VERIFY PASSWORD performance is     *
   *                      degraded when using passwords which are *
   *                      less than 8 characters long.            *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD and internal CICS use of VERIFY
   PASSWORD has degraded performance when using passwords which are
   less than 8 characters long.
   DFHXSSB uses a fastpath mechanism to check that the password
   is correct. This always fails with passwords that are
   less than 8 characters long. The effect is that DFHXSSB issues
   a RACROUTE VERIFYX to validate the password. This results in
   additional RACF IO causing a performance degradation.
   .
   A separate problem can affect 8 character password validation
   resulting in the same unnecessary RACROUTE VERIFYX call.
   However, this problem is intermittent and most of the time
   the fastpath mechanism works with 8 character passwords.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHXSSB has been changed to ensure that fastpath validation of
   all length passwords succeeds when the password is correct.
