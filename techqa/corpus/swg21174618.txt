Title: IBM Why are we receiving a core dump each time we encounter an A147 CICS abend with a Micro Focus COBOL program? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a Micro Focus program receives a signal the COBOL runtime will dump a core if core_on_error=1 is set in the cobconfig file. CICS will then terminate the cicsas process with a A147 abend instead of the A583 abend.
This may or may not be the action you would like. The core can be stopped by removing the variable or setting it to 0. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Have the customer check $COBDIR/etc/cobconfig file. This is a runtime configuration file for MF Cobol. If it contains the line 

set core_on_error=1

When a process running cobol programs encounter a signal the COBOL runtime will dump core.
