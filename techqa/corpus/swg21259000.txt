PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are looking to retrieve a WSDL from a Web Service Proxy service with the IBM WebSphere DataPower XS40 or XI50 appliance 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A WSDL can be retrieved from a Web Service Proxy by allowing the GET method in the HTTP or HTTPS front side handler and going to the URL of the service including "?wsdl" for the query string such as: 



http://service:port/uri?wsdl 


By default, the GET method is disabled within a Web Service Proxy. If the GET method is not enabled, you will not be able to retrieve the WSDL from the URL.

NOTE: When a WSDL contains include or import references to other documents, the WSDL that is output from DataPower will also contain include or import references. If you are unable to access your complete WSDL or if you find that something is missing when using this method, contact IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322] for assistance with troubleshooting the problem.
