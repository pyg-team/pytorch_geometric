APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. The Transaction Tracking Data collector does not generate
   STARTED_INBOUND and OUTBOUND_FINIHSED events when handling KD4
   header in the SOAP request in the presence of SOA DC in the
   combined DC.
   2. If the SOAP response does not have a header (not created or
   stripped out for some reason), ITCAM should create the header
   block and insert the KD4 header.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  See L2 support
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   
   ITCAM for Transaction Tracking for WebSphere environments where
   ITCAM for SOA Data Collector is present.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   1. Web service requests from clients that do not have ITCAM for
   WAS (like DataPower) does not generate the correct Transaction
   tracking events STARTED_INBOUND and OUTBOUND_FINISHED.  The SFID
   and SFID Correlation IDs are absent from these events that
   prevents the proper stitching between these systems.
   
   2. If the SOAP response does not have a header (not created or
   stripped out for some reason), ITCAM should create the header
   block and insert the KD4 header.
