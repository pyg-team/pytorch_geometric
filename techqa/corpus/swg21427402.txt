CTGSM0901E The session management server was not able to initialize 
the Tivoli Access Manager Runtime for Java: 
[ 
[ 
HPDBA0287E Automatic refresh could not be performed because the 
certificate has expired. 


ANSWER
1- find the .properties file for the SMS server instance. This is usually 
located at 
. 
./AppSrv01/installedApps/Cell01/DavidSess.ear/DSess.war/WEB-INF/ 
SMS-One/pdjrtecfg.properties 
. 
2- Run the following command using the name of the config file found on 
your server, and using the java for your WAS server: 
. 
java com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.SvrSslCfg -action replcert -admin_id sec_master -admin_pwd **** -cfg_file ./AppSrv01/installedApps/Cell01/DavidSess.ear/DSess.war/WEB-INF/SMS-One/pdjrtecfg.properties 

This will generate a new certificate.
