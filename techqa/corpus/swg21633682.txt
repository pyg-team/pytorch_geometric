PROBLEM
 Customers whose Users utilize an updated version of Mozilla Firefox have reported an issue when modifying a Repeating Meeting using SmartCloud Notes Web. Users will see the Error "A problem has occurred which may have caused the current operation to fail." in the SmartCloud Notes Web UI - expanding to show the Full Console will show an error similar to the following: 

Domino Build V851SAAS_M10_03212013 (Linux for Intel)

Through investigation, it appears that an Error will occur with any modification of a Repeating Meeting using FF (with the exception of changing the Alarm). Some examples of actions that will trigger this error are outlined below:


 * Editing A Repeating Meeting's Name 
 * Rescheduling A Repeating Meeting 
 * Adding Person To A Repeating Meeting 
 * Deleting Any Instance Of A Repeating Meeting

CAUSE
The underlying cause of this issue is linked to a Firefox prompt - "Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs". 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&amp;aid=1]


If a user selects "OK" to the prompt, the Error users are experiencing in the SmartCloud Notes Web UI occurs. However, if a User selects Cancel, the expected "Changing Repeating Entry" Calendar Dialog box appears and you are able select which meeting instance you would like your change to apply to:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&amp;aid=2]


Selecting OK to the Firefox prompt does not allow this "Changing Repeating Entry" Calendar Dialog box from displaying and therefore prevents you from rescheduling, deleting, or modifying your Meetings without error.

NOTE: This issue does not occur in Single-Instance Calendar Entries As The Above "Changing Repeating Entry" Calendar Dialog box only occurs on the modification Repeating Meetings.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Further investigation into this prompt showed a setting we can enable in the Firefox Browser to avoid this prompt and therefore, prevent the Error from occurring. Outlined below is a set of steps to work around this prompt: 


1) Open Firefox and enter about:config in the URL Address bar

2) Right-click in the preference area and select New --> Integer - See Screen Shot below:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=3]


3) Paste in the following preference name: dom.successive_dialog_time_limit and select OK

4) Next, for the Integer Value, enter 0 and select OK - See Screen Shot below:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=4]


5) Observe the new Preference in the View and ensure it appears as outlined below.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633682&aid=5]


6) Lastly, restart your Firefox browser and log into your SmartCloud Notes Account and test. You should now no longer see this issue when working with your Calendar Entries.
