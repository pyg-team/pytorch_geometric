APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After syndication of navigator components the result designs
   are
   not in correct order on subscriber machine
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue
   
   1.Create a new navigator component on the syndicator
   (Basic settings -> Start type: Current top level site area,
   Include
   start: true, Ancestor level: all, Descendent level: all,
   Preceding
   siblings level: none, Next siblings level: none, Show top
   level site
   area: false, Show content: true, Expand current navigator
   branch one
   level: false, Expand navigator to display current site area:
   false,
   
   Results per page: 10, Start page: 1, Maximum pages to include:
   10,
   Pages to read ahead: 10, Distinguish items with no children
   using the
   final navigator design: false).
   2.Add 10 result designs to the navigator (by adding the markup
   to the
   design, then click the button ?Add result design?). Include
   the
   correct level in the result design, for example use a design
   like
   ?<div>Result Design N</div>? where N is the current navigator
   result
   design level     (1-10).
   3.Click save and close.
   4.Wait a few seconds/minutes until the Navigator is visible on
   the
   subscriber. Open the navigator on the subscriber and on the
   syndicator
   and verify the result design. You will see the difference.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary:
    Navigator result designs do not syndicate in the correct order
   
   Detailed Problem Description:
   The result design fields of a navigator component are not
   syndicated in order.  They are in a random order when comparing
   the syndicator and  the subscriber.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Analysis:
   The layer used to transport the node from syndicator to
   subscriber used a HashMap.  HashMap returns the items in an
   unspecified order.
   
   Problem Solution:
   The code has been updated to use a LinkedHashMap resulting in
   the items being in the same order as the original.
