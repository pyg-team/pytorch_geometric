Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat affect the IBM FlashSystem models 840 and 900 - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat to which the IBM® FlashSystem™ 840 and FlashSystem™ 900 are susceptible. An exploit of these vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-6816, CVE-2016-6817, and CVE-2016-6796) could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, cause an application to enter an infinite loop, or bypass a configured SecurityManager, 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6816 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6817 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6817]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119156 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119156] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-6796 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6796]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions. By modifying configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass a configured SecurityManager.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118404 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118404] for the current score
