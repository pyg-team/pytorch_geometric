Title: IBM Operations Analytics Predictive Insights cannot open multiple tabs within JazzSM 1.1.3 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM) version 1.1.3, content that belongs to Operations Analytics Predictive Insights will attempt to re-use a tab within JazzSM if there is already an open tab that belongs to Predictive Insights. 

SYMPTOM
One symptom is that from the Console Integrations icon (or 'Snowflake' icon), if you choose the Service Diagnosis Anomaly Search option and then attempt to launch a Predictive Insights Service Diagnosis chart from there, the chart will attempt to re-use the current tab, and fail to open.
Another symptom is that, from the Detected Anomalies page, or the Event Viewer, if you right-click on an anomaly event and choose Service Diagnosis and then repeat for a second anomaly event, then the first Service Diagnosis chart will update with the new information instead of opening a second chart.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The resolution requires 2 steps.

1/ Patch JazzSM 1.1.3 up to Cumulative Patch 6 or later. 
Note that this was tested with Cumulative Patch 6.

2/ Download and run the attached shell script on both the JazzSM 1.1.3 server and on the Predictive Insights UI server (if they are different). Note that this script should be run as the user that installed JazzSM 1.1.3 and the Predictive Insights UI.

ROLLBACK
The script does also provide a rollback option.
Just run the script with a -rollback argument on both the JazzSM 1.1.3 server and on the Predictive Insights UI server (if they are different).
