 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 PowerKVM is affected by multiple glibc vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6040 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6040]
DESCRIPTION: The GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper validation of input by the iconv() function when converting IBM933, IBM935, IBM937, IBM939 or IBM1364 encoded data to UTF-8. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash. 
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/95616 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/95616] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-8121 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8121]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly check if a file is open by DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS). By performing a look-up on a database while iterating over it, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop. 
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102652 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102652] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-7817 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7817]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error in the wordexp() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the system. 
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98852 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98852] for the current score
