QUESTION
 We have successfully implemented SSO for Content Navigator using SPNEGO on WebSphere v7. We have users that span across different domains so in the event of SSO failures, is it possible to fallback to basic authentication? 

ANSWER
Here are the steps to address the issue: 

1) Logon Content Navigator WebSphere administrative console, and go to Application servers > server1 > Process definition 

2) Click Java Virtual Machine, add the following parameter
com.ibm.wsspi.security.web.failOverToBasicAuth = true 

3) Restart Server and clear IE cache, try to recreate the issue to check if it is working as expected.
