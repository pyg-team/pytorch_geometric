   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Even when one of the subject alternative name values of the SSL
   certificate matches to the hostname in SOAPRequest/HTTPRequest
   node, the node may still throw error:

   operation Operation: 'connect'.
   Error Text: 'javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: SSL Peer
   certificate did not match host name'.
