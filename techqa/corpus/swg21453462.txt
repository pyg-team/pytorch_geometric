QUESTION
 Is it possible to use a wildcard certificate on the appliance? 

ANSWER
Yes, a wildcard certificate can be used on the appliance, provided the following information is present in the appliance:

1. Required CA certificate
2. RSA key (public/private key pair) and/or PKCS12 file (which would contain both the public/private key pair along with the certificate).

If the above are present, then there should be no issue in loading the certificate on the appliance.
