ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error #: 00321 after viewing files in SmarTeam
   when using PDF files as the viewable file and using
   the Adobe Reader as the Viewer
   
   SETUP:
   ------
   Setup SMARTEAM in a High Security Vault configuration.
   
   Configure the Microsoft Word File Type in Applications Setup to
   use Adobe Reader as the Embedded Viewer (see IBM Technote
   #: 1248918)
   
   Create two MS Word documents and associated PDF files
   
   SCENARIO:
   ---------
   
   1. Launch SMARTEAM - Editor and login as joe
   
   2. Add both MS Word documents that were created during Setup to
      SMARTEAM and Check them In
   
   Note: The viewable PDF files will also be moved to the Checked
         in Vault
   
   3. View the first MS Word document
   
   ==> It views just fine and it is using Adobe Reader as the
       plug-in viewer
   
   4. While still having the Viewer tab selected, select the second
      MS Word document
   
   ==> You will receive an error message saying that the viewable
       PDF file for the first file cannot be deleted from the
       temporary directory in SmTemp
   
   Error No: 00321
   Check if you have permission to delete file <file_name> in
   folder '\\<server>\SmTemp\<server>\<server>\<temp_folder
   >'.
   Check also if another user is using the file. Contact your
   System Administrator to obtain the correct permission.
   
   5. If you click OK on the error then the file will be viewed
      just fine
   
   6. If you investigate the folder in SmTemp that is specified in
      the error message you will see that both viewable PDF files
      exist in there
   
   The system is trying to delete the viewable file after you
   switch to a different tab
   
   If you terminate the AcroRd32.exe process in Task Manager
   and then switch tabs, then the file you were viewing will get
   deleted from the temporary directory in SmTemp and no error
   will appear
   
   Therefore it is safe to assume that Acrobat Reader still has a
   lock on the file when SMARTEAM is trying to delete it, thus
   resulting in the 00321 error
   
   CONCLUSION:
   -----------
   
   This issue does not occur if you use the SmarTeam Viewer to
   view the viewable PDF files.
   
   Also, if you set Applications Setup to view the native file
   (no 'Viewer file extension' or the same extension as the native
   file), then SMARTEAM does not try to delete the file when
   switching to another tab.  When the User closes SMARTEAM -
   Editor, then the temporary folder that was created in the
   SmTemp folder on the Vault server will get deleted along with
   all the files inside it.
