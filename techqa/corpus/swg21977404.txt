PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CTGIMH055E error when starting password synchronization using the
windows plugin 

SYMPTOM
We just installed and configured the password synchronization plugin on 

one of our AD servers. We set the password of one account inside this AD server and got 
"CTGIMH055E There are no existing accounts for this person. The accounts may be inactive, or 
access is denied, or the account does not require a password." 
as result.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure you are using an ITIM Account for password sync (principal) that has system admin privileges.
The easiest way is giving the sync account the ITIM Administrator group solves the problem.

The other way is as described in the WinAD Password Sync Plug-in documentation:
The account must have the proper authority to submit password change requests for the specified people. This authority is granted when you create the access control information (ACI) for the Principal account by granting read and write permissions to all the attributes that were listed. 
At a minimum, the principal must be granted read and write permissions to perform the following tasks for password synchronization: 
a. Search for the account that triggered the password synchronization 
b. Search for the owner of that account. 
c. Search for any accounts that are to have their passwords synchronized.
d. Modify those same accounts, with write access to their password attributes. 

Create an account specifically for these types of requests.
