ABSTRACT
 Demonstrate the steps to develop and test a Message Driven Bean (MDB) using Rational Application Developer (RAD) 7.5 and WebSphere Application Server V7, while using WebSphere MQ V7 as Java â„¢ Messaging Service (JMS) Provider.

This demonstrates the steps required to develop and test a Message Driven Bean (MDB) using Rational Application Developer (RAD) 7.5 and WebSphere Application Server V7, while using WebSphere MQ V7 as the Java Messaging Service (JMS) Provider.

The testing scenario shows how the Listener Port for WebSphere Application Server gets a message from an MQ Queue (Point to Point) and passes it to the MDB, which displays the contents of the text message. This MDB is a simple but functional application.

The following file (available with this techdoc) includes the MDB as it was developed, tested and exported as described in this document:
EAR file with MDB: SampleMDBEJB.ear 

The document is provided in the attached file: Developing_and_testing_MDB_on_RAD7.doc
This document shows all the screen shots needed for beginners.
This document has the following chapters:
1: RAD 7.5 development of the MDB
2: RAD 7.5 testing of the MDB using WebSphere Application Server 7
