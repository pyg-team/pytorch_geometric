Title: IBM Unnecessary network view creation, ITNM failover domain - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 xml files that exist in the autoprovision directory $NCHOME/precision/profiles/TIPProfile/etc/tnm/autoprovision get processed on failover ITNM 

SYMPTOM
unnecessary views


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Since the primary ITNM domain will send the NetworkViews.xml file to the failover domain and keep it updated, the xml file in the autoprovision directory is not necessary. If TIP were restarted, it could regenerate views. 

Move xml, xml.error, and xml.processed files from that autoprovision directory to the default directory (autoprovision/default). This applies to the backup TIP/ core installation, that services that failover ITNM domain. 

The primary domain ITNM will use these files to create the dynamic views for both.
