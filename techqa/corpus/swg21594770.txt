WebSphere Portal v8 Mustgather Installation TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
What data to collect for failed installation of WebSphere Portal v8?

ANSWER
If you have already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal 8.0. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21591590] 

Collecting Portal Installation information
Portal v8 Installation includes the following steps:

1) Installation of the install tool, named as IBM Installation Manager or shortly, IIM.
2) Adding the repositories for Portal and pre-requisites (WebSphere AppServer, WAS fixes, Portal Server and the Offering) for installing Portal.
3) Determining if this will be a base, full or custom installation.


Automated collection of troubleshooting data Automated log collection is the recommended method for improving accuracy of the data collection. This is coming soon.

For capturing logs manually, please collect the below:

The following location is defined IM_DATA_DIR

Unix: /<user_home>/var/ibm/InstallationManager
Windows: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Installation Manager

1) The directory

Unix: <IM_DATA_DIR>/logs
Windows: <IM_DATA_DIR>\logs

(if not at the very least, make sure to include the index.xml, index.xsl, all <timestamp>.xml and the two directories 'DownloadExceptions' and 'native' from the above directory)

2) The files: installed.xml, installed.xsl and installRegistry.xml and histories

from <IM_DATA_DIR>

Note: Only on Windows (Check with your Windows System Administrator for further details): The directory, C:\Program Data is hidden by default. If one needs to access this location, do the below:

Under Control Panel -> Folder Options -> Show hidden files and folders,

choose to check "Show hidden files, folders and drives", uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types" and "Hide protected operating system files". 

Enabling traces for Portal installation issues

If support requests you to enable traces for installation issues, do the below:

A file, log.properties needs to be created as in the below provided sample

#Sample debug properties suitable for log.properties
#Tue Jan 18 12:54:48 EST 2011
InstallOperation=DEBUG
InstallOperation/pause.on_error=true
#global=DEBUG

Save this file, copy it to the directory 'IM_DATA_DIR/logs'. Re-run the portal install. When the install fails, the installation pauses and then one can collect all the logs from the following directories:

<IM_DATA_DIR>/logs
<IM_DATA_DIR>/installed.xml
<IM_DATA_DIR>/installed.xsl
<IM_DATA_DIR>/installRegistry.xml
<wp_profile root>/logs
<wp_profile root>/ConfigEngine/log/ConfigTrace.log
<AppServer root>/logs
