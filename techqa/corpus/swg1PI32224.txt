   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * As an Excel Addin, CAFE shares memory with Excel itself. In  *
   * most versions of MS Office the memory available to Excel and *
   * its addins is limited to 2GB. It is always possible that a   *
   * CAFE query and results will exceed the amount of memory      *
   * currently available, especially if the results are half a    *
   * million rows.                                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * If this report is being used as part of a user driven        *
   * analysis task, it may be possible to start the report with   *
   * higher level consolidated levels and drill down and expand   *
   * to lower levels of information as required. Selectively      *
   * expanding to detail may allow users find the rows they       *
   * require without selecting all 500,000+ rows.                 *
