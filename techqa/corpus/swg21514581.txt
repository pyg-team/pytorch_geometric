PROBLEM
Webform Server fails to display images in rendered forms for no apparent reason

SYMPTOM
Product working as expect and then suddenly stops displaying images.


CAUSE
The temporary directory (/tmp or /var/tmp) is full and can no longer store the images. When the Translator starts it creates several temporary files in the temporary directory. The Server does not remove these files on shutdown or a crash and therefore it is recommended to modify your start procedure to remove them on server start.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop the Server and clear the /var/tmp directory to resolve this issue. To ensure the issue does not happen again it is recommended to edit the start script of the server. 

Editing the start script: 

Have a look in your temp directory and you will probably see several files with the name of "+~JF......"

If you add the following to your start (unix-based) script it will remove the temp files:

find /tmp -name "+~JF*" -prune -exec rm -Rf {}

On Windows you will need to remove the files from the temporary directory, the default is C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Temp

This will insure that your temp space does not fill up with unwanted files. 

** Note: The +~JF font files are generated by the JVM on startup not the Webform Server itself
