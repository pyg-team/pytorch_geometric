ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITCAM Microsoft MSSQL monitoring agent
   V6.3.1
   
   Agent reference guide does not specify the location of
   bottleneck workspaces.
   
   Details
   
   The ITCAM for Microsoft SQL Server agent reference guide
   mentions following in the "Predefined workspaces" section.
   The Microsoft SQL Server agent has following composite
   workspaces:
   v SQL Server CPU Bottleneck workspace
   Chapter 1. Workspaces reference 3
   v SQL Server Disk Space and Logon Statistics
   v SQL Server Logical Disk Bottleneck workspace
   v SQL Server Memory Bottleneck workspace
   v SQL Server Physical Disk Bottleneck workspace
   
   ------------
   Since these workspaces are defined at Tivoli Enterprise Portal
   (TEP) navigator item called "Windows Systems", customers are
   unable to locate it on the agent navigator items.
   
   The reference guide should include the information that these
   workspaces are defined at "Windows Systems" navigator.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Select "Windows Systems" in TEP navigator, then right click to
   select the above mentioned workspaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The agent reference guide notes following workspaces, but these
   cannot be located in the TEP.
   > SQL Server CPU Bottleneck workspace
   > SQL Server Disk Space and Logon Statistics
   > SQL Server Logical Disk Bottleneck workspace
   > SQL Server Memory Bottleneck workspace
   > SQL Server Physical Disk Bottleneck workspace
   > MS SQL Resource Pool Stats attributes
