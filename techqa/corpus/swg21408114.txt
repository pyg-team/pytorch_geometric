PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When remote upgrading Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent (TEMA) to ITCAM for Application Diagnostics 7.1 on a non-Windows platform, the upgrade fails with the following message:
For WebSphere Agent:
KDY0005E: The agent bundle YN is missing the prerequisite YN which was not be installed on <host_name>.An error occurred during an attempt to install the specified prerequisite.
For HTTP Servers Agent:
KDY0005E: The agent bundle HT is missing the prerequisite HT which was not be installed on <host_name>.An error occurred during an attempt to install the specified prerequisite. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the host name value of TEMA: 

1. Log on to Tivoli Enterprise Portal; 

2. Right-click on the Enterprise and select Workspace->Managed System Status:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21408114&amp;aid=1]

4. Check the host name in Managed System Status. The host name format should be the same for UX, HT, and YN agents. If the host name format is different like the one in the following image ("tivs02.cn.ibm.com" and "tivs02‚Äù), it cannot be recognized by IBM Tivoli Monitoring. This causes a problem when remote upgrading.

1. Add the property CTIRA_SYSTEM_NAME=UX_Host_Name in the following files:

- For HTTP Servers Agent, the files are ht.ini and ht.config.


For example, In the previous image, the UX_Host_Name value is "tivs02" 

The files are located in the ITM_HOME/config directory.
