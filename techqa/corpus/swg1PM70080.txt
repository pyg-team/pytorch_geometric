LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of Create Template utility function    *
   *                 in the File Manager Plug-in for Eclipse.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SSL hand-shake error is reported while  *
   *                      creating a template using the Create    *
   *                      Template utility function. The user     *
   *                      must be using a secured connection to   *
   *                      the File Manager server.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Install the updated version of File Manager  *
   *                 plug-in V11.1.0.6                            *
   *                 and                                          *
   *                 Apply the host PTF for PM68291 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1PM68291].              *
   ****************************************************************
   Timing of connection closure causes SSL handshake error to
   occurr. Instead of closing the connection, enable re-use of
   the connection so that we can avoid the problem.
