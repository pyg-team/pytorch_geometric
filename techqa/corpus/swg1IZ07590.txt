ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TITLE: FormValidationServlet bails out if "Suggested Value"
   contains ampersand character
   PROBLEM: FormValidationServlet bails out if "Suggested Value"
   contains ampersand character
   STEPS TO DUPLICATE:
   Have a service (in my case WinAD, customer W2K)
   Have a Provisioning Policy for this service:
   Membership: all
   Entitlement: Manual, Mandatory attribute "Display Name" =
   "Display&Name"
   Modify an existing account or create a new one with "Display
   Name" = "Display Name"
   Press Submit and get a Popup:
   com.ibm.itim.webclient.formviewer.FormValidationServlet.ERROR_KE
   Y
   And two entries in trace.log:
   -----------
   ...
   javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: The reference to
   entity "Name" must end with the ';' delimiter.
   ...
    <Exception><|ﾎCDATAﾎcom.ibm.itim.webclient.util.WebUIException:
   CTGIML009E An error occurred during XSL processing.
   ...
   -----------
   On customers box the first of this error messages is a little
   bit different as on my box (maybe because of FP55):
   -----------
   ...
   javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: The entity name must
   immediately follow the '&' in the entity reference.
   ...
   -----------
   Anyway, interesting is that "Non-Compliant Value" field can
   contain ampersand character without problem.
   Problem seems to be only with ampersand character in "Suggested
   Value" field.
   DESIRED BEHAVIOR: Not to get this error
   ENVIRONMENT: ITIM 4.6 FP55, recreated with ITIM 4.6 FP48
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use ampersand character, use "and" instead
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   Users affected:
   Customers using ampersand "&" in "Suggested value".
