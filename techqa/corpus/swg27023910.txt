Steps for installing Combined Cumulative Fix 

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
Familiarize yourself with the Portal Upgrade Best Practices available from IBM Remote Technical Support for WebSphere Portal.

Portal Upgrades: Best Practices for V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21452611] For instructions on how to validate your environment prior to the upgrade, see the instructions for running the Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal at:

Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] IMPORTANT: Certain security configurations can cause failures with the upgrade. Please check the following technote to see if this may apply to your environment.

Fix Pack 7.0.0.1 fails at action-import-defaultnodes-wp.filestore/base task. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496067] 
 1. Perform the following steps before installing Combined Cumulative fix:
     1. Before you install this combined cumulative fix, check to see if the list of fixes already installed on your system is included in the list of fixes provided in this combined cumulative fix. If you have temporary, interim or cumulative fixes on your system that are not included in this Combined Cumulative Fix, then uninstall those fixes before installing this Combined Cumulative Fix and contact IBM Support for an updated version of that fix, or for more information. 
     2. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. 
     3. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. 
         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. 
         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. 
        
        
     4. Special considerations for multiple profiles or binary install or migration upgrade:  1. If you did a binary installation and created a WebSphere Portal profile later, or your Portal 7.0.0.x was migrated from 6.1.x, ensure that the PortalServer/wps.properties file correctly references the profile. The Portal Update Installer uses the wps.properties file to determine which profile is the primary profile to update. Failure to complete this step could result in an inoperable Portal server after the Combined Cumulative Fix installation completes.  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor 
             2. Add these two properties if they do not already exist:
                ProfileName=<your profile name, e.g. wp_profile>
                ProfileDirectory=<your profile directory, e.g. /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile>
                
                Note: The ProfileDirectory property should use forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\) on Windows.
            
            
         2. If you have created multiple profiles. the Portal Update Installer will automatically upgrade all profiles. If you want to specify which profiles are updated, then complete the following steps:  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor 
             2. Add this property if it does not already exist:
                AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles=<comma separated list of profile names, e.g. wp_profile, wp_profile2, wp_profile3>
            
            
         3. If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting upgrade.
            
        
        
     5. Perform the following steps to download the Combined Cumulative Fix and the WebSphere Portal Update Installer:  1. Download the latest Combined Cumulative fix (e.g. 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn), and the latest WebSphere Portal Update Installer from http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857]. 
         2. Create the PortalServer_root/update directory and extract the WebSphere Portal Update Installer file into this directory. 
         3. Create the PortalServer_root/update/fixes directory and extract the 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn.zip file into this directory, where n is the numbers associated with the version of the Combined Cumulative fix. Note for z/OS users: refer to Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670] for detailed descriptions of how to execute steps ii. and iii. above. 
            
        
        
    
    


2. Choose either the graphical user interface installation option or the command line installation option: 

NOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z/OS can only use command line). 

NOTE: If the installation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task. 


If using the Universal PUI, (which does not include the bundled Java environment), run the following command, setupCmdLine.bat for Windows or . ./setupCmdLine.sh for Unix/Linux from the was_profile_root/bin directory to set up the Java environment for the graphical user interface installation program. When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall="true", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root/bin. z/OS users can not use the Universal PUI. 

Enter the following command to launch the graphical user interface installation program:  *  Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortalWizard.bat Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortalWizard.sh
   
   - OR -
   Perform the following steps to launch the installation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. 
    2. Enter the following command to launch the installation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):
   
    * Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortal.bat -install
      -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>\update\fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install
      -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * IBM i: portal_server_root/update> updatePortal.sh -install
      -installDir "<portal_server_root>"
      -fix
      -fixDir "<portal_server_root>/update/fixes"
      -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
    * z/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before installing the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to install the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>/bin directory:
          . ./setupCmdLine.sh 
       2. PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install
          -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
          -fix
          -fixDir "<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes"
          -fixes <Cumulative fix>
          
          Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670]. Submit the JCLs, and then return here to continue.
          
      
      
   
   If you do not have any profiles at this point (because you are in the process of migration from WebSphere Portal 6.1 or Installing an additional node for a cluster or creating multiple profiles) no post installation steps are necessary and you can continue with the next steps that create the profiles as outlined by the according documentation.
   
   z/OS: If doing an upgrade as part of a migration from a previous version (eg. 6.x), run ./ConfigEngine.sh gather-migration-files command from the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory.
   
   z/OS: Run the following command: <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.sh install CF skipPreCheckProfile
   
   All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be applied. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].
   
   <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.bat|.sh install CF
   
   This cumulative fix provides updates to OSGi bundles. After installing the cumulative fix, run "<profile location>/bin/osgiCfgInit.sh" (for IBM i the command is just osgiCfgInit, for Microsoft Windows the command is osgiCfgInit.bat) to clear the caches and make the OSGi container pick up the updates to the modified OSGi bundles. Note that it is recommended to stop the portal server before running the osgiCfgInit command. 
 *

3. Perform the following post installation steps: 
 *  If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:
    1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. 
    2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. 
    3. Restart the Web server.
       
   
   Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to installing the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory 
        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator 
        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules 
        * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module 
        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet 
        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps 
        * Click Next and Finish
       
       
    2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory 
        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator 
        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules 
        * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module 
        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet 
        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps 
        * Click Next and Finish
       
       
    3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.
   
   Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager. Review the following documentation "Configuration Changes and Options introduced in WP/WCM V7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021250] to see if it applies to your environment.

Steps for uninstalling Combined Cumulative Fix 

NOTE: Changing the server context root after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. To uninstall after changing the context root, you must first change the server context root back to the values of the previous version. 

NOTE: Configuring Portal Server from a stand-alone environment to a cluster environment after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. 

 1. Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. 
     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. 
         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. 
         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. 
         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. 
         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. During the Combined Cumulative Fix uninstall the primary profile is downgraded first if one exists (The Update Installer also supports the update case for a binary only install without profiles). The primary profile is identified by two properties, ProfileDirectory and ProfileName. Ensure these properties are set before starting the downgrade process. 
         * If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting downgrade.
           
        
        
    
    
 2. Choose either the graphical user interface uninstallation option or the command line uninstallation option:

When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall="true", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root/bin. z/OS users can not use the Universal PUI.
     * Enter the following command to launch the graphical user interface uninstallation program:  * Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortalWizard.bat 
        * Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortalWizard.sh
          
          - OR -
          
       
       
     * Perform the following steps to launch the uninstallation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. 
        2. Enter the following command to launch the uninstallation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):  * Windows: PortalServer_root\update> updatePortal.bat -uninstall
              -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"

            * Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -uninstall
              -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
              -fix
              -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
            * IBM i: portal_server_root/update> updatePortal.sh -uninstall
              -installDir "<portal_server_root>"
              -fix
              -fixes < Cumulative fix > 
            * z/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before uninstalling the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>/bin directory:
                  . ./setupCmdLine.sh 
               2. PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -uninstall
                  -installDir "<PortalServer_root>"
                  -fix
                  -fixes <Cumulative fix>
                  
                  Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670].

     2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. 
     3. Restart the Web server.
    
    
 5. If you previously customized any configuration files in the wp_profile_root/PortalServer/config directory, check to see if uninstalling the cumulative fix affected those files by restoring a version of the files that was saved when the cumulative fix was originally installed. If it did affect the files, you must perform the same customization on the restored version of each file. 
 6. Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to uninstalling the Combined Cumulative fix.  1.

Known issues for latest Combined Cumulative Fix 


Problem: There may be browser / functional issues in themes and in WCM when running 7002 CF levels against Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft Edge. 
Solution: It is recommended to run these browsers in compatibility mode as necessary. Also, note that some pieces of WCM functionality (exs. inability to close Workflow dialogs, Applet issues) may not work correctly with these browsers even in compatibility mode as they are not supported. 

Problem: Inline help may not appear correctly after CF29 update on zOS. 
Solution: From the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory, run task 

./ConfigEngine.sh expand-ear-wp.iehs.ear 

Then restart the Portal server. 


Problem: When using versions earlier than 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51', a security pop-up dialog or error will be seen every time the WCM FileTransferApplet or Ephox EditLive editor is instantiated. 
Solution: It is recommended to upgrade the Java runtime environment level to either 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51' or later. Please refer to the following URL: swg21663838 


Problem: After you enter a number into the number element/component, and then save the content/component more than twice, you will notice that the number field gets populated with some dots, i.e. 123.456.78. If you then click on Save again, you will get the following error: 
'Enter a valid number. ( content/component name here)' 
Solution: The workaround is to remove the dots and save again. 


Problem: Page theme is changed to current Portal default theme when changing page content layout. 
Solution: The workaround would be to change the page theme back to "Inherit Parent Theme". A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. 


Problem: After upgrading to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix and "Portal 7.0.0.2" theme has been set as the default portal theme, a user is unable to post to a blog or update a wiki using Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer. 
Solution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Navigate to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Contenet_Root -> Hidden pages. 
 2. Select "Edit Page Properties" for the hidden page named 'Web Content Management'. 
 3. On the 'Edit page: Web Content Management' page, extend 'Theme:' drop-down list and select "-----Inherit Parent Theme-----".



Problem: WCM Authoring Search may not work after an upgrade to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix 
Solution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Edit the <wp_profile>/PortalServer/jcr/lib/com/ibm/icm/icm.properties file in a text editor to verify all properties are correct. 
 2. Set jcr.textsearch.enabled=true 
 3. Change jcr.textsearch.indexdirectory to a corresponding location in the filesystem 
 4. Restart your Portal Server. 
 5. Create a new library or make changes in existing libraries



Problem: When configuring Portal for use with a remote DB2 on z/OS database, the sample job provided for the database creation does not contain the statements required to create the storage groups. These take the form: 

CREATE STOGROUP group 
VOLUMES(' volume') 
VCAT category; 
COMMIT; 

where, 
group is the name of the storage group for the database, 
volume is the volume serial number of * to let SMS select the volume where the database will reside, 
category is the category name of the Integrated Catalog Facility. 

Solution: When using the EJPSCRDB sample job add the above statements for each storage group to the final version. These should be added at the beginning of "Step 2" of the sample job, just before the CREATE statements for the actual databases. 


Problem: Theme Policies are not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: Client-side aggregation is not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: The WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 theme does not support Sametime 8.5.1 
Solution: This is a known limitation. 


Problem: Loading a page with the out of box default profile (Deferred) causes "dojo is not defined" error. 
Solution: Dojo is not available in view mode using the Deferred profile, which is the default out of box. Switch the page or theme to use the Full profile to access Dojo in view mode. For more information see URL: http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc] 


Problem: The Portal 7.0.0.2 drag-and-drop framework does not support multi-selection and copying resources. 
Solution: This is a known limitation. This can be enabled by creating a custom drag and drop source and enabling these features. 


Problem: The deploy-7002-theme task fails 
Solution: The Portal 7.0.0.2 theme requires several artifacts from the "Page Builder" theme to exist on the server. If you have removed the theme or if you are coming from a migrated environment where the theme never existed, you will need to add the Page Builder theme back to the system before running the deploy-7002-theme task. Please see the "Additional instructions for a migrated environment" section at the following URL for more information http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc] 


Problem: The Feedspace portlet in Portal 7.0.0.2 may show JavaScript issues. 
Solution: The Feedspace portlet needs to be redeployed to resolve this. Use the Portal administration area to update the the SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war. Use the PortalServer/bp/wp.bp.feedspace/installableApps/SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war to do this update. 


Problem: If a WCM cumulative fix is installed on a Websphere Portal 7.0.0.2 where the date of the install is later than the date on which the cumulative fix was packaged, then the update-wcm task will fail to overwrite the WCM war files from the base version. 
Solution: To workaround this problem, the war files from [PortalServer]\wcm\prereq.wcm\installableApps have to be manually copied to [PortalServer]\installableApps. Once this is done, the update-wcm task will execute successfully. 


Problem: Newly added WCM libraries might not be listed in the "Web Content Libraries" portlet on all nodes of the cluster due to an issue in cache replication. 
Solution: The workaround would be to restart nodes which have the stale library list. A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. 


Problem: After uninstall of the combined cumulative fix, WPVersionInfo shows IBM WebSphere Portal Configuration Framework (CFGFW) at the upgraded version level. 
Solution: This is expected. The CFGFW version level shown after the uninstall of the combined cumulative fix remains at the upgraded level. There is no functional problem. 


Problem: If you plan to configure Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder as your external security manager to handle authorization and authentication, the XML configuration interface may not be able to access WebSphere Portal through eTrust SiteMinder. 
Solution: To enable the XML configuration interface to access WebSphere Portal, use eTrust SiteMinder to define the configuration URL (/wps/config) as unprotected. Refer to the eTrust SiteMinder documentation for specific instructions. After the configuration URL is defined as unprotected, only WebSphere Portal enforces access control to this URL. Other resources such as the /wps/myportal URL are still protected by eTrust SiteMinder. If you already set up eTrust SiteMinder for external authorization and you want to use XMLConfiguration Interface (xmlaccess), make sure you have followed the procedure to allow for xmlaccess execution. 


Problem: If using the Firefox browser, portlets cannot be dragged to a page from the palette. It is necessary to click the + icon next to the portlet in the palette to add it to the page. 
Solution: This is documented as a known limitation. 


Problem: If an error is seen starting server "WebSphere_Portal" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. 
The error would appear similar to the following as part of the "action-start-portal-server-standard" task : "ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal" 
Solution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for "Node restart state" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment.
