SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 19, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Tivoli Netcool/Reporter. Netcool/Reporter has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0209 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0209]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the d2i_ECPrivateKey or EVP_PKCS82PKEY function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed Elliptic Curve (EC) private-key file to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101674 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101674] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0286]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp function when attempting to compare ASN.1 boolean types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash any certificate verification operation and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101666 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101666] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0287 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0287]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to the reuse of a structure in ASN.1 parsing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an invalid write to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101668 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101668] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0288 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0288]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the X509_to_X509_REQ function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101675] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0289 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0289]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly handle missing outer ContentInfo by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blob to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101669 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101669] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0292 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0292]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error when processing base64 encoded data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted base 64 data to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101670 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101670] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0293 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0293]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially-crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101671 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101671] for the current score
