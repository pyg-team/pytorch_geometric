ABSTRACT
 This paper describes the requirements, setup, configuration, and use of the Express Logon Feature with IBM Host On-Demand. The Express Logon Feature is an IBM cross-product solution that allows a user with a TN3270 client session and an X.509 certificate to log on to a SNA application residing on a host system without having to enter a user ID and password. 

This feature has several advantages: 
1. It helps reduce the time administrators spend maintaining user IDs and passwords. 
2. It helps reduce the number of user IDs and passwords that users have to remember. 
3. It helps remove a potential security risk of users writing down user IDs and passwords, losing them, or sharing them with someone else. 
4. It helps remove a potential security risk of users using trivial or easily guessed passwords.
