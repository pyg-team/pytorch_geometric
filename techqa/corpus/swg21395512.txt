Title: IBM Database Gateway filter for the ODBC and Oracle Gateways - United States

Text:
gateway filter; Gate.ReaderFilter; filter TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the format for building a text comparison filter in the database gateways? 

ANSWER

The general rule is the value of the Gate.ReaderFilter should be simple, valid SQL that qualifies the 'WHERE' clause in an SQL select statement which is selecting rows that primarily match values in a list of Serials - ie SELECT <column list> from alerts.status WHERE Serial in (<serial value list>) AND (<Gate.ReaderFilter>)

One thing to note is some characters need to be escaped in the definition of the filter, for example, single quotes. Thus, the example 

Gate.ReaderFilter : 'Class = 93 or LiveStatus LIKE "YES"' 

is invalid, not just because it uses double quotes instead of single quotes. You need to do this:

Gate.ReaderFilter : 'Class = 93 or LiveStatus LIKE \'YES\'' 
(NB it ends in 2 single quotes, the penultimate of which is escaped)

The other thing to do is try out Reader filters manually before using them in the props file. Note though that escaping quotes is not necessary there, as the whole string is not enclosed in quotes as it is in the props file.
