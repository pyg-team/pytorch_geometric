APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Search templates with more than 9 sort levels are not sorted
   properly in Workplace XT. For example, if a search template has
   10 sort levels, the 10th sort field is incorrectly placed in the
   2nd sort level.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a search template with 10 sort levels.
   2. Open the search template in Workplace XT and execute the
   search.
   3. The search results are not sorted properly. The 10th sort
   property is actually used as the 2nd sort level.
