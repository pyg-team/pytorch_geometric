APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting multiple instances of the Resolver can result in
   excessive loads of ASASYMBM by EZBREINI. The loads occur when
   Resolver res_init procesing is resolving system symbolics
   and the entry point address of ASASYMBM is unknown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Start the Resolver 1 time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the IBM Communications Server   *
   *                 for z/OS Version 1 Release 13 IP: Resolver   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If the Resolver is started a second     *
   *                      time it clears a control block field    *
   *                      that may lead to CSV001I message        *
   *                      flooding in a application's JOBLOG.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The resolver incorrectly clears its RcvtSym@ field which
   contains a system service routine's address for static system
   symbol processing. Clearing this field will cause the resolver
   to LOAD the ASASYMBM routine for each statement in the
   application's TCPIP.DATA. When finished with processing the
   statements the resolver only DELETEs the load module once. This
   can cause an ever increasing load counter. When the counter
   gets to be greater than 32767 the following message will be
   issued for each line in the TCPIP.DATA.
