Title: IBM Question on using client kerberos authentication - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the Master's ego.conf uses Symphony client Kerberos authentication i.e. EGO_SEC_PLUGIN=sec_ego_gsskrb is set, then is this same setting also needed for all other nodes in the cluster?


CAUSE
Symphony does node authentication through vemkd-pem Kerberos auth, which uses EGO_AUTH_PLUGIN. Therefore, a Compute node can join the cluster even if EGO_SEC_PLUGIN is set to sec_ego_default, in this case.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is okay for a Compute Host to have EGO_SEC_PLUGIN=sec_ego_default defined in it's local ego.conf as long as the Compute node does not act as a Symphony client, i.e., no jobs can be submitted from such hosts. Note that such Compute hosts cannot act as secondary Symphony clients in running parent-child workload.
