PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10   *
   *                  Appliance Version 2.1 or later.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After you upgrade the firmware to       *
   *                      v2.1.0.0 or later, you might not be     *
   *                      able                                    *

   *                      user.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:  Install a firmware update that contains     *
   *                  this                                        *
   *                  APAR.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   After you upgrade the firmware from v2.0.0.x to v2.1.x, an
   internal configuration file that keeps track of the user
   migrates
   to a new format that is supported by the new
   firmware. However, this migration might not succeed.  As a
   result,
   you cannot change the xcadmin password after completing the
   upgrade.
   This problem affects only the xcadmin user. Passwords can be
   changed for other users.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The user management code was corrected to properly process the
   internal configuration file in the case of a migrated applicatio
   The APAR is included in Version 2.5.0.1.
