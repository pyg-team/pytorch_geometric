ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Solaris 8 to Solaris 10 env, OS agent - other agents may also be
   affected
   
   
   Problem Description:
   
   This sequence of events leads to a problem:
   
   - install a level of ITM - 6.1 or 6.2, any patch level, on a
   Solaris 8
   machine - so 6.1 FP7 for example. Install the OS agent.
   - uprade the Solaris to Solaris 10
   - upgrade ITM to a later level major release than was installed
   - 6.2
   FP2 for example - select just the OS agent - whatever was
   installed
   before
   
   The problem that results: Rather than the OS agent for 6.2 being
   upgraded to the 6.2 level, and the previous OS Agent agent being
   uninstalled (depricated), both OS agents end up on the machine
   at the
   same time.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   - install ITM 6.1 FP7 on a Solaris 8 machine - select the OS
   agent
   - upgrade Solaris from 5.8 to 5.10
   - upgrade ITM to ITM 6.2 FP2 - include just the agent you
   installed
   before
   - run cinfo -i - you will see both versions of the OS agent
   installed on
   the machine. The ver files these correspond to are
    uxsol286.ver
    uxsol506.ver
     There shouldn't be those two versions of the same agent, the
   other 286
   version should be gone. Thus, recreated.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This is being marked as FIN, but it is not certain if this can
   be fixed at all, it might in fact be a "PRS", or parmanent
   restriction. An Enhancement request has been opened
   (72609344) and development will examine to see if this will even
   be possible.
