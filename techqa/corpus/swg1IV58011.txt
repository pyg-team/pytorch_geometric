ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using MSSQL server and authenticating users with LDAP,
   double byte characters show as ??? in the distinguished name
   field.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Setup ITM630FP2 TEPS using MSSQL server as the TEPS database on
   windows 2008 or 2012. Authenticate users at the TEPS using
   LDAP,  the LDAP vendor and version does not seem to matter.
   
   Create UID's in ldap using double byte characters. Then logon to
   the TEP client and create a new user and assign it a
   distinguished name from the LDAP list which contains double byte
   charaters. In this particular case hebrew characters were being
   used but any other double byte language character will work.
   
   Save the userid in the tep client, the distinguished name will
   not correctly show the double byte character, it will display a
   question mark for each double byte character.
