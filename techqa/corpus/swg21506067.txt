PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Ensure that the user that is currently running as the Web Reports Server service has full control permissions on these keys. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
I am using Web Reports and when I try to add the Database, I get the following error: 

"Cannot create or modify the database settings. The registry keys could not be created or edited." 

You may also see this issue in the following error: 
"Background thread threw exception: Unable to set value data in the registry for a remote database." 

We create these keys during installation with very limited permissions (usually for System account only) that would allow Web Reports to access, but hopefully no other users. So if you changed the account on which the Web Reports service is running, you will get the error. Add a new user with read/write access to these keys. 

Please make sure the user has write permissions on the following two registry keys:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BigFix\Enterprise Server\FillAggregateDB\RemoteDatabases
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BigFix\Enterprise Server\FillAggregateDB\RemoteDatabases\SERVERNAME 

What can I do to fix this? 

Ensure that the user that is currently running as the Web Reports Server service has full control permissions on these keys. If necessary, run regedt32 to add sufficient permissions to this hive and below. 

Support may also suggest adding full read/write permissions for this user on all registry entries starting at:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BigFix 

To do this, right click on this key, choose permissions, add the user giving Full Control, click on Advanced and check the two options to "Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate..." and "Replace permission entries on all child objects..."
