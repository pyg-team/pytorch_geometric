APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you select "Search","Help", "View", or "Specify additional
   archiving information" from the IBM Content Collector Outlook
   Web App  functions, a separate window opens.
   In Internet Explorer, this window was too small, but could not
   be resized. Thus, users could not read and interpret the
   search results properly. In addition, no scroll bars
   and no status bar were available in the new window.
   
   The issue occurred only with IBM Content Collector OWA support
   in Exchange 2013.
