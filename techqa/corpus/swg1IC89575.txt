APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempts to migrate a v7.0 client to a later release fails if
   processes are accessing WebSphere MQ files. The installation
   ends without indicating that files were in use or what
   processes caused the sharing violation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   WebSphere MQ 701 client Installations
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere MQ client fixpack installation hangs when the MQ
   files are in use during installation. The 'Ready to Install'
   window that displays the 'Install' or the 'Modify' button does
   not respond when clicked on it, if any of the WebSphere MQ
   libraries are in use. It appears as if the installation is
   hung since no message box gets displayed nor the installation
   ends reporting an error. The installation only ends when
   the 'Cancel' button is clicked.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ client installation code is modified so that
   the installer notifies the user that WebSphere MQ is active and
   allows the user to end the WebSphere MQ applications. The
   dialog lets the user to continue or cancel the installation. If
   the installation continues with out ending the MQ application
   then the user should reboot the machine to complete the client
   installation.
