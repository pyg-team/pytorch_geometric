Title: IBM Source record information from a duplicated record in Maximo - United States

Text:
TPAEUI duplicated record source from where find duplication maximo TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides a workaround configuration for finding the source record info for a record that is duplicated in Maximo applications. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You may face the scenario where a record, such as workorder is duplicated, and there is no apparent reference to the record it was duplicated from. You may believe that the ideal solution is this. 

WO12345 already exists. User chooses Select Action > Duplicate Change. WO12346 is created. 
The value "WO12345" is stored in the ORIGRECORDID field in the WORKORDER table for WO12346


Maximo does not offer that specific functionality, however, you can achieve that by using the existing configuration resources.

On almost every application Maximo provides a useful entry in the action menu to duplicate the selected record. The new record is just that, a 'new' record. 

When this action is performed, some of the field are intentionally wiped from Maximo. For example if you try to duplicate an Asset you will notice that Maximo resets some fields like ASSETNUM, LOCATION and SERIALNUM. 

The Database Configuration Application has been enhanced in Maximo 7.5.0.3 with a new object definition menu called 'Exclude Attribute Data'. Here you can specify the attributes that you do not want included in your new object during the duplication process. 

This way you can control what record could be the source record of a specific duplicated data created from duplicate action, including information from the source record, where you can view information retained in the new duplicated record, using even a SQL tool for that. 

You may need to enable this feature in Database Configuration before you try to do that.
