APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Content Collector V2.2 Windows installer program requires
   WSE 3.0 which is not a supported product by Microsoft on Windows
   Server 2008. Microsoft has replaced WSE 3.0 with WCF for Windows
   Server 2008 and is the recommended method. The P8 connector will
   need to be updated to support SSL connections to the P8
   Content Engine server using Microsoft WCF.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM Content Collector FileNet P8 Connector did not support
   web service connections that use Microsoft Windows Communication
   Foundation (WCF).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, the IBM Content Collector FileNet P8
   Connector has been updated to support SSL connections to the
   FileNet P8 Content Engine server that use Microsoft WCF. It now
   makes appropriate calls using the FileNet P8 APIs to support
   both Microsoft Web Services Enhancements (WSE) and Microsoft
   Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) connections.
