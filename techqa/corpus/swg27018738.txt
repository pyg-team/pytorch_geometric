Known issues for Runtime WebSphere Portal 6.1.0.4/6.1.5.1 for z/OS 

Problem: Application of the fix pack updates the Domino Web Access portlet with the Privileged User role for All Authenticated Users. While this is the default access control for the portlet, any administrator who had previously removed such access will have their efforts reversed. The effect of such setting is creation of implicit private pages for each user who attempts to personalize the portlet. 
Solution: Manually remove All Authenticated Users from the Privileged User role on the Domino Web Access portlet via the administration portlets or via XMLAccess. This will prevent any further personalization and creation of private pages. To address the private pages already in the system, delete them via XMLAccess. 

Problem: Slow responses in the People Picker application 
Solution: Starting with 6.1.0.3 the People Picker application searches not only for the cn attribute but additionally for the description, viewIdentifiers and displayName attribute. In configurations with slow LDAPs this might cause slower responses in the People Picker application. 

Problem: On a z/OS Portal, a user submits Jobs to add LA attributes by executing wp-add-la-properties or add-wcm-la-attributes tasks. If he receives the following error message(s): 

Security, CBIND check failure, SAF Retcode = 8 

It indicates that the user is not allowed to start the bean, which means that WAS is not configured correctly. There are no RACF CBIND profiles to intercept the cluster transition name on the server. 

Solution: Define a generic CBIND profile in WAS and connect group WSCFG1 to it. Here are the sample RACF commands to define the profile: 

RDEFINE CBIND CB.BIND.** UACC(READ) 
PERMIT CB.BIND.** CLASS(CBIND) ID(WSCFG1) ACCESS(CONTROL) 
RDEFINE CBIND CB.** UACC(READ) 
SETROPTS RACLIST(CBIND) GENERIC(CBIND) REFRESH 

Problem: After migration from wp60x, the out of the box non admin pages are lost. 
Solution: Any out of the box non admin pages will be deleted as part of migration.If you want to use these pages,you have to re-add these pages and portlets on them. 
runtime 
Problem: Published page couldn't be seen on target server after security changed. 
Solution: 
1.Go to Applications->Content->Personalization->Business Rules 
2.Select "publishrule" and edit this rule 
3.Set the current portal group to the group after changed 
4.Submit and save 
5.Relogin 

Problem: After HTTP session expires, a login window will be prompted for user's credentials due to user's interaction with Resource Manager portlet on the Administration Site Management page. 
Solution: This is a current limitation of the product. 

Problem: When Portal is configured with Microsoft ADAM 2008 federate LDAP, and use cn as personAccountRdnProperties. You may get an error and fail to update user first name and last name on Edit User profile portlet. 
com.ibm.portal.puma.UpdateReadOnlyAttributeException: EJPSG0044E: Updating the rdn attribute cn is not supported. 
Solution: Login WAS Admin console, under Resources > Resource Environment > Resource Environment Providers. Add a property in WP PumaStoreService: store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter=cn. Then restart Portal Server. 

Problem: After installing WAS Fix Pack 6.1.0.29 or 7.0.0.9 (or later), duplicate host name entries are detected and server now log HMGR0031E messages. This may result in dynamic cache replication problem on a Portal cluster. 
Solution: Refer to WAS technote - HMGR0031E Messages Logged Due To Duplicate Host Name Entries in local hosts file 

Problem: Build a 6104 cluster based on WAS 7.0.0.9, stop all java threads, including DM, nodeagents and portal server.Then restart DM, nodeagents and portal server.Check the ffdc log, there will be some exceptions: 
Exception:com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.ConnectorNotAvailableException SourceId:com.ibm.ws.management.event.DownstreamServerManager.QueueConsumerThread.updateServers ProbeId:1303 Reporter:com.ibm.ws.management.event.DownstreamServerManager$QueueConsumerThread@41dc41dc 
com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.ConnectorNotAvailableException 
at com.ibm.ws.management.discovery.ServerInfo.getAdminClient(ServerInfo.java:218) 
at com.ibm.ws.management.event.DownstreamServerManager.getRemoteProxy(DownstreamServerManager.java:289) 

Solution: These exceptions could be ignored. 

Problem: When downgrade of Portal from 6104 to 6101 and try to create a new page, you may encounter the error "This portlet is temporarily disabled" and couple with the exception in SystemOut.log 
[11/12/09 19:53:39:029 CST] 0000005b servlet E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception created in one of the service methods of the servlet /WEB-INF/properties/html/addPlaceComposition.jsp in application PA_Properties. Exception created : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: parentNodeID must not be null. Use getCreateSharedNodePermissions(DatabaseDomain domain) instead at com.ibm.wps.ac.impl.NodePermissionFactoryImpl.getCreateSharedNodePermissions(NodePermissionFactoryImpl.java:70) 
Solution: Update Properties.war web module with <WPSInstallationDir>/ap/wp.ap.properties/installableApps/Propertes.war by using Web Modules portlet or xmlAccess 

Problem: If Profile Management Portlet is deployed on a new page, non admin user will see this error message 
Users can not be enrolled in this portal, or you do not have permission to perform user enrollment. 

Solution: The problem is happened on Portal with WAS 7.0.0.x only. Currently it's a limitation. 

Problem: If Portal 6.1.0.x is configured for searching federation to a remote Lotus Quickr server after the upgrade to Portal 6.1.0.4/6.1.5.1 some configuration steps need to be redone. 
Solution: Steps 1e through 1i from "Search across Lotus Quickr Server" section from the 6.1.x InfoCenter [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpzosdoc/v6r1] must be redone. 

Problem: Spellchecker function does not work in Common PIM Portlet Mail when used through Apple Safari browser. 
Solution: This is a known issue in this release. 

Problem: OperaÂ® Web browser only: Enter key cannot focus on the Search button if some other button lies above it. 
Solution: This is a current limitation of the product. 

Problem: Drag and Drop functionality may not work properly on some pages when using Web2Theme on a zOS Portal. 

Problem: An error occurs when attempting to add a widget to the WebSphere Portal server through the mashup hub. If you experience this error: "An error occurred when opening the catalog. Check to make sure the URL to the WebSphere Portal server is correct. Also, make sure that your user ID and password are correct" 

Solution: This error occurs because the 'Enable trust association' setting is not enabled. Run the following command: 

 * ./ConfigEngine.sh enable-http-basic-auth-tai-sitemgmt
   

In the admin console verify the following: Go to Security->Global security->Web and SIP security->Trust association. The checkbox for 'Enable trust association' is selected. 

Problem: Self-help portlets are stopped. 

Solution: If you optionally submit EJPSAHLP to install the WebSphere Portal administrative self-help 
pages and portlets, you need to execute './ConfigEngine.sh activate-portlets' to activate the related 
portlets after EJPSAHLP is successfully executed.
