PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Can we restore our production DB to our QA DB?


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If a customer wishes to backup the production database to their QA or development environment, there are two options available for performing this task: 


The first method would be to copy the existing production DB instance over the QA DB instance. This is the recommended method and is the fastest and easiest way to backup. We strongly recommend that a certified DBA or technical member of your team perform this function.

The second option is to perform an unload of member, audit, and dictionary information using the Initiate command line utilities. Using these utilities will unload and load the data into the QA database. This will also require a level of technical expertise so if necessary submit a Service Request and a support analyst will assist you.
