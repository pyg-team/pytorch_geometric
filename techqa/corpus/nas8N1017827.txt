Question: Is the IBM WebSphere Application Server on IBM i Software Application a chargeable item? 

Answer: 
There are four different types of offerings and three different editions available for IBM WAS on the IBM i.

Express Edition (WAS v8.5 and earlier)
The Express edition is the most common edition used by our client base. For this edition, there are two different offerings: 

1. The Express (WEBENAB) edition for the IBM i is available free of charge as a feature code of the IBM Web Enablement product (5722-WE2). Note: The 5722-WE2 is not an installed LPP. 

It can be obtained by ordering the IBM Web Enablement package from the IBM Entitled Software Support (ESS) Web site (https://www.ibm.com/eserver/ess/ [https://www.ibm.com/eserver/ess/]).
