ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  According to "Access Manager 3.9 webseal administrator's guide"
   page 63, "Configuriing WebSEAL server-side request caching",
   .
   "The limitation of this implementation became apparent when
   for example, a POST request was interrupted by a session timeout
   that prompted a re-authentication process. Since WebSEAL only
   cached the URL of the original request, the POST data (including
   the METHOD and Message Body) were lost during the HTTP redirect.
   The user had to rebuild the POST request.
   .
   WebSEAL now caches a more complete set of request data and
   uses this cached data to rebuild the request during the HTTP
   redirect,
   if a re-authentication requirement interrupts the completion of
   the
   request processing. This solution particularly benefits POST and
   PUT
   request, because these requests types can include a veriety of
   information fields."
   .
   The above new feature was included in WebSEAL 3.9 to handle
   cases
   where the initial rquest is a POST request for form
   authentication.
   .
   But it seems like Access Manager does not cache the body of the
   POST
   request,when e-community single sign on is enabled.
   In other words, when e-community single sign on is enabled, the
   above
   new feature will not work and webseal will only cache the URL of
   the original request...
   We just test this issue using multiple webseal instances.
