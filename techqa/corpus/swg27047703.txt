ABSTRACT
 You schedule a backup on the "Backup configurations" page, but after the scheduled backup runs, the time in the history does not match the time in the configuration. 

CONTENT
Problem:When a backup configuration is created, the start time is passed to the system in the local time zone and is not subject to any shift due to Daylight saving time.

Therefore, if you create the backup configuration during Daylight saving time (DST), and the scheduled backup later runs when DST is no longer in effect, the time of the backup is different than is shown in the schedule. If you create the backup configuration when Daylight saving time (DST) is not in effect, and the scheduled backup later runs when DST is in effect, the time of the backup is different than is shown in the schedule.

Resolution:This is a known limitation. You can edit the backup schedule to adjust the time if needed.
