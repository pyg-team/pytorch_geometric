Q1. Does the Message ID change ? We have Exchange server sending mail to Domino Server. Both are internal. If yes, Is there any way to link both messages.

A. Yes. Message Id will be different for exchange and and Domino. There is no way to link the message ID, as each SMTP engine will have there own message ID.

Q5. We wanted to Block a Group of user from sending emails to Gmail.com, Yahoo.co.in etc .and others should be allowed to send. Is it possible ?

A. You can set this using rules. If you want to completely block users from sending messages to internet you can set the same from Configuration Document --> SMTP Outbound tab.

Q8. If we get the mail router error "Name not found in Domino Directory" which fields should be checked for an updated ?

A. When you get message "Name not found in Domino Directory" there is no specific fields to be checked. Router will look up the user in view "$Users" you need to update this view with the command "Load updall -t ("$users") names.nsf -R" 


Q9. How do we find the Passthru server details....if we do not have admin access to the server...?

A. You can find Passthru server details by looking at the server document in server address book which has a passthru sign in front of that. Server address book is accessible to all users.


Q10. We want to restrict a sender to send email to some respective domains only like MCD.COM, hence we have created a below rule on server but its not working. 

When Sender contains abc@xyz.com
AND any recipient does not contain mcd.com
-- Don't accept message 

If we are enabling the above rule then it is applying for all sender, means it will restrict all sender for sending emails to the domain other than mcd.com 

A. Don't enable such rule, you need to reconstruct the rule. It is suggested in that case you open a PMR with IBM support to check the behavior.


Q11. How can we block auto forwarding to external domain but open for internal domain ?

A. Currently it is not possible.


Q12. When we send mail from Archive database, it goes in Archive Sent items. Is it possible to save it in current mail file instead of Archive file ?

A. This is working as designed. It is not possible to change it.

A. Hop count is the number of servers through which the mail passes.


Q14. What is he maximum size which we can allow to send over SMTP?

A. There is no such limit for size.

Q16. How to send Lotus Notes email as an attachment ?

A. Simply drag the email to desktop or open the mail and go to File > Save as > *.eml and it will be saved as an eml file. Further this file can be send as an attachment.

Q17. Can saving as an eml file make the message to loose the header information ?

A. This has not been heard yet. You may log a PMR with IBM Support and provide the copy of such email for further analysis by IBM Support.

A. You can create an agent to achieve this. The agent should be created on a separate database and should act on mail.box
