SYMPTOM
User has installed Cognos 8.4 on an IBM AIX 5.3 machine, and deployed it on IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1. The Content Store is DB2. 

The Content Store connection is successful. The build of p2pd.ear file is successful and the deployment of IBM Cognos 8 application on the WAS server instance is also successful.

However, user gets error page "Content Manager not running", when they are accessing the content manage URI. i.e. http://<server>:9300/p2pd/servlet



CAUSE
JAVA_HOME is pointing to the different JDK and not the one which used by the IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1 


On UNIX platform user can type <env> command and on Windows platform user can open the command prompt and type the <set> command to find out the environment variables set for the user


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the JDK that is being used by the IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1 


UNIX administrator should be consult on how to set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
