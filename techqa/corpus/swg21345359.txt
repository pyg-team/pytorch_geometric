CAUSE
There are many different possible causes for the "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package" generic message: 

 * Scenario #1 - Controller 8.1.x client fails if the incorrectly patched version of .NET Framework 1.1 is installed  * In this scenario, you will get an entry inside the Event Viewer similar to the one listed above
   
   
 * Scenario #2 - Controller 8.2.x - 10.x client fails if the .NET Framework 2.0 is not installed.  * See separate IBM Technote #1382295.
   
   
 * Scenario #3 - User has remembered to disable Microsoft User Account Control (UAC) before installing the MSI file, but has forgotten to reboot the client device afterwards for the changes to be registered.  * See separate IBM Technote #1504404.
   
   
 * Scenario #4 - Excel not installed on client PC  * See separate IBM Technote #1345848.
   
   
 * Scenario #5 - Required component "wshom.ocx" not registered correctly on the client device.  * See separate IBM Technote #1361286.
   
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Scenario #1 

Install Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 SP1 ("NDP1.1sp1-KB867460-X86.exe") on the client PC. 

 * NOTE: .NET Framework 1.1 SP1 is available from Microsoft as a separate patch - it is required in addition to the original .NET Framework 1.1 ("dotnetfx.exe") install software.
