ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  [Edited excerpts from a memo sent by Robert Belden/White
   Plains/IBM on
   01/22/2003 06:32 PM] -
   I spent some time last night and this morning to help get more
   facts on how
   much storage calendar entries are consuming. In particular, I am
   concerned that
   replies to meetings are taking up undue space in our Notes
   databases.
   
   Methodology
   1)  I created a blank archive database, so that I could baseline
   what overhead
   the database shell required.
   2)  I made two copies of this database.
   3)  In the first, I copied into it all my meeting replies for
   2002.
   4)  In the second, I copied into it all my calendar entries,
   workflow notices,
   meeting replies, etc. Also, for 2002.
   
   Results Size Net Size # of Documents Avg Doc Size
   Empty Database 11,520 KB

   With All Calendar Documents 40,448 KB 28,928 KB 4,267 6.8 KB
   
   Observations
   My calendar is about "normal" for a manager or executive in the
   company. I
   suspect that if I observe a lot of storage usage for calendar
   documents, it is
   a rampant problem in the company, overall.
   Replies should be tiny. They aren't. At an average size of
   5.5KB, they can
   consume a lot of space -- in my case approximately 8 MB.
   One of the underlying causes of the replies being large is that
   they send back
   all the information in the original invitation. I had a number
   of meetings
   which had long invitee lists and the whole invitee list was sent
   back to me, ca
   using the meeting reply to be large. I think there is a huge
   potential benefit
   to be had by forcing replies to be simple, small documents.
   Calendar documents are a more complex subject -- but they
   consume a big amount
   of memory -- 29 MB in my case (this is a superset of the 8 MB
   cited above,
   since replies are also included with the calendar documents).
   One thought I
   had, just scanning the calendar entries, is to suggest that
   people not put
   attachments on the calendar entries....when they do, they get
   large, and then
   do not get archived. I had 4 or 5 instances where calendar
   entries had
   attachments, one of which was over 2 MB. But most importantly,
   there has to be
   a simpler, more concise method for archiving calendar entries --
   today, they
   just sit out there gathering dust.  -- (Will not be addressed by
   this SPR.)
   
   
   Technical Details
   To address the storage concerns, I removed the various fields
   related to the
   invitee lists from common reply types. I did some quick
   interoperability
   testing and everything seemed to work fine. I tested the change
   by having the
   various chairs View Invitee Status.
   
   In my tests, the average reply size was about 1K. It's not going
   to get much
   smaller than that as weeding out the other fields will have a
   negligible effect
   with the level of risk significantly increasing.
   
   One field in particular, $CSTrack, can cause significant
   variance in the reply
   size. This field is a text list which keeps track of the C&S
   operations that
   have occurred. It can not be removed as it is used by Customer
   Support to
   diagnose problems.
   
   Specifically, the fields being removed are:
   RequiredAttendees
   OptionalAttendees
   AssignedTo
   OptionalAssignedTo
   AltRequiredNames
   AltOptionalNames
   INetRequiredNames
   INetOptionalNames
   StorageRequiredNames

   My Quick Test Environment
   Tried single and simple repeating meetings.
   Operating system for all users -  Windows 2003 Professional
   SP3.
   Server for all users - V70_02172003 Domino server.
   Chair Person Participant/Room/Resource
   R4.6.7a Notes client and mail template.
   V5012_12122002 Notes client and mail template.
   V70_02172003 client with V603_02032003 mail
   template. V70_02172003 client with
   V603_02032003 mail template.
   
   The code (which is trivial) is checked into ClearCase branch
   whang_60733 which
   is based off V70_02172003. Basically, the fields are removed
   right before the
   subject is modified on the reply notice. The code is restricted
   to the
   participant/resource context and only applies to the above
   notice types.
   
   Most of the effort will need to be done by QE to make sure there
   are no side
   effects, especially with prior releases. However, the risk is
   low.
