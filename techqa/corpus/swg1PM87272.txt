APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED WITH UNKNOWN CLOSE CODE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user opened a new crosstab report using a DQM package in
   Cognos Workspace Advanced. He drags a measure from the metadata
   tree into the measure area of the crosstab. Now the crosstab is
   not displayed any more in the studio (screens are in attached
   issue_description.pdf).??This happens when a DMR package is
   used. A relational package or an OLAP package do not show this
   behavior.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Either insert an element into the crosstab edges before the meas
   ure is inserted or change the Cognos Workspace Advanced view fro
   m Page Preview to Page Design.
