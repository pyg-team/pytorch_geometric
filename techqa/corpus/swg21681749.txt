 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I use Open LDAP to authenticate operating system login users on my IBM PureData System for Analytics appliance? 

ANSWER
The attached documents describe how to configure the IBM PureData System for Analytics appliances to support operating system logins by users who are authenticated through an LDAP server within your environment. 

IMPORTANT: Existing IBM Netezza user documentation includes numerous references that LDAP authentication is supported only for Netezza database user accounts. With this procedure, you can now configure LDAP authentication for operating system user access. 

The LDAP operating system user authentication has been tested and verified with NPS release 7.0.2, 7.0.4, 7.1, and 7.2. The LDAP authentication support is valid for any subsequent fix packs of those releases, unless otherwise indicated in the readme file for a fix pack. This document requires the IBM Netezza Hardware Support Tools version 8.3.0.3, which is available on IBM Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/Netezza+Tools&release=HWSUPPORT_8.3&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=8.3.0.3-IM-Netezza-HWSUPPTOOLS-fp93648&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc].
