PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You attempt to migrate WebSphere Process Server profiles from any version of 6.1 to any version of 6.2 and later. If the user ID does not have the "create view" privilege, a CWLAE0005I error and a java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01031: insufficient privileges exception displays when you start the deployment manager or stand alone server 

SYMPTOM
You see the following error in the SystemOut.log file: 

utilE com.ibm.wbiserver.relationshipservice.util.ArtifactLoaderUtility createRuntimeSchema (JPT_Cashiering_AffiliateClubApp) CWLAE0005I: An exception was encountered when the relationship service code was executing.

You see the following stack dump in the corresponding FFDC file: 

Stack Dump = java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01031: insufficient privileges

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps. The user ID that accesses the common database needs an additional "create view" privilege. 

 1. Request that your database administrator grants the "create view " privilege for the database user ID that you are using to access the common database. See the following command:
    
    grant create view to @DB_USER@;
    
    
 2. Restart the servers after the "create view" privilege is granted.



Review all of the required Database privileges [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v6r2mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.wps.620.doc/doc/rpln_db_privileges.html] that are documented in the WebSphere Process Server information center.
