RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Q : The forms in yantra WMS is built using what? Is it some versions of oracle forms? 
A : Yantra WMS UI forms were built using JAM, a Front-end tool similar to Oracle Forms.

Q : If not, do you have a document which identifies how to create a new form if any?
A : A form / function can be developed using a couple of mechanisms based on the functionality desired.
1) UI Shell Script : Called using "Function Profile Setup ( 09753 )"
This shell script should do all of the user requested handling and processing.
2) Using Yantra Print Architecture which use Screen files to take input data at once and then invoke a shell script and perform intended processing.

Option 1 above will be quite simple and straightforward to develop, test, and deploy in-house by Customer.

Option 2, Refer to WMS Report and Labels Config guide for research and reference. 

Based on functionality and complexity, you may need some help from YES ( Yantra Enhancement Service ) for any such task.
