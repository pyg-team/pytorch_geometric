Title: IBM License key center shows null available Activation kit after first download - United States

Text:
Activation Kit; RLKC; License Key Center; null available; download activation kit; not available; 0 available TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to download the Activation kit type of license keys results in the IBM Rational License Key Center (LKC) showing the license quantity as zero (0) available. 

SYMPTOM
Unlike the floating type license key, the quantity of activation kit type license keys will show "0 available" after the first time the license key is created from Rational License Key Center, no matter how many license keys you have purchased.


CAUSE
The license activation kit is an Eclipse based license key that you can download from the license key center. 

 * It is not host based and can be imported on any clients. 
 * You can use the same kit to validate the whole amount of clients you are entitled to without restrictions.


Because of this, the License Key Center will show the quantity available as null. 
Note: Once you have generated the activation kit license key, you can not return or re-generate it. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

WORKAROUND: 

 * You can make copies of the activation kit type license key up to the quantity you have purchased. 
 * You can download the activation kit again by clicking Download button next to previously generated key in LKC.
   


Note: Activation kit type licenses are a trust based license. You should use the license keys up to the quantity you purchased. RELATED INFORMATION
