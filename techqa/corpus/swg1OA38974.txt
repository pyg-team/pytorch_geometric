   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: AGENT FAILS TO DISCARD EVENTS FOR A     *

   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   Agent fails to discard events collected in autonomous mode
   for a stopped or modified situation. Situation events remain
   stored in persistent files on the agent if a situation is
   stopped while an agent is running in autonomous mode.
   Symptom: Presence of persistent files
   <hostname><pc>_autoattr.asa in the agent  directory when
   agent is connected to the monitoring server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Agent framework now discards events for stopped or modified
   situations.
