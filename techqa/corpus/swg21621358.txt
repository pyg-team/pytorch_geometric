Title: IBM How to have users in the same group share the on-hold verify tasks when disabling the Job Monitor Permission in Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1? - United States

Permission; Job Monitor; Share; On hold task TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Sometimes, the verify operators have no permission of the Job Monitor because the Datacap admins don't want them to perform the functionality of Job Monitor. However, if the permission of Job Monitor is disabled, the operators in the same group can't share the verify jobs which are put on-hold by the other operators. For example, there are operators mk1 and mk2 which are in the same group AUTDIT-OPERATOR. Then disable the permission of the job monitor for the group AUTDIT-OPERATOR. We see that both operators can't do the Job Monitor functionality. On the other hand, the mk1 and mk2 can't share the same verify task which is on hold. Below is a specific scenario to explain this situation. The operator mk1 does the verify task and put it on hold. Then the operator mk2 logins to Datacap. The mk2 can't see the task put on hold by mk1. As a result, the on-hold task can't be shared between mk1 and mk2 although they are in the same group. 

SYMPTOM
The users in the same group can't share the same on-hold task.


CAUSE
There is the sub-permission Enabling the Priority/Operator change under the main Job Monitor permission. The sub-permission can be enabled without the main permission. If the sub-permission Priority/Operator change is enabled, the users in the same group can share the on-hold task between each other.

ENVIRONMENT
8.1

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Enable the sub-permission Priority/Operator change separately without the Job Monitor permission enabled.
