ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is integrating WPS and TAM 4.1 on Windows 2k Sp3. One
   of the steps is to configure the pkmslogout to redirect to
   another web page. Customer cannot get this to work. When they do
   a http://<webseal>/pkmslogout?filename=wpslogout.html, it goes
   to the logout.html instead. I cannot get this recreated in my
   environment. There needs to be a way to trace the pkmslogout
   form.
   .
   Also, customer is having the same issue for pkmspasswd:
   .
   The portal page is going to be our intranet page and we do not
   want the end users seeing any of the "ugly" WebSeal screens.  We
   have a couple ways of resolving this.
   .
   One is that we simply "pretty" up the html pages provided with
   WebSeal.  But this still requires us to use those html pages,
   meaning they will look distinct from the rest of the portal even
   if we try to make them look similar.
   .
   Two is that we use the WebSeal commands within the portal
   architecture.  (I am about to get technical) I have a login
   portlet that simply displays login.jsp as its view.  In this
   page, I get a parameter from the request object called
   "status".  This parameter tells me what part of the process I am
   dealing with.  For example, when the portlet loads on the
   unauthenticated portal page, the "status" is null and therefore
   the page loads a simple login screen (username, password, login
   button).  Users enter the username and their password and click
   the login button which submits the username and password to
   "/pkmslogin.form?filename=loginRedirect.html".  If the login is
   successful, then it should be sending the request to
   loginRedirect.html, which I have created to redirect back to the
   logged in portal page.  If the login isn't successful (for
   example, the password is expired), then the login command will
   redirect to passwd_exp.html.  I have modified that page to
   redirect back to the portal with status=passwordexpired as part
   of the query string.  The login portlet's login.jsp recognizes
   that status parameter and displays the form to change the
   password.  I literally copied the form from the passwd_exp.html
   file.  When you submit this form (to
   "/pkmspasswd.form?filename=loginRedirect.html"), it should be
   changing the password and logging you in and sending you to the
   logged in portal page.  But it seems to be sending you to the
   WebSeal login.html page instead.  There is probably a reason why
   it's doing this and if I had documentation, I could look it up.
