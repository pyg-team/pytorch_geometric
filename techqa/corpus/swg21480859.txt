Title: IBM Upgrade patch cannot be installed by the Windows Installer service - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have downloaded an incremental patch for SPSS for Windows. When I attempt to install it, I encounter the following error:

The upgrade patch cannot be installed by the Windows Installer service because the program to be upgraded may be missing, or the upgrade patch may update a different version of the program. Verify that the program to be upgraded exists on your computer and that you have the correct upgrade patch.

What is the problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following will render the above error:

1. You do not have the appropriate major dot release of SPSS for Windows installed on your system.

2. You already have the current version of SPSS for Windows installed on your system. 

The following no longer apply starting with version 17.
3. If you have the SPSS Graduate Pack or Career Starter versions, you need to download and install the patch that corresponds to your flavor of SPSS. 

4. You have a non-English release of SPSS for Windows which is already based on the current version
