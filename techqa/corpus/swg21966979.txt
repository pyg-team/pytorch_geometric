PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to login to IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (DNG) or IBM Rational Jazz Team Server (JTS) results in a "403: AuthorizationFailed" error in the browser. 

CAUSE
Problem with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) configuration in the Websphere Application Server(WAS) during the initial application setup or after a change to LDAP configuration.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The WAS SystemOut.log file can contain the following error:


SECJ0129E: Authorization failed for user <Username> while invoking GET on default_host:/jts/secure/authenticated/identity, Authorization failed, Not granted any of the required roles: JazzUsers JazzAdmins JazzGuests JazzProjectAdmins "



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

To resolve this problem the Group Mappings for the jts.war file should be removed and refreshed.

To do this please follow the steps below:


 1. Open WAS Console.
    
 2. Navigate to the jts.war mappings file which is located under Applications/Application Types/Websphere enterprise applications/jts_war/Security role to user/group mapping.
    
 3. Remove all the current LDAP groups from each Jazz Group in the mapping table.
    
 4. Shut down WAS.
    
 5. Clear the WAS cache by first backing up and then deleting the contents of the following 2 directories  * WAS_INSTALL_LOCATION/profiles/AppSrv01/temp 
     * WAS_INSTALL_LOCATION/profiles/AppSrv01/wstemp 
    
    
 6. Restart WAS.
    
 7. In the WAS Console navigate back to the jts.war mappings as detailed in step 1 above.
    
 8. Add the LDAP group mappings back for each Jazz Group.
