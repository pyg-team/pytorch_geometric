CAUSE
Table statistics inside Oracle database are invalid.



ENVIRONMENT
Oracle schema exported from server#1, and the resulting DMP file was recently imported into different Oracle server (server#2).



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the Oracle statistics inside the Oracle database, and re-create them. 

 * TIP: The simplest method to achieve this is to perform a full database optimise (from within the Controller application).


Steps: 

 1. Ensure no other users on system 
 2. Launch Controller 
 3. Click "Maintain - User - Single Mode" 
 4. Click "Maintain - Database - Optimize" 
 5. Tick/select all available options 
 6. Click "Run"
