 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer-provided background information (also known as MustGather data) helps in problem determination and saves time when resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). This technote provides a description of the background information IBM® Support will need. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Gathering data before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data.
Collecting MustGather data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if:


 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a workaround to reduce severity.


Locating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix. 

1. General Information:  * How often does this problem occur? 
 * Can the problem be reproduced? 
 * How many users are affected by this problem? 
 * What is the business impact of this problem? 
 * Is there a workaround?

 * Are the FileNet Web Parts configured to connect to P8 using Integrated Windows Authentication (Single Sign On), or a Credential Store database? 
 * Are Web Parts using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection to P8? 
 * Is anonymous access enabled on the SharePoint server? 
 * Web.config file:
   The web.config file for the default web app can be found in: C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\80. The actual web.config file location will depend on where the web parts have been deployed. Whether they have been deployed to all web applications or a specific web application. 
 * Is the SharePoint site using the default master page? 
 * Are the Web Parts deployed to the root site collection or a non-root site collection?
   


8. Other Server Information 

The following information about the P8 servers in use may be needed:
