ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a Power Search is saved using the Prompt for Value option
   and on the Library tab the box is checked for Case Insensitive,
   this option is not honored.
   
   Launch Power Search and configure a search, be sure to select
   the "Enable prompting for values" and on the Library tab check
   the Case Insensitive box.  Save the Search.
       In my test I set U.S. State =
       I checked the "Enable prompting for values", and entered
   "What State do you want to seach"
       On the Library tab check the Case Insensitive box
   Find the search, double click on it, answer the prompt, enter it
   in all lower case.
       On my system I enter "Fl" and the search fails, the DM log
   shows this.
       [04/23/2007 14:38:15.459]      928 D: Evaluating query: '/*
   [((@SEMANTICTYPE = 1) OR (@SEMANTICTYPE = 2) OR (@SEMANTICTYPE =
   1000)) AND (@State = "Fl")]'
       [04/23/2007 14:38:15.553]      928 D: Number found: 0 in
   93ms
       [04/23/2007 14:38:15.553]      928 D: Number returned: 0
   
       However is I enter "FL" the search works
