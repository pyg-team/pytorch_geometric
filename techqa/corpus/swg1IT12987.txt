APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are errors while configuring the schedules though the
   time range entered is correct. Below are the scenarios:
   
   Scenario 1: Create a schedule based on timer, with default and
   under schedule exclusions page if you choose anytime current
   day and next day that is PM to AM it does not work. For
   example, 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM,
   where if you choose a time in the same day, such as
   10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, it works.
   
   Scenario 2: Create a schedule based on "run daily" as below
   in English locale:
   Change the language in the My Account page to traditional
   Chinese, and create the same schedule as above and it fails.
   
   Scenario 3: Create a schedule based on run daily as below.
   When we choose 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM which is between the above
   time range, it fails.
   
   Scenario 4: Create a schedule based on days of the week and
   the configuration fails.
   
   Scenario 5: The scenario3 when created to run weekly in
   Chinese fails while choosing the time range itself.
   
   Scenario 6: It is the same issue with run based on month.

   There are errors while configuring the schedules though the time
   range entered is correct. Below are the scenarios. Please refer
   to the schedules.doc(it contains screenshots which are missing
   here)
   Scenario 1 : Create a schedule based on timer, next page go with
   default and under schedule exclusions page if you choose anytime
   current day and next day that is PM to AM it does not work, that
   is for example 10:00 PM to 12:00 AM
   where as if you choose a time in the same day, that is lets say
   10:00 PM to 11:00 PM it works
   Scenario 2 :  Create a schedule based on "run daily"  as below
   in english locale
   Change the language in the My Account page to traditional
   chinese, and create the same schedule as above and it fails
   Scenario 3 : Create a schedule based on run daily as below
   When we choose 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM which between the above time
   range, it fails
   Scenario 4:  Create a schedule based on days of the week in
   english
   In chinese the same configuration fails
   Scenario 5 :  The scenario3 when created  run weekly  in chinese
   it would fail while choosing the time range itself

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem was in the comparison of the word 'every' written in
   chinese. The properties file had incorrect translation for this
   'every' word in chinese and so the behavior was unexpected.
   Resolved the issue and now it works perfectly.
