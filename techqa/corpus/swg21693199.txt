Note: The same fix may be listed under multiple vulnerabilities. Installing the fix addresses all vulnerabilities to which the fix applies. Also, some fixes require installing both a fix pack and a subsequent patch. While the fix pack must be installed first, any additional patches required may be installed in any order. 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None.
