ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After IZ88839 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88839] that went in to 622fp6, the TEPS schema name is
   required to be the same as the TEPS userid.  With MS SQL and
   ITM 621
   the TEPS DB schema name could be anything and the TEPS would
   find tables using the SQLTables function.
   This is because at 622fp6 we began enforcing that the userid
   and schema name must match.  Prior to this, the schema name
   could be anything and the SQLTables function would work. This
   caused problems in environments where multiple schemas existed,
   so the code was tightened to search only the schma of the TEPS
   userid.  This requirement of having the TEPS DB schema name and
   the TEPS user name match needs to be documented in the
   Installation and Config Guide for ITM v6.
   
   Note that if MS SQL 2005 is used for the TEPS DB, the schema
   name has to match the TEPS user name, otherwise the TEPS
   fails to start
   with an error:
   (Wednesday, June 13, 2012, 6:11:22
   PM-{16B0}ctinstallmanager.cpp,921,"CTInstall::Manager::installCh
   eck")
   ERROR: SQLTables failed: KFWHISTBEHAVIOR
   (Wednesday, June 13, 2012, 6:11:22
   PM-{16B0}ctinstallmanager.cpp,922,"CTInstall::Manager::installCh
   eck")
   ERROR: KFW_DSN Database 'teps', is missing table. Be sure tables
   were
   properly generated during installation or configuration.
   
   On a fresh install this will not be an issue, but in cases where
   ITM is upgraded from 6.2.2 or earlier where it was not checked,
   it is possible the schema name for the TEPS DB does not match
   the TEPS user name.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the TEPS database schema name to match the TEPS userid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See Error Description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Tivoli Monitoring v6.3 user documentation hasbeen updated
   in Chapter 7, Upgrading from a previous installation, saying
   that the portal server database schema name must match the
   portal server user ID for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 when
   upgrading from v6.2.2.
