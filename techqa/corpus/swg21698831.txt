Title: IBM Security Bulletin: A security vulnerability has been identified in IBM WebSphere Application Server shipped with IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
CVE-2015-0138 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.1, 7, 8, 8.5, and 8.5.5 that are used by IBM Rational ClearCase. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Please consult the Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with RSA Export Keys may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-0138) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613] for vulnerability details and information about fixes. 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase, CCRC WAN server/CM Server component. 

Versions 8.0.0.x, 8.0.1.x: 

 * 
 * 
 *  
   (a) You have installed CCRC WAN server into an existing profile, and that profile supports a non-default set of ciphers (b) You modified the set of supported ciphers in the WAS profile that was created during installation of ClearCase
   
   

Versions 7.1.x.x:  * 
 * 
 * In addition, this vulnerability only applies if you modified the ClearCase WAS profile by changing its list of supported ciphers.

Note: other components of ClearCase are subject to the "FREAK" attack, as disclosed in the following security bulletins:
