QUESTION
 Is running HP-UX Diagnostic and ITCAM for AD monitoring tools on the same JVM supported? 

ANSWER
We have not done any co-existence testing with both HP-Diagnostics and ITCAM for AD monitoring agents on the same JVM. 
We do not recommend simultaneous byte code instrumentation by two different monitoring agents. If the instrumentation for the HP product is turned off, ITCAM will probably work and vice-versa but this is a not tested and not supported configuration.
