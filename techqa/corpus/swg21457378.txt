PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When generating a bar file in WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus, the contents within the .cmf is not always in the same order. 

CAUSE
In pre v7 CMF generator, a .cmf file is generated with the contents ordered in a different way, even when using the same flow.

ENVIRONMENT
Linux, Windows

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When examining the .cmf files, the contents are not always built in the same order.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In WebSphere Message Broker v7, changes have been made to the cmf generation process, so the contents are ordered in the same way for every bar file created for the same flow.
