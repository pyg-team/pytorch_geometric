ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating a tablespace with NO FILE SYSTEM option on V10.1
   on Zlinux,  the following SQL1763N error is being returned.
   
    SQL1763N  Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space
         "<table-space-name>" due to reason "<reason-code>"
   
   This error message does not make sense in this context since we
   are creating a tablespace and not altering it.
   
   The reason we run into this issue is because when creating
   tablespaces with DMS containers and the containers reside on a
   storage devices with disk sector size not equal to 512 B, we are
   forced to create the tablespace with 'file system caching"
   option.
   
   
   The db2diag.log reported the following error message:
   
   "/xxxxxx/partition0/xxxxx2/xxxxxxx3/NODE0000/SICSSGD1/T0000014/C
   0000001.LRG" resides on a device with sector size not equal 512
   bytes.
    NO FILE      SYSTEM CACHING option cannot be supported.
   
   From InfoCenter:
   Before Version 9.5, the keyword FILE SYSTEM CACHING was implied
   if neither NO FILE SYSTEM CACHING nor FILE SYSTEM CACHING was
   specified. With Version 9.5, if neither keyword is specified,
   the default, NO FILE SYSTEM CACHING, is used. This change
   affects only newly created table spaces. Existing table spaces
   created prior to Version 9.5 are not affected. This change
   applies to AIX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows with the following
   exceptions, where the default behavior remains to be FILE SYSTEM
   CACHING:
   ?AIX JFS
   ?Solaris non-VxFS
   ?Linux for System z&#65449;
   ?All SMS temporary table space files
   ?Long Field (LF) and Large object (LOB) data files in SMS
   permanent table space files.
   
   This APAR will improve the return error message and will provide
   a better user response for this type of problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Problem Resolution: do not use the NO FILE SYSTEM CACHING
   option.
