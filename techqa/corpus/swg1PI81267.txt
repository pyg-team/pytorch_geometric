APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0-FP1 stream with a parameter defined as
   a Date Type is uploaded into IBM SPSS Collaboration and
   Deployment Services (C&DS) Server 8.0 repository. Execution of
   this stream is successful and produces the expected results.
   
   Issue occurs when a change is made to the parameter within C&DS
   Deployment Manager (Thick) Client. When the parameter value is
   changed in the Modeler job-step > Parameters tab, it is not
   reflected in the results and the original value of the stream is
   used.
   
   For example, original Modeler stream has a parameter
   ($P_DataReference) with an original value of "2016-09-25". This
   is used for a DERIVED field called DateOperation. When the
   Parameters tab of the Modeler job-step is edited to "2017-05-09"
   as the default value, the results in the output file of the
   derived field DateOperation, retains the original value of
   "2016-09-25".
   
   
   The expected behaviour is that when a change is made to the
   Parameters tab of a Modeler job-step, it is expected that the
   new value is represented in the results of the stream.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This appears to be isolated to the Date type of the Parameter
   setting. If String or Unknown is used, the updated value of the
   Modeler job-step > Parameters tab is reflected correctly in the
   results of the stream.
