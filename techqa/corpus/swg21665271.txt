Sterling Connect:Direct C:D UNIX XCPS012I TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When copying a file from a sterling Connect:Direct for UNIX node to a mainframe node, I get the message XCPS012I. What does this mean? 

CAUSE
When C:D UNIX copies a file to a dataset on a mainframe node, which is fixed block (FB) and has a given fixed record length (LRECL), it checks for records in the source data which are too long to fit in the recipient dataset's records. If it finds one or more records which are too long, this message is issued and the copy is failed.

ANSWER
XCPS012I
short.text=Block mode send record length &RLEN exceeds LRECL &LRCL.
long.text=During block mode send, encountered a source file record length that exceeds the destination file LRECL
SYSTEM ACTION->The copy step fails and CD processing continues with the next process step.
RESPONSE-> Correct source file record length or destination file LRECL.
