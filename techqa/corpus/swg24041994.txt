1.0 General description
=======================
This fix resolves the APARs and defects listed in the "Problems Fixed"
section below. 

2.0 Problems fixed
==================
2.1 APARS:
-------------------
APAR: IV79406
Abstract: Duplicated entries of SQL Server on TADDM portal.
Additional Information: SQL Server instance discovered from ITM 
DLA and TADDM Sensor was not reconciling on TADDM 
and duplicates were seen. The reason for duplicates
was that the DLA naming rules were not matching 
with the Sensors naming rules.

APAR: IV82234 
Abstract: False databases are reported as Suspected.
Additional Information: The data collected for Database Detail is written
in <InstanceName>_DBD_PREV file. Due to improper file handling the 
collector logs were written into this file which was causing collector 
logs to be seen on the portal and triggering false alerts.

2.2 DEFECTS:
-----------------
DEFECT: 138512
Abstract: Improvement of table detail (KOQTBLD) algorithm.
Additional Information: The Table Detail information is now sorted 
based on COLL_TBLD_SORTBY. 

DEFECT: 138519
Abstract: Default instance of SQL Server is identified as 'MSSQLSERVER' 
instead of hostname.
Additional Information: The default instance of SQL server used to get 
configured with hostname and not MSSQLSERVER. 
In an environment, where there was default instance and 
a named instance having same name as hostname had issues 
in configuration.

DEFECT: 140838
Abstract: Collector process crashes when collecting Statistics Summary
attribute group.
Additional Information: There was an access violation exception as agent
is trying to read from the memory that is already freed up.

2.3 Superseded fixes
--------------------
None

2.4 APARs and defects included from superseded fixes

5.0 Installation instructions
=============================
This fix can only be installed over an existing installation. 
Use the following steps to install this fix.

5.1 Before installing the fix
-----------------------------
- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites
for this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.

- With reference to this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the
IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value
for CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\IBM\ITM'
on Windows systems.

Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment
variable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation
directory.

For example:
> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM
> export CANDLEHOME

- Refer to section 7.0 entitled "Known problems and workarounds"
before installation.

- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to
perform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.

5.2 Local agent update
----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For
the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the
fully qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for that agent
platform. For more information on the "itmpatch" command, see
section 6.2.

On Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to
<TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:

For 32 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab

For 64 bit Agent:
> <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> 
-i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab

Note : Use "itmpatch" command from <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\ 
temporary directory.

5.3 Remote agent update
-----------------------
1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory
on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the
purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully
qualified path to this directory.
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the 
supported platforms.

3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use
the "tacmd addBundles" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX
systems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\bin on Windows systems. For more
information on the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring Administrator's Guide.

On UNIX systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

On Windows systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix 
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
might require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to 
be added to the depot. 

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. For more information on the
"tacmd login" and "tacmd updateAgent" commands, see "IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring Command Reference".

On UNIX systems: 
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001

Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is 
specified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the
managed system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be
updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always
an OS agent.

5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command 
>tacmd getDeployStatus <transaction id>

where transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.

5.4 Agent support update
------------------------
Use the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, 
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate archive file
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the 
Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers
or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.

2. Expand the archive file using the "tar" command on UNIX systems
or an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported
platforms.

3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)
that contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, 
Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop 
using the "tar" command on UNIX systems or an 
extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a 
directory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,
with the necessary updates.

4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either 
GUI installation or silent installation of the application 
support files. 

Note: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one
of the following additional steps must be performed.

1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version 
of the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at 
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]
for download and installation instructions.

2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to 
a java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running 
the itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. 

GUI installation option
------------------------
The GUI can be started by using one of the following commands
from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the 
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not
the component directory. The installer can install updates for 
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, use one of the following
commands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is 
located. 

Note: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 
or above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems 
requires the following files contained in interim fix 
6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and 
silent installation option of agent support upgrade.
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin
- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin
- Windows: setupwin32.exe

Follow the installation instructions contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README".

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] 
[-r <response file>] 
[-j <JAVAHOME>] 

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and
modified as per your environment.

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the
"bin" directory where Java(R) is installed.
The location of Java on your system might
vary.

5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer 
asks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components
you want to add application support to.
For this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:

Unchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)
Checked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)

Continue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the
Microsoft SQL Server 06.31.08.01 support to complete the
installation.

Note: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the
above Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. 


6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise
Portal Browser was running when the update was installed, it
must be restarted.


6.0 Additional installation information
=======================================
Any existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted
after the installation of this fix.

6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file
--------------------------------------------------
Fix (6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent
baroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already
installed these baroc files, there are no additional installation
steps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation
and Setup Guide under "Installing monitoring agent baroc files
on the event server" in "Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise
Console Event Synchronization" section for more information.

6.2 Additional information on using "itmpatch" command
----------------------------------------------------
The "itmpatch" command has the following syntax.

Usage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

itmpatch -h <installation home>
-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }

where:
-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory
-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be 
installed
-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch

For example, on UNIX systems:
- To preview the fix installation, use the "-t" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>

- To install the fix, use the "-i" option:
> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>

where:
<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring 
installation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include
the drive letter.
<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where
the fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive
letter.

6.3 Verifying the update
------------------------
1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the "tacmd" command
to view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.
You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring
Server prior to viewing the agent version.

For example:
On UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli 
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ

On Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory, the default location
is 'C:\IBM\ITM'.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser> 
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems -t OQ 

Note:
- The component (-t) for the tacmd "listSystems" command is 
specified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).

When the agent update is successful, the agent version is:
06.31.08.01.

After the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify
the agent was successfully updated.
For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is 
06.31.08.01.

2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use 
the "kincinfo" command on Windows systems or the "cinfo" command
on Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the 
versions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli 
Enterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Desktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.

Note: The displayed build date and installation date might not 
be accurate. This is known problem.

On UNIX or Linux systems:
-------------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

./cinfo -i

On Windows systems:
-------------------
To validate that all components have been installed, run the
following command:

For example:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\kincinfo -i

C:\Users\Administrator>kincinfo -i

7.0 Known problems and workarounds
==================================
Abstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade
Problem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading
agent fix pack. The following error message is 
displayed: 

Version 06.31.08.XX of product koq is currently installed.
The patch requires that you must have at least version
06.31.08.XX of product installed to apply this patch.
Workaround: Use the itmpatch.exe provided in patch file 
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-XXXXXX.zip or 
6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-XXXXXX.tar file.

Abstract: English characters are getting displayed in Agent support 
installer having Non-English language operating system.
Problem: In Non-English language operating system, when agent 
support installer is executed it shows English characters.
Workaround: None

Abstract: Installing support for patch fails on ITM 6.3.0
Problem: When you try to install the support for this patch on ITM
6.3.0, the installation fails with following error:
The wizard cannot continue because of the following error: 
could not load wizard specified in /wizard.inf (104)
Workaround: Use the pre-packaged binaries for itmasi available at:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]

Abstract: Crash encountered in event viewer for koqagent.exe
Problem: Sometimes while stopping the koqagent process, the collection
process is not getting completed. When koqagent.exe stops, the
thread spawned by it gets terminated forcefully. Hence it's
causing a crash.
Workaround: None

Abstract: Application support installation fails on Non Windows OS.
Problem: While installing the application support on the machines
having Operating system other than windows, the support
installation using ASI fails if the temporary directory 
where the patch files are extracted has spaces.
Workaround: Use the temporary directory without space.

Abstract: MSSQL Agent collector crashes.
Problem: Sometimes the job 'syspolicy_purge_history' fails and 
the collector crashes.
Workaround: 1. Disable scheduling of system job 'syspolicy_purge_history'.
2. Disable detail trace logging.

Abstract: MSSQL Agent collector process keeps on restarting.
Problem: If the default instance is configured before patch upgrade then 
after patch upgrade the collector process keeps on restarting 
Workaround: In this patch, the name of default instance is changed from 
HOSTNAME to MSSQLSERVER (Defect 138519). Hence, the previously 
configured default instance with name as HOSTNAME will not 
work properly. So, it is required to unconfigure default 
instance (with name hostname) and configure it with name as 
MSSQLSERVER.

Following are the steps to unconfigure and configure:
1. Open Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services 
(MTEMS) window. 
2. Right click on template row and go to 
"Configure Using Defaults".
3. Select the default instance with name as HOSTNAME 
from 'Server To Monitor' list box and click on ">>" button 
to unconfigure it.
4. Select the instance with name 'MSSQLSERVER' in 
'Database Servers Available' list box and click on "<<" button
to configure this instance.
5. Set the configuration parameters and start the agent.

Abstract: KOQ.SAVE registry is created for 631FP8 agent
Problem: When a configured instance is un-configured or 631FP8 agent is 
uninstalled, the KOQ.SAVE registry is created.
Workaround: In case of upgrade to 6318IF1, manually delete the 
KOQ.SAVE registry.
