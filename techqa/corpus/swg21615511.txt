QUESTION
 Is it possible to monitor IBM InfoSphere Guardium (Guardium) devices in IBM Tivoli Monitoring using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)? 

ANSWER
Yes. Guardium does not provide a specific custom Management Information Base (MIB) file for SNMP polling. However, the MIB file UCD-SNMP-MIB [http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/mibs/UCD-SNMP-MIB.txt] is a widely used MIB file to query many SQL Guard metrics. This MIB file also can be used to query Guardium devices. 

An Agent Builder agent can be created using the Management Information Base (MIB) file UCD-SNMP-MIB to access Guardium data. 

An Agent Builder agent built with the UCD-SNMP-MIB using SNMP v1 worked well to get the data from Guardium SNMP. Tivoli Monitoring Universal Agent can also be used for this purpose. 

Please note that the MIB file UCD-SNMP-MIB may not be available for download in the future. Guardium devices may provide SNMP data differently in the future. An Agent Builder or Universal Agent agent may fail to work if Guardium provides data using different MIB definitions than was used to create an agent.
