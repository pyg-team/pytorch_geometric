ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 release installed on a
   Apple Macintosh 10.10 OSX Yosemite.
   You click File - Open - Data and select Excel file type XLS
   You either browse to demo.xls on
   /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23/Samples/English folder or
   use an own XLS Excel file for import.
   However, the file is not opened.
   You get below error:
   
   (2068) Excel file version (Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook) is
   currently not supported by the Excel DAC (or)
   Out of Memory error occurred. Please convert to Excel 97/2003
   format (or) increase java heap size in jvmcfg.ini and try again.
   
   When you use an Excel XLSX file for import it works, so as a
   workaround open the XLS file in Microsoft Excel first and save
   it as XLSX file (or CSV file format).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This is a third party issue caused by Apache POI.
   Unix and Mac use a different code path to read XLS file formats
   than Windows.  Unix/Mac relies on Apache POI to read XLS files.
   Statistics 23 use POI version 3.10.  There are differences in
   the classes included in Apache v3.10 compared to POI v3.0.1 used
   in prior releases.
   The workaround to be used is to save the XLS format in XLSX
   format in Excel and then import in release 23 on Macintosh
