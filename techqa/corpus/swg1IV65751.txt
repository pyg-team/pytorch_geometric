   populated on receipt transactions.
   
   9. Via the Purchase Orders application, create a new Purchase
   Order and enter the Company COMP1.
   
   10. On the PO Lines tab, click New Row and enter the following
   information:
   
   Item: A0756
   Quantity: 10
   Storeroom: 01
   
   11. Approve the purchase order.
   
   12. Note the GL Debit and Credit Accounts associated to the

   13. Navigate to the Receiving application for the purchase
   order that was just created.  Click Select Ordered Items.
   
   14. Select line 1 and click OK.
   
   15. Change the receipt line quantity to 1 and save.  The
   receipt status should be WASSET.
   
   16. Note the GL Debit and Credit Accounts on the receipt.  The
   credit account is that of the purchase order line and the debit
   account is the receiving holding locations GL Control Account.
   
   17. From the Select Action menu, choose Receive Rotating Items.
    Enter an Asset number and click OK.
   
   18. A receipt to transfer the quantity from the receiving
   holding location into the storeroom has been created.

   that was just received and click OK.

   be set to the GL debit account of the purchase order line.
   This is inconsistent with other return transactions, in
   particular using the Select Items for Return for non-rotating
   items.
