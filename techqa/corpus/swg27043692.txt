Title: IBM Navigator Sync MustGather and Troubleshooting - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). 

CONTENT
Collecting data before you open a problem management record (PMR) can help you to answer the following questions:


 * Do the symptoms match any known problems? If so, has a fix or workaround been published? 
 * Can the problem be identified and resolved without a code fix? 
 * When does the problem occur?


Complete the following steps before you contact IBM Software Support: 

 1. Ensure that the appropriate versions of the following software are installed:  * IBM FileNet P8  * IBM Navigator Sync is a IBM FileNet P8 only Java EE 6 feature. For more information, see Features of IBM Content Navigator [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucao003.htm].
       
       
     * Ensure that you are using one of the following web application servers:  * Oracle WebLogic Server 
        * WebSphere Application Server  * Important: If you are using WebSphere Application Server 7.0 or earlier or Oracle WebLogic Server 11g or earlier, IBM Navigator sync service is not supported and will not be deployed as part of your IBM Content Navigator deployment.
          
          
        * Remember: IBM Navigator sync services is not supported if you use any of the following repositories or any combinations of them without IBM FileNet P8:  * IBM Content Manager Version 8 
           * IBM CMIS 
           * IBM Content Manager OnDemand
          
          
       
       
    
    
 2. Verify that the IBM Navigator sync services are operational by accessing the Sync Server Summary page from a web browser. For more information, see Configuring sync services for IBM Content Navigator [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco111.htm]. 
 3. Enable debug logging and re-create the problem for specific users or host computers, or for the entire system if necessary. For more information, see Enabling server logging for IBM Content Navigator [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucts002.htm].  *  Important: Do not enable debug logging in a production environment. It can negatively affect system performance, and it enables users to view server messages in the web client. After the logs capture the required event or information, restore your original logging settings to control the size of your log files and to improve performance. 
    
    
 4. Gather the IBM Navigator Sync client log files, which by default are in the following directory: 
    C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\IBM\Content Navigator for Sync 
 5. Describe the problem. Provide the following information to help IBM Software Support understand the problem that you are encountering:  * What are you trying to do when the problem occurs? 
     * Can the problem be reproduced? If so, how? Provide specific steps to reproduce the problem. 
     * How many users are affected by this problem? 
     * What is the business impact of this problem? 
     * Is there a workaround for this problem? 
    
    
 6. Describe your deployment environment:  * Operating system and version 
     * Application server and version 
     * Type of installation performed:  * Interactive (graphical user interface) 
        * Silent (command-line interface)
       
       
     * Installation location:  * Default location 
        * Custom location; include the fully qualified directory where you installed IBM Content Navigator

Troubleshooting 

No updates occur in the IBM Navigator Sync client 

 * 
 * 
 * This is usually because Content Platform Engine is not communicating with the sync server. To fix this issue, adjust the URL that Content Platform Engine uses when it needs to deliver a notification to the sync server. For more information, see Configuring sync services for IBM Content Navigator [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco111.htm]. 
 * 


The IBM Navigator Sync client shows a "path too long" exception  * 
 * 
 * To resolve this issue, shorten the sync folder name or limit the folder depth that the client is syncing. 
 * 


Resolving document conflicts  * 
 * 
 * Tips for syncing items in IBM Content Navigator
 * 


Some content is excluded by the IBM Navigator Sync client 

 * 
 * 
 *   * The client ignores files that are tagged as System, Read-only or Hidden. This applies only to new files that the client encounters in the file system. 
    * The IBM Navigator Sync client syncs documents without content or external documents, but the user will not see them on their workstation. However, when the user checks in a new version of these documents that has content, the client automatically loads them and they are visible in the file system. 
    * The IBM Navigator Sync client does not sync any documents with MimeTypes listed in the MimeTypeExclusionList.txt file.  * If you modify this file, changes will not take effect until the client is stopped and restarted.
      
      
    * The IBM Navigator Sync client does not add new files to the repository that have the file extensions listed in the ExtensionExcludeList.txt file.  * If you modify this file, changes will not take effect until the client is stopped and restarted.
      
      
   
   


MustGather information for reporting issues 

IBM Navigator sync service issues 

 *  Gather system configuration information such as:  * Operating system and version 
    * Application server and version 
    * Type of installation performed:  * Interactive (GUI) 
       * Silent (command-line interface)
      
      
    * Installation location:  * Default location 
       * Custom location; include the fully qualified directory where you installed IBM Content Navigator
      
      
   
   Gather steps to reproduce the issue. Provide application server logs. For more information, see Gathering data for troubleshooting and problem reports for the IBM Content Navigator web client [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucts004.htm]. Send the results of the Sync Server Summary page. For more information, see Configuring sync services for IBM Content Navigator [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEUEX_2.0.3/com.ibm.installingeuc.doc/eucco111.htm]. Change the log level to DEBUG or TRACE, for example:  * http[s]://icnhost:9080/sync/ChangeLogLevel?level=error 
    * http[s]://icnhost:9080/sync/ChangeLogLevel?level=warn 
    * http[s]://icnhost:9080/sync/ChangeLogLevel?level=info 
    * http[s]://icnhost:9080/sync/ChangeLogLevel?level=debug 
    * http[s]://icnhost:9080/sync/ChangeLogLevel?level=trace
   
   Optional: Retrieve the IBM FileNet P8 sync handler log. 
 * If there is an issue with retrieving IBM FileNet P8 sync events from the IBM FileNet P8 event handler, the sync event handler log must be captured to check events that are generated by the IBM FileNet P8 event subsystem. To capture the IBM FileNet P8 sync handler log, define two server custom properties:  * SyncEventLogFile The SyncEventLogFile value should be a full path to the sync event handler log file. 
      
      
    * SyncEventLogLevel Use one of the following values: all, fine, finer, finest, info, off, severe, or warning. These values should be defined for the application server instance where IBM FileNet P8 Content Platform Engine is deployed.
      
      
   
   
 * IBM Navigator Sync client issues If you have issues with the IBM Navigator Sync client you must first complete the MustGather procedure for IBM Navigator sync services and then complete the following steps: 
   
    *  Provide the following MustGather information:  * Client and server configuration  * Client operating system and version 
          * File system type (NTFS/FAT) 
          * IBM Navigator Sync client version
         
         
       * Steps to reproduce
      
      Supply the IBM Navigator Sync client and server logs, application server logs, and error message text or screen captures. Include information about the troubleshooting steps that you have taken to resolve the issue. 
   
   


Gather installation log files  * 
 * 
 *  
   Display the installation log by selecting the check box that is shown at the end of the installation program. By Default, the GUI installation log is written to the user's temporary directory, for example:  * 
    * C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\IBM_Content_Navigator_Sync_Log.txt
   
   
 * For silent installations: 
 *  
   Generate the installation log on any specified path after th /L argument in the silent installation command, for example:  * 
    * ICNSyncClient.exe /v"/qn /L*v C:\SyncInstallLog.txt AgreeToLicense="Yes" <optional parameters>
   
   


Enable debug logging for the IBM Navigator Sync client  * 
 * 
 *  
   C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\IBM\Content Navigator for Sync 
 * 
 * To enableDEBUG logs, locate the installation folder and open file log4net.config file. Replace the value ERROR with the value DEBUG and restart the application.
