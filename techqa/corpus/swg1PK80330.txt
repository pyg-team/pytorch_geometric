ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For the resolution of defect RATLC01250951(ALM: Can not use CQWe
   b with multi user accounts on IE7.0 at the same time) and RATLC0
   1250949 (ALM: Via Firefox, multiuser can not use CQWeb(Falcon) a
   t the same time), since this is a browser issue within the lates
   t browser version and CQ can do nothing to avoid, so it is neede
   d to add it to the release notes to let users know.
   
   - taken from RATLC01279216
   
   Here is an overview:
   
   - schema with two production databases (A and B)
   - user has login access to both
   - user opens browser window(bw) 1 to CQWeb, logs into db A
   - user opens bw 2 to CQWeb, is automatically logged into db A
   - user logs out of db A in bw2, logs into db B
   
   at this point, if the user goes back into bw1 in db A, they can
   still create records for db A, and any queries already defined w
   ill return results from db A.  However, if the user defines a ne
   w query, they will get results from db B, from which they can ac
   cess and modify records of that db.  This behavior can be seen i
   n both internet explorer and firefox.  I know it sounds a little
    crazy, but overall the definition of the behavior of the 7.1 we
   b interface is now unclear.  With the RCP or Windows clients, a
   user can open up multiple client instances and be logged into tw
   o databases at the same time without this issue occurring.  In t
   he 7.0.x web interface, the user had a dropdown selection to sel
   ect the database they are currently working with, so logging out
    and back in is not required to switch.  If a user tried to open
    two separate windows connected to different databases under the
    same schema, any action in either session automatically require
   s them to log back into that database.
   
   I understand that this goes a little overboard, but this is what
    the client is concerned with.  I can't see the behavior I am de
   scribing above for 7.1 as working as designed, but that would be
    an engineering call.  I have attached a few screenshots of a we
   b session showing query results of different databases under the
    same session.

COMMENTS
 *  This is not a product problem because the behavior is
