   Under extreme load, the collective controller cannot service all
   of the incoming http requests.  Failures result on the client
   servers (e.g. collective member servers).  An error is found in
   the controller logs that contains:
   
   com.ibm.ws.channel.ssl.internal.SSLHandshakeErrorTracker     E
   CWWKO0801E: Unable to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized
   access was denied or security settings have expired. Exception
   is javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during
   handshake
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product is improved to allow batching of requests in the
   FRAPPE component, when there are simultaneous requests
   received.
