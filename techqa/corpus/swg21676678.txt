QUESTION
 Does JazzSM v1.1 need to be installed before installing the JazzSM 1.1.0.2 package that is bundled with Tivoli System Automation Application Manager v4.1 ? 

ANSWER
The TSAAM v4.1 installation instructions are documented in such a way as to suggest that JazzSM v1.1 needs to be installed before JazzSM v1.1.0.2 fixpack can be installed. However, this is not the case. The JazzSM v1.1.0.2 package that is bundled with TSAAM v4.1 is a complete JazzSM package and therefore can be installed without first installing the base v1.1 code level.
For reference, the JazzSM v1.1.0.2 eAssembly (package) referenced above is called the following :
