ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using an IBM Content Collector offline repository in Lotus

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you use IBM Content Collector 4.0 and enable an offline
   repository in Lotus Domino, it might happen that some
   attachments cannot be opened correctly. If Lotus Domino
   compresses the attachment after it has been stubbed, a corrupt
   version of the attachment is retrieved from the local
   repository. As a result, the attachment cannot be opened.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0 Fix Pack 2, the
   problem has been fixed. Re-enable the Domino template by using
   the IBM Content Collector Domino Template Enablement utility to
   activate the corrected template. Then install and enable the IBM
    Content Collector Offline Repository again.
