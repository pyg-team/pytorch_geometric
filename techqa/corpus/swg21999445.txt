 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM API Connect is affected by three vulnerabilities in Node.js (CVE-2016-7099, CVE-2016-5325 and one for which a CVE ID was not assigned.) These vulnerabilities are now fixed. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2016-7099 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7099]
DESCRIPTION:Node.js could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper verification of the host name. By sending a specially-crafted certificate containing wildcard characters, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the system.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117538 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117538]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID:CVE-2016-5325 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5325]
DESCRIPTION:Node.js is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the reason argument in ServerResponse#writeHead() function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117539 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117539]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID:Not Applicable
DESCRIPTION:Node.js could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the loading of third-party engine modules when the ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() function is used. By impersonating malicious code as a module, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 4.9
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117537 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117537]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
