Recommended Minimum AIX Technology Levels 

The recommended minimum technology levels are minimum levels. Unless otherwise indicated, higher Technology (TL) or Service Pack (SP) levels are recommended. The prerequisite levels in the standard Informix product documentation are the minimum levels required for support and do not change after the product becomes generally available; the recommended minimum levels presented in this document deal with issues discovered after the product became generally available. Following these recommendations can result in increased system stability and reliability.
