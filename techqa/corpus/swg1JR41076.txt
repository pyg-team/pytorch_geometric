APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  4.Creating profiles using the manageprofiles command-line
   utility
   :http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5mx/topic/
   com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.sbpm.doc/topics/ccnfg_select_config.html
   5.I would change the link for "Prerequisites for creating or
   augmenting profiles." to something like Database prerequisites
   for creating or augmenting profiles.  This would encourage
   someone to click the link which has a lot of usefull and needed
   information.  Otherwise they might skip it thinking its another
   link to the same system pre-reqs that they have already read.
   6.Not quite sure about APAR for this part as the information is
   there and linked.
   7.In this general section "Creating profiles using the
   manageprofiles command-line utility" I do not see anything
   (examples or otherwise) that helps me cerate the profile using
   the file created by the database design tool.  To find this
   information I have to read though everything including the
   examples then click the link (Related information
   manageprofiles parameters ) to find out how to specify the file
   created by the database design tool.
   8.When using the database design tool you do not need almost any
   of the variables used in the command line / response file that
   are associated to the database as the generated file contains
   all of these values.  I also belive that you would not need to
   add the -adminUserName adminUser_IDetc parameters in the
   response as this is indicated in the generated file from the
   database design tool
   9.APAR this to add complete explanation and example of how to
   run the manage profile commmand using the file created from the
   database design tool.
   10.Noteable -- in this same section we are using the
   profilemanagement tool to create profiles, we have customers
   that need to specify ports as they have security concerns (CIA
   for example).  They need a way to be able to specify ports that
   will be used during profile creation.  I believe you can specify
   this in the profiletemplate directory but I am not sure.
