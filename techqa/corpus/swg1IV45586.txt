PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users of the SNMP probe.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The description of how to install the Configuration Analyser *
   * on UNIX and Linux systems is incomplete. The use of          *
   * nco_patch applies to IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2.1 only. *
   * Information on the nco_install_integration, which is used    *
   * from IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.3.0 and later, is         *
   * missing.                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The product documentation will be updated with the next      *
   * release of the probe.                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the Reference Guide for the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus SNMP
   Probe, modify the section named Installing the Configuration
   Analyser on UNIX and Linux systems. Modify the text to provide a
   summary of the procedure that the user follows to install the
   analyser. In here, specify clearly which utility to use for the
   applicable versions of Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus. In addition, add
   a reference to the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Installation and
   Deployment Guide for details of how to use that utility.
