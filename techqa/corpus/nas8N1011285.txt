C:\Users\Public\Documents\IBM\Client Access\Config

Note: If you can not find the file try searching for it. Click on "Start", "Search", select search "All files and folders" and in "All or part of the file name" search for "Unity.Toolkit" 3. Make a backup copy of all the files that start with Unity.Toolkit. 4. Delete all the files that start with Unity.Toolkit. 5. Restart System i Navigator.
