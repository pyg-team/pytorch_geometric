APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  when a Enterprise Application is added and published to WAS test
   environment, there is a error: "publish failed EJB Bean could
   not be deployed". while there is no ejb beans itself in
   application.
   
   in the .metadata/.log, you may see following error:
   
   !ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.server.core 4 0 2008-01-03 11:05:20.565
   !MESSAGE Publishing failed
   !SUBENTRY 1 com.ibm.etools.server.task.ejbdeploy 4 0 2008-01-03
   11:05:20.565
   !MESSAGE EJB beans could not be deployed
   !SUBENTRY 1 com.ibm.ws.ast.st.common.core 4 4 2008-01-03
   11:05:20.565
   !MESSAGE WebSphere Server Error
   !SUBENTRY 2 com.ibm.ws.ast.st.v61.core 4 4 2008-01-03
   11:05:20.565
   !MESSAGE WebSphere Server Error
   
   in the SystemOut.log file in Websphere TE, you may find
   following.
   
   "IWAE0006E Archive is not a valid EAR File because the
   deployment
   descriptor can not be found (case sensitive):
   META-INF/application.xml"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  change classloader policy to Application and back to Module.
   when you save, 3 files generated in
   META-INF/../applications/../defaultAPP/
   deployment.xml
   resources.xml
   variables.xml
   
   
   then the publish works without any error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the JAX-WS webservice           *
   *                 creation tools                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Publishing of a JAX-WS application      *
   *                      fails if the module contains a binary   *
   *                      archive containing an annotated         *
   *                      webservice                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The following error occurs during publishing of a JAX-WS
   application if the module contains a binary archive file
   containing an annotated webservice:
   
   "publish failed EJB Bean could not be deployed"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The error is happening because the classpath for the module
   being publish is incorrectly constructed.  Binary archives are
   added to the classpath with a path relative to the module
   rather than using the absolute path.  The fix for this APAR is
   currently scheduled for inclusion in the Rational Application
   Developer v7.0.0.6 and WebSphere Application Server Toolkit
   v6.1.1.6 fixpacks.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
   page for WebSphere Application Server Toolkit delivery
