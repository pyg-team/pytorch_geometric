APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Select stats critera filter has unusual behavior:
   
   1. The Column drops below the window and you have to arrow down
   to get to the full list.
   2. Format issues with displaying the criteria has Xs over the
   descriptions
   3. The criteria allow multiple critera against the same column,
   even when it doesn't make sense.  For example, two date "is"
   entries, etc.
   4. The interface does not use the full window, is the size
   fixed?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 399608
   SF / SF
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue:  The Web Console Statistics Viewer filter
   did not allow for specification of the Log Date and Log Time
   rules in a combination that would retrieve statistics records in
   a consistent and logical manner. The Log Date and Log Time rules
   are combined to generate the Log Date/Time column used in the
   statistics database table.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix:  Modified code so that the user can specify
   Log Date and Log Time rules in a consistent and logical manner
   using the guidelines below. (Note that it is possible to specify
   illogical rules that result in fewer/more statistics records
   than desired, unless these guidelines are followed.)
   (1) To view statistics records on a particular date, specify a
   Log Date rule with an "is" condition. (The Log Time option will
   be removed in this situation.)
   (2) To view statistics records before or after a specific date ,
   specify one Log Date rule with either a "before" or an "after"
   condition. Log Time is assumed to be 00:00:00 (midnight).
   (3) To view statistics records before or after a specific date
   and time, specify one Log Date rule and one Log Time rule with
   both rules having the same condition ("before" or "after").
   (4) To view statistics records using a range, specify four
   rules: one Log Date rule and one Log Time rule with both rules
   having an "after" condition", and one Log Date rule and one Log
   Time rule with both rules having a "before" condition.
