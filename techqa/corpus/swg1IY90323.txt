APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Queries are not working correctly with fp3
   I can copy/create like existing queries but changes I make to
   the
   queries are not taking.
   
   e.g., I tried to modify one of the attributes in the Query to
   only
   report for given value/substring. When I leave and come back it
   loses my
   change.
   
   Doesn't matter if I'm in Author mode or Admin mode.
   
   It's only when I try using the 'Return a Subset of String'
   Option on the
   attribute. Doesn't work on SE or Test. Does work in Production.
   
   If I use the == Options to specify a fully qualified
   string/value then
   it works on all three systems
   
   Env: 6.1.0-ITM-FP03
   
   L3 approval:  EKemak/EAtkins
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  LA fix for FP03 is being created.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Query parse error disallows some (Query) expressions from being
   displayed.  This error was introduced in FP3.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The test for the number of function parameters was off by 1 --
   the 0-based nature of the count was overlooked.
