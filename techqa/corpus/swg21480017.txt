Title: IBM Why can't I get inferential test statistics in Multiple Response groups in Custom Tables? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running SPSS Custom Tables. I have a multiple response group in the rows of the table. I'd like to get a chi-square or a column proportions test on this multiple response group, but SPSS doesn't allow me to do so. How can I test column proportions or run a chi-square test on my table? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS 14 now allows for inferential statistics of Custom Tables that have multiple response groups in them. If you do not have SPSS 14 for Windows, please contact your local SPSS Sales office for a copy.

SPSS previously did not allow for inferential statistical testing on multiple response groups since such statistics violate certain assumptions. For example, one of the assumptions in doing a chi-square is that the responses of the row variables are independent from each other. A multiple response group violates that basic assumption. As such, the chi-square statistic will be inflated. 

The same assumption on independence is made for the test of column proportions. If, for example, we had a variable on a five-point scale, and we had a dichotomous variable in the column, we could do a test of proportions because, in a sense, we're testing the proportion of one row (such as "Strongly Agree") against the other rows. But with a multiple response group the same respondent would probably have responses in more than one cell in the five-point multiple-response scale, and the statistics as such would be on somewhat shaky ground
