ABSTRACT
 The IBM Storage Tier Advisor Tool predicts whether the addition of capacity of different storage classes, in conjunction with the Easy Tier function, will benefit performance. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The IBM Storage Tier Advisor Tool is a Windows console application that analyzes heat data files produced by Easy Tier and produces a graphical display of the amount of "hot" data per volume and predictions of how additional Solid State Drive (SSD) capacity, Enterprise Drive and Nearline Drive could benefit performance for the system and by storage pool. This version of the Storage Tier Advisor Tool supports heat data files produced by Easy Tier on SAN Volume Controller (6.x, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 8.1), Storwize V7000 (6.x, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 8.1), Storwize V5000 (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 8.1), Storwize V3x00 (6.x, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4,7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8) and DS8000 (5.x, 6.x, 7.1, 7.2).




You can download the Storage Tier Advisor Tool, and install it on your Windows 7 computer. The tool comes packaged as an ISO file which needs to be extracted to a temporary location. The tool installer resides at temporary_location\IMAGES\STAT\Disk1\InstData\NoVM\. Storage Tier Advisor Tool is by default installed at directory C:\Program Files\IBM\STAT\. 

Heat data files are produced approximately once a day when Easy Tier is active on one or more storage pools and summarize the activity per volume since the prior heat data file was produced. On SAN Volume Controller and Storwize serial products the heat data file is in /dumps on the configuration node and is named "dpa_heat.node_name.time_stamp.data". Any existing heat data file is erased when it has been existing longer than 7 days. The file must be off-loaded by the user and Storage Tier Advisor Tool invoked from a Windows command prompt console with the file specified as a parameter. The user can also specify the output directory. The Storage Tier Advisor Tool creates a set of html files and the user can then open the resulting "index.html" in browser to view the results. Browsers Firefox 27, Firefox ESR_24, Chrome 33 and IE 10 are supported. 

Usage information can be found in a help.txt supplied with the Tool. 

NOTE: On the platform Storwize V3500 and V3700 without Easy Tier license, automatic data placement is not supported.
