APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A timing window exists during endmqm processing where a
   WebSphere MQ agent thread ends without responding to an
   application thread which results in the application thread
   waiting indefinitely.
   
   The endmqm command will not complete until all application
   threads have ended which makes the endmqm command appear to
   hang.
   
   This problem occurs only on AIX when endmqm is used in quiesced
   or wait shutdown mode.  A workaround is to use endmqm with the
   -i option.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Try "endmqm -p" and if that fails to end the queue manager
   then kill the WebSphere MQ  queue manager processes as discussed
   in the WMQ v7 Information Center under the section
   "Stopping queue managers in  WebSphere MQ for UNIX systems".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users that end their queue managers in quiesced or wait shutdown
   mode
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   A quiesced WebSphere MQ queue manager will only end once all
   applications have disconnected and all agent processes have
   ended.
   
   A timing issue where a particular flag was briefly set caused
   an agent thread to end early. The agent was still in
   conversation with an application thread which was waiting
   indefinitely for a reply on a semaphore. The application never
   received a reply which meant that it never ended. This
   prevented the queue manager from ending.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed so that the agent thread would not end
   early if the timing issue occurred.
