 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I obtain the latest RHEL patches, including security updates, for my IBM SONAS appliance ? 

ANSWER
IBM delivers PTFs (including security fixes) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle [https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata] policy. As stated in the Red Hat policy, fixes are not provided for all vulnerabilities on all RHEL versions, which means that IBM cannot deliver security fixes for some RHEL issues. 
IBM periodically reviews security vulnerabilities applicable for the RHEL release included in the SONAS product versions under support. When security and other related updates are available from Red Hat for the relevant RHEL release included in IBM SONAS, IBM delivers those updates in IBM SONAS PTFs. IBM SONAS systems may then be upgraded to such PTF levels to obtain the fixes 


IBM also publishes Security Bulletins with additional information for security related updates. Customers should watch out on IBM SONAS Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/account/userservices/jsp/login.jsp?persistPage=true&page=/support/entry/myportal/alerts/system_storage/network_attached_storage_%28nas%29/sonas/scale_out_network_attached_storage%3FproductContext%3D-267772237&PD-REFERER=none&error=]to be notified of important IBM SONAS support alerts. 

Best Practices regarding the Linux OS upgrade program:  * Contact IBM support for assistance in upgrading your system with the relevant PTF release containing the fixes. 
 * Do not install any additional RPMs on an IBM SONAS appliance unless approved by IBM. Only RPMs or PTF releases made available by IBM should be installed. 
 * Understand that if there are issues after applying any RHEL updates, it may be necessary to downgrade any and all RHEL patches applied to regain a stable Linux environment.
