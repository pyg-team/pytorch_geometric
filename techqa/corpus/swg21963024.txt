CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5

CVEID: CVE-2014-0227 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted request in a malformed chunked header to the Web server to cause multiple processing conflicts on the servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVEID: CVE-2015-0209 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0209]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the d2i_ECPrivateKey or EVP_PKCS82PKEY function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a malformed Elliptic Curve (EC) private-key file to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the system and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.8
