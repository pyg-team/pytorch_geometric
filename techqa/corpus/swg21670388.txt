SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. These vulnerabilities affect IBM Rational Build Forge 8.0 and 8.0.0.1. Fixes for the vulnerabilities have been added to the Rational Build Forge 8.0.0.1 iFix1 release.

If https and SSL are not enabled, Build Forge 8.0 and 8.0.0.1 are not affected. Versions of Build Forge released prior to version 8.0 are not affected.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] 

Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: It is strongly encouraged that you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score. 


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

Description: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. This vulnerability can only be exploited locally, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Build Forge Version 8.0 and 8.0.0.1 are affected when HTTPS and SSL are enabled. 

Build Forge Versions 7.1.x and earlier are not affected.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Rational Build Forge 8.0 or 8.0.0.1: Upgrade to Rational Build Forge 8.0.0.1 iFix1 [https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-build-forge/releases/8.0.0.1iFix1]

Notes: 

 *  When HTTPS and SSL are not enabled, Rational Build Forge is not affected. The 8.0.0.1 iFix resolves the issue in Apache and agent, but does not include OpenSSL fixes for the Perl Engine. Build Forge V8 has two engines, and you must use the Java Engine to avoid issues if you wish to use SSL with the engine. 

After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160: 

 1. Replace your SSL Certificates
     * You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates for any affected SSL connections. 
     * You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (ie using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 
       
       
    
    
 2. Reset User Credentials
    
    If you have network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, you should force a reset of the passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force users to re-authenticate.


Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
