PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to export a statistic Historical Databse (HDB) created with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.1 data to a DB2 table created with CICS Performance Analyzer for z/OS (CICS PA) V3.2 results in a job ABEND=S04E U0000 REASON=00E40323. 

SYMPTOM
DSNU335I INPUT FIELD 'CICS_BELOW_INUSE' NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN INPUT RECORD
DSNU302I (RE)LOAD PHASE STATISTICS - NUMBER OF INPUT RECORDS PROCESSED=24
DSNU017I UTILITY DATA BASE SERVICES MEMORY EXECUTION ABENDED, REASON=X'00E40323'

CAUSE
DB2 tables created by CICS PA 3.2 are for the version of CICS Transaction Server current at the time. In this case CICS TS 4.1 was the most current version available.

Your tables might have been created some time ago, possibly even before you bought CICS PA 3.2, and are now being reused. The DB2 tables created by CICS PA 3.2 are for the version of CICS TS current at the time; in this case CICS TS 4.1.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To create DB2 tables with correct attributes for CICS TS 3.1 statistic HDB you would need to modify the table create JCL before you can load CICS TS 3.1 data into them.

One suggestion is that you remove the fields that are not in the HDB table and adjust the offset as well. Or you can use CICS PA 1.4 (for matching CICS TS 3.1 data) to generate the Load data JCL.

CICS PA is backward compatible, but not for creating DB2 DDL or Load data JCL. CICS PA is working correctly, but development is aware of this issue.
