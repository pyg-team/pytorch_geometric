   ****************************************************************
   To load the policy set and binding configuration when you use
   web service integration, a workspace is created to process the
   configurations. If the workspace is created on a remote
   deployment manager (dmgr) server, web service integration code
   cannot release the newly created workspace after its use. As a
   result, the memory use keeps increasing on the dmgr server for
   the duplicate workspace.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in a future IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 Cumulative
   Fix that ensures the remote workspace can be released after use.
