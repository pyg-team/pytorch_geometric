APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DecisionService node uses IBM ODM functionality to process
   rule decisions. This functionality uses an ra.xml file to
   configure itself and this ra.xml file is included with the
   product install.
   To solve some performance and tuning problems with the ODM
   functionality it may be necessary for a customer to need to
   modify some properties in the ra.xml file. This APAR will add
   the option to override the template ra.xml file with a modified
   copy of the default IIB one.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V10 who use the DecisionService
   node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, z/OS

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The DecisionService node uses IBM ODM functionality to process
   rule decisions. This functionality uses an ra.xml file to
   configure itself and this ra.xml file is included with the
   product install.
   To solve some performance and tuning problems with the ODM
   functionality it may be necessary for a customer to need to
   modify some properties in the ra.xml file. This APAR will add
   the option to override the template ra.xml file with a modified
   copy of the default IIB one.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Users can now take a copy of the default template ra.xml file
   from the IBM Integration Bus installation directory, modify it
   and then configure an Integration Node to use that in place of
   the default.
   
   To use a different template ra.xml
   
   1. Users need to copy the IIB template ra.xml from
     <IIB_Install_Path>/businessrules/config/ra.xml
   
   2. Edit as appropriate.
   
   3. Set the environment variable
   MQSI_NODE_DEPLOYED_RULES_RA_LOCATION to point at the directory
   which contains the copied ra.xml before starting the integration
   node:
       eg for Unix
   &#09;    export MQSI_NODE_DEPLOYED_RULES_RA_LOCATION=<custom
   path>
   
   4. During startup the integration node will process the custom
   ra.xml template file.
