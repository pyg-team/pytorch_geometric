QUESTION
 Which commands are used by the MQ monitoring agent to gather data from the Queue Manager?
Does the MQ monitoring agent require the usage of the runmqsc command? 

ANSWER
The MQ monitoring agent uses various PCF commands to access WebSphere MQ (WMQ) data and to manipulate them.
It sends the PCF commands to the WMQ command server. 
Currently the MQ monitoring agent requires the usage of the runmqsc command only to set up the environment to monitor a remote queue manager running on an operating system that is not supported by the Messaging agents, as described at the following link:
