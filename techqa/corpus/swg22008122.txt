REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix Rational Synergy 7.2.0.x and 7.2.1.x N/A Replace the JRE used in Rational Synergy.

Steps to download and replace JRE in Rational Synergy: 
1. Open the list of Synergy downloads on Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Synergy&release=All&platform=All&function=all&source=fc]
2. Select the SDK and Readme for Rational Synergy which applied to your release as follows:

Note: The fix will use the following naming convention: 
<V.R.M.F> -Rational-RATISYNE-JavaSE-SDK-6.0.16.50- <platform> 

Where <V.R.M.F> = release & <platform> = operating system 

o Rational Synergy 7.2.1 (uses 7.2.1.5 release designation) 
Example: 7.2.1.5-Rational-RATISYNE-JavaSE-SDK-6.0.16.50-Linux

o Rational Synergy 7.2.0 (uses 7.2.0.7 release designation)
Example: 7.2.0.7-Rational-RATISYNE-JavaSE-SDK-6.0.16.50-Windows

3. Follow the steps in the Install instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042896] to replace the JRE. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008122&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008122&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008122&amp;aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008122&amp;aid=1] For Rational Synergy 7.1.0.x IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. 

To verify if Synergy has JRE version to address these security vulnerabilities:- 
Open a command prompt 
Unix:- 
Go to $CCM_HOME/jre/bin folder 
Execute ./java -version 

Windows:- 
Go to %CCM_HOME%\jre\bin folder 
Execute java -version 

If the output version is SR16 FP50 or greater than SR16 FP50, it implies the run area has jre version that addresses these security vulnerabilities. 

Example:- 
java version "1.6.0" 
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build pxi3260sr16fp20-20160111_01(SR16 FP20)) IBM J9 VM (build 2.4, JRE 1.6.0 IBM J9 2.4 Linux x86-32 jvmxi3260sr16fp20-20151221_282799 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)
