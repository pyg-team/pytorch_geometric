PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to configure JCC SSL connection to DB2 server fails with communication error -4499 and the DB2 server recording message, "DIA3604E The SSL function "gsk_secure_soc_init" failed with the return code "407" in "sqlccSSLSocketSetup". " in it's diagnostic log (db2diag.log). 

SYMPTOM
Example JCC Exception:

[jcc][t4][2030][11211][3.64.104] A communication error occurred during operations on the connection's underlying socket, socket input stream, or socket output stream. Error location: Reply.fill() - insufficient data (-1). Message: Insufficient data. ERRORCODE=-4499, SQLSTATE=08001 DSRA0010E: SQL State = 08001, Error Code = -4,499

Example DB2 Server log entry:

2015-01-02-15.19.33.098312-360 I114680187A503 LEVEL: Error 
PID : 7143496 TID : 11054 PROC : db2sysc 0

FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, common communication, sqlccMapSSLErrorToDB2Error, probe:30 
MESSAGE : DIA3604E The SSL function "gsk_secure_soc_init" failed with the return code "407" in "sqlccSSLSocketSetup". 



CAUSE
The return code 407 means the label specified by ssl_svr_label as defined in the Database Manager Configuration file (DBM CFG) can not be found in the key file specified by ssl_svr_keydb (also defined in the DBM CFG). Since the DB2 server is not able to resolve the label, the SSL handshaking fails and DB2 closes the connection.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure the correct label is specified for ssl_svr_label in the Database Manager Configuration file and that it exists in the server .kdb file.
