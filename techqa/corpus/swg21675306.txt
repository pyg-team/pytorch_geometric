CVE ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

Description: An attacker running a program on the same machine as where the victim is running a program could use CPU timing information to discover key information about certain kinds of binary type Elliptic Curves used in Digital signatures during signing operations. Although GSKit only generates Prime type Elliptic Curves, externally generated keys may be imported in GSKit. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The IBM GSKit is used if ClearQuest is using LDAP authentication with SSL enabled. 


The IBM GSKit is also used by CQWeb server for ClearQuest 8.0.0.x/8.0.1.x (all platforms) when supporting SSL connections with IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher. 

 

LDAP component 

 

LDAP component (all platforms) Status 8.0.1.x Affected 8.0.0.x Affected 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x, 7.1.2.x Not affected CQWeb Server 

 

CQWeb Server (all platforms) Status 8.0.1.x Affected 8.0.0.x Affected if you use IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x, 7.1.2.x Not affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to upgrade to a newer fix pack of Rational ClearQuest that has a newer GSKit component that corrects these vulnerabilities, and to update the IBM HTTP Server. 

Review the information on the fixes available below:




Affected Versions Apply the fix to Windows clients using an integration 8.0.1.x Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 4 (8.0.1.4) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037663] 8.0.0.x Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 11 (8.0.0.11) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037662] Server fixes (for CQWeb server): 

Install a fix to IBM HTTP Server if you use SSL on your WAN server and you use IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher. You need the fix for APAR PI19700. Consult IHS security bulletin 1676092 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676092] for the details of the fix.
