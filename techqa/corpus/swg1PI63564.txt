APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0-GA, exporting output objects
   using the OMS utility will fail (no error message is displayed)
   when output path contains an ampersand. E.g. C:\Temp\Success &
   Fail
   
   Removing the ampersand character in the directory structure will
   succeed. E.g. C:\Temp\Success and Fail
   
   Usage of an ampersand character is acceptable and OMS should be
   able to write to a directory containing this character.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove any ampersand that may be present in the directory path
   for the OMS output.
