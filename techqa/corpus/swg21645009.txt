Title: IBM Cognos Incentive Compensation Management – Web Portal - How to define the logout redirect URL destination - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Once a user that is logged in ICM Web Portal clicks the LOG OUT link, it will be redirected to the default configured URL destination. The default URL destination after logging out is login.html. 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Cognos ICM Web Portal

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The ICM administrator was required to change the URL destination for post-logout.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Depending on the authentication mechanism in place (default one, SSO, LDAP, etc), there are different configuration files that should be modified.

The steps to configure post logout destination URL are below:

1. Locate the folder “WB-INF” inside the ICM Web Portal application deployed on the application server (Ex. Tomcat).

2. Depending on the existing authentication mechanism, open one of the files:

security.xml - used by the default authentication mechanism
security-ldap.xml
security-saml.xml
security-siteminder.xml
security-spnego.xml





3. Locate the parameter logoutConfig:

Example for security.xml

<bean id="logoutConfig" class="com.varicent.security.web.LogoutConfig">
<property name="view" value="redirect:/ " />
</bean>





4. Change the default value from “redirect:/” to the desired URL.

Example: 
<bean id="logoutConfig" class="com.varicent.security.web.LogoutConfig">
<property name="view" value="redirect:http://mydomain.com/dologout [http://mydomain.com/dologout] " />
</bean>
