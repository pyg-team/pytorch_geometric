PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A VERIFY PASSWORD function rejects      *
   *                      passtickets.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Authentication mechanisms such as VERIFY PASSWORD, SIGNON
   USERID PASSWORD, web authentication, web service
   authentication, all reject valid passtickets.
   The passticket is however accepted if the request is retried.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  UI22614
   A new fastpath password authentication mechanism was introduced
   as part of the change for RACF APAR OA43999 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1OA43999]. This new mechanism
   does not support passtickets.
   The code has been changed to retry a fastpath failure using the
   full RACROUTE VERIFYX mechanism with the APPLID parameter to
   validate a passticket.
