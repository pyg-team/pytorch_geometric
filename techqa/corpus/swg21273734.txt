QUESTION
 What are the steps to remove IBM® Rational® Performance Tester manually from either a Microsoft® Windows® computer or a Linux® computer, if it was installed from IBM Installation Manager? 

ANSWER
To manually uninstall Rational Performance Tester version 7.0.x, follow these instructions. 

First Method: Installation Manager 

If you installed Rational Performance Tester (RPT) by using the Installation Manager (IM), first try to uninstall RPT by using the IM. To do this, from the IM main window, click Uninstall, select RPT, and follow the instructions in the wizard. If you cannot uninstall RPT using the IM, then do the following to manually uninstall RPT. 

 

Second Method: Manual Alternative 

Use this method only if the first method fails or if later attempts to install RPT fail because of items left behind after an unsuccessful attempt to uninstall. 

 1. Stop the Data Collection Infrastructure (DCI), if it is running.  * Windows: Open Task Manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) and select the process tapmagent.exe. Right-click and select End Process 
     * Linux: At a command prompt, type kill tapmagent.exe 
    
    
 2. Stop the Rational Agent Controller (RAC) service, if it is running.  * Windows: Use the Services control panel to stop the RAC service, or use Task Manager to end the ACWinService.exe and TPTP*.exe processes. 
     * Linux: In the RPT installation directory, run the /AgentController/bin/RAStop.sh script. Alternately, at a command prompt type ps -ef | grep -i RAS to find the process to stop using the kill command. Repeat for any running TPTP* processes. 
    
    
 3. Stop any Tivoli® Java™ processes. In the RPT installation directory, look for a file named RPA.pid in the 
    /rpt/DCI/rpa_prod/rpa_comp folder. If the file exists, open it and then stop the processes listed in the file. 
 4. Remove the DCI. Type the following at a command prompt:  * Windows: <installdir>/rpt/DCI/_uninstall/uninstall.exe -silent -W prod_id_uninstall.value=ibmrpt 
     * Linux: <installdir>/rpt/DCI/_uninstall/uninstall.bin -silent -W prod_id_uninstall.value=ibmrpt 
     * Note: manual uninstalling the DCI may take 5 minutes or more.
       If the above does not clean up the DCI, RAC and Tivoli components, then further manual removal may be necessary; see DCI/RAC/Tivoli cleanup below. 
    
    
 5. On Windows, manually remove the following programs using the Add/Remove Programs control panel. Remove the programs in the following order:  1. IBM Rational Data Collection Infrastructure V7.0 
     2. IBM Tivoli Data Collector V7.0_4 (this should be an empty link at this point, so respond 'yes' when prompted to remove) 
     3. IBM Rational Agent Controller V7.0.2 (this should be an empty link too) 
     4. IBM Rational Common Licensing - Client Components 
    
    
 6. Remove the "common" and "rpt" directories. Perform this step with caution. 
    Caution: In the case where multiple products have been installed from the IM, you should uninstall them using the IM before deleting these folders:  *  Windows: 
     * 
     * C:/Program Files/IBM/SDP70 <or> C:/Program Files/IBM/SDP
     * C:/Program Files/IBM/SDP70Shared <or> C:/Program Files/IBM/IBMIMShared 
     *  Linux: 
     * 
     * /opt/IBM/SDP70 <or> /opt/IBM/SDP
     * /opt/IBM/SDP70Shared <or> /opt/IBM/IBMIMShared
    
    




DCI/RAC/Tivoli cleanup 

The following steps remove the DCI, RAC and Tivoli components installed with Rational Performance Tester or Rational Performance Tester Agent. Follow these instructions if the DCI remains after uninstalling through Installation Manager or if step 4 in the manual uninstallation steps above fails. 


First, try to remove DCI by typing the following at a command prompt: 

 * Windows:
   <installdir>/rpt/DCI/_uninst/uninstall.exe -silent -W prod_id_uninstall.value=ibmrpt 
 * Linux: 
   <installdir>/rpt/DCI/_uninst/uninstall.bin -silent -W prod_id_uninstall.value=ibmrpt



Manually uninstalling the DCI may take 5 minutes or more. 
If this fails, or leaves items behind, cautiously remove the following items.
Note: Do not remove these items if you have another product using the RAC or if you installed the RAC without using the IM. 

 * On Windows, remove the following:
   C:/Windows/IBM/IBMAGENT_70
   C:/Windows/vpd.properties 


Do not delete the vpd.properties file if it has entries other than ITCAM. In that case, remove only ITCAM entries starting with: "ITCAMTTR|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_Base|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_win|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_linix86|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|" 

Remove the following directories: 

C:/Program Files/Common Files/InstallShield/Universal/ibmrac
C:/Program Files/Common Files/InstallShield/Universal/ipotdci 

Remove the following registry keys: 

HKLM/SOFTWARE/IBM/Rational Agent Controller
HKLM/SOFTWARE/IBM/Rational/Software Development Platform/products/com.ibm.rational.data.collection.infrastructure
HKLM/SOFTWARE/Tivoli/Tivoli Transerf Service/parameters 

 * On Linux, remove the following:


/etc/IBM/IBMAGENT_70
/root/vpd.properties Do not delete the vpd.properties file if it has entries in it other than ITCAM. In that case, remove only ITCAM entries starting with: 

"ITCAMTTR|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_Base|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_win|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|";
"ITCAMTTR_linix86|6|0|0|0|6_0_0_0|" 

Remove the following directories: 

/root/InstallShield/Universal/ibmrac
/root/InstallShield/Universal/ipotdci
