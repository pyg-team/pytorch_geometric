Title: IBM ITCAM for AD J2EE required libraries for installation on RHEL 5 and 6 systems - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Libraries that are missing from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 5 or 6 can result in errors

Possible error:

Â· "The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag." 

CAUSE
Some additional libraries are required beyond those typically included with a default RHEL server. 

 64-bit libraries may be installed, but the 32-bit equivalent of some libraries may also be needed.


ENVIRONMENT
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x or 6.x



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Consult with your Linux system administrator. 

The following yum command (package management on RHEL) should show what is installed:

'yum list installed libstdc++* libgcc* compat-libstdc++* libXp libXmu libXtst libXft'

For more detail, enter the following command:

'yum info libstdc++* libgcc* compat-libstdc++* libXp libXmu libXtst libXft'

Also, confirm if libraries are installed by checking the system's /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 directories.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure the following required libraries are installed on RHEL v5 or v6 prior to ITCAM installation. They should be available in the standard Red Hat repositories, and can be installed with 'yum install <package name>'. 

-------------
o libstdc++ (also 32-bit)
o libgcc (also 32-bit)
o compat-libstdc++-33
o libXp (also 32-bit)
o libXmu
o libXtst (also 32-bit)
o libXft (also 32-bit)
-------------
Though only the 32-bit libraries noted are *additionally* required if installing on a 64-bit system, installing both 32- and 64-bit versions of all the above libraries may help in some environments. Consult with your Linux system administrator.

Packages in yum usually indicate i686 (or i386) for the 32-bit version, and x86_64 for the 64-bit version.

Installing ITCAM using the ISMP GUI uses the above libX* libraries in addition to requiring a standard graphical environment (X11).
