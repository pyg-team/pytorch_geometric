Text:
Managing Server; SFU; SUA; Subsystem for Unix-based Applications; Services for Unix TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Managing Server requires Windows Services for Unix or Subsystem for Unix-based Applications. The Managing Server Installation and Customization Guide instructs you to download them. However, the links in the document shipped with the product do not work. 

CAUSE
The links in the document are outdated. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must enable the Subsystem for Unix-based Applications, which is a part of the operating system, shipped on its installation media. You must also download and install the Utilities and SDK for Unix-based Applications, available for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 at https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=35512 [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=35512] 

Important: Windows Server 2012 R2 does not include the Subsystem for Unix-based Applications. You can not run the Managing Server on Windows Server 2012 R2.
