QUESTION
 How do I install a trial of IBM Rational Developer for i without downloading the large zip files? 

CAUSE
The Rational Developer for i trial page which provides the option of downloading zip files is at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/r/rdi/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/r/rdi/]but does not show the Web Install option or the Web Install option does not work properly or the Web Install option directs users to this technote.

ANSWER
You can do a Web install of the trial of Rational Developer for i. Only the content for the features you select will be downloaded from IBM. The product will be automatically installed at the latest fixpack level. 

If you are installing on Windows, the Automated procedure is easiest. Otherwise, please follow the Manual Procedure below. 

 

 

Automated Procedure (Windows only): 

Download and run IBM Installation Manager that is pre-configured for the Rational Developer for i trial on Windows. 

 1. Download RationalDeveloperForiV9.6TrialWebInstall-Windows.zip from Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7ERational&product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Developer+for+i&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=9.6.0.0-Rational-RDI-TRIAL-WEBINSTALL&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http&source=fc ]. 
 2. Unzip the file to a local folder with no spaces in the name. 
 3. Run AdminInstall.bat if you are an administrator and want to install it for all users on the machine. Run UserInstall.bat if you want to install just for the current user.
