Title: IBM Disabling session timeout for Test environments - United States

Text:
TPAEUI timeout maximo session seconds minutes hours never time logout TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This documentation provides info about changing timeout settings for Test environments. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Maximo displays a warning message when an user session is about to timeout. (Your session will time out in X seconds). The timeout sets the amount of time the server waits for certain events before failing a request. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21961137&amp;aid=1]

By default, client sessions are timed out after 30 minutes of inactivity. As per Maximo System Administration guide, in order to change this value, you can edit the web.xml file. 

You will have to find the session-config section and change the session-timeout element to a different value. For example, in the web.xml file, replacing the session-timeout parameter from 30 to 60 increases the timeout period from 30 minutes to 60 minutes.

Increasing the session-timeout element to a higher value consumes additional memory and that's why it is recommended not to increase to a high value.

However, for some internal TEST environments, you may want to disable timeout, to have sessions never time out, since the environment will not be a Production system, and will be intended only for testing.

That would be possible if you configure the timeout setting to a negative value, such as -1.

This following instructions outlines the steps to change the timeout settings.

1. Edit web.xml which you will find in the following directory using a simple text editor like Notepad:

...[maximo root]/applications/maximo/maximouiweb/webmodule/WEB-INF

2. Change the value in the session-timeout tag in session-config section as follows, setting the timeout to -1 :

<session-config>
<!-- The session-timeout element defines the default session timeout interval for all sessions created in this web application. The specified timeout must be expressed in a whole number of minutes. -->
<session-timeout>-1</session-timeout>
</session-config>

In the above example, the session timeout is set for a negative value, which will make sessions to never timeout.

3. Save and close the file.

4. Rebuild and redeploy the maximo EAR file by following the procedure in your Maximo Installation Guide.
