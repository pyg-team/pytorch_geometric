Title: IBM Configure Decision Validation Services not to use Decision Warehouse - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I configure Decision Validation Services not to use Decision Warehouse? 

ANSWER
Decision Warehouse is preconfigured with database resource by default. To be able to use Decision Warehouse, you have to setup a database and run the provided script to create Decision Validation Services schema. 
If you have configured Decision Validation Services with a database persistence, your module is ready to use without any extra steps. However, if you choose not to use a database resource, you can not use Decision Warehouse to view execution traces. In this case, you can still run tests and simulations from Rule Team Server (RTS) and Rule Studio (RS) if Decision Warehouse is configured correctly on Decision Validation Service.

Download the sample here sample.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21441394&aid=2] sample.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21441394&aid=1]. It defines a customized Decision Warehouse, which allows RTS and RS to run tests and simulations successfully without having database resource available. To use this sample, perform the following steps:


 * Unzip the file.
   
 * Update your Decision Validation Service ear/war file:
   For tomcat6:
   - put the sample folder and the dvs-dw.properties under testing.war\WEB-INF\classes\
   For all other application servers:
   - put the sample folder and the dvs-dw.properties under jrules-ssp-<AppServerName>.ear\jrules-ssp-server.war\WEB-INF\classes\
   
 * Update your RES Management ear/war file. 
   - put the sample folder under RES management ear\jrules-res-management.war\WEB-INF\classes\
   - open the web.xml file from your RES Management ear/war, go to section <!-- Decision warehouse Configurations -->. Replace the following
   
   <param-name xmlns="">defaultDWConfiguration</param-name>
   <param-value xmlns=""> factoryClassname=ilog.rules.res.persistence.
   impl.jdbc.IlrDatasourceTraceDAOFactory;
   JNDI_NAME=jdbc/resdatasource</param-value>


with 

<param-name xmlns="">customDWConfiguration</param-name> 
<param-value xmlns="">factoryClassname=sample.CustomDAOFactory</param-value> 

and replace 

<param-value xmlns="">defaultDWConfiguration</param-value> 

with 

<param-value xmlns="">customDWConfiguration</param-value> 

 * Redeploy the testing.war/ssp.ear and RES.ear/RES.war files, restart your application server.
