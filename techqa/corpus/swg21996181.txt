SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on September 22 and 26, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Security Network Controller. IBM Security Network Controller has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by multiple memory leaks in t1_lib.c during session renegotiation. By sending an overly large OCSP Status Request extension, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6303 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6303]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function. By using unknown attack vectors, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6308 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6308]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory allocation error in dtls1_preprocess_fragment() prior to the excessive message length check. By initiating multiple connection attempts, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large DTLS message to exhaust all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117114 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117114] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2181 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2181]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the DTLS replay protection implementation. By sending a specially crafted sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause valid packets to be dropped.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-6309 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6309]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a use-after-free when handling message sizes. By sending an overly large message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117148 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117148] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7052 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7052]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a missing CRL sanity check. By attempting to use CRLs, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117149 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117149] for the current score
