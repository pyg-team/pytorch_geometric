PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 and higher.  When user uses ACCE to
   update the Directory Configuration bind user's password to match
   the password in the LDAP service provider, the update will be
   saved without any error.  If the new password does not match the
   one in the LDAP service provider, an error returns and the
   change will not be saved.
