QUESTION
 How do I review the user accounts in my Tivoli Directory Server installed by P8 FileNet CPIT? 

ANSWER
 

 1. From the Windows operating system, go to your Start menu and select All Programs=>IBM Tivoli Directory Server=>Web Administration Tool (you may need to allow blocked content in your web browser). 
 2. On the login screen, enter 'superadmin' and 'secret' for the username and password. If this doesn't work, locate the file 'accounts.txt' in your CPIT installation directory. Check the Server Administration Console entry for the correct information. 
 3. Select 'Manage console servers'. 
 4. Click the 'Add' button and enter 'localhost' under the hostname and click 'OK' to add your local server to the management options. 
 5. Logout. Do not close the browser, and click the 'here' link to login again. 
 6. You should now see the LDAP server name localhost:389 listed. The default User DN is 'cn=root', with a password of 'IBMFileNetP8'. Again, check your accounts.txt file if this doesn't work. 
 7. Select the 'Users and groups' option on the left, then click the 'Manage users' link. 
 8. You should now see the list of user accounts in your Tivoli domain.
