QUESTION
 How to configure the Data Collector in debug mode. 

ANSWER
If you'd like to get detailed debug information in the logs while configuring the Data Collector, follow these steps. This could be useful if you are running into 'wsadmin.sh' issues with the server not connecting to the Deployment Manager. Or if you just wish to see detailed debug information while configuring the Data Collector.
1. cd /opt/IBM/ITM/config

2. Make a backup of your original ITMConfigRAS.properties file first.
cp ITMConfigRAS.properties ITMConfigRAS.properties.original
See screenshot here:

3. cd /opt/IBM/ITM/<arch>/yn/wasdc/<maint>/installer/etc
where <arch> = your architecture and <maint> = your DC maint level. In my case, its li6263 and 7.1.0.2. 
See the second screenshot below which shows the directory.

4. Now copy the ITMConfigRAS.properties file from the $ITM_HOME/..../installer/etc directory to your config directory. In my case, the <arch> is li6263 and the <maint_level> is 7.1.0.2. See the copy command used here:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507796&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507796&aid=2]

5. Now start your DC configuration command or silent config script if you are doing a silent configuration. Now that you have the debug properties file in place, the DC configuration will write detailed debug log info into these files during the configuration process. If you prefer, you can tail the log files shown in the screenshot below.

6. These are the files where the detailed debug info is written in the /opt/IBM/ITM/logs directory:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507796&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507796&aid=3]
