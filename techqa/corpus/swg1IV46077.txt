APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  All the double bytes characters specified in the column are
   suddenly just deleted. I am able to recreate the problem
   in L2 test environment below.
   
   -Server
     Win2k8
     TPAE 7.5.0.4
     MAM 7.5.0.4
     WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.15
     DB2 v9.7
   
   -Client PC
     Windows XP
     IE8
   
   STEPS TO RECREATE:
   1) From "Go To"-"System Configuration"-"Platform
   Configuration"-"Application Designer", open "ASSET"
   application.
   
   2) On "Asset" tab, add a multiline textbox.
   
   3) Select the multiline textbox and click "Control
   Properties" button.
   
   4) On "Multiple Textbox Properties" window, specify
   "MOVEMEMO" in "Attribute" column. Then save the record.
   
   5) From "Go To"-"Assets"-"Assets", create a new Asset.
   
   6) In "Memo" field, specify 254 double bytes characters.
   At this stage the problem does not happen yet. For your
   information, 254 is the maximum length of "MOVEMEMO"
   attribute.
   
   7) When you try to specify 255th double bytes character
   there, all 254 characters specified in the step 6) just
   disappear and you can see only 255th character there.
   This is the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem does not happen with FireFox.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is due to an IE bug in the way IE processes
   double-byte character input. The coded workaround is to display
   a message when the maximum number of characters is exceeded in a
   textbox. The message will only display if the input is
   double-byte and if the user is using Internet Explorer.
