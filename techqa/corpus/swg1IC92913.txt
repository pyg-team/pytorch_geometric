APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WebSphere MQ V7.5 OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq_7.5.0.0.jar needlessly exports
   the com.ibm.mq.pcf package. This package is not contained within
   the
   bundle.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The JARs within the bundle
   com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq_<version number>.jar do not
   contain any classes within the com.ibm.qm package. The
   reference to it in the Export-Package statement within
   the bundle's MANIFEST.MF file should be removed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects all users of the WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes
   for JMS OSGi bundle:
   
   com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq_<version number>.jar
   
   who are loading the bundle into an OSGi environment that
   validates the contents of the bundle's MANIFEST.MF file.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes for JMS OSGi bundle:
   
   com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq_<version number>.jar
   
   contain the classes that implement the WebSphere MQ messaging
   provider.
   
   The Export-Package statement within the MANIFEST.MF file for
   this bundle included entries for the following packages which
   were not in the bundle:
   
   com.ibm.mq.external
   com.ibm.mq.pcf
   com.ibm.mq.jmqi.test.utils
   
   When the bundle was loaded into an OSGi environment that
   validated the information in the MANIFEST.MF file, the
   validation failed as the bundle did not contain any classes
   in the three packages shown above. This prevented the bundle
   from being loaded, which would mean that it could not be used
   inside the OSGi environment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Export-Package statement in the MANIFEST.MF file for the
   WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes for JMS OSGi bundle:
   
   com.ibm.msg.client.osgi.wmq_<version number>.jar
   
   has been updated so that it only includes entries for packages
   which have classes contained within the bundle.
