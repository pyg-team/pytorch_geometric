ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is no information in the IBM BPM V8.0.1 documentation
   about how to create backup copies of the databases after
   installing IBM BPM. These backup copies can be used, in certain
   situations, to revert to the post-installation state of the
   databases.
   
   To create backup copies of the IBM BPM databases, complete the
   following steps:
   
   1. Delete the databases or tables.
   
   2. If you deleted the databases, re-create them.
   
   For IBM DB2, see "Creating DB2 databases"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/db_create_nd_lin_db2.html).
   
   For Oracle, see "Preparing the Oracle database server"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/db_prep_nd_lin_orcl.html).
   
   3. If you deleted the tables, re-create the tables and run the
   bootstrap.
   
   Note: These instructions say they are for stand-alone
   installations, but they also apply to network deployment (ND)
   installations. The database scripts are located under <BPM
   Root>/profiles/<DMGR Profile>/dbscripts.
   
   For DB2, see "Configuring DB2 databases after stand-alone
   profile creation"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/db_cfg_sa_lin_db2.html). If you need
   to re-create the scripts, you can use the dbdesign tool. See
   "Creating database design files for deployment environments with
   DB2"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/ddt_env_nd_lin_db2.html).
   
   For Oracle, see "Configuring Oracle databases after stand-alone
   profile creation"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.0.1/com.ibm
   .wbpm.imuc.ebpm.doc/topics/db_cfg_sa_lin_orcl.html).
   
   This procedure is not in the documentation.
