QUESTION
 Why does IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (B2Bi) create a directory structure and files in the /tmp directory whenever a new Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is started and how can this behavior be modified to not create these files when B2Bi is started 

CAUSE
The Java Attach API is a mechanism provided by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It is designed to allow applications to connect to a running Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The interface is described here: [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.zos.70.doc/user/attachapi.html]
By default, Java creates a directory and file structure in the /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach folder in most unix/linux environments.


ANSWER
The default behavior is to create the /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach directories and files. This behavior can be disabled by adding the "-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no" paramater to a new line at the end of both the options.default files. 

Linux:
<install>/jdk/jre/lib/amd64/default/options.default 
<install>/jdk/jre/lib/amd64/compressedrefs/options.default 

AIX:
<install>/jdk/jre/lib/ppc64/default/options.default 
<install>/jdk/jre/lib/ppc64/compressedrefs/options.default


After adding the new line containing "-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no" to both options.default files the tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach directory and files will no longer be created once B2Bi is stopped and restarted

It is possible that the changes made to the options.default files will need to be reapplied after upgrading or patching B2Bi.
