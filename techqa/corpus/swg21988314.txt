QUESTION
 What version of Java is required on z/OS to use RDz's Headless Code Review and Code Coverage? 

ANSWER
The Host documents state that RDz supports running with Java 6 and 7 on z/OS. However, the Headless Code Review and Code Coverage functions are client pieces that run on z/OS and as such do not follow the same Java support rules as the true Host components. For these functions, the minimum Java requirement is as follows: 
RDz 9.5.x
Code Coverage requires Java 7
Code Review requires Java 7

IDz 14.0
Code Coverage requires Java 8
Code Review requires Java 7
