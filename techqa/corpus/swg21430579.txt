PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to delete a multi-instance queue manager configuration in IBM i 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To delete a multi-instance queue manager, it is recommended that you end remote journaling and remove all queue manager instances before issuing the DLTMQM command for the original queue manager. 

 1. Use the CHGMQMJRN command to stop remote journaling between the queue managers on each server.
    CHGMQMJRN MQMNAME('<QMGR_NAME>') RMTJRNRDB('<REMOTE_RDB_SERVER_NAME>') RMTJRNSTS(*INACTIVE) 
 2. End all instances of the queue manager, from the primary server as follows:
    ENDMQM MQMNAME(<QMGR_NAME>) OPTION(*IMMED) INSTANCE(*ALL) ENDCCTJOB(*YES) 
 3. Issue the RMVMQMINF to remove the instance of the queue manager from each server. RMVMQMINF MQMNAME(<QMGR_NAME>) 
 4. For the original instance of the queue manager, issue the DLTMQM command to delete the queue manager.
    DLTMQM MQMNAME(<QMGR_NAME>)
