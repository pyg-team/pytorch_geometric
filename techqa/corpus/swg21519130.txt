QUESTION
 Why are some special characters not allowed as text in process data 

ANSWER


Process data in GIS must be valid xml (i.e. capable of being displayed in a browser).

There are special characters that CANNOT be used in an XML pc data field. 
This is because XML does not contain a release character and so these characters have to be stored by wrapping them.
If the special character were not wrapped, then the XML produced would fail any XML parser as it would contain ILLEGAL characters.
So this is a standard behaviour due the definition of XML itself.

All the special characters are syntactically relevant for parsing XML. 
In order not to confuse the XML Parser, any xml value, which contains such a character, will be wrapped in a CDATA section. 
The parser now knows, that the value is real data and not a syntax instruction.

The less-than character (<) starts element markup (the first character of a start-tag or an end-tag).</p> <p>The ampersand character (&) starts entity markup (the first character of a character entity reference).</p> <p>The greater-than character (>) ends a start-tag or an end-tag.

The double-quote character (") can be symbolised with this character entity reference when you need to embed a double-quote inside a string which is already double-quoted.

The apostrophe or single-quote character (') can be symbolised with this character entity reference when you need to embed a single-quote or apostrophe inside a string which is already single-quoted.
