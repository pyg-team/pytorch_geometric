RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The transaction log for the database has reached its size limit. This cannot be altered in the Contributor Admin Console. Instead you will have to consult your IT Dept on truncating the transaction log file, which is commonly done after a full backup.

If data is frequently imported and exported from Contributor applications the transaction log file can get very large, so it is advisable to schedule the truncation of this file at regular intervals.
