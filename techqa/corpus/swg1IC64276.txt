PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.2 who are    *
   *                 running Mediation Flow Components.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Customers using a Mediation Flow        *
   *                      Component may experience the above      *
   *                      mentioned NullPointerException.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you encounter this problem then you are   *
   *                 advised to install the fix pack which        *
   *                 contains the code update associated with     *
   *                 this APAR                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   The logic for initialising the AggregationSession was not
   generalized enough. Customers can come across suitations where
   the session is being referenced without being intialised,
   resulting in the NullPointerException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the AggregationSession is
   initialised in all circumstances.
   
   There are no known side effects associated with this fix.
   There is no known alternative workaround should you encounter
   this problem.
   
   This code fix was targeted to be included in the following fix
