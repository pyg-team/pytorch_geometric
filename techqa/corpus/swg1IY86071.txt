PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All WMB V6 users of 64-bit Execution         *
   *                 Groups on AIX.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 64-bit Execution Group terminates on    *
   *                      AIX with a core dump when processing    *
   *                      a message through a complex message     *
   *                      flow containing many nodes.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a message flow runs within the Execution group it runs as
   a thread within the DataFlowEngine process. When a thread is
   created an area of storage is reserved for the thread's call
   stack. Generally, the more message processing nodes in a
   message flow that a message has to pass through, the greater
   the call stack storage required. The default AIX thread stack
   size is quite small, so the 32-bit Execution Group sets the
   thread stack size to 1MB which is adequate for most message
   flows, but can be overridden.
   The 64-bit Execution group, however, was not explicitly
   setting the thread stack size, allowing to default to the
   operating system default value. Hence, a complex message flow
   that could process messages successfully when running in a
   32-bit Execution Group may fail in a 64-bit Execution Group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The 64-bit Execution Group now explicitly sets the thread
   stack size to 1MB, the same as the 32-bit Execution Group.
