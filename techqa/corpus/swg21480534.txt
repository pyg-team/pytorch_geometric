The current license does not permit this job to continue.

followed by...

Error # 2085
The temporary period for running SPSS for Windows without a license has expired. 
Use the License Authorization Wizard to contact SPSS for a license code.
This command not executed.

Specific symptom number: 37

What does this mean? 

CAUSE
The software is unable to obtain a valid, non-expired license code.

ANSWER
One or more of the following reasons may apply: 

1. Your trial period has expired for your installation. Please run the License Authorization Wizard and request a license using the Authorization Code (AC) that came with your software. 
If you do not have your AC you will need to talk to your Primary Contact for the license or access to the License Key Center, If you require assistance please contact Client Care.
Client Care can be reached via E-Mail at tsmail@us.ibm.com or phone 800-978-2246.

2. You may not have read and/or write permission to the lservrc file located in the software's installation directory. Please log in as a local Administrator and repeat the licensing process.

3. An incorrect system date and time can sometimes cause this error message to occur. Check the system date/time on your machine and if it is incorrect, please reset to the current date and try running the software again. 

4. The lservrc file may have two or more references to the base module. You may want to delete the line that refers to the earliest expiration date, save the lservrc file, and run the software. We have found instances where the software reads the first license for the base module, and if the expiration date for that base module has passed, the software will return Error 2085.

5. You may have an invalid code, a code that only contains an add-on module and is not license for the base software product, or a code for a different version of software product.
