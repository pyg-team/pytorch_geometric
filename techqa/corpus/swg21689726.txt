AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects some versions and releases of WebSphere Lombardi Edition.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
WebSphere Lombardi Edition completely relies on WebSphere Application Server to provide HTTPS capabilities. 


IBM recommends that customers install an interim fix for the IBM JDK to disable SSLv3. For information on the required fix, refer to the the Remediation/Fixes section in the following bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

The eclipse based Process Designer tool includes another instance of the IBM SDK for Java. In order to also disable tolerance of SSLv3 connections from this development tool, please install IT05359 as appropriate for your version of WebSphere Lombardi Edition: 

 * WebSphere Lombardi Edition [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=IT05359]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Customers who cannot or do not want to install the fix recommended in the "Remediation/Fixes" section of this security bulletin can disable the use of SSLv3 using manual configuration as described in "Workarounds and Mitigations" under the "Client configuration files" section in the following bulletin: Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]
