IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Collaboration Server Version 11.5.0, Fix Pack 6 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FInfoSphere+Master+Data+Management+Collaboration+Server&fixids=11.5.0.6-MDM-CE-FP06IF000&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Drop Down box for key on lookup attribute popop not showing all
   values
   For a data driven drop down box not all values of the drop down
   are being shown.  The user clicks on "More Choices" to see more
   but after doing that 2 or 3 times it stops showing any more
   even though more items are present.
   
   This behavior is seen in following circumstances:
   - Internet Explorer 11 presents the problem when the document
   mode is set to anything other than Edge.
   -Internet Explorer 10 presents the problem when the document
   mode is set to Standards or Quirks
   
   This will be fixed for supported MDMCE supported settings for
   IE 10 and 11
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  One of the below can be used as workaround:
   1.Use "View all Rows" button to get all lookup items.
   
   2.Type in lookup key name and autocomplete will popup the key
   names
