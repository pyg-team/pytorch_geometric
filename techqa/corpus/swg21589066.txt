CAUSE
The Windows Kernel monitors a program's execution. If the Kernel detects an attempt to run code from a memory page that is not marked executable, the Kernel halts execution of the program, resulting in a "crash." This is a security measure to help ensure that memory-related vulnerabilities (for example, buffer overflows) in the application cannot be exploited in order to execute arbitrary code.
