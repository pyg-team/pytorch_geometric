APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description
   Memory not available for ITCAM causing native storage
   exhaustion. Memory is not available  because a 64-bit JVM
   requested less than 2G heap, is not using zArchitecture Large
   Page Support and requested compressed references.  If all these
   are true, then the Java heap is allocated from 31-bit private
   region leaving precious little 31-bit memory for Web Application
   SMF records.
   
   Users Affected:
   ITCAM 7.1 FP3
   1) The 64bit Java Virtual Machine is being used
   2) z/OS Java 6.0 or above is in use
   3) Compressed References are activated (-Xcompressedrefs)
   4) Large Pages are NOT in use (no -Xlp or no OS support for
   large pages activated)
   5) The Max Heap setting is less than 2GB (-Xmx < 2048M)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Enable the large page support so the Java heap will go above the
   bar.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
