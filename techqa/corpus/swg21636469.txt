PROBLEM
Assume you have a custom theme which you developed based of out of box Portal 8 theme (in Portal 8.0.0.0). Custom theme's static resources are residing in the webdav repository. 

Now you upgraded to Portal 8.0.0.1 so that you can use the new inline (inplace) Editing feature with the Web Content Viewer content. While using the custom theme, when you put the page in the Edit mode, you may get following error in the console 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636469&amp;aid=1] 

 

If you change the theme from the custom theme to out of box portal theme, then it works fine. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There has been few changes in the webdav repository between Portal 8.0.0.0 and Portal 8.0.0.1 version. One would have to add the new those changes in their custom theme's webdav in order to work correctly. 

Please do the following to resolve the issue : 

1) Copy the contextmenu.json from out of box portal 8 theme from fs-type1 webdav (themes\Portal8.0\contributions dir.) and paste it in the custom themes fs-type1/themes/<custom_theme>/contributions dir.

2) Copy the entire templates folder from out of box portal 8 theme from fs_type1 webdav (\themes\Portal8.0\menuDefinitions dir.) and paste it in the custom themes fs-type1/themes/<custom_theme>/menuDefinitions dir.

3) Now compare the out of box portal 8's deferred profile (fs-type1 - \themes\Portal8.0\profiles) with the custom theme's deferred profile and add the missing profiles in the custom theme's deferred profile.

Note: Assumption here is the custom theme is using/associated with deferred profile.

For instance, add the following modules in the deferredModuleIDs list : 
"wp_contextmenu_live_object",
"wp_content_targeting_cam",
"wcm_inplaceEdit"

4) Copy all the css files that starts with wp_contextmenu* from the fstype1 webdav of out of box portal theme ( in \themes\Portal8.0\css dir) and paste it in the custom themes fs-type1/themes/<custom_theme>/css dir.

5) Restart the portal server and test it out.
