Title: IBM If WebSphere Application Server v8 is installed with InfoSphere Information Server, why would the UpdateSignerCerts.bat script need to be run on a new DataStage client installed machine especially if wanting to use HTTP port 9080 and not HTTPS port 9443? - United States

Text:
RMI/IIOP; port 9080; 9080; WebSphere Application Server v8; WAS v8; SSL; SSL enabled TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 On a brand new DataStage client install, why would the UpdateSignerCerts.bat script needs to be run in order to connect to the DataStage server if WebSphere Application Server v8 is installed on the DataStage Domain tier when one would like to use the HTTP port 9090 (default port) rather than the HTTPS port 9443 (default port)? 

CAUSE
If WebSphere Application Server v8 is installed, by default, the RMI/IIOP is SSL enabled whereas with WebSphere Application Server v6.1 and v7.0, RMI/IIOP are not SSL enabled by default.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you would like WebSphere Application Server (WAS) to behave like it did with WAS v6.1 or v7.0, , then you would need to disable SSL for RMI/IIOP. 

This can be done via the WAS Admin Console by exercising the "CSIv2 inbound & outbound communications" options found under the Global Security menu.

Change Transport property from "SSL-required" to either "SSL-supported" or "TCP/IP" and after a restart, one should be able to send JMS messages without SSL.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue: 


Please follow the steps outline here.


 1. Log in to the WAS Admin Console 
 2. Under Security, click on Global security
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623252&amp;aid=1] 
 3. Click on RMI/IIOP security
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623252&amp;aid=2] 
 4. Click on either CSIv2 inbound communications or CSIv2 outbound communications[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623252&amp;aid=3] 
 5. Check the CSIv2 Transport Layer and look at the Transport field[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21623252&amp;aid=4]



The options for Transport are: 

TCP/IP 
If TCP/IP is selected, then the server opens a TCP/IP listener port only and all inbound requests do not have SSL protection. 

If TCP/IP is selected, non SSL connections will be used and the UpdateSignerCerts.bat script does not need to be run. 

SSL-required 
If SSL-required is selected, then the server opens an SSL listener port only and all inbound requests are received using SSL. 

If SSL-required is selected, only SSL connections can be used. Thus, the UpdateSignerCerts.bat script will need to be run on all new DataStage client installed machines. 

SSL-supported 
If SSL-supported is selected, then the server opens both a TCP/IP and an SSL listener port and most inbound requests are received using SSL. 

If SSL-supported is selected, either SSL connections or non-SSL can be used and one is not forced to use SSL and the UpdateSignerCerts.bat script does not need to be run. RELATED INFORMATION
