ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer have this issue:
   They have a customized workflow where Items are among the attach
   ed objects. In one node, there is an operational task; Promote.
   When I reach the node, all Items are state In Work. I then selec
   t one of them and perform task on it, it is promoted from In Wor
   k to Approved as expected and it says ???Task executed successfu
   lly???.
   I then select the entire process and choose Perform Task, in ord
   er to Promote all Items. All other Items are promoted to Approve
   d, except the first one which is promoted to Released, even thou
   gh task already is performed on it.
   1. Why is task performed on object even though it says ???Task e
   xecuted successfully??? on it?
   2. How can I prevent this from happening?
   Scenario:
   1. Have a Task defined for a specific Node.
   2. Open a Process and Initiate to get into this Node.
   3. Select a linked Object and do: Perform Tas.
   ==> OK: Object is set with Status flag: Task executed successful
   ly.
   4. Select same Object again and do: Perform Task.
   ==> KO: Task is being performed again.
   Notice: If task is a Lifecycle Promote operation, then an unexpe
   cted result occurs.
   User expects that if Status = Task executed successfully, then o
   peration is not performed again.
   At least there should be some Preference to prevent more than on
   e Perform Task per Object in a specific Node.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customer have this issue:
   They have a customized workflow where Items are among the
   attached objects. In one node, there is an operational task;
   Promote.
   When I reach the node, all Items are state In Work. I then
   select one of them and perform task on it, it is promoted
   from In Work to Approved as expected and it says ???Task
   executed successfully???.
   I then select the entire process and choose Perform Task, in
   order to Promote all Items. All other Items are promoted to
   Approved, except the first one which is promoted to Released,
   even though task already is performed on it.
   1. Why is task performed on object even though it says ???Task
   executed successfully??? on it?
   2. How can I prevent this from happening?
   Scenario:

   2. Open a Process and Initiate to get into this Node.
   3. Select a linked Object and do: Perform Tas.
   ==> OK: Object is set with Status flag: Task executed
   successfully.
   4. Select same Object again and do: Perform Task.
   ==> KO: Task is being performed again.
   Notice: If task is a Lifecycle Promote operation, then an
   unexpected result occurs.
   User expects that if Status = Task executed successfully,
   then operation is not performed again.
   At least there should be some Preference to prevent more than
   one Perform Task per Object in a specific Node.
