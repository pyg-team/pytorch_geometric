APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   Tests in UNIX:
   1. Create a part in FTA work bench.
   2. Create a Geometrical Tolerance.
   3. Create a text document, with Multiple lines.
   4. Copy / Paste this in the Text field of the Geometrical
   Tolerance
   5. Results: Multiple Lines are pasted in Unix for Geometrical
   tolerance.
   Tests in Windows:
   1. Create a part in FTA work bench.
   2. Create a Geometrical Tolerance.
   3. Create a text document, with Multiple lines.
   4. Copy / Paste this in the Text field of the Geometrical
   Tolerance.
   RESULTS:
   Multiple Lines pasting is possible for UNIX,  but it is not
   possible to do that in Windows.
   EXPECTED RESULTS:
   The Behavior should be consistent for CATIA in both Windows
   and UNIX OS.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA V5R21 GA level.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED ON CATIA V5R20 SP6.
   Additional Closure Information:
   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   Feature control is not working as expected on WIN VISTA OS
   when compared with UNIX
   .
   TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE DEFECT:
   The Geometrical Tolerance (GT) User Interface (UI) uses a
   mono-line text editor to insure that only a single line of
   text can be added to the GT.
   However, a defect specific to Unix UI implementation allowed
   adding several lines of text in this mono-line text editor,
   through copy/paste operation.
   By this mean, several lines of text could be added to the GT.
   .
   TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CORRECTION:
   The ability to add several lines of text haven't been made
   official up to now for the following reasons:
   - GT model support several lines of text;
   - But GT model does not allow specifying some text properties
   like Line Spacing, Justification, Wrapping, etc. Supporting
   these text properties on GT is an enhancement which is not
   planned as of today.
   However, taking into consideration the fact that customers
   may already have some GT with several lines of texts in
   production drawings, the capability to create such GT with
   several lines of text has been provided on Windows as well as
   on UNIX.
   Customer can thus decide to use multi-line texts for GT or
   not, knowing that line spacing cannot be tuned.
   .
   POSSIBLE BY-PASS AND/OR CORRECTION LIMITATION:
   On V5R20 level, it's mandatory to set the environment
   variable "CAT_MLG_LA" so as to activate this new function
   (i.e. multi-line text definition for GT). This is to insure
   there is no UI modification on V5R20 SP. From V5R21 and
   V6R2012 levels, the function is activated by default; the
   environment variable is
   not needed anymore.
   Please note that GT containing multiple lines of text can be
   edited even if the variable was not set (in that case, all
   text lines will appear on a single line of the text editor,
   with a special character figuring carriage return).
