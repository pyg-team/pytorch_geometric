PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM InfoSphere Metadata Asset Manager, long-running import operations for large imports can fail if they exceed the defined container-timeout period. The default timeout period is two hours. 

SYMPTOM
A long-running operation fails to complete successfully in IBM InfoSphere Metadata Asset Manager. A general failure message is displayed that indicates there was an error with saving the results. For example, this message might appear for an import to staging operation: 

 * 
 * com.ascential.xmeta.exception.ServiceException: Error saving the given EObjects to the persistent store
 * 


If the failure is caused by a transaction timeout, the WebSphere Application Server log displays a message such as the following immediately before the failure:  * TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction 000001321D4848DF00000001000005FF95012BC39891C7FBE3AABCC2A4F50648A1B598D5000001321D4848DF00000001000005FF95012BC39891C7FBE3AABCC2A4F50648A1B598D500000001 has timed out after 7200 seconds.


CAUSE
A long-running WebSphere transaction has timed out or the client has been inactive too long.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Analyze log messages and stack trace details of the WebSphere Application Server log at the time of the error.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the transaction and client inactivity timeout.
