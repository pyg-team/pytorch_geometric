OPTIM DIRECTORY SUPPORT
For Optim 9.1 test data management solutions that use Optim designer and Optim manager, the Optim directory and the IBM InfoSphere Optim Connection Manager database must be Unicode and are supported on the following database management systems only. For the next major version, all Optim solutions support the Optim directory and the InfoSphere Optim Connection Manager database on these database management systems only. The Optim directory must use a different schema from the schema that is used by the InfoSphere Optim Connection Manager database.

In DB2, certain Optim directory tables require an 8K tablespace. The default size for DB2 is 4K. Ensure that the directory owner has authorization to an 8K tablespace or that a specific 8K tablespace is specified when installing or upgrading.

SUPPORTED DATA SOURCES
The Optim solutions support data sources heterogeneously. That is, a solution can generally process a business object that consists of data from one or more data sources or extract data from one data sources or DBMSs and insert it in another. Select a tab for more information about supported data sources.

To prevent inadvertent deletion or alteration of data from system tables for your relational database management system, your Optim solution cannot be used in INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE processing against these tables.

Toleration 





Support levels

The support level for a version of a database is toleration or supported.

If a database is provided at a toleration level, the Optim solution can connect to the data source. The Optim solution also supports data types and features supported in previous releases of the solution but does not support all features of the data source.

If a data source is supported, the Optim solution also:

 *  Supports processing of the most common data types for the data source
 *  Might support or exploit other new features of the data source

In addition, for relational databases, the Optim solution supports extracting object definitions for the database as well as preserving and using (with the Optim create utility) extracted objects.
