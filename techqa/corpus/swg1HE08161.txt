APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting with this fix, ICC is able to derive the P8 Object Id
   from the document hash and thus the P8 Lookup task can process
   non archived emails correctly.
   This can be achieved by setting the environment variable
   AFU_PRODUCE_P8_OBJECT_ID=<SymbolicClassName>,<SymbolicObjectStor
   eName>,<ConnectionName>.
   Error Description:
   If the P8 4.x Confirm Document task is used in an IBM Content
   Collector task route to check if email documents have been
   archived and mark those documents that have been archived as
   processed, the P8 4.x Confirm Document task fails because of
   missing parameters.
   
   Problem summary:
   The P8 4.x Confirm Document requires email metadata information
   to work with email documents. However, this metadata is not
   available in the P8 4.x Confirm Document task, so that the
   result is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Problem solution:
   Starting with this fix, if the environment variable
   AFU_PRODUCE_P8_OBJECT_ID is set, the EC Extract Metadata task
   produces the email metadata that is required for the P8 4.x
   Confirm Document task to work correctly.
   
   Make sure that the Content Collector SharePoint Connector is
   installed. Set the environment variable in the following way:
   AFU_PRODUCE_P8_OBJECT_ID=<SymbolicClassName>,<SymbolicObjectStor
   eName>,<ConnectionName>
   where:
   - <SymbolicClassName> is the symbolic name of the FileNet P8
   document class that is used for archiving (default: ICCMAIL2)
   - <SymbolicObjectStoreName> is the symbolic name of the FileNet
   P8 object store
   - <ConnectionName> is the display name of the FileNet P8
   connection in IBM Content Collector that is used to interact
   with FileNet P8
   If unsure, check the values in FileNet Enterprise Manager or the
   Content Collector Configuration Manager.
   
   Restart the IBM Content Collector Server machine after you set
   the environment variable
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the P8 4.x Confirm Document task is used in an IBM Content
   Collector task route to check if Microsoft Exchange email
   documents have been archived and mark those documents that have
   been archived as processed, the P8 4.x Confirm Document task
   failed because of missing parameters. The P8 4.x Confirm
   Document requires email metadata information to work with email
   documents. However, this metadata is not available in the P8
   4.x Confirm Document task, so that the result is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, if the environment variable
   AFU_PRODUCE_P8_OBJECT_ID is set, the EC Extract Metadata task
   produces the email metadata that is required for the P8 4.x
   Confirm Document task to work correctly. Make sure that the
   Content Collector SharePoint Connector is installed. Set the
   environment variable in the following way:
   
   AFU_PRODUCE_P8_OBJECT_ID=<SymbolicClassName>,<SymbolicObjectStor
   eName>,<ConnectionName>
   
   where:
   *  <SymbolicClassName> is the symbolic name of the FileNet P8
     document class that is used for archiving (default: ICCMAIL2).
   *  <SymbolicObjectStoreName> is the symbolic name of the FileNet
     P8 object store.
   *  <ConnectionName> is the display name of the FileNet P8
     connection in IBM Content Collector that is used to interact
     with FileNet P8.
   
   If unsure, check the values in FileNet Enterprise Manager or the
   Content Collector Configuration Manager. Restart the IBM Content
   Collector Server machine after you set the environment variable.
