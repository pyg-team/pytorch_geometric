 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Attempting to Install OpenPages, I receive "The Oracle driver /apps/oracle/product/11.2.0//client/jdbc/lib/ojdbc7.jar does not exist"

Oracle 11.2.0.4 is installed and ojdbc6.jar exists. 
ojdbc7.jar exists in Oracle 12 installations, so why is this error being thrown?



CAUSE
unknown.....Oracle 12 was never installed on this box. After contacting OpenPages Support to confirm that the Oracle Client Installation is correct, the workaround below was used to avoid the validation. Please do not relax any other settings with OpenPages Support approval.

ANSWER
