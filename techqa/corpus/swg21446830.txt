PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files does not map the anyType datatype to UnstructuredContent datatype while migrating from version 6.0.2 to 6.1. From 6.1 onwards, Flat File adapter supports UnstructuredContent datatype in place of anytype datatype. 

SYMPTOM
When you set the datatype to anyType and migrate the PI from version 6.0.2 to 6.1, the following DataBinding Exception is thrown: 

commonj.connector.runtime.DataBindingException: Failed to transform Record to a DataObject instance. Record: com.ibm.j2ca.flatfile.FlatFileInputStreamRecord


CAUSE
Caused by setting of datatype to be anyType which the Flat File Adapter does not support.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After migrating the PI from version 6.0.2 to 6.1, manually set the Content field as UnstructuredContent datatype under FlatFile.xsd in place of anyType.
