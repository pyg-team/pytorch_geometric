   ****************************************************************
   The Private Protocol to DRDA protocol REXX Catalog Analysis
   tool (DSNTP2DP) that is run via job DSNTIJPD generates the
   REBIND PACKAGE and/or BIND PACKAGE COPY commands needed to
   convert packages from using private protocol to use DRDA
   protocol.  It also generates the REBIND PLAN and/or BIND
   PACKAGE COPY commands needed to convert plans from using
   private protocol to use DRDA protocol.  If the name of an
   object to be rebound is quite long, the generated command
   required to rebind the object might exceed column 72 such
   that TSO batch does not see a line continuation character
   to indicate that more of the command is continued on the
   next input line.  If the generated command(s) are then
   processed via TSO batch, the error message:
     CSV003I REQUESTED MODULE DBPROTOC NOT FOUND
   could be issued because the generated REBIND PACKAGE command
   being processed exceeds column 72 such that the TSO/E batch
   command processor does not know that the command is continued
   on the next input line. Since the next input line begins with
   DBPROTOCOL(DRDA), the TSO/E command processor attempts to load
   a program named DBPROTOC which does not exist and the CSV003I
   message is issued.
   Another symptom which could occur is the length of a line
   written to either the OUTPKGS or OUTPLANS output destination
   could exceed 80 characters resulting in an I/O error causing
   the termination of DSNTP2DP processing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DSNTP2DP has been changed such that any generated statement
   will not exceed 72 characters in length.
