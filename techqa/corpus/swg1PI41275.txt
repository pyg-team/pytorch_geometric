   *                      no easy way to see which ciphers have   *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a CICS resource definition for IPCONN, TCPIPSERVICE
   or URIMAP is installed, it is possible that the resource
   is installed with a reduced set of cipher codes.
   
   When the ciphers are specified by a cipher suite
   specification file then message DFHSO0145 is issued when
   a reduced set of cipher codes are installed. This message
   states the number of ciphers that have been removed from
   the cipher list. However there is no easy way to tell which
   ciphers have been removed.
   
   When the ciphers are specified by a list of 2-digit cipher
   suite codes then message DFHSO0145 is not issued, so there is
   no easy way to know how many or which ciphers were removed.
   
   It is possible to take a CICS system dump and then review the
   SO domain to see which ciphers have been successfully
   installed. The user could then compare this installed
   list with the list they provided to the relevant resource
   definition.
   
   It would be preferable if CICS provided a list of the
   ciphers that had been removed at the same time as issuing
   the SO0145 message. As well as ensuring that the SO0145
   message is issued for all resources that are installed
   with a reduced set of cipher codes.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSOIS has been altered to issue message DFHSO0145 when
   ciphers are removed for both cipher lists and cipher files.
   It has been further altered to issue new message DFHSO0146
   after message DFHSO0145 so that it can list the ciphers
   that were removed.
   
   DFHMESOE, DFHMESOC and DFHMESOK have been altered to add new
   message DFHSO0146 and update DFHSO0145.
   
   The CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Version 5 Release 2, CICS
   Messages and Codes Vol 2, GC34-7284-00, Chapter 4. DFH messages
   - DFHN to DFHZ, section DFHSOnnnn messages has been altered in
   two places.
   1. Message DFHSO0145 has been updated and will now read as
   follows:-
   DFHSO0145 W DATE TIME APPLID An installation using ciphers
   ciphersourcetype ciphersource has resulted in number ciphers
   being removed from the cipher list.
   Explanation: Whilst installing a resource using a ciphers list
   or file to specify the ciphers to use, a number of the ciphers
   have been removed because they are not supported by system SSL
   in the security environment requested for this CICS region.
   This message will be followed by one or more DFHSO0146 messages
   listing the ciphers.
   System action: As long as one cipher in the list is valid, the
   install proceeds successfully.
   User response: Ensure that the ciphers list or file only
   specifies valid ciphers.
   Module: DFHSOIS
   Message inserts:
   1. DATE
   2. TIME
   3. APPLID
   4. ciphersourcetype
   5. ciphersource
   6. number
   Destination: CSOO
   2. New message DFHSO0146 has been added as follows:-
   DFHSO0146 I DATE TIME APPLID Ciphers removed: cipherlist.
   Explanation: This message follows message DFHSO0145 listing the
   ciphers that are not supported.
   System action: As long as one cipher in the list is valid, the
   install proceeds successfully.
   User response: Ensure that the ciphers list or file only
   specifies valid ciphers.
   Module: DFHSOIS
   Message inserts:
   1. DATE
   2. TIME
   3. APPLID
   4. cipherlist
   Destination: CSOO
