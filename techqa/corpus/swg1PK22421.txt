ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Short description:
   RPMPROD6126:'Update Project Health Status'
   I am not able to access "Update Project Health Status" from My
   Portal Page. I can see all the options except this one. I can
   access this from the Investment Map when I access it from the
   normal Portfolio Viewer.
   Action Taken:
   I sent the following e-mail to the customer on March 14:
   Hello Preeti,
   Regarding PMR 77370 49R 000 ('Update Proj Health Status' not
   available in My Portal):
   This is a defect. After some research, I have discovered that
   access to the "Update Project Health Status" option in the  'My
   Portal' page is controlled by the "Access Asset Portfolio
   Dashboard" security option. This is not correct. I have opened a
   defect on the requirements server and notified the Development
   Team.
   As a workaround, in order to make the "Update Project Health
   Status" option visible from the 'My Portal' page, please follows
   the steps below:
   1. Log on as the resource administrator who has access to the
   user's resource record.
   2. Navigate to the "Resource Management" view and locate the
   resource record.
   3. Double-click on the resource record to open its "Description
   View".
   4. Check out the resource record.
   5. Maximize the "System Security Rights" portlet.
   6. Expand the "Asset Management" node.
   7. Put a check mark in the box next to the "Access Asset
   Portfolio Dashboard" security option.
   8. Check in the resource record.
   9. Log on as this resource.
   10. Confirm that the user now has the "Update Project Health
   Status" option in the 'My Portal' page.
