   PO07691, WorkItem:225732 - IEG conditional question responses
   are not cleared even though the control question response is
   changed
   Issue Description: Previously in IEG, conditional clusters
   controlled by a dropdown within another conditional cluster
   were not hidden when the controlling cluster was hidden.  User
   Interface Impact: Yes  Steps to Reproduce:
   * Login as hcrcaseworker.
   * Open the HCR Cases and Outcomes tab.
   * Open the toggle in the shortcuts menu labelled Registration.
   * Click Person. The Register Person modal will open. Click Next.
   * Enter details for any person and click Save. The person
   profile should open.
   * Click on the Options menu and select New Application. The
   Before We Start modal should open.
   * Tick the checkbox labelled "This person agrees to allow their
   information to be used for this application.".
   * Click Next. Select No from the dropdown labelled "Do you have
   a fixed address?".
   * Select No from the dropdown labelled "Are you a state
   resident?".
   * Select Select Yes from the drop-down labelled "Do you have a
   fixed address?".
   Resolution:
   This issue has been resolved by unsetting the value of dropdown
   fields when the conditional cluster they are displayed within
   is hidden. This ensures any conditional clusters which were
   displayed based on the value of these dropdowns will also be
   hidden.
