PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is it possible to filter an Impromptu report on the current fiscal year? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Yes, using this calculation in a filter to obtain the required report you need. This calculation assumes that the period of May 1, 1997 and April 30, 1998 is Fiscal year 97.

(if (month(order date) between 5 and 12) then (year(order date)) else (year(order date) -1)) = (if (month(today()) between 5 and 12) then (year(today())) else (year(today()) -1))

If this period is called Fiscal year 98, it would be the following filter:

(if (month(order date) between 5 and 12) then (year(order date) +1) else (year(order date))) = (if (month(today()) between 5 and 12) then (year(today()) +1) else (year (today())))
