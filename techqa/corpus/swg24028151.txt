 5. Download all the required images.
 6. Extract each of the images into a single, temporary directory on your system. Use a file extracting utility that supports large file extractions.
 7. Download the Quick Start Guide [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=14&uid=swg27016910]. Follow the instructions to perform the basic installation of the product.
 8. If you are migrating from IBM InfoSphere Information Server, Version 8.0.1 or later, read the migration information [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21445403].

If you purchase additional product modules or components after you install the suite, you do not have to download the installation image again. However, you must update the license on the services tier computer before you can install the new modules. For more information, see the latest IBM InfoSphere Information Server Planning, Installation, and Configuration Guide [http://www.ibm.com/e-business/linkweb/publications/servlet/pbi.wss?CTY=US&FNC=SRX&PBL=GC19-1048].

You apply any relevant fix packs from the Support site.

NOTE: When you download images, keep in mind that Windows limits the length of the file name to be 260 characters. Therefore, if you try to download an image to a directory that has an extremely long path, the download will not be successful. To avoid this problem, make sure that the combined length of the directory to which you will download the image and the file name of the image is less than 260 characters, including spaces and special characters.
