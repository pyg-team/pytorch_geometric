APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: Files in the /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach
   directory, such as _attachlock, _master, and _notifier, have
   unnecessary execute permissions.
   Only owner, group, and world read and write permissions are
   required.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run:
   chmod 666 /tmp/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_*
   Do not change permissions on directories.
   Do not remove any read or write permissions on _attachlock,
   _master, and _notifier as this will delay VM shutdown.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Java VM was creating files with unnecessarily broad
   permissions, creating security concerns. It was also not
   handling the case where certain files had incorrect permissions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.1 SR2
   7.0.0 SR1
   6.0.0 SR11
   .
   The default permissions for the attach API common files have
   been changed.? The recovery algorithm was fixed to handle files
   with insufficient permissions.
