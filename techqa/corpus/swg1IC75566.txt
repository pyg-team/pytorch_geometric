APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The InfoCenter does not have adequate documentation for
   configuring the WebServices nodes (HTTPRequest, SOAPRequest and
   SOAPAsyncRequest) to use Basic-Auth.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Information Center needs to be updated
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker HTTPRequest, SOAPRequest
   or SOAPAsyncRequest Nodes.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When configuring WebSphere Message Broker to use Basic-Auth the
   recommended practice is to use the Security Propagation and
   Mapping functionality so that the user does not need to
   generate the required heads in a compute node. The
   documentation for the Security Propagation and Mapping
   functionality is extremely broad and does not specifically
   mention Basic-Auth at all making it difficult for application
   designers to find the required information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new topic has been added to the InfoCenter with the following
   text:
   
   Using a security profile to implement HTTP Basic-Auth in the
   HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest Nodes
   
   Basic Auth is a common extension the the HTTP protocol that
   allows a client to provide identity information to a remote web
   server in the form of a username and password passed in the
   HTTP header data. WebSphere Message Broker's built in security
   profile functionality provides an easy way for message flow
   designers to provide these credentials without having to build
   the HTTP Headers in a compute node.
   
   The HTTPRequest node and SOAPRequest node will automatically
   pick up username and password credentials, if present, from the
   Properties tree if the currently selected Security Profile has
   identity propagation enabled, see Configuring for identity
   propagation (link to ap04160_.htm). There is a predefined
   Security Profile called "Default Propagation" which has this
   setting predefined.
   
   In order to enable Basic Auth select an appropriate security
   profile for the Output node or the whole messageflow in the
   Broker Archive editor. The credentials are picked up from the
   following Properties tree locations if set:
   
   Properties.IdentityMappedType
   Properties.IdentityMappedToken
   Properties.IdentityMappedPassword
   
   If the "Mapped" identity fields are not set then the
   credentials are picked up from the following Properties tree
   locations:
   
   Properties.IdentitySourceType
   Properties.IdentitySourceToken
   Properties.IdentitySourcePassword
   
   For Basic Auth both a username and password are required so the
   appropriate "Type" field must be set to the string
   'usernameAndPassword'. For example a compute node with the
   following ESQL sets username to "myUser" and the basic auth
   password to "myPassw0rd". These fields will then be interpreted
   by a subsequent HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest Node and converted
   in a Basic Auth header:
   
   SET
   OutputRoot.Properties.IdentitySourceType='usernameAndPassword';
   SET OutputRoot.Properties.IdentitySourceToken = 'myUser';
   SET OutputRoot.Properties.IdentitySourcePassword = 'myPassw0rd';
   
   It is also possible to propagate the credentials from an input
   message by setting a Security Profile which includes
   propagation on an input node and then using the input node
   properties "Identity token type", Identity Token location"
   and "Identity password location". These 3 properties take an
   XPath expression specifying the location in the input message
   to retrieve the appropriate token or password from. When
   configured correctly these properties place the identity
   information in the Properties.IdentitySourceType,
   Properties.IdentitySourceToken and
   Properties.IdentitySourcePassword fields. The values can
   then be used directly from a HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest Node
   with an appropriate Security Policy.
