install application support failed failure KCI1148E KCI1249E not supported platform TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installation of application support can fail with KCI1148E or KCI1249E errors when product media images do not contain the prerequisite support packages for all of the platforms where management server and/or portal server and portal client components are supported. 

SYMPTOM
Installation of application support fails with KCI1148E or KCI1249E errors.


CAUSE
Some product media images do not contain the prerequisite support packages for all of platforms where management server and/or portal server and Client components are supported.

ENVIRONMENT
Unix, Linux

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Run install.sh from the product media image.
Select the option to install support for one of the management server or portal server or Client components.
Notice that you received one of the error message IDs KCI1148E or KCI1249E.




This technote does NOT apply if you are attempting to install an agent and you received one of the error message IDs KCI1148E or KCI1249E.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two workarounds for this situation. Choose the appropriate workaround based on the contents of install.sh from the product media image.
Use Workaround 1 if install.sh from the product media image contains the following 
PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_CHECK=__PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_CHECK__ 

Use Workaround 2 if the above line is not found.


Workaround 1:  1. Ensure that you have write access to the product media image directory, If you do not, you will need to copy the product media image to a location where you do have write access. 
 2. Set the following variables as directed.
    PRODimage - The fully qualified path to the directory containing install.sh for the product media image directory which contains the application support that you want to install on this system. 
 3. Copy $PRODimage/install.sh to $PRODimage/installAppSuppOnly.sh in the writable product media image directory. 
 4. Edit $PRODimage/installAppSuppOnly.sh and replace the line
    PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_CHECK=__PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_CHECK__
    with the line
    PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_CHECK=NO 
 5. Save $PRODimage/installAppSuppOnly.sh 
 6. Run $PRODimage/installAppSuppOnly.sh  1. Enter "1" to install products to the local host. 
     2. Enter "1" if you accept the license agreement. 
     3. Enter the appropriate number to install the desired management server Support, portal server Support or portal client Support options and confirm the selection. 
     4. Enter the appropriate numbers for the product application support to install and confirm the selection. 
     5. Enter "y" if you need to install the application support for additional installed Server and Client components and repeat step 4. 
     6. Enter "n" if no other application support needs to be installed.
    
    

Workaround 2:  1. Locate the original ITM media image directory which was used to install the management server or portal server on this system and ensure that you have write access to the directory, If it is not available or you do not have write access to the directory, you will need to unpack and/or copy the ITM media image to a location where you do have write access. 
 2. Ensure that you have read access to the product media image directory which contains the application support that you want to install on this system, 
 3. Set the following variables as directed.
    ITMimage - The fully qualified path to the directory containing install.sh for the ITM media image directory used to install the management server or portal server on this system.
    PRODimage - The fully qualified path to the directory containing install.sh for the product media image directory which contains the application support that you want to install on this system. 
 4. Copy $PRODimage/unix/*tms.jar to $ITMimage/unix in the writable ITM media image directory. 
 5. Copy $PRODimage/unix/*tp*.jar to $ITMimage/unix in the writable ITM media image directory. 
 6. Run $ITMimage/install.sh  1. Enter "1" to install products to the local host. 
     2. Enter "1" if you accept the license agreement. 
     3. Enter the appropriate number to install the desired management server Support, portal server Support or portal client Support options and confirm the selection. 
     4. Enter the appropriate numbers for the product application support to install and confirm the selection. 
     5. Enter "y" if you need to install the application support for additional installed Server and Client components and repeat step 4. 
     6. Enter "n" if no other application support needs to be installed.
