QUESTION
 SNMP Gateway : How is the gateway configured? 

ANSWER
 

The SNMP Gateway is used to forward object server events as SNMP traps. 

It does not perform a synchronisation on start-up. If such a filter is required, this must be performed using customisation's. 

Basic configuration is straightforward, and the SNMP [MTTrapd] Probe can be used to test trap forwarding. 

Please refer to Support's Guide to the SNMP gateway.
