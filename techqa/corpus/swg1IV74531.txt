APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Having following directory used, twsinst should not allow to
   set " -inst_dir /opt/Tivoli/TWS".
   
   TWA_path=/opt/Tivoli/TWS/TDWC -> TWA HOME for TDWC.
   TDWC_basePath=/opt/Tivoli/TWS/TDWC/TDWC -> TDWC HOME
   EWas_profile_path=/opt/Tivoli/TWS/JazzSM/profile
   EWas_basePath=/opt/Tivoli/TWS/WAS -> WAS Home (TWSProfile
   profile)
   
   In this case we have a TWA_HOME that hosts another
   TWA_HOME as sub folder, that is not a supported configuration.
   
   TWA_HOME         (/opt/Tivoli/TWS)
     |_ TWA_HOME    (/opt/Tivoli/TWS/TDWC)
   
   Consider also that this same scenario is not supported by
   Installation Manager by default.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set "-inst_dir" to other directory which is not a parent of
   other instance's TWA_HOME.
   For example:
     /opt/Tivoli/FTA
          or
     /opt/Tivoli/TWS/FTA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fixed the agent code to avoid to select as the installation path
   the subfolder of another TWA product
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR will be fixed in 9.1.0-TIV-TWS-FP0003,
   9.2.0-TIV-TWS-FP0002, 9.3.0-TIV-TWS-FP0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Do not install a TWA product in a subfolder of another TWA
   product.
