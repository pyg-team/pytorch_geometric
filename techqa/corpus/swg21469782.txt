Title: IBM Authentication to Identity Insight fails after changing database password - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When logging into the Identity Insight's Visualizer or Console GUIs, authentication fails after changing the database password. 

SYMPTOM
Logging into the Console or Visualizer may fail with authentication errors after changing the database password.

CAUSE
Need to update WAS files with new authentication information.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem is related to the WAS files not being updated with the new authentication information. Engineering has created a script to change the password throughout AR. The file can be provided by Support with a valid Support contract. Once downloaded, it should be edited with the updated/corrected database authentication information at the top of the file where indicated.


The script should be run from the WAS profile bin directory: 

 

 ./wsadmin.sh -conntype NONE -f <path to edited jacl script> 

 

An alternative to this option, should customers not feel comfortable running the jacl script, is to uninstall and reinstall the Resolver.
