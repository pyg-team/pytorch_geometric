Title: IBM CTE0105 Memory allocation error from Net Search Extender Update Index Command - United States

Text:
NSE; CTE0105 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DB2TEXT update index for text command fails with the following error message.

105 CTE0105 Memory allocation error.CTE0101 A search engine operation failed. Reason code: "2", "100001", "0", " ", "../cos/headers/cos_memmgr.hpp:359". 

SYMPTOM
The db2text update command fails to complete the text index update operation. 

The event table associated with the text index being update will contain the following error message: 
CTE0105 Memory allocation error.CTE0101 A search engine operation failed. Reason code: "2", "100001", "0", " ", "../cos/headers/cos_memmgr.hpp:359".



CAUSE
The update index process could not allocate memory. This can be caused because the limit for the DB2 instance owner or the DB2 fenced id for memory and data have been reached. Or because the system ran out of memory.


ENVIRONMENT
AIX, Linux , Unix



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Check the operating system error reports for any memory related errors. 
 * Check the ulimit settings for the DB2INSTANCE owner by executing the following:  1. login in as the DB2INSTANCE owner 
    2. executing the "ulimit -a" command
   
   

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * If the operating system error report shows memory allocation errors, then reduce the number of applications running to free up more memory for the NSE update command.
   
 * If the uliimit settings for memory and data are not set to unlimited or -1 , have your operating system administrator set hard limits for data and memory to unlimited for the DB2INSTANCE owner and the DB2 FencedId.
