Title: IBM On Demand Router is unable to route requests to application servers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The On Demand Router (ODR) is unable to route traffic to applications deployed to dynamic clusters. 

SYMPTOM
The ODR returns a HTTP 1.1 503 response code to the client. This may either appear as a blank page or HTTP 1.1 503 error page in the client browser.


CAUSE
A core bridge has not been set up between the core group the ODR belongs and the core group which the cluster where the application was deployed belongs

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The following exceptions are written to the ODR logs: 

TreeBuilder no CF endpoint: 
com.ibm.wsspi.channel.framework.exception.NoCFEndPointException: Factory
class class com.ibm.ws.soapchannel.acceptor.SOAPAcceptorChannelFactory
