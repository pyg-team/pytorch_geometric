APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description :
   Data Power Data Collector requests may hang whilst connecting
    or  reading from Data Power.
    HTTP connections to the Data Power don't currently have a
    connect or read time out.
    An read or write requests operation on a connection will block,
    indefinitely, whilst waiting for a response.
    This might mean that the WSM Buffer Completed Records may reach
    the maximum size and cease to grow.
    Any other Data Power Data Collections will continue to operate
    as they are independent and run in different threads.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the Data Power Data Collector on
   * all platforms.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Data Power Data Collector requests may
   * hang whilst connecting or  reading from Data Power. HTTP
   * connections to the Data Power don't currently have a connect
   * or read time out. Any read or write operations on a
   * connection will block indefinitely, whilst waiting for a
   * response.
   *
   * Interim Fix 7 fixes this by adding a read timeout to the Data
   * Power Data Collector. Is a session is not established in this
   * time frame an exception is raised and it retries in the next
   * poll interval. The default read timeout is 10 seconds.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply IFix 7 when available.
