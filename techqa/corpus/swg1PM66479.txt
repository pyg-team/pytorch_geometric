PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Failures related to version management along with a version list
   that appears to have duplicate version names in the 'version
   name' column.
   Opened for release 7002
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Summary:
   All Item syndication can result in versions with duplicate
   names.
   
   Detailed Problem Description:
   All Item syndication can result in version related issues.  This
   means that if there is a version 1,2,3,4 on syndicator these
   versions will be syndicated to the subscriber.  This can result
   in versions with duplicate names and thus cause issues when
   reading, deleting, restoring, labeling, etc. versions.
   
   Problem Analysis:
   All Item syndication can result in version related issues.  In
   7.x WCM tries to ensure the version names on syndicator and
   subscriber match.  This means that if there is a version 1,2,3,4
   on syndicator these versions will be syndicated to the
   subscriber.  This can result in versions with duplicate names
   and thus cause issues when reading, deleting, restoring,
   labeling, etc. versions.
   
   The duplicate versions are caused by content manipulation
   (versions being created on subscriber).  If a syndicator has
   versions 1,2,3 and the subscriber has the same then content is
   edited on the subscriber resulting in 1,2,3,4 and 5 on the
   subscriber then the user edits the same content on the
   syndicator version 4 and 5 get created on the syndiccator and
   syndicated to the subscriber and on the subscriber you end up
   with 1,2,3,4,5,4,5 in Support tools you will see 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
   but the version names of 6 and 7 are 4 and 5.  This results in
   the version code returning the second version 4 and or 5 when
   you select version 6 and or 7.
   
   Problem Solution:
   Code updated to allow JCR to control the version names and thus
   prevent reoccurrence.  The items where this issue already exists
   can be fixed either using SQL that support will need to provide.
