QUESTION
 Support Guides : Which Support Guides are available? 

CAUSE
Users find it useful to have a list of all available guides

ANSWER
A list of the available Support Guides is given in the links below. 

The Support Guides documentation is mostly a collection of technical documentation that supplements the main user reference guides for specific integrations. 

Within these guides there are worked examples for at least one UNIX platform, and recommended configurations. 

The rest of the documentation provides examples of specific tasks, such as event replication and the controlled re-synchronisation of events. 

NOTE: You can use the search text "Support's Guide [product]" to see if anything is available if you find you need to get to the link outside of this FAQ. 

For example, "Support's Guide" will list all of the guides when entered into the Netcool/OMNIbus search portal.
