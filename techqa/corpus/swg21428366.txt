PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error CTGIN9633E is encountered while using the middleware installation program, indicating a failure running the idsldapadd command. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Error CTGIN9633E is encountered while using the middleware installation program, indicating a failure running the idsldapadd command. 

To troubleshoot the error, examine the following logs:

<workspace>/deploymentPlan/MachinePlan_<machine_name>/000XX_ITDS_6.2/logs/[INSTALL_<Timestamp>]/ITDS_6.2.log 

<workspace>/deploymentPlan/MachinePlan_<machine_name>/000XX_ITDS_6.2/logs/ITDS_6.1_[INSTALL_<Timestamp>].message

<mwi-workspace>/<machine_name>/deploymentPlan/MachinePlan_<machine_name>/<stepno>_ITDS_Configuration/install/03_CONFIG/[INSTALL_<processing.req.id>]/logs/ addLDIFData.log

<instance_home dir>/ idsslapd-<instancename>/logs

For example, for AIX platforms, the default home directory is /home/idsccmdb/idsslapd-idsccmdb/logs.

On Linux and AIX platforms, this problem can occur if the <workspace>/<machine_name>/deploymentPlan/MachinePlan_<machine_name>/<stepno>_ITDS_Configuration/install/03_CONFIG/[INSTALL_<processing.req.id>]/GeneratedFiles/ITDS_LDAP_Config.ldif file contains ^M characters, which happens when install files are not transferred in binary mode. These characters can be removed by using the dos2unix utility with the ITDS_LDAP_Config.ldif file as input. 

Refer to the following for more information:

After resolving the condition causing the error, restart the middleware installation program:

1) Restart the middleware installation program. 
2) Select Undeploy the plan. 
3) Select Partial Uninstall, selecting only IBM Tivoli Directory Server.
4) Complete the uninstall.
5) Restart the middleware installation program with the Restart the Plan option, and continue the middleware deployment.
