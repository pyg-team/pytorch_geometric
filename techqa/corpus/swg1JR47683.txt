APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A "Select Package" dialog displayed by the Report Designer
   widget displays the following message which prevents the
   creation of a report: "No measures found.  Select a package or
   folder that contains measures."  This happens when a Cognos
   package or folder name contains special characters such a 'c'
   with a cedilla, an 'a' with a tilde, or an 'e' with an accent
   and the browser is Internet Explorer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue can be avoided by removing special characters from
   Cognos package or folder names when creating a monitor model.
   Using a browser other than Internet Explorer is another way to
   avoid the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM Business Monitor.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Report Designer widget cannot be    *
   *                      used to create reports if Cognos        *
   *                      package or folder names contain         *
   *                      special characters and the browser is   *
   *                      Internet Explorer.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Logic to retrieve package information from Cognos did not
   properly encode URL parameters so that special characters in
   the resulting URL would be handled correctly.  In addition,
   logic in the Report Designer widget to save a report did not
   properly encode special characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Report Designer widget logic to retrieve package
   information from Cognos and to save a report has been modified
   to properly encode special characters.
   
   An interim fix has been created for IBM Business Monitor
   version 8.0.1.1.  The issue is also addressed in IBM Business
   Monitor version 8.0.1 Fix Pack 2 (8.0.1.2).
