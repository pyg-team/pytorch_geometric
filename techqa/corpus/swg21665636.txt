Title: IBM Data synchronization is successful but the WAS log indicates a thread hung in Tivoli Identity Manager. - United States

Text:
data sync synch synchronization hang hung thread threads TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We are facing thread hang issue during data synchronization process but the Data Synchronization is successful. 

Is this normal behavior or not? 

CAUSE
 When a thread takes longer than 10 minutes to complete, WebSphere flags it as "potentially hung" 
and writes it to the log file. Once the thread completes, it will write another message stating that thread ### which was previously thought to be hung has now completed after ### milliseconds. We attempted to have them increase the hang detection threshold in WebSphere, but that's not 
really going to solve the problem. Data Synch is single threaded, so unless you set the threshold longer than Data Synch takes, you will get one of these log entries showing a hung thread. Reconciliations have several threads to process the results, but there's still one thread holding the 
connection to the adapter, so you'd also need to set the threshold 
higher than your longest recon to completely avoid the message.


ANSWER
This is completely normal and expected behavior. The best solution is to just leave it at the default of 10 minutes and expect to see those entries every so often. It's only a problem if you start getting 15-20 or more hung threads, and the number doesn't seem to be going down. Or leave this message as a warning, it will not harm at all in this case.
