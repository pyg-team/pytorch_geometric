Title: IBM Unable to open FileNet Content Platform Engine (CPE) Subscription due to duplicate event - United States

Text:
event actions; subscriptions TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After importing events with FileNet Deployment Manager (FDM) a subscription in Administration Console For Content Engine (ACCE) will not open due to duplicate events 

SYMPTOM
Attempting to open the subscription that is associated with duplicate events gives a pop-up error:

FNRAC1008E
Unable to get data from server

User response: Check the error details for more information and contact IBM Software Support if necessary

Exception details:
undefined

Attempts to delete a duplicate event gives the error "‘The object cannot be deleted as it is referenced by other objects’".


CAUSE
The duplicate events cause an inconsistency with the subscription.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the duplicated event in ACCE:


 1. Locate and examine both duplicated events. If they are identical, you can probably just keep the most current. 
 2. Rename the display names of both duplicate events, save and refresh. 
 3. Attempt to open the subscription that was getting the error. If it still errors, make sure all ACCE session are closed, clear your browser cache and try to open the subscription again. 
 4. Once in the subscription change the event to any event that is not a duplicate, save and refresh 
 5. Delete the event that is not needed, and rename the other back to it's original name. Save and refresh 
 6. Go back to the subscription and re-select the event you just renamed back to the original. Save, refresh and test.
