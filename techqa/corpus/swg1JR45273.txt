APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When open coach design view it needs a long time (50 seconds -
   xx minutes) till PD view is responsive again and changes can be
   done on coach.
   This problem happens on complex coaches using Localization
   Ressources.
   
   The performance degradation does not occur when removing
   Localization Ressources.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  not using LR (Localization Ressources)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When opening a coach view with many translated strings and/or
   the human service links to many localization resources, it takes
   a long time (a minute to well over a minute) to load a coach
   within the human service.  Subsequent modifications result in
   the same lengthy delay, making the heritage coach editor pretty
   much unusable.
   
   USER AFFECTED:
   Business Process Manager Advanced, Standard and Express Process
   Designer users. Specifically, human service authors leveraging
   many localization resources and using many translated strings in
   their heritage coaches.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   The problem is that each UI element (button, section, etc)
   handled its own isolated resolution of its translated string.
   This resulted in many localization resource resolutions and
   loadings.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A caching mechanism was introduced, so that each localization
   resource linked to by the human server is resolved and loaded at
   most once per heritage coach editor instance.  The result is
   that the heritage coach editor loads in 4-14 secs, and has no
   delays at all after loading.
