APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WSDL status shows error if WSDL's are fetched too many times in
   succession.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are DataPower configurations with Web Service Proxy
   service accessing many WSDLs remotely hosted via HTTP(S) or
   WSRR.
   
   The WSP service may fail to come up either the first time after
   appliance restart or after it or its domain has been disabled,
   reporting many WSDLs in error state. The state is persistent and
   may or may not be recovered by appliance restart.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 7.1.0.18, 7.2.0.15, 7.5.0.9, 7.5.1.8,
   7.5.2.8 and 7.6.0.0

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Appliance restart may or may not help, depending on the affected
   service configuration.
