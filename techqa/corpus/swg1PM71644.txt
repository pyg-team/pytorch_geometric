LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IMS V12 systems using Multiple           *
   *                 System Coupling (MSC) TCPIP links            *
   *                 where PM51402 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM51402] / UK78508 and UK78507 applied. *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A limited number of IMS PTFs contained  *
   *                      missing SMP/E ++HOLD statements.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: INSTALL CORRECTIVE SERVICE FOR APAR/PTF      *
   ****************************************************************
   A tool error caused SMP/E ++HOLD statements to be missing from
   a small subset of IMS PTFs. The absent ++HOLD statements had no
   negative impact on the code solutions these PTFs provided.

   Message and Codes Volume 1 - GC18971207
   
   Add the following active_process meanings to the DFS3178E
   message:
   
   TCPPOST
   The device dependent routine post handler (DFSTCP20) was
   processing a post of a message received from the SCI input
   message exit (DFSSXIN0) but the logical link the message was
   targeted for could not be determined, or an error on the
   CSLSCBFR RELEASE buffer request occurred.
   
   Diagnostic Guide - GC19301500
   In Chapter 16, MSC - Multiple System Coupling service aids,
   Table 108. Significant fields in MSS1 and MSS2 records,
   In the TCP/IP Link Type section, add the following new
   fields that are traced:
   
   * DFSAWE, The input AWE from the SCI input message exit,
     DFSSXIN0. This AWE chain is initially queued to the
     LXBAWEHDR, then moved over to CLBQE by the TCPIP post
     handler, DFSTCP20 for processing by the DDM. The AWE
     is mapped by the DFSAWEXI macro. Field AWXI_MBRPLPTR contains
     the DFSMSDIR parameter list from SCI.
   
   * DFSMSDIR, The parameter list of double word parameters,
     containing the length and address of the parameters passed
     between MSC and IMS Connect through the SCI interface.
   
   * ICONDATA, The data from IMS Connect, pointed to by the
     DFSMSDIR parameter MDIR_ICONMSGPTR. This data is mapped
     by the BUFMS macro, starting at field BUFMSHDR.
