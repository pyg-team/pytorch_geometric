PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to use the Data View source node in IBM SPSS Modeler do not show any Data Access Plans in the Analytic Data view drop down box. 

SYMPTOM
No Data Access Plans in the Analytic Data view drop down box.


CAUSE
Only Real Time Data Access Plans had been created.
Modeler can only use Batch Data Access Plans.

ENVIRONMENT
Modeler 18

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review what type of Data Access Plans have been created in Deployment Manager client.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modeler does not do real-time scoring. You would not see the real-time data access plan. 
However, you would see a batch data access plan if one exists. So you can create a batch data access plan just like your real time access plan which can then be used in Modeler.
