 * Remote Server: Creating this endpoint as client.


Configuring HTTP endpoint as Details Server End-entity certificates and private key are required to be imported in keystore. The Server
Certificate Alias Name which is imported keystore need to be selected as the Server Certificate Alias Name at HTTPS option. Client Connects to remote server
with HTTPS connection. Confirm that root certificates of CA certificates or intermediate certificates which guarantees remote server
are contained in truststore. If it is included, there is no required action in here. If not, you have to import the target root certificates of CA certificates or intermediate certificates.
