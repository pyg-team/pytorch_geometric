Title: IBM TEP clients with inconsistent views of situation events - United States

Text:
situation situations event events inconsistent web start webstart java TEP client clients situation event console SEC TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 On several occasions, one can see differences in data (situation events) shown between
multiple TEP clients using java webstart, even after a refresh of the involved PCs, is that right? 

CAUSE
This problem was already addressed in APAR IZ07920 for ITM 6.1.x

ANSWER
Regarding the inconsistent view of situations between multiple TEP clients, following things should be taken into account: 
- The TEP Client situation event console (SEC) displays different events when connected to the same HUB. Events can even be missing from the SEC. 
- In the TEPS there is a single snapshot object that contains all events. In an environment where there are large number of events the snapshot object can get updated, while it is still being read for a TEP client. This can cause different events to be displayed for different TEP clients. 
- There can also be TEP Client time-out problems that will appear as an event console out of sync. The only difference is that on the TEP client that has timed out, there will be no new events displayed. 

To correct this problem, you may please set the following parameters in the 
KFWENV file for TEPS on Windows, or in cq.ini for TEPS on Linux/Unix: 
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_MAX=20
- KFW_EVENT_ASSIST=N 
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30 

Further information about the given parameters:
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_MAX = Number of retries before time out 
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = Number of seconds between retries 



These parameters deliver the time-out interval of the TEP client event channel. If these two
parameters are not set, then there is a current time-out interval of 2 minutes.
If you e.g. set the parameters as follows: 
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_MAX=20 
- KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30 
then we have a time-out interval of 20 * 30 /60 = 10 minutes (Source: APAR IZ10303) 

- KFW_EVENT_ASSIST is related with "Event Assist" feature which consists of a table in the TEPS
database that keeps a history of all situation events. That history is (by default) pruned daily and is 
sometimes turned off because it has been known to cause DB2 problems since it can be heavily 
updated when there are lots of events. 
The Event Assistant is enabled by default (KFW_EVENT_ASSIST=Y). To reduce the processing 
demands for the portal server, the Event Assistant can be disabled by setting 
KFW_EVENT_ASSIST=N in the portal server configuration file 

 (KFWENV on Windows, cq.ini on Unix/Linux).
