ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are automating the cleanup of an SPSS Statistics Output
   Viewer file via Python scripting.  You are specifically trying
   to change the Print Options for the Output Viewer page as a
   whole by automating the   SetPrintOptions methods.
   
   You note that the orientation methods successfully changes the
   Page from Portrait to Landscape.  But the other methods (for
   setting page margins) seem never to take effect.
