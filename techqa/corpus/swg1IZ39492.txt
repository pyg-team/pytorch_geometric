APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The documentation for the Agents need to be very specific as to
   what libraries and versions are needed.  For example, the Linux
   agent just says:
   
   "Linux versions require some compatibility libs to be installed
   for the agent to work correctly. The latest versions of
   libstdc++,libgcc, compat-libstdc++, and libXp are required for
   the agent to work correctly".
   
   Specific information needs to be documented in the Setup and
   Installation Guide.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The documentation for the Agents need to be very specific as to
   what libraries and versions are needed.  For example, the Linux
   agent just says:
   
   "Linux versions require some compatibility libs to be installed
   for the agent to work correctly. The latest versions of
   libstdc++,libgcc, compat-libstdc++, and libXp are required for
   the agent to work correctly".
   
   Specific information needs to be documented.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A table has been added to Chapter 2 of the 6.2.2 Linux OS Agent
   documentation that specifies the exact version of Linux
   libraries required.
