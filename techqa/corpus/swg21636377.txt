Title: IBM Unable to start TSAM 7.2.2.1 Launchpad. - United States

Text:
launchpad; "No such file or directory"; "java class is not found"; "java class not found"; com.ibm.eec.launchpad.runtime.Launchpad TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error received starting launchpad:

cp: cannot stat `/7.2.2-TIV-TSAM-FP0001/TSAMBASE7221/launchpad/lib': No such file or directory 

The java class is not found: com.ibm.eec.launchpad.runtime.Launchpad 

SYMPTOM
When launching launchpad.sh, I get two lines of output and a window that pops up briefly: 
cp: cannot stat `/7.2.2-TIV-TSAM-FP0001/TSAMBASE7221/launchpad/lib': No
such file or directory 
The java class is not found: com.ibm.eec.launchpad.runtime.Launchpad 


CAUSE
You may see this problem if you are running FireFox 10+

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps to resolve the problem:

1.) Enable Firefox 10+ support:
Change ./launchpad/browser.sh by adding one line to accept Firefox 10. After this, the launchpad should start.

...
supportedFirefoxVersion()
{
case "$*" in
*Firefox\ 1-9.*) return 0;;
*Firefox/1-9.*) return 0;;
*Firefox\ [1-9][0-9].*) return 0;; #line added
*Firefox/[1-9][0-9].*) return 0;; #line added
*Firefox*) return 1;;
...

If the same problem affects the firststeps/firsteps.sh of your Process Server installation (it always asks to export BROWSER, even though you may have done it). For this you can make the same changes in firststeps/fbrowser.sh.

2.) Fix to get Firefox 15+ working:

a. Open the <launchpad_root_dir>/launchpad/preferences.sh file, and edit it to add the following line to the file (this line can be added anywhere in this file): 

echo 'user_pref("security.enablePrivilege.enable_for_tests", true);' >>$userprefpath/user.js 

b. Restart the launchpad.
