ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITM 6.2.2 CEC agent manual does not provide instructions
   under section for configuration on VIOS for need to
   setup keys for unprompted SSH communcation between CEC and
   HMC.
   
   Unprompted SSH communication is necessary for the CEC
   agent to be able to contact the HMC and get the list
   of LPARs to monitor.
   
   CEC agent on AIX LPAR utilizes "key.pl" script to
   create SSH keys and configure the communication.
   
   CEC agent on VIOS does not use the "key.pl" script
   or rely on key.pl_managedfile.
   The CEC agent on VIOS relies on the "cfgsvc" command
   to generate a pair of public and priviate keys, but
   it does not authorize the HMC to accept the
   public key.
   
   There are missing steps in the configuration that
   are necessary to explain how to create the keys, and
   how to import the key generated from the cfgsvc command
   to the HMC.  In ITM VIOS agent manual, this is done
   by running a command on the HMC:
     mkauthkeys --add
   
   The manual needs to include detailed steps to create
   and configure unprompted SSH for CEC on VIOS environments.
