APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enhancement:  Object Store Simple Search dialog should be able
   to show all object type properties in the Criteria dropdown
   list.
   
   For example, searching on DOCUMENT class, Version Series does
   not show up, along w/these other properties:
   
   Document Lifecycle Policy
   External Replica Identities
   Replication Group
   Security Folder
   Security Policy
   Storage Area
   Storage Policy
   This
   Version series
   
   FEM allows this.  FEM allows you to either type in a string of
   the ID of the object (e.g.
   {CF44C847-BEF1-4507-8A93-60D9B1B20B05}) or paste an object ref.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * ACCE users with CPE 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 or prior             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When using Object Store search in ACCE, users can't use      *
   * Object type of properties in the Criteria dropdown.          *
   * For example, when searching on DOCUMENT class, Version       *
   * Series does not show up, along w/these other properties such *
   * as Document Lifecycle Policy, External Replica Identities,   *
   * etc.                                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 or later.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This provides an enhancement in ACCE to allow users to search
   using Object type of Properties in the Criteria.
   For example, they can now search using ClassificationStatus,
   Cardinality, Settability, ProxyType,
   ReservationType, VersionSeries, VersionStatus, etc. as criteria.
   Fixed in 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 and higher.
