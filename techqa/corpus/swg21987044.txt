QUESTION
 Does the JazzSM/DASH Map widget handle MapInfo .tab data? 

CAUSE
The output of the MapInfo product is the .tab format, which is not currently supported by DASH Map widget.

ANSWER
The DASH map widget cannot consume the MapInfo .tab file directly. That .tab file is a proprietary format from the MapInfo product. The .tab data will need to be converted into a format that can be used with the Map services that the DASH Map widget supports, or export a supported formation from MapInfo. Supported Map services that DASH supports is Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreenMap.
