CAUSE
The MS 7.1.0.4 GUI installer does not support any WAS embedded installation/uninstallation.


ENVIRONMENT
Server with no WAS already installed on it



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If a user wants to use the MS GUI installer, WAS has to be installed before running MS installer. 


Supported WAS versions with MS 7.1.0.4 are 7.0 and above.

To install MS using WAS 8.x, the user has to download both IBM Installation Manager & WAS 8.x, perform IBM Installation Manager installation, then use the IBM Installation Manager to install WAS 8.x.

Silent embedded installation is supported for WAS 8.5.5, provided that users install IM first.
In any case, the MS installer cannot install IBM Installation Manager (IM), so even if a user wants to use the MS silent installer to install WAS 8.5.5, he/she has to install IBM IM first, then run IM to generate WAS silent installation response file.
The sample MS silent installation response files installation_image_directory/silent/MS_Sample.opt or MS.opt contain instructions of how to reference WAS silent installation response file.
Detailed information about how to create a WebSphere silent installation response file can be found in WebSphere documentation, e.g. for WAS 8.5.5 at: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.doc/ae/cins_WASv85_base_install_Win32.html [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.doc/ae/cins_WASv85_base_install_Win32.html]"

Silent WAS uninstallation from the MS uninstaller is not supported for any WAS version. If the user wants to uninstall WAS, he/she has to uninstall WAS manually himself/herself. To uninstall WAS, the user has to use IBM IM to do it.
