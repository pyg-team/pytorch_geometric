QUESTION
 If the UPDI install step fails when installing a fix pack for Tivoli Integrated Portal (e.g. step_00002_WebSphereUPDI) , where are the corresponding logs written to? 

ANSWER
Check the home directory for the installation user for a directory called "updilogs". Review these logs to determine the cause of the UPDI installation failure.
