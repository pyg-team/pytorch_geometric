Text:
Permission denied; unable to set access control list; clearviewtool/server_id_nt; Access is denied; out-of-synch; identity.sd; groups.sd; Failed to set identity on view: Permission denied.; Error: unable to set access control list; 1148681; clearviewtool/server_id_nt: Error: unable to set access control list; clearviewtool/view: Error: Failed to set identity on view: Permission denied; access denied/permission denied TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains why attempts to create a new IBM® Rational® ClearCase® view on Microsoft® Windows® fails with an access denied error. 

SYMPTOM
 

Attempts to create a view on Windows reports the error: 


clearviewtool/server_id_nt: Error: unable to set access control list for \\host\share\view.vws: Access is denied.
clearviewtool/server_id_nt: Error: protection on <path to .vws> is out-of-synch with identity.sd and groups.sd

clearviewtool/view: Error: Failed to set identity on view: Permission denied.

CAUSE
 

The cause of this problem relates to restrictive permissions on either the view share or directory to which the view is being created.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 


Permissions are too restrictive on one or both of the following:


 1. The root of the view storage drive (for example, C:\) has restrictive permissions.
    
    To resolve:  1. In Windows Explorer, right-click the root of the drive containing the view storage 
        
        
     2. Select Properties > Security tab
        
        
     3. Ensure that both the ClearCase user group and the clearcase_albd user have Full Control to this drive.
        
        
    
    
 2. The view storage share (for example, C:\ClearCase_Storage) has restrictive permissions. 
    
    To resolve:  1. In Windows Explorer, right-click the ClearCase_Storage Folder
        
        
     2. Select Properties > Sharing Tab
        
        
     3. Ensure that the "Share this folder" radio button is selected
        
        
     4. Click the permissions button and make sure that the ClearCase User group and the clearcase_albd user have full control to this Folder and its subdirectories. 
    
    


Refer to technote 1143292 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=984&uid=swg21143292] About ClearCase permissions on Windows for further details regarding ClearCase permission requirements on Windows hosts. 


Note: If you are uncertain of the names of the ClearCase User group and/or clearcase_albd user in either of the steps above, then set the permissions to: Everyone Full Control. This can be adjusted later once you have verified the problem has been resolved.
