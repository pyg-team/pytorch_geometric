   Short description
   ESR: Problems importing DOORS Requirements into Rhapsody
   We have 3 different packages that all have requirements being
   loaded from DOORS. Note that  each have 2 sets of requirements
   as well (i.e. 2 different modules in DOORS) for a total of 6
   different modules. Each of the sets are in separate packages.
   
   Other relevant information
    [Rhapsody Information]
   Version=7.2
   Build=958223
   Language=C++
   
   Edition=Development Edition
   [System Information]
   OS Version=Windows XP
   
   
   
   When trying to 'Add High Level Requirements' from inside of
   Gateway, if I load one package set it loads those requirements
   correctly, but marks all the other requirements in all the other
   packages as 'Deleted At High Level'. Note that I have to have
   all the other packages chekced out otherwise I get an error
   during the 'Add High Level Requirements' process. Note that this
   all worked in the 7.1 MR1 Version. This is the first time we
   have tried to update requiremetns since converting to 7.2.
   
   
   Keeping the non-updated packages unloaded and loading only
   the package that is desired to update will work and not mark
   the other packages for deletion. What will also work is updating
   all the Packages at once.
   
   Gateway apparently assumes that unchecked requirements and optio
   ns are to be discarded. This is believed to have been caused by
   synchronization issues with Gateway and Doors. This issue has
   also been reported in Quintus under 108519 and 107386.
   Development is aware of the issue and is working hard for a fix
   for the Rhapsody 7.5 release.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Keeping the non desired packages unloaded and loading only the
   package that is desired to update will work and not mark
   the other packages for deletion. What will also work is updating
   all the Packages at once.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Add High Level Requirements option in Gateway creates Delete
   Tag
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 7.5.1.1
