APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At some point in the recent past, perhaps as far back as the
   Mozilla Firefox Extended Service Release (ESR) v42,
   the Tivoli Monitoring 6.3.x Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP)
   browser client stopped functioning when launched using the
   Firefox browser from a Windows OS client.
   
   
   
   Four separate symptoms have been observed during attempts to
   reproduce the problem:
   
   1. TEP applet will not launch at all; no deployment of the
   applet by the browser occurs.
   
   2. TEP applet will launch, but would then crash; a message
   reporting that the Java deployment toolkit had failed is
   displayed.
   
   3. TEP applet will launch, and the logon dialog will appear;
   however, after entering valid credentials, the applet would
   continually restart itself, and the first workspace would never
   be rendered.
   
   4. TEP applet will launch, and first workspace will render
   successfully; however, after just a few attempts to switch to
   other workspaces from the navigator, the content area would
   disappear, and only the applet's top banner frame would display.
   
   
   The test environment used to reproduce these issues was the
   following:
   
   
   TEPS: ITM 6.3FP6 GA level on Linux server
   TEP: ITM 6.3FP6 GA level
   Browser:  32-bit Firefox ESR v45.3.0 on Windows 7 laptop (IBM
   Edition - Windows 7 64-bit v1.14.00.AM B17)
   Java: Eight different 32-bit versions were tested:
    IBM:  7.0.9.40, 7.0.9.50, 7.1.3.10 (currently shipping with
   ITM), 7.1.3.50, 8.0.3.11
    Oracle: 7u80, 7u111, 8u101
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  At some point in the recent past, perhaps as far back as the
   Mozilla Firefox Extended Service Release (ESR) v42, the Tivoli
   Monitoring 6.3.x Tivoli Enterprise Portal browser client stopped
    functioning when launched using the Firefox browser from a
   Windows OS client.
   
   
   The Tivoli Monitoring 6.3.x Tivoli Enterprise Portal browser
   client stopped functioning when launched using the Firefox
   browser from a Windows OS client.
   
   The following behaviors have been observed:
   
   1.  Tivoli Enterprise Portal applet will not launch at all; no
   deployment of the applet by the browser occurs.
   
   2.  Tivoli Enterprise Portal applet will launch, but will then
   crash; a message reporting that the Java deployment toolkit had
   failed is displayed.
   
   3.  Tivoli Enterprise Portal applet will launch, and the logon
   dialog will appear; however, after entering valid user
   credentials, the applet will repeatedly restart itself, and the
   first workspace will never be rendered.
   
   4.  Tivoli Enterprise Portal applet will launch, and first
   workspace will render successfully; however, after just a few
   attempts to switch to other workspaces from the navigator view,
   the content area will disappear, and only the applet's top
   banner frame will be displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The APAR fix involved an update to the primary applet.html file
   associated with the Tivoli Enterprise Portal browser component.
    A change was made to adjust for various race conditions and
   timing issues associated with applet instance management under
   the Firefox browser.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
