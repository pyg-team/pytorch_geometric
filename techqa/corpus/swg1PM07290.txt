APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Out of Memory on TEMA occurs and is triggered when the
   Historical Collection is enabled.
   
   Scenarioo:  A TEMA with more than 1 subnode (ie. DC) has history
   set for any table.  Only the first subnode will return
   historical data but all the subnodes will be collectin it.
   The samples will keep accumulating on the other subnodes that
   don't return historical data until the TEMA evenutally gets an
   Out of Memory condition.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable historical collection for the Attribute Group
   "Allocation Failures"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description:
   With 2 or more DCs connected TEMA have significant memory leak.
   Also history data is completely incorrect on all server nodes
   except an one.
   
   Problem Summary:
   History is not passed to TEMS from all server nodes except one.
   This have two impacts:
   1) History workspaces on these nodes contain garbaged data;
   2) Internal history samples constantly grow in size which seems
   like memory leak. This is particulary true for
   AllocationFailures or GCCycles tables
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Internal history handling is modified to not lose history
   request flag after a first node processing.
