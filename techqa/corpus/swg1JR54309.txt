APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you start a IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) deployment
   environment (DE) by using the BPMConfig -start command and the
   following conditions are true
   -You use a configuration properties file as the argument for the
   BPMConfig -start command instead of the profile name and DE name
   -A node agent of the DE is on the same machine where you run the
   BPMConfig -start command and the node agent has a SOAP port
   other than the default 8878
   -There is another DE configured and it also has a local node
   agent
   -The other DE's local node agent has the default SOAP port 8878
   assigned,and it is running
   you receive a message stating that the certificate must be
   imported from the other WebSphere cell. If you select yes or no
   twice, the node agent starts.
   
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Select Yes to import the certificate.
   Or, ensure that there is not a different node agent running at
   8878 while using this command.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The certificate prompt appears because BPMConfig -start uses the
    default SOAP port to determine whether the node agent is
   already running if you specify a configuration properties file
   on the command line instead of the profile name and DE name. It
   then incorrectly connects to the running node agent of the other
    DE which has the default SOAP port 8878 assigned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available in an IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 cumulative fix 2 that
   allows the BPMConfig -start to read the SOAP port that  the
   local node agent's profile uses instead of the default SOAP port
    number.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Before you run the BPMConfig -start command, shut down the other
    DE's local node agent.
