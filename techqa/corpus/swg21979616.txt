DSM SQLCODE=-206 T1.TOTAL_RQST_TIME TOTAL_ROLLBACK_PROC_TIME SQL0206 migration HealthSnapshotLogger TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is Data Server Manager (DSM) showing the following error in HealthSnapshotLogger file, after installing/migrating DSM to a newer version:
"T1.TOTAL_RQST_TIME" is not valid in the context where it is used.. SQLCODE=-206, SQLSTATE=42703, DRIVER=3.69.56 

CAUSE
Two new columns have been added to the IBMOTS.WORKLOAD_STATS table in DSM Repository Database after V1.1.2.1:
- TOTAL_ROLLBACK_PROC_TIME bigint"
- TOTAL_RQST_TIME bigint"

For some reason the migration process did not update the table successfully.


ANSWER
To fix the issue, stop DSM, connect to the DSM Repository Database using the DSM instance owner, and run the following DB2 commands: 

- db2 "alter table IBMOTS.WORKLOAD_STATS add column TOTAL_ROLLBACK_PROC_TIME bigint"
- db2 "alter table IBMOTS.WORKLOAD_STATS add column TOTAL_RQST_TIME bigint"

Restart DSM.
