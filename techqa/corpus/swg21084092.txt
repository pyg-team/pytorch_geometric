Title: IBM ICM attributes: Error DGL5390A minimum string length violation despite actual min constraint - United States

Text:
5390; DGL5390A; varchar; min; length; PLSUtilICM.checkAttributes(); check attributes; minimum; Varchar; String TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 My attribute defined in my item type or component type has a minimum string length constraint set lower or equal to my value, but I still get Error "DGL5390A: Attribute named 'myAttribute' contains a string of length 'actual string length', which violates the minimum required length of 'some value' specified in the attribute definition." from my VARCHAR attribute. What can I do? 

ANSWER
Variable length character strings (VARCHAR) 

Minimum and maximum VARCHAR string lengths are enforced based on the original attribute definitions that were defined before the item type that uses it was defined. 

Adjustments to the minimum and maximum properties for attributes added to item type and component type definitions for variable length strings (VARCHAR) are not enforced. Only the original minimum and maximum are enforced based on the original attribute definition. 

Adjustments will appear in retrieved item type and component type definitions, but not in item type view or component type view definitions. 

Short and Integer types 

Short and Integer attributes are not affected.
