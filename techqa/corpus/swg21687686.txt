PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) is configured for build triggers in a z/OS environment in case of duplicate copybooks with identical names. 

CAUSE
The reason for this set up is that both the baseline copybooks 
PDS as well as the copybooks under development are in the 
SYSLIB search. 

There are two copybooks with the same name in the same stream. These copybooks are associated with two different language definitions and are loaded to different data set definitions. Changes to either one of these copybooks should trigger rebuilding of the COBOL file.

Although this scenario is unsupported, there is a workaround using two translators.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WORKAROUND 

 1. Create another no-op translator (for example, IEFBR14) that has the 
    SYSLIB pointing to one of the copybooks
    
    
 2. Add this no-op translator to the same language definition
    
    
 3. Modify the dependency type of the scanner in this language definition to include both translators
    
    
 4. Do a rebuild of the COBOL file and verify that the 
    buildmap of this COBOL file contains two dependencies. That way, if one of these two dependencies is modified, then the COBOL file gets rebuilt.
    
    Note that getting the right copybook to compile with the COBOL file is the user's or administrator's responsibility, as this action goes beyond normal dependency build.
