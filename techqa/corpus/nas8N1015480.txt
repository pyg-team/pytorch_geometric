PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document provides information about configuring file access security for IBM WebSphere Application Server users on the IBM i OS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If a group of developers or users needs access to specific IBM WebSphere files, a combination of IBM i OS security and Java security can be used. This is particularly helpful when the files in question are log files that get re-created or "rolled over" by WebSphere. 

Note: When log files get re-created or rolled over, they will not have any individual authorities that were manually added to the previous file.

Example: A group of developers need continuous access to the WebSphere log files, but they do not need access to the rest of the WebSphere directory structure.

Do the following to accomplish this task: 

1. Create a new user profile with the authorities that are needed by the users, for example, WASUSRS. 2. Give this user profile *RWX authority to the /QIBM/UserData/WebSphere/AppServer/<version>/<edition>/profiles/<profileName>/logs folder and any subfolders under the logs directory. 3. Add this user profile as the group profile to all of the developers' user profiles that need access. For example, to add the group profile WASUSRS to a developer's user profile called DEV1, type the following on the IBM i OS command line:

CHGUSRPRF USRPRF(DEV1) GRPPRF(WASUSRS)

Press the Enter key. 4. Add the following property to the command line arguments in the WebSphere administrative console:

Server -> Server Types -> Application Servers > server name > Server and Process Management -> Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic JVM Arguments > -Dos400.file.create.auth=RWX 5. Restart the WebSphere instance.
