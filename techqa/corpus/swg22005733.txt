QUESTION
 When designing a custom panel in Datacap Navigator, how do I increase the height of a text or comment field to allow for multiple lines of input 

ANSWER
In Datacap Navigator v9.1.1, a new feature was added to support inputting multiple lines of text in a text or comment field when using custom panels. With this new feature, a new "Editor" field options has been added with a "Datacap text area" selection. When launching the Verify task, the field will be displayed in the "Datacap text area" where multiple lines of text can be added and the height will be adjusted automatically. 

Usage : 
1. In Datacap custom panel design, set the field to Datacap text area, and set the width as needed. 
2. When launching Verity task, the field will be shown with a Datacap text area editor. 
3. Multiple lines are shown in the editor, and users could press the enter key to add a new line 
4. The height of this editor is auto sized. After a new line is added, its height will be enlarged for this new line.
