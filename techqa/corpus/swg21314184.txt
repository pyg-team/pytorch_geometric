Title: IBM Run osgiCfgInit.sh to update osgi plugins - United States

Text:
CAMADALL CAMADWASZDC OSGI osgiCfgInit.sh Plugin DC install "Data Collector" TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data Collector is installed but is not running. 

CAUSE
The Data Collector configuration is incomplete. Plugins have not been refreshed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The osgicfginit.sh script should be run under the covers when setupwas.sh is run. It only needs to be run one time, during configuration. The osgiCfgInit.sh script is a WebSphere-supplied script that is used to update the osgi plugins. When applying maintenance to an ITCAM Data Collector on a WAS 6.1 server, you should always run the setupwas.sh script with the -plugins option. This will NOT reconfigure the DC but simply copy any updated jar files to the WAS plugins directory and run the WAS osgiCfgInit.sh script. 

Example : 
cd /usr/lpp/itcam/WebSphere/DC/bin 
./setupwas.sh -plugins

Alternately, you can run the osgiCfgInit.sh script after setupwas.sh completes.
