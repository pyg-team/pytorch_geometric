Title: IBM What is the purpose of RUNMQTRM QPRINT file - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the WebSphere MQ trigger monitor is started, using the STRMQMTRM command, it generates a QPRINT spoolfile for the QMQM user profile. 

1. Why is the file generated? 
2. What is the purpose of this file? 
3. Is there a way to prevent this file from being generated?

The contents of the file are usually comprised of text similar to following: 
5724-H72 (C) Copyright IBM Corp. 1994, 2014. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The QPRINT spool file generated when the trigger monitor is started is used to display copyright information, which is as per design. The copyright info cannot viewed until the trigger monitor is ended. You can have it deleted once the RUNMQTRM job ends by setting the environment variable as follows: 

 ADDENVVAR ENVVAR(QIBM_MQS_DONT_USE_STDERR) LEVEL(*JOB) 

 
Note: It is strongly recommended for you to change this variable at a *JOB level instead of a *SYSTEM level because it will affect other WebSphere MQ jobs. The command should be performed prior to issuing the STRMQMTRM command. 

 
Note: You will still see the QPRINT file while the RUNMQTRM job is active, but it will be deleted once the RUNMQTRM job ends.
