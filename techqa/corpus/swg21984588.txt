Title: IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 FAILS TO INSTALL ON CERTAIN IBM PURE APPLICATION SYSTEM LEVELS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users observe errors when attempting to install or migrate to IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 using IBM Pure Application System. 

SYMPTOM
Users observe errors when attempting to install or migrate to IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 using the following levels of IBM Pure Application System: 

 * 2.1.2.0 
 * 2.2.0.0 and later



This affects users with IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier. 
CAUSE
Because of an interface change in IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, and in 2.2.0.0 and greater, installation and upgrade of IBM MQ at the latest maintenance level contained in the pattern-type fails. The installation appears to succeed, but IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 is installed and the subsequent fixpack update is not applied. This affects IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier, leading to the following restrictions: 

 * For IBM Pure Application System releases earlier than 2.1.2.0 and at version 2.1.2.1, you can install all versions of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. You can also apply maintenance to running pattern instances. 
 * For IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and later, you can install IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 only. You cannot install later versions e.g., 8.0.0.4. You cannot apply maintenance to running pattern instances.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A new maintenance.py lifecycle script is available to enable installation and migration of the latest maintenance level of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. 


This update, and installation steps, can be obtained from IBM Fix Central:

APAR IT15252 has been raised for the IBM MQ development team to address this issue within future releases of the IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-type.
