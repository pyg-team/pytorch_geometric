CAUSE
 

The most likely cause is that the user had dragged the file name column to the side so as to hide it since this can not be done from the tools menu for this column.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

The solution is to drag the column back out from the side, however, it HAS to be done from the "column heading" row in the pane, such as where the column headers "size", "modified", and "version" are displayed otherwise the pane to the left is resized. 

In the example below we are expanding the Name column by moving the bar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21313289&amp;aid=2] to the right.
