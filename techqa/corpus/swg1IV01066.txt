APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a network outage occurs, the primary cluster member is
   ejecting the secondary from the cluster when it fails to reach
   it with a ping.  After this, it never recommences to ping the
   secondary.
   
   This results in an endless loop of messages like this in the
   secondary netcool.log
   DEBUG [ClusterMember] Did not receive a
   ping...
   Checking to become primary
   
   In each case the secondary is able to contact the nameserver and
   reestablish itself but only until the next ping timeout.
   
   The problem appears to be because the exception being through at
   the network outage is not a regular NetcoolTimeoutException.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The cluster actually continues to perform, but in order to stop
   the messages occuring, a restart of the primary or failover
   would be necessary.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PRIMARY CLUSTER MEMBER STOPS PINGING CLUSTER MEMBER AND NEVER
   RESTARTS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The secondary will not add itself back to the primary cluster
   and fails to connect.
   This APAR is addressed in the following maintenance code:
   5.1.0.1-TIV-NCI-IF0006
