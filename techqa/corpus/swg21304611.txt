Title: IBM WMQ AMQ6175 LOAD ERROR MAGIC NUMBER INVALID PERMISSIONS - United States

Text:
AMQ7626 AMQ6175 error 8 magic number load XA libclntsh.a libclntsh mqminfo TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you migrate WebSphere MQ (WMQ) to a newer version, you get AMQ6175 and AMQ7626 errors when starting your queue manager. 

SYMPTOM
AMQ7626: XA resource manager initialization failure. Refer to the error log for more information

AMQ6175: The system could not dynamically load the shared library '/var/mqm/xa/oraswit'. The system returned error number '8' and error message 
'0509-022 Module /var/mqm/xa/oraswit cannot be loaded. 
0509-150 Dependant module /u00/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/lib32/libclntsh.a(shr.o) cannot be loaded. 
0509-103 The modular magic number is invalid. 
0509-022 Module /var/mqm/xa/oraswit cannot be loaded. 
0509-150 Dependant module /var/mqm/xa/oraswit cannot be loaded.'. 

AMQ7622: WebSphere MQ could not load the XA switch load file for resource manager 'OracleRFT'. 
EXPLANATION: An error has occurred loading XA switch file /var/mqm/xa/oraswit. If the error occurred during startup then the queue manager will terminate. At all other times the queue manager will continue without this resource manager meaning that it will no longer be able to participate in global transactions. The queue manager will also retry the load of the switch file at regular intervals so that the resource manager will be able to participate again should the load problem be resolved.


CAUSE
This problem is due to lack of read permissions on /u00/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/lib/libclntsh.a. 

ls -la /u00/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/lib
-rw-r----- 1 oraadmin oinstall 15524370 Feb 22 12:52 libclntsh.a 

ls -la /u00/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/lib32
-rw-r--r-- 1 oraadmin oinstall 13645392 Feb 22 12:52 libclntsh.a 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As noted above, read permission was lost on /u00/app/oracle/product/9.2.0/lib 

Change group permission flag of this library to give read permission in order to fix this problem.
