QUESTION
 What is included in the encrypted and temporary directories in the 9235/9004 and 7199/7198 IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances? 

ANSWER
The IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance file system is split into several sections when viewing the "show filesystem" CLI command or Status -> Filesystem Information in the WebGUI:
Encrypted space, Temporary space and Internal space.

 * Temporary and Internal Space
   The "temporary" and "internal" space are not persisted storage and the files will be lost if the appliance is rebooted or powered down but will not be cleared if use the "Reload" option.
   
   The temporary space includes these user accessible directories: temporary, image, export and logtemp 
   The internal space is not accessible by the user.
   
   Both the "temporary" and "internal" space are also used for various processing actions during operation.


NOTES: 
1) It is not possible to account for all the space displayed in the "show filesystem" output by adding the file sizes as there are internal files as well as the "rollback image" that are not visible to the user. 

2) In the M/T 7199 and 7198 the "temporary" and "internal" space listed in the "show filesystem" output will vary by firmware release. This is due to how the available memory is utilized in each release.
