LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Summary: LibraryDeleteModule fails with
   PathNotFoundException if run with incomplete library
   
   Detailed Problem Description:
   
   If the LibraryDeleteModule does not run to completion when
   attempting to delete a library, subsequent attempts to delete
   the library fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Analysis:
   
   When the LibraryDeletionModule does not run to completion a
   library can be left in an unexpected state where some of the
   default folders are deleted and others are not.  This failure
   could be caused by an unexpected exception in the
   LibraryDeleteModule, or by an external event like a power outage
   or Portal being stopped or restarted while the module is
   running.  Once the library is in this state, LibraryDeleteModule
   will fail because it can not find all of the expected folders.
   
   
   Failing Module: WCM - Web Content Management (General)
   
   Problem Solution:
   
   Change LIbraryDeleteModule so that it will correctly handle any
   case where a folder can not be found.  Since the library is
   being deleted, missing folders should not cause a problem.
