APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XA transactions generated by WebSphere Application Server can be
   handled slowly by the IBM MQ queue manager.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM MQ queue managers that participate in XA
   transactions managed by WebSphere Application Server.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX, HP-UX Itanium, Linux on Power, Linux on S390, Linux on x86,
   Linux on x86-64, Solaris SPARC, Linux on zSeries, Solaris
   x86-64, Windows, HP-UX PA-RISC
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   IBM MQ uses a hashing algorithm to reduce the length of lists of
   transactions within the queue manager. The algorithm was not
   adequate to deal with the XIDs generated by WebSphere
   Application Server. The hashing algorithm did not distinguish
   adequately between these XIDs, so they all appeared in the same
   list as all other WAS-originated XIDs. Lookups within this list
   became relatively slow, leading to slow queue manager
   performance for operations on transactions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The algorithm has been changed to deal successfully with the
   XIDs generated by WebSphere Application Server, to improve the
   performance of these transactions.
