APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) user is a member of a
   group that has double slashes in the group name, an exception is
    logged by the server. No function is lost and the user does not
    see an error in IBM Process Portal.
   
   The Invalid Channel exception is logged in the server log files:
   
   E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError
   SRVE0293E: [Servlet Error]-[SocialBusServiceServlet]:
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid channel

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Process Portal does not parse group names correctly when the
   group names contain double slashes. As a result, these group
   names aren't passed to the collaboration processing code on the
   server and the exception appears in the server log files.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.1 that can process group
   names containing double slashes.
