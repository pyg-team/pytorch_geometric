ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We need to update the IC with the steps to change the ldap
   binding user password:
   
   ...................................
    The default binding user for ITDS is cn=root; for MSAD is
   administrator (On the customer's system,  wasadmin is used). If
   the
   customer changed the password for this binding user, he also
   needs to do
   the following:
   
   1. %TIO_HOME%/tools/encrypt.cmd <new password>
   
   2. replace bindingPassword in %TIO_HOME%/config/user-factory.xml
   with
   the output of 1
   
       <bindingPassword>Your new encrypted
   password</bindingPassword>
   
   3. restart TPM
   .................................
   
   We probably need to add these additional steps the
   customer discovered as well:
   
   ................................
   Updating the user-factory.xml file with encrypted binding user
   password
   solved the problem.
   However, changing the maxadmin and wasadmin LDAP password
   involved the
   following steps on the TPM server.
   ***
   1. Because wasadmin in this case is also the LDAP binding user,
   we also
   had to update the binding user password in the WAS Admin
   Console:
   Login https://tpmserver:9043/ibm/console [https://tpmserver:9043/ibm/console]
   Click secure administration --> Federated repositories -->
   Repository
   reference --> ISMMSAD
   Update Bind password.
   The best way is probably to login to WAS Admin Console and leave
   the
   session open before changing the bind password in LDAP,
   otherwise you
   are unable to login to WAS Admin Console anymore.
   The change the password in LDAP and immediately update the bind
   password in the still open WAS Admin Console.
   ***
   2. Change wasadmin password in casprofile https://tpmserver: [https://tpmserver:]
   21003/ibm/console
   Login with old wasadmin password.
   Click Users and Groups --> Manage Users
   Click search
   Select wasadmin and update new password.
   Restart casprofile
   .
   This step is necessary because otherwise the tio.cmd stop fails
   with
   the following error:
   ADMU0128I: Starting tool with the casprofile profile
   ADMU3100I: Reading configuration for server: server1
   ADMU0111E: Program exiting with error: javax.management.
   JMRuntimeException:
              ADMN0022E: Access is denied for the stop operation on
   Server
   MBean
              because of insufficient or empty credentials.
   ADMU4113E: Verify that username and password information is
   correct.  If
              running tool from the command line, pass in the
   correct -
   username
              and -password.  Alternatively, update the
   <conntype>.client.
   props
              file.
   .
   Note: this command failed to run.
   changePassword.cmd -c wasadmin -n new_wasadmin_pwd -u wasadmin
   -p
   new_wasadmin_pwd
   2009-10-14 09:51:06,634 INFO  COPCOM447I The password for

   2009-10-14 09:51:40,087 ERROR COPCOM451E The system failed to
   update
   the password for wasadmin.
   ***
   3. Run command changePassword to update new maxadmin password.
   changePassword.cmd -c tpmuiadm -n new_maxadmin_pwd -u wasadmin
   -p
   wasadmin_pwd
   2009-10-19 15:44:21,674 INFO  COPCOM447I The password for
   tpmuiadm will
   be changed.
   2009-10-19 15:44:26,107 INFO  Start updating the password
   credentials
   for CDS file repository...
   2009-10-19 15:44:34,930 INFO  Password credentials for CDS file
   repository updated successfully.
   2009-10-19 15:44:34,932 INFO  COPCOM448I The password for
   tpmuiadm was
   successfully changed.
   .
   We perhaps also need to update the reporttools.properties file
   with the
   new maxadmin password in order to import inventory extenstion
   reports,
   but I have not verified this.
   This step is described in the post-installation chapter in the
   TPM 711
   Installation Guide pdf-document (right after Backup Admin
   Workstation),
   but this step is missing in the online Info Center.
