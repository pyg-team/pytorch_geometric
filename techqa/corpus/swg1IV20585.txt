APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The BPC Explorer fails to validate messages if Java2Security is
   turned on under some circumstances.
   
   The problem occurs if the message is invalid and the diagnostics
   need to be rendered in the BPC Explorer and it only occurs if
   restrictions for the used data types are violated.
   
   For example, if a field requires a enumeration type but the
   entered string does not belong to the enumeration.
   
   This fix makes sure that the libraries used for rendering the
   diagnostics are accessible with Java2Security for the BPC
   Explorer.
