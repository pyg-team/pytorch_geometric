APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WebSphere MQ V7.5 resource adapter has been deployed into an
   application server. An application running inside the
   application server is performing outbound messaging, and calls
   either the method QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection() or
   the method QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection(String
   username, String password) . The method fails with a
   JMSException containing the message:
   
   MQJCA1026: An operation on a domain specific object was not
   valid
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The WebSphere MQ V7.5 Resource Adapter.
   - The WebSphere MQ V8.0 Resource Adapter.
   
   who have applications that perform outbound messaging and call
   the methods shown below:
   
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The JMS Specification defines three types of ConnectionFactory
   objects:
   
   - QueueConnectionFactory
   - TopicConnectionFactory
   - ConnectionFactory
   
   QueueConnectionFactories should be used by JMS applications that
   want to perform point-to-point messaging and
   TopicConnectionFactories are used by applications that want to
   do publish/subscribe messaging. The ConnectionFactory object
   (also known as a "unified ConnectionFactory") can be used by
   applications that perform either point-to-point or
   publish/subscribe messaging.
   
   To create a JMS Connection from these objects, applications can
   call one of the following methods:
   
   - ConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - ConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection()
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection(String, String)
   
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   - TopiconnectionFactory.createTopicConnection()
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection(String, String)
   
   The methods:
   
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   
   appear on the QueueConnectionFactory and TopicConnectionFactory
   objects as both of these objects inherit the method from the
   Connection object (which is their parent).
   
   
   As the JMS Specification did not define what the behaviour
   should be when one of the four methods shown above were called,
   the WebSphere MQ V7.5 and V8.0 Resource Adapters contained logic
   that prevented applications that were performing outbound
   messaging from calling them. If an application attempted to call
   one of these methods, a JMSException containing the message:
   
   MQJCA1026: An operation on a domain specific object was not
   valid
   
   was generated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ V7.5 and V8.0 Resource Adapters have been
   modified to no longer throw a JMSException if an application
   calls one of the methods shown below:
   
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - QueueConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection()
   - TopicConnectionFactory.createConnection(String, String)
