APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM SPSS Modeler stream contains a XML EXPORT node which writes
   to the local file system of SPSS Modeler Desktop/Server. When
   saving this stream to the C&DS repository, an error message is
   displayed:
   ==========================================
   Error = "Output file node <filename>.xml is missing a file
   format.".
   ==========================================
   
   When you switch to the Data Files tab of the Modeler job-step,
   you notice that the Format column is empty.
   
   Clicking the drop-down within the Format cell and selecting
   either Formatted (tab) or Data (comma delimited)(dat) will allow
   you to save the job.
   
   Please note that even though you are selecting (tab) or (dat),
   the file exported by the XML EXPORT node will still retain the
   (xml) file extension.
   
   Have reviewed cds.log and observed the following error (full log
   is attached):
   14:19:18,773 ERROR [FileSystemOutputNode] Exception caught: The
   property 'delimit_mode' is undefined
   
   
   No message was captured in the spssemgr.log of the Deployment
   Manager client application.
   
   This issue was first reported on Modeler 17.0-FP1 + C&DS 7.0 but
   can also be replicated on Modeler 18.0 + C&DS 8.0.
   
   Expectation is that when the stream is uploaded to the C&DS
   repository, the Modeler Adapters would configure the file format
   of the Data File to use the XML format automatically without any
   user intervention.
   
   If user intervention was required, could the File Format include
   the XML file type as an option or is it always going to require
   (tab) or (dat) even though this extension is not retained when
   the job-step is executed?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Clicking the drop-down within the Format cell and selecting
   either Formatted (tab) or Data (comma delimited)(dat) will allow
   you to save the job.
