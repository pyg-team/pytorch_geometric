ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Extended Oracle Database Agent in Oracle RAC DB env
   with PFILE configured
   
   If the monitoring Oracle RAC DB is started with PFILE, the
   RDB_Active_Instance attribute group returns one record -
   Instance Name is '*', and Status is 'INACTIVE',
   it triggers false alert about Inactive Oracle Instance Status.

   4) The product pre-defined situation KRZ_RDB_Inst_InActive_Crit
      or other customer defined situations on 'INACTIVE' Oracle
      Instance Status raise false alert
