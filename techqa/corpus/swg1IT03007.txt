APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Occasionally the virtual system manager JVM on the
   PureSystems Manager stops abruptly and causes Workload
   Console outages lasting from 5 to 10 minutes.
   One or both of these events may also appear in the events log:
   Message key: CWZIP6078W()
   Event text: CWZIP6078W The management node is not healthy on
   high availability.
   Source: PureSystems Manager SN#XXXXXXXX
   Message key: CWZIP9602W("Service10","tsaXXXXXXX")
   Event text: CWZIP9602W The state of Service10 is failed offline
   at node tsaXXXXXX.
   Source: TSA Node tsaXXXXXXX
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workload console will automatically recover after 5 to 10
   minutes
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A method that was designed to kill a specific process was not
   filtering process IDs correctly and killing the wrong process
   ID.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been updated to pass in a match string to identify
   the correct process ID before killing it.
