PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to import a FlexLM licesnse key in IBM Rational License Key Administrator for an IBM Rational Software Delivery Platform (SDP) product results in the error "At least one of the licenses in the file being imported is invalid. Would you like to import these Floating Licenses? " 

SYMPTOM
Error when trying to import a FLEXlm license key for a Rational SDP product in the License Key Administrator. 

The error message in the Confirm Import window is as follows.


At least one of the licenses in the file being imported is invalid. Would you like to import these Floating Licenses? 



 * The product is the SDP product, for example Rational ibmrpt. 
   
   
 * The License Type is Floating.
   
   
 * The License Term is Invalid. 
   
   
 * The Quantity is Unknown. 
   
   
 * The Expiration is Unknown.
   

Importing the license fails. 
CAUSE
A known cause is that you do not have the correct version of the IBM Rational License Server installed. 
Required versions of the IBM Rational License (Key) Server are as follows.


 * For Microsoft Windows: version 7.0.1 or later.
   
   
 * For UNIX and Linux: version 7.0.0.1 or later
   


Only these versions contain the ibmratl daemon process. This process is required for the SDP version 7.x products. Without this daemon process the license file seems to be invalid. Note: As of Rational License Key Server v8.1 the ibmratl vendor daemon has become the sole vendor daemon which however is able to authenticate features previously served by the other vendor daemons. The IBM Rational License Key Server v8.x is backward compatible.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Procedure: 

 1. Verify the version of the License Server. 
    Click Start > (All) Programs > IBM Rational > Rational Software Installed Product Information.
    
    
 2. Update the License Server if necessary.
