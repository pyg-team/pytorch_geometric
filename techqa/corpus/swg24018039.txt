ABSTRACT
 SupportPac CS04 provides a Java program and associated artifacts to display and change some of the values in a CICS TS V3.2, V4.1, V4.2, or V5.1 WSBind file from a z/OS batch job. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac was updated on 4 May 2011. See details of version 1.0.3 and upgrade to this new version as soon as you can to take advantage of the latest updates.

The purpose of SupportPac CS04 is to provide a way for you (using CICS TS V3.2, V4.x, or V5.1) to display and change WSBind file contents using z/OS batch jobs. The Java program included with this SupportPac provides a z/OS batch interface to the Java WSBind file support classes supplied with CICS TS V3.2, V4.1, V4.2, or V5.1. The CICS-supplied Java classes read, modify, and write the WSBind file values.


With this SupportPac, JCL, PROC, script, and a Java program are provided. In order to instruct the supplied Java program what to do, control statements must be written. These control statements must then be included with the supplied JCL which executes the PROC, script, and Java program. In addition to the control statements, one or more WSBind files will be required as input. Upon execution, the actions taken by the Java program will then be listed in the Job output. Additionally, depending on the control statements, the Java program can produce updated WSBind file(s).

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24018039&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24018039&aid=1]

Batch control statements (control cards) are available to: 

 * Display the characteristics of an individual WSBind file 
 * Display the characteristics of all WSBind files in a specified directory 
 * Display the characteristics of all WSBind files in the specified directory and every subordinate directory 
 * Change some of the characteristics of individual WSBind files


Lists of all values that can be changed in a WSBind file are shown below, where the amount of information that can be displayed, and the values that can be changed depend on your CICS version and the mapping level of the WSBind file. Error messages are provided by the SupportPac if, for example, you ask for a value change that is not permitted by your CICS version or the WSBind file's mapping level. 

For a Provider WSBind file, the following values may be changed:  * URI 
 * Target Program Name 
 * Transaction Id 
 * User Id 
 * Request Channel Name 
 * Request Channel File Name 
 * Response Channel Name 
 * Response Channel File Name 
 * Sync On Return 
 * WSDL File Name 
 * WSDL 2.0 File Name 
 * Vendor Converter Program Name


For a Requester WSBind file, the following values may be changed:  * Endpoint URI 
 * Request Channel Name 
 * Request Channel File Name 
 * Response Channel Name 
 * Response Channel File Name 
 * Vendor Converter Program Name 


What's New in version 1.0.3?  * Updated to support CICS TS V4.2 
 * Fixed various typos found in documentation and messages 
 * Provided better error diagnostic messages 
 * Removed requirement to use deprecated methods when using the CICS TS V4.2-supplied WSBind file support classes


Possible uses 
This SupportPac can be used to provide a way for CICS customers (CICS TS V3.2, V4.x, or V5.1) to display and change WSBind file contents using z/OS batch jobs. 

Skill level required 
Some knowledge of the purpose and content of a WSBind file is required. Scripts and (or) JCL will need to be modified. Knowledge of invoking scripts, submitting JCL, and looking at job output is required.

PREREQUISITES
The Java program supplied with this SupportPac requires Java SDK 1.4.2 or higher. Additionally, this SupportPac uses Java classes supplied with CICS TS V3.2 (CICS TS V4.x or V5.1) so any restrictions that apply to those classes (e.g. required Java level) also apply to this SupportPac. Since this SupportPac uses CICS TS V3.2 (CICS TS V4.x or V5.1) supplied Java classes, you will need to have access to a CICS TS V3.2 (CICS TS V4.x or V5.1) installation, and will need appropriate CICS licensing.
