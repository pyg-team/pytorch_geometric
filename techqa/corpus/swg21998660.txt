Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM MQ Java clients might send a password in clear text (CVE-2016-3052) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 If a Java or JMS client application uses a channel that does not use SSL/TLS, then setting "PasswordProtection=ALWAYS" in a queue manager's qm.ini file does not stop IBM WebSphere MQ sending a password in clear text across a network during the connection. 

Applications that do not set the "USE_MQCSP_AUTHENTICATION_PROPERTY" or "USER_AUTHENTICATION_MQCSP" properties to "true" on the connection are potentially vulnerable. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-3052 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3052]
DESCRIPTION: Under non-standard configurations, IBM WebSphere MQ might send password data in clear text over the network. This data could be intercepted using man in the middle techniques.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114722 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/114722] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
