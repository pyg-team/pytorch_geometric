Title: IBM Output files (*.spv) created with OMS syntax on UNIX servers: lightweight pivot tables do not render when output is opened in client - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0 installed on a UNIX Server platform (AIX, HP-UX or Solaris) and executed an OMS syntax that contains lightweight pivot tables. The creation of the tables went fine and I saved the output as SPV file. After that I copied the output file to a Statistics 19 Client (Windows, Macintosh or Linux platform). However, when I try to open the SPV file on the client the lightweight pivot tables do not render, they only show "Processing..", why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to IBM SPSS Development. This issue is resolved with the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FixPack 1.

As a workaround please download the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FP1 and install it for your Client or Server operating system. The FixPack is available on IBM FixCentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] for download. 

Select "Information Management" as product group and SPSS Statistics as product. As installed version select 19.0.0.0 and select the operating system platform where you have installed the product. 

For example if you select Windows 32 bit as operating system the relevant Fixpack would be: 

19.0-IM-S19STATC-WIN32-FP001 (This is IBM SPSS Statistics Fix Pack 1 for Statistics Client 19.0.0.0. ). 

Please read the installation instructions included in the download package.
