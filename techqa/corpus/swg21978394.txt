QUESTION
 When configuring InfoSphere Data Replication for Oracle, is transparent Application Failover supported for the connection of the II DR Agent to the Oracle RAC database? 

CAUSE
Oracle Transparent Application Failover provides messaging back to a connected application when the current database instance handling the fails or is unavailable, the session will attempt to be passed to another available instance. It is the application's responsibility to re-try any rolled back operations and handle the ORA message that is returned. 

ANSWER
Infosphere Data Replication does not support the use of Transparent Application Failover settings in the Oracle TNSNAMES.ora connection configuration. A Failover and connection pass over attempt will require restarting the CDC Instance and/or Subscriptions.
