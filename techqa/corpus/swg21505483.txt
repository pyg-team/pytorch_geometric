PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message CWPZI8840E Failed to enable CICS JVMSERVER jvm server when trying to use the Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0 in CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.2. When you enter a zero command, you also receive message CWPZI8735E Request failed. ZEROCICS return code=0, ZEROSERV return code=203 (RC=0 RC0 RC=203 RC203). 

SYMPTOM
These are the error message that display on the terminal when you try to enter a zero command such as zero version or zero help from UNIX System Services (USS):
CWPZI8735E: Request failed. ZEROCICS return code=0, ZEROSERV return code=203. 
CWPZI8840E: Failed to enable CICS JVMSERVER jvmserver. initializing the cli failed

These are the error messages in CICS region log:
DFHSJ0210 date time applid An attempt to start a JVM for the JVMSERVER resource jvmserver has failed. Reason code: JVMPROFILE_ERROR.
DFHSJ0914 E date time applid userid JVMSERVER jvmserver is DISABLED because the Language Environment Enclave was not created.
DFHSJ0912 date time applid userid JVMSERVER jvmserver was successfully discarded. Reason code:JVMPROFILE_ERROR.
date time GMT *Exc*: Problem encountered on line 50 of the JVM profile jvmserver = LIBPATH and JAVA_HOME are both specified. They are mutually exclusive.


CAUSE
The CICS TS Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0 is for CICS TS V4.1 and is not compatible with CICS TS V4.2. This is because this feature pack has environment variables set for using the 31bit JVM and CICS TS 4.2 only uses a 64bit JVM.

Note: The key failure is that JVM server can not be started due to the incompatibility between the 31bit and 64bit JVM. This failure happens regardless of the JVM profile error (LIBPATH and JAVA_HOME are both specified).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.1 available for CICS TS 4.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21566483].

Do *NOT* attempt to deploy the existing Dynamic Scripting Feature Pack for CICS TS V4.1 into your CICS TS V4.2 environment.
