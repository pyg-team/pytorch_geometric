QUESTION
 VM Managers - Operation Status is still showing "Pending" state for days. 

CAUSE
Despite a number of import tasks executed successfully and a "Connection Test Status" in VM Managers page shows "Successful.......", the "Operation Status" is still reporting as "Pending" state.

A few items to verify to ensure there is no communication issue with the VM Manager Tool. 



1) On the IEM server where VM Manager Tool is installed (by default), run


C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\LMT\VMMAN\vmman.bat -testconnection
C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\LMT\VMMAN\vmman.bat -status

or

/var/opt/BESClient/LMT/VMMAN/vmman.sh -testconnection
/var/opt/BESClient/LMT/VMMAN/vmman.sh -status


Example outputs below showed "OK" status with no issue:


C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\LMT\VMMAN>vmman.bat -testconnection 

CODUI0046I: [ vmmconf_1.properties ] Test connection operation has been successfully completed. 

CODUI0046I: [ vmmconf_2.properties ] Test connection operation has been successfully completed. 

 

C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\LMT\VMMAN>vmman.bat -status

2) Next, also check if the following action below is still running with 100% complete status from IEM Console.

Schedule VM Manager Tool Scan Results Upload

3) Lastly, manually run the import task again from ILMT console | Management | Data Imports | click on Import Now button. Verify the status again.



ANSWER
If the above steps have been confirmed that things are looking good but the status is still not changing to "OK", restart the ILMT server service to refresh the data. Manually run the import task again after restarted in order to see the status change from "Pending" to "OK" status.
