APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On a server where Cognos Business Intelligence is running,
   the following message is periodically written to the
   SystemOut.log file, as a warning message:
   
   CognosConfigF W
   com.ibm.wbimonitor.admin.command.cognos.CognosConfigForCacheClea
   ring runCognosCacheClearingTask  about to release
   
   The frequency with which the message is logged is determined by
   the global cache clearing interval in Cognos BI and the interval
   configured in the Monitor scheduled service for Cognos BI cube
   cache clearing (see this page in the Information Center for
   more details:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5mx/topic/c [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5mx/topic/c]
   om.ibm.wbpm.mon.admin.doc/data/cognos_cubecaching_manage.html);
   each time the cube cache clearing task is executed, the message
   is logged.
   
   This message should not be logged as a warning during normal
   operation; instead, it should only be logged as part of tracing
   (component com.ibm.wbimonitor.admin.command.cognos), so that it
   does not needlessly fill up SystemOut.log (which could affect
   the ability to diagnose real issues that may occur, in addition
   to simply wasting disk space, depending on the configured
   maximum size of the log).
