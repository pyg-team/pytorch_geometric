QUESTION
 Can you open a Problem Management Report (PMR) or Service Request (SR) for the CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) Developer Trial? 

ANSWER
Yes, in addition to posting inquiries on dW Answers [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/151/cics.html] for questions about the Developer Trial, existing CICS Transaction Server for z/OS clients can raise PMRs or Service Requests (SR) [https://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/Home.action] with IBM CICS Support. Since the Developer Trial is a non-production version of CICS Transaction Server, only Severity 3 (some business impact) or Severity 4 (minimal business impact) PMRs can be raised.

CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Developer Trial [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/no/cics-ts-devtrial] V5.4, V5.3 and V5.2 are no cost "try-before-you-buy" versions of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS for evaluation use only. CICS TS Developer Trial can NOT be used in a production or business critical environment. CICS TS Developer Trial contains the same features and functions as CICS TS, however it is restricted in terms of performance and will operate only for a limited evaluation period. Authorized Program Analysis Report (APAR) fixes resulting from PMRs will only be provided against the main CICS TS product itself rather then the Developer Trial edition of this code. However, the Developer Trial will be updated periodically to include the latest service fixes.
