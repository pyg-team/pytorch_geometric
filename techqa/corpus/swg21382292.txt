Title: IBM A particular computer is having problems opening Excel reports - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to run Excel report output through Cognos Connection. 

Saved Excel files from the hard drive are opened properly directly through Excel. When you try to open a report in ReportNet using Excel formats, the window will open and then disappear. Other users have no problem opening Excel report output. 

Tried launching from within Report Viewer, as well as by Run with Options. When doing so, ReportViewer would open up briefly in another window, and the window closed itself. No error messages are displayed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 
Try the following -

 * Verify that Internet Explorer security settings are properly set - KB #1014647, KB #1015618
 * Ensure that there are no pop-up blockers preventing Cognos Connection from functioning properly.
 * Verify that Excel files are opening properly - KB #1014002, KB #1016267.
 * Restart Reportnet services.
