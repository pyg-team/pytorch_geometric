QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM FileNet P8 Enterprise Records (IER) deployed in IBM Content Navigator (ICN), to run on a High Availability (HA) clustered environment? 

ANSWER
 

 * The IER FilePlan Object Store (FPOS) in ICN admin desktop has to be connected via the URL as follows:
   corbaloc:rir:/cell/clusters/your_websphere_cluster_name/FileNet/Engine
   
 * Before running the Advance Disposition Task, you need to configure the RecordsManagerSweep.sh or RecordsManagerSweep.bat file for EJB mode and set the naming provider URL as follows: set NAMING_PROVIDER_URL=corbaloc:rir:/cell/clusters/your_websphere_cluster_name
   
   
   
 * Run the Disposition Sweep through Advance Disposition Tasks in IER desktop deployed in ICN.
