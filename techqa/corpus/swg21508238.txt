Title: IBM The Workplace XT Site Preferences page is not reflecting or saving the Yes value for the Accept User Tokens option, however, user tokens are currently being accepted in Workplace XT - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When setting the Accept User Tokens value to yes in FileNet Content Manager Workplace XT's Site Preferences page, it keeps reverting back to a value of no when trying to save it. But the user tokens are accepted in Workplace XT. 

CAUSE
WorkplaceXT was accessed with a URL that contained ContainerLogin.jsp (e.g. <servername>:port#/WorkplaceXT/ContainerLogin.jsp)

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When entering "<servername>:<port#>/WorkplaceXT" only (nothing after WorkplaceXT) then the Bootstrap page shows “Yes” for the “accept user tokens” option. However, when accessing the URL with ContainerLogin.jsp, then the Bootstrap page shows “No” for the “accept user tokens”. 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This is the expected behavior when accessing WorkplaceXT.

When a URL such as "<servername>:<port#>/WorkplaceXT" is used, it automatically redirects to "<servername>":<port#>/WorkplaceXT/ContainerLogin.jsp".

The redirection is automatically handled by the web application server, where it also triggers the configured User Token Trust Interceptor needed for user token handling. This will allow the admin to set the accept token in Site Preferences. 

When going directly to the ContainerLogin.jsp link, the trust interceptor is bypassed, which prevents the Site Preference from being set.

When bookmarking or saving a link to WorkplaceXT, ensure that the link does not contain the full path to ContainerLogin.jsp.
