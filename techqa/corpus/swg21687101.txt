QUESTION
 Which database parameters impact Atlas Who is on Hold report performance? 

CAUSE
The report does not bring back data when run with and without filters

ANSWER
Below are some of the steps that need to be performed to analyze the issue 

1. Login to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA, get Oracle initialization parameters by running 
SQL> show parameters

The output needs to be spooled to a file for analysis 

Analyze the file and confirm that the parameters have respective values as below

optimizer_capture_sql_plan_baselines=false
star_transformation_enabled=false
optimizer_mode=choose

2. Identify how often the statistics is run on Atlas database and the command currently being used. 

3. Identify last analysis by running the command using SQL*Plus as PSSAPL user

SQL> select table_name,last_analyzed from user_tables where last_analyzed is null or last_analyzed<(sysdate-30); 

The output needs to be spooled to a file for analysis 

4. Run schema statistics based on recommended parameters in Atlas Administration guide
$ sqlplus PSSAPL/PSSAPLPWD@DBName
SQL> EXEC dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats('PSSAPLâ€™, cascade=>TRUE, estimate_percent=>DBMS_STATS.AUTO_SAMPLE_SIZE);

5. Generate an AWR Report and Explain Plan when the report is run.
