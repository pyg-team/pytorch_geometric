PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are performing the CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICSVR) installation verification procedure (IVP). You select 1 ( list of VSAM spheres ) in the CICSVR main menu and receive message:

" Error found for one or more VSAM spheres."
" Message 1410 contains further information for your system programmer." 

SYMPTOM
You are installing CICSVR and following the instructions outlined in the Program Directory in section 6.1.10.1 Verify your CICSVR Installation. In the CICS Information Center in section DWWCLIST - ISPF Dialog Interface In step 4. you are instructed to " Select 1 (list of VSAM spheres) in the CICSVR main menu." This results in ISPF popup message box with the following text on panelid DWWPPVLT:

" Error found for one or more VSAM spheres."
" Message 1410 contains further information for your system programmer."

DWW1410E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.cvr.doc/dwwmd/kw00412.html] Unexpected result from the IGWARLS interface for sphere DWW.CICSVR.CUSTOMER. The return code is 0000000C. The reason code is 0000000C. The problem determination field is 0000000000000000.


CAUSE
The 1410 message ( DWW1410E ) is expected as the DWW.CICSVR.CUSTOMER VSAM sphere does not exist.

ENVIRONMENT
CICS VR V4.3;

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can ignore the 1410 message ( DWW1410E ). The DWW.CICSVR.CUSTOMER dataset does not need to exist for the IVP forward recovery job to successfully recover. The IVP uses the Recovery Control Data Set (RCDS) that was imported when running the DWWRUNAR job. 

There are multiple inaccuracies in the IVP as follows:


 1. If you choose CICSVR ISPF dialog option 1. List of VSAM spheres from the following panel: 
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21264611&amp;aid=1]
    
    ...and then press Enter on the following panel: 
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21264611&amp;aid=2]
    
    ...you will receive the following ISPF popup box with the 1410 error message text.
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21264611&amp;aid=3]
    
    If you choose CICSVR ISPF dialog option 6. Browse messages, the following message will provide additional details:
    
    DWW1410E Unexpected result from the IGWARLS interface for sphere
    DWW.CICSVR.CUSTOMER. The return code is 0000000C. The
    reason code is 0000000C. The problem determination field is
    0000000000000000.
    
    The return code 0000000C and reason code 0000000C indicate:
    
    "The data set specified in dsname could not be found. Verify that the data set exists and has been correctly specified in dsname. "
    
    This is normal and is expected as the DWW.CICSVR.CUSTOMER dataset is not created by the IVP jobs. The message can be ignored.
    
    
    
 2. The recovery job is also created with DWWIN data with start and stop times that do not match the specified time on the ISPF panel of: 91.001 00:00:00. This is also normal. CICSVR obtains the STARTTIME and STOPTIME from the IVP RCSD EMCO record as follows:
    
    EMCOFTGC: 05.258 06:05:05
    EMCOFTLC: 05.258 06:05:05
    
    These times are used to create the parameters:
    
    STARTTIME(05.258/06:05:05)
    STOPTIME(05.258/10:32:58) 
    
    
    
 3. Step 7 in the Program Directory for the IVP also suggests that you specify BACKUP TYPE ...1 however there is no option 1. This field is a prompt field as indicated by the plus sign '+'. 
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21264611&amp;aid=4]
    
    ...if you press the F4=Prompt PF key, you can choose option 1. None.
