Title: IBM DOORS Symbols are not exported using Rational Publishing Engine 1.1 - United States

Text:
glyph; font; unicode; blank; character; export; import; msword; junk; square; empty TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is Rational Publishing Engine 1.1 not exporting all the symbols inserted in the DOORS module successfully to Microsoft Word? Some of the symbols are exported as squares and question marks. 

ANSWER
Unicode characters (glyphs) are not supported by all fonts. Or, to be more precise, each font supports a subset of the Unicode glyphs. 

If you want to use only a particular font, and if that symbol is not supported by that font, then you won’t be able to see the Unicode glyphs regardless of the application used: Rational Publishing Engine, Rational DOORS, Microsoft Notepad, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etcetera. 

 

For example, if you do a standard export to Microsoft Word from Rational DOORS, then you will find that the symbols are exported using the ‘Symbol’ font, irrespective of the font used in the Rational DOORS display schema. 

 

So when you use Rational Publishing Engine 1.1, depending upon the type of symbols that you use, you must select a suitable font for it to be exported properly.
