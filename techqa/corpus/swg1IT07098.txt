LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects all MQ v8 queue managers which have been
   migrated from earlier versions and are using the channel
   authentication feature.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A CHLAUTH definition has been created at MQ V710 which has a
   small object length (70 bytes). The queue manager started at MQ
   V8 and records are read from the data set
   SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE.
   
   Validation of the channel authentication record uses minimum
   object length of 72 bytes which is the size of a CHLAUTH Profile
   structure at V710. This minimum object length includes some
   padding to the nearest double word boundary. Because of this
   minimum length being larger than actual length of the record
   AMQ9774 errors are generated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been updated so that the correct minimum length
   is passed when validating the CHLAUTH record.
