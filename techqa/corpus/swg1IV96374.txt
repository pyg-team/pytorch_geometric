ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Various existing users with non US English language profile
   get:"An Error Occurred. Contact your System Administrator.
   - [MID-3402867005]"  when clicking on "System" tab on each form
   when accessing.
   ENVIRONMENT:
   1. What is the environment?: DEV and PROD
   2. Platform: (3.5.2.2)
   3. Application: (10.5.1)
   4. Operating System: (Other)
   5. Database Server and Version: (DB2)
   6. Application Server and Version: (WebSphere)
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   1. Create a user, set to British english.
   2. Get the spec_id for the newly created user from the
   t_tripeople (employee record).
   3. Run:
   update t_tripeople set SYS_GEOGRAPHYNAMEOBJID = 1234,
   SYS_GEOGRAPHYNAME = null  where  spec_id = <<<SPEC_ID__>>; to
   setup the bad data.
   4. Login as the british user
   5. Navigate to their employee record.
   6. Go to the system tab
   Notice it only displays a MID error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When translating object references, the Platform needs to catch
   the smart object not found error, and follow path as if it was
   non-translated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When invalid data is contained in a reference field (Like
   System Geography), the Platform will no longer throw a MID
   error, and will show the field as blank, since the referenced
   record does not exist.
   This is targeted to the 1h2017 Release.
