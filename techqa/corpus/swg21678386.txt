Title: IBM VMGR NodeAgent question - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
We are trying out Sametime 9 Complete and are trying to deploy ST9 VMGR (Video Manager). We noticed that NodeAgent of VMGR cannot be started without errors after VMGR deployment. 

We found out examples how to start the VMGR. and it was said to start Solid DB and then to start STMediaServer server. There was no comments about VMGR node agent. Also VMGR's node agent is not seen in ISC (Integrated solutions console).


Is this working by design? Should VMGR's node agent be visible in ISC? Should it start automatically prior VMGR's application server STMediaServer ?

ENVIRONMENT
Sametime 9.x.x

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Is this working by design? Should VMGR's node agent be visible in ISC?
- Yes. VMGR has no node agent. It is not WAS cluster.

Should it start automatically prior to VMGR's application server STMediaServer ? 
- Node agent does not matter from VMGR, only soliddb should be started before VMGR.
