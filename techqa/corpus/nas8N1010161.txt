Title: IBM Automating Data Transfer by Using the Batch Transfer for Microsoft Windows - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The document describes how to create a batch data transfer and how to run the batch transfer from Microsoft Windows. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Following are the steps to create a batch data transfer for Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME, Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000/XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7. The batch data transfer is a transfer that requires no input from an operator other than starting a batch job. This document presumes you know how to set up a data transfer session, run it, and save it. 

The following chart shows the batch data transfer options available followed by the direction the data will flow and the saved transfer extensions that would be used by each batch transfer executable.



RTOPCB From the IBM i products database to the PC .TTO, .RTO, .DTF, .DT RFROMPCB From the PC to the IBM i database .TFR, .RTO, .DTT, .DT RXFERPCB From the IBM i database to the PC and from the PC to the IBM i database .TTO, .TFR, .DTT, .DTF 
Note: RXFERPCB was added to Client Access Express V5R1 in service pack SI10376 and IBM iSeries Access V5R2 in service pack SI09809. RXFERPCB can be used for both downloads and uploads. 
RXFERPCB allows the addition of a IBM i user ID and password. 

Following is an example of an automated data transfer: 1. Bring up Data Transfer to System i or Data Transfer from System i in the System i Access for Windows group. Fill in the required parameters for data transfer and click on OK or the X to close the session. This brings up a Question box, which asks: Do you want to save the transfer request? Click on Yes. This brings up the Save As window. Type a file name and select the directory where you want the transfer request saved. Do not put an extension on the end of the file name because an extension will be added automatically. If the Client Access for Windows 95/NT product is used, the default extension will be either .TTO or .TFR. If the Client Access Express, iSeries Access, or System i Access product is used, the default extension will be either .DTT or .DTF. 2. Following is an example of what you would type in Notepad.

When using RTOPCB, type:
RTOPCB C:\YOURFOLDER\TEST.DTF

When using RFROMPCB, type:
RFROMPCB C:\YOURFOLDER\TEST.DTT

When using RXFERPCB, type:
RXFERPCB C:\YOURFOLDER\TEST.DTF USERID PASSWORD
or
RXFERPCB C:\YOURFOLDER\TEST.DTT USERID PASSWORD

Select the File pull-down menu from Notepad and the Save As option. Type a file name and select the directory where you want this saved. You must end the file name with an extension of .BAT. Ending the file name with .BAT allows additional properties that control how the DOS environment can be run. For this sample, the file name and extension is TEST.BAT. 3. Drag and drop the TEST.BAT file anywhere on the PC, and it should run.
