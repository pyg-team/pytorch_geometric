ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  GSD : UNFOLD : UNFOLD OPERATION YIELDS
   INCORRECT RESULT WITH DEVIATION
   .
   0.Open the attached COMPOSITE-2.CATPart.
   1.Select GSD Workbench.
   2.Select Unfold command.
   3.Select the Extract.1 as the surface to unfold.
   4.Select Plane.7 as the support plane.
   5.Select the origin of Axis.3 as the Origin for the
   Unfold operation.
   6.Click Ok.
   -Please note that the Unfold operation result has
   deviated and is different from the one obtained
   from the Composites Design Flattening command.
   .
   This is the problem.

   Incident Diagnosis
   .
   Comparing the outputs of Unfold operator of GSD
   and Composites workbench.
   .
   Restriction Explanation
   .
   Unfold of an exactly developable ruled surface is
   precise.Whereas Unfold of a not exactly
   developable ruled surface is less precise.
   .
   GSD workbench has a behavior based on
   geometry. Thus the part sent by customer in our
   case can theoretically not be unfolded. In this case
   we are not able to know/estimate the gap we will
   have between our unfolded result and the physical
   unfolded result.
   .
   As of today, analyzing customer?s case, we are not
   able to provide a more accurate result in this case
   with the used function. Customer has to use Unfold
   function of Composite Workbench to get a more
   accurate result. This unfold function provide a more
   accurate result because it takes into account more
   physical information like the material properties.
   .
   There is today no possible development to be
   made in a HF/SP or actual releases to permit to
   have a better result on the CGM operator as those
   deviation cases  (most cases are correctly unfolded
   by the function ) are not possible to identify by the
   software itself as of today.
   .
   Bypass
   .
   Use the Composite workbench to obtain the desired
   Unfold result.
