 * How do I purchase a Support Extension if necessary?

 * IBM WebSphere Application Server recognizes that there might be unique situations where a Client is not able to migrate to a supported product version prior to an End of Support date. WebSphere Application Server may, at its discretion, extend customer technical support and defect support for a withdrawn release. Extended support for a product will be considered and provided on an individual Client basis. Information on how to purchase [http://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21298463] [http://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21298463] a Support Extension [http://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21298463] is available.
