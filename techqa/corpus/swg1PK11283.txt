PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TDS for z/OS users who want to display   *
   *                 or collect z/OS 1.7 data and in particular   *
   *                 the new z9-109 processor data.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This Apar adds z/OS 1.7 support, and    *
   *                      in particular the support for the new   *
   *                      z9-109 processor (2094 model), to       *
   *                      TDS for z/OS 1.7.0.                     *

   ****************************************************************
   The main changes in z/OS 1.7 that are integrated in the Tivoli
   Decision Support for z/OS 1.7.0 are:
   - z990, z890 and previous processors manage ICF, IFL and zAAP
     (IFA) processors as a single pool of resources (the ICF
     processor pool). Thus, the possible values for CPU types were
     only two: General Purpose (CP) and Special Purpose
     (ICF/IFL/IFA) processors. With z9-109 processors, the ICF
     processor pool is separated and CPU times for ICF, IFL and
     IFA processors are reported by RMF independently. The field
     SMF70CIX, for this processors, can now contain 5 different
     values: 1 (CP); 2 (reserved for compatibility); 3 (IFA);
     4 (IFL); 5 (ICF).
     Record changed: SMF(70).
   - RMF enhances the Crypto Hardware Activity Report by
     supporting the new Crypto Express2 Coprocessor crypto card.
     Also this report now distinguishes between the used hash
     algorithms and provides metrics for hashing activity with
     SHA-1 functions and with SHA-256 functions (SHA =
     Secure Hash Algorithm).
     Record changed: SMF(70).
   
   The MVS Performance Management component and the MVS
   System component have been checked, modified, and updated
   in order to be compliant to the mentioned z/OS changes.
