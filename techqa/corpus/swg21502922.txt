Title: IBM Sentinel License Manager seems to install properly, but does not work - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have downloaded the Windows Sentinel License Manager for IBM SPSS Modeler 14.2. The installation seems to go well, but nothing is actually installed. 

SYMPTOM
I have downloaded the Windows Sentinel License Manager for IBM SPSS Modeler 14.2, and executed the file Sentinel_win-8.3.0.exe. The installation went well, but there is no new entry in Start - Programs, the installation folder is not where it usually is (in Program Files\Common Files) and it does not contain what it should. It only contains 2 folders (License, and Uninstall IBM SPSS Concurrent licensing tools), a text file and an executable file, Sentinel_LM_win-8.3.0.exe.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You need to run Sentinel_LM_win-8.3.0.exe that was extracted (default folder is C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Concurrent Licensing Tools\9.0) ; this will install the Sentinel License Manager.
