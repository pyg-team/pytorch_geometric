Title: IBM Security Bulletin: December 2015 OpenSSL Vulnerabilities in Multiple N series Products - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple N series products incorporate the OpenSSL software libraries to provide cryptographic capabilities. OpenSSL versions below 1.0.2e, 1.0.1q, 1.0.0t, and 0.9.8zh are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could lead to a denial of service attack or information disclosure. Multiple N series Products have addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-3193 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3193]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain private key information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108502 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108502] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1794 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1794]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when a client receives a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a segfault and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
