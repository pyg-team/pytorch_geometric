ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is a repaint problem in the Implementation tab. The cursor
   disappears in the middle of typing and you have to hit Apply or
    Ok to get the cursor visible again. If you continue to type and
    use the arrow keys, the keyboard strokes and mouse clicks are t
   racking ok. The cursor is just missing. If you hit the Apply but
   ton, the cursor shows up, but it is back at the upper left inste
   ad of where you were typing at. This seems to happen when you cu
   t-and-paste while you are working in the Implementation tab of t
   he Features dialog box.
   
   
   Further details from client:
   
   I usually have several windows open because I'm using Rhapsody,
   Simulink, and Lotus Notes for mail (which seems to take a lot of
    memory).
   
   I'm using Rhapsody for C with the MicroC profile. I don't rememb
   er the exact version because the Help/About screen only shows 7.
   5 and a Build number.
   
   Yes, cutting and pasting a lot triggers this behavior. I have no
   t used observed an exact sequence because I'm usually busy with
   the task as opposed to concentrating on how much I'm typing, swi
   tching windows, moving the mouse, and cutting and pasting. I don
   't know if this is helpful, but some of my common habits are ALT
   -TAB to switch windows, combination of arrow keys and the mouse
   to move within the text box, and I use SHIFT-DEL to cut and SHIF
   T-INSert to paste. These are old Windows habits and I noticed th
   at the SHIFT-INS doesn't work in the Implementation text box (or
    whatever type of control it is). Sometimes when I'm using the S
   HIFT-???, I accidentally hit CTRL-??? which runs the scroll bars
   . Also, I work off-site half-time, so for convenience of switchi
   ng PCs I have my Rhapsody project on an external USB hard drive
   (USB 2.0 ports). I'm not sure how this affects any license serve
   r or auto archive features, but perhaps there are some simultane
   ous, automatic activities to the slower external drive when this
    occurs.
   
   This is more of an aggravation than a problem. There is no funct
   ionality loss nor does it prevent me from completing my work on
   time. I will try to control the use of memory on my machine, but
    I do see it happen when I have Rhapsody and Lotus Notes open wi
   th only one or two instances of Internet Explorer running. It is
    hard to close my e-mail and function at work though. I don't kn
   ow what type of control the Implementation tab contains, but it
   might be an issue with a common
   control included in the development tool used to create the Rhap
   sody application.
