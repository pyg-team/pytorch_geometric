QUESTION
 What are the known issues regarding the IBM Rational ClearQuest CQTool? 

ANSWER
The following list of issues and their known solutions have been consolidated and listed below:
1. CQTOOL login fails if examples with blank password "" as the last parameter 

 * 
 * Incorrect command
 * 
   
   CQTOOL login -s Local -d MYDB -u tom -p ""
   
   
   
 * Correct command 
 * 
   
   CQTOOL login -d MYDB -u tom -p "" -s Local
   
   



2. Non-regression cqtool does not give the 'Severity' choice list when submit a defect on command line 

 * 
 * 
 * Component: Command Line Interface
   
   Reproduce step:
   1. cqtool submit -type Defect 
   2. The command line will prompt you to input "headline", input and click Enter
   3. The command line should prompt for the "Severity ", but when you input "?" it will error and exit the command. 
 *  Expected result (when you input "?", it will present the choice list)
   Value required for field Severity [SHORT_STRING] (? to see list): Actual result (when you input "?", it will error and exit the command)
   Value required for field Severity: 
   
   If you use the command, it errors with:
   
   
   
   cqtool> submit -headline "hellocaty" -severity 3

7. "cqcli error : invalid cqcli command null" when running cqtool 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The fix for this is to remove/correct any invalid syntax or delete/overwrite corrupted characters with correct syntax. 
 * WORKAROUND: The initial contents of this file can be restored by overwriting/pasting the file content with following text: "add=add_attachment"



8. cqtool does not start on Microsoft Windows if gsk8\lib dir is at the end of the PATH 

 * 
 * 
 * 
   
   Could not load library "gsk8iccs"
   
   
   
 * Possible Cause:CQTOOL searches the PATH for the GSK8 libraries but if GSK8 is the last element in the PATH it will not be recognized
   
 * WORKAROUND: Add a semi-colon ";" to the end of the PATH using one of the following methods: 
 *  Append a semicolon to the PATH at the command prompt, for example: set "PATH=%PATH%;" Append a semicolon to the system PATH or the user PATH, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519] 
 * 
 * Possible Cause: You need to run the command line as administrator. 
 * WORKAROUND: Open the command line "As Administrator" before running CQTOOL.
