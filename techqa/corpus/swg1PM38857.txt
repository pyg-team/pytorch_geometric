APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When accessing the same stateful session bean instance multiple
   times within the same transaction context, a hang condition may
   occur.
   
   This condition may occur for stateful beans configured with
   container managed transactions where remote interfaces are used.
   
   
   This may also occur for stateful beans configured with bean
   managed persistence and a global transaction is started
   within the scope of one method call, but not completed.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  V8.0 with applications that may             *
   *                  concurrently  access Stateful Session       *
   *                  Enterprise Java Beans.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Accessing the same stateful session     *
   *                      bean multiple times within the same     *
   *                      transaction context, a hang condition   *
   *                      may occur.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In prior releases, any attempt to concurrently access a
   stateful bean instance would result in an exception (either
   BeanNotReentrantException or ConcurrentAccessException). With
   WebSphere Applicaiton Server V8, access is now blocked until
   the current thread accessing the bean completes, however there
   have been some scenarios where this may result in a thread
   being blocked indefinitely.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Corrections have been made to the stateful session bean state
   management and concurrency locking to correct the hang
   conditions. Concurrently accessing stateful bean instances
   will no longer result in hang conditions.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.0.0.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
