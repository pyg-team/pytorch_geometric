Title: IBM Content Collector date range search is not returning any results. - United States

Text:
ICC; date range TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have enabled date partitioning on the FileNet P8 object store for ICCMaildate property but why does the IBM Content Collector date range search does not return any results ? 

SYMPTOM
You are able to perform content searches but not date range searches.


CAUSE
With a date partitioned object store, you can only do a property search on date because content-based retrieval search is not supported.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector with FileNet P8 4.5.1 & 5.0

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The date range search does not work from Verity dashboard but the content search works fine.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM






 * Starting with IBM Content Collector 2.2 Fixpack 2, you can use the new style set ICC_FileSystem_PushAPI_p8cse_4.5.1_no_partition without any changes in the search mapping file. 


IBM Content Collector 2.2 Fixpack 1 or earlier is required to do the following.  * Stop IBM Content Collector Web application service from Windows services. 
 * Export the afu_search_mapping.xml from Archived data access for email in IBM Content Collector Configuration Manager. 
 * Modify the exported afu_search_mapping.xml file to remove icc_received_date text index value for ICCMaildate. 
   Value to be removed:
   <search format="yyyyMMddHH">icc_received_date</search> 
 *  Import the modified afu_search_mapping.xml in Configuration Manager. 
 * Start IBM Content Collector Web application service 
 * Perform the date range search from IBM Content Collector search application.
