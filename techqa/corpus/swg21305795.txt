CONTENT
The Licensed Program Specifications (LPS) for CICS TS V3.1 and V3.2 state:


The SOAP for CICS feature, if used with CICS TS V3.1 (V3.2), is provided with program services. Unless otherwise indicated, these program services will no longer be available with CICS TS V3.1 (V3.2) when they have been discontinued on CICS TS V2.2 and CICS TS V2.3.

This means the SOAP for CICS feature is no longer supported on any CICS release after 30 September 2009. You should update your applications to use the support for Web services provided in CICS TS V3.1 and above.
