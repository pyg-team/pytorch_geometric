APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ISIM WebSEAL/SSO documentation needs to be updated to avoid
   issues with ISC:
   
   When ISC is accessed via WebSEAL junction, clicking on the
   badges on the home page appear to redirect back to the hompage
   or a blank screen is displayed.
   Configuring the WebSEAL junction as transparent resolves these
   issues...but another issue arose:
   Clicking on Request Access, then selecting a User and finally
   clicking on an Access badge to request, would result in the
   following errors and the User is sent to the ISC login screen:
   
   CTGIMW005E An application error or communication error
   occurred. If the
   problem persists, contact your system administrator.
   
   WebSphere SystemOut.log contains the following:
   [3/19/15 10:51:53:347 PDT] 00000126 SystemUsersSe W   CSRFToken
   header
   is missing or not valid on HTTP POST request for
   '/access/assignments';
   possible cross-site request forgery attack in progress

   checkSecurity SESN0008E: A user authenticated as anonymous has
   attempted to access a session owned by gthrasher.

   SessionContext
   checkSecurity SESN0008E: A user authenticated as anonymous has
   attempted to access a session owned by gthrasher
   
   Steps to duplicate:
   
   1. create webseal junction to protect ISC (/itim/ui) per our
   documentation (e.g. server task default-webseald-tam60-server
   create -b supply -t tcp -s -j -e ut8_uri -c iv_user -p 9080 -h
   ITIMServer /isimisc )
   ...follow the rest of the steps we document in:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRMWJ_6.0.0.3/com [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRMWJ_6.0.0.3/com]
   .ibm.isim.doc_6.0.0.3/securing/cpt/cpt_ic_security_sing_tai_ovie
   w.htm
   
   2. attempt to access the ISC via the webseal junction.
   
   Homepage will either be blank or will display...but clicking on
   Request Access will loop back to the Homepage.
   
   3.  reconfigure the junction as a transparent junction (same
   command as above, but remove the -j option).
   
   4. access ISC via the transparent junction
   5. click Request Access (should work now)
   6. click on a User badge
   7. click on an Access to request for the User...
   this should fail with the errors above and redirect to the ISC
   login screen.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Blank/looping Homescreen:
   Define the WebSEAL junction as per our documentation but
   without the -j option (this will create a "transparent
   junction")
   
   Error/redirect to ISC login, when clicking Access for User:
   
   Add the following stanza to the webseald.conf file (where
   'juntionname' is the name of the junction protecting ISC):
   
   [junction:/junctionname]
   validate-backend-domain-cookies = no
   allow-backend-domain-cookies = yes
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue is not recreatable by L2 or L3 staff following the
   latest Knowledge Center instructions published for configuring a
   transparent path junction in 6.0.0-ISS-SIM-FP0006.
