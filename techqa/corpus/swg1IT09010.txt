APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In PureApplication System version 2.1.0.0, if using an invalid
   regular expression in a classic virtual system pattern, a
   warning is provided at build time in the Pattern Builder to
   alert the user that the expression is invalid. This same
   invalid regular expression is ignored at deploy time.
   
   For new architecture virtual system patterns, warnings are not
   seen for invalid expressions in the pattern builder nor at
   deploy time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The correct behavior here for both classic and new
   architecture virtual system patterns is:
   
   - if a valid regular expression is used in a pattern to validate
   a user input field the user input should be validated and
   provide messages in the Pattern Builder and at deploy time.
   
   -  if there is an invalid regular expression used to validate a
   user input field the user input is ignored and does not provide
   messages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.1.0.1.
