QUESTION
 I need to be able to order variables, how can I get around this limitation? 

ANSWER


 

How can I get this to compile ... I have a model that has variables defined directly in a package. These variables define various constants (such as PI, DEGREES_PER_RADIAN, etc.). Some of these variables are defined in terms of others, such that the dependent variable must be declared before the others in order for it to compile. Rhapsody does not allow me to override the default alphabetical order of the variable declarations. This ability to order variables in Rhapsody was added in version 5.01 MR2. If you are using an earlier version, consider the following two approaches: 1) Define your constants using types. For example, assume a type named PI with a C++ Declaration of: const double %s = 3.14 Here, the %s is replaced with the name PI. A DEGREES_PER_RADIAN type would have a declaration of: const double %s = 180.0 / PI Here, the %s is replaced with the name DEGREES_PER_RADIAN. Rhapsody allows me to change the order of the type declarations such that PI is generated first, thereby providing a successful compilation. 2) Create a variable called PI of type const double with an initial value of 3.14. Create a second variable called DEGREES_PER_RADIAN of type const double with an initial value of 180.0 / PI. This will not compile since Rhapsody generates the DEGREES_PER_RADIAN before the PI. On the DEGREES_PER_RADIAN variable, set the CPP_CG::Attribute::VariableInitializationFile property to "Implementation" to initialize the variable in the implementation file. Rhapsody's default setting of "Default" causes the initialization to be put in the specification file if the type declaration begins with const; otherwise, it's put in the implementation file. It will now compile. 337AnswerProduct versionPartner ContentInternal ContentCategoryReference ID
