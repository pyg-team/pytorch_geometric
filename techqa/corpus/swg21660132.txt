PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using Internet Explorer 10 to open TCR 3.1.0.1 (delivered with Jazz for Service Management 1.1 SP1), the tab bar border overlap the icon bar row, making it partially unusable in case you have many tabs opened. 

SYMPTOM
When you open Common Reporting under DASH using Internet Explorer 10, the tab bar is moved one line below and this causes it to overlap the icon bar.

Usually this does not cause meaningful problem despite the cosmetic glitch, but it can partially hide the icons if you have many tabs opened.


CAUSE
The problem depends on the default Document mode used by latest Internet Explorer versions as V9 or V10.
This is a known issue related to the HTML code used by Cognos UI that is not fully compatible with newer Document mode rules.
Cognos UI is known to work fine with Document Mode IE5 standards (also known as Quirks mode).
Document Mode can be changed from Internet Explorer activating the Developer tools with F12 and changing the Document mode accordingly.
Anyway, this cannot be done from within JazzSM DASH, because DASH itself does not support Quirks mode.
If you try to activate the Quirks mode when operating from DASH, you obtain a blank page.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If this cosmetic glitch is causing problems, you can run TCR outside from DASH and activate Quirks mode there. 

Those are the steps you must follow to activate Quirks mode:

1. Go to Tools->Compatibility view settings and add TCR hostname under websites section

2. Access TCR/Cognos outside DASH by using the following URL:
https://<TCR_Server_hostname>:16311/tarf/servlet/dispatch

3. Press F12 and change these two settings in the Development window available at the bottom:

Browser Mode to: IE 10 Compat View
Document Mode to: Quirks Mode 
(also IE7 standards should works fine)

4. The screens will be automatically refreshed and the tab border should now be showed at the expected position 

Cognos is working to support more recent Document modes but the fix is expected only on next releases of the report engine.
