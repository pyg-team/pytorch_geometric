APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Tivoli Monitoring: CEC Base Agent User's Guide
   does not clearly document the requirements to monitor an
   LPAR.
   
   A section needs to be added under
    "Requirements and agent-specific installation and
    configuration information for the monitoring agent"
   
   Under heading:
    "Requirements for the monitoring agent"
   
   This section should document what is necessary in order
   for the CEC agent to monitor LPARs.
   
   Suggested Text:
   ***
   The CEC agent requires the following in order to be able to
   monitor a remote system.
   1) network connectivity to remote LPARs
   2) remote LPAR must be running xmtopas/xmservd to support RSI
   calls
   3) open communications on UDP port 2279
   
   If an LPAR is being reported as un-monitored, possible causes
   are:
   1) ITM agent pointing to wrong CEC
   2) ssh not configured correctly between CEC and HMC
   <provide a link to the section of the manual where ssh setup is
   discussed using key.pl>
   3) xmservd/xmtopas not running on remote LPAR
   4) communication on UDP port 2279 is blocked
   *NOTE* CEC monitoring is NOT supported over firewalls.
   If a firewall is in place between CEC and remote LPAR, opening
   port 2279 for UDP may allow communications to work.
