APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On importing Assets using Application Import function,
   Applicatoin Import dialog gets hung with
   Internal Server Error.
   
   This always happens if it takes more than the
   ServerIOTimeout value. Once it happens,
   "Application Import" dialog just gets hung
   until hitting F5 button.
   
   Even after the error, Assets are actually imported.
   
   This is recreatable in MAM 7.5.0.5 environment with the
   following steps.
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   1) Sign into Maximo with maxadmin.
   
   2) From "Object Structures" application open MXASSET
   object and verify Support Flat Structure? check box is
   checked.
   
   3) From "Select Action" menu, select "Add/Modify
   Application Support Import" and specify the following
   values.
   
   Application      : ASSET
   Flat File        : checked
   Maximum Count    : 1000
   
   4) From "Security Groups" application, open maxadmin.
   
   5) On "Applications" tab, select "Assets" application
   and check "Grant Access?" check box for "Application
   Import".
   
   6) Sign out from Maximo and sign in to it with maxadmin
   again.
   
   7) From "Assets" application, click "Application Import"
   button and specify the following values.
   
   Object Structure : MXASSET
   Import Preview?  : checked
   Specify Import File Name : <import csv file name>
   
   Then click OK.
   
   8) In case that the import takes more than the
   ServerIOTimeout value, "Internal Server Error" happens
   and "Application Import" dialog just gets hung until
   hitting F5 button.
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   "Application Import" dialog gets hung if the nimport takes
   more than the value of ServerIOTimeout
   (Default value is 60 seconds.)
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   "Application Import" should not gets hung even when
   the import takes more than the ServerIOTimeout value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Increase ServerIOTimeout.

 *  To avoid application import hang, activate long operation dialog
   on the uploadfile control by changing the event from "loadData"
   to "dolongop".
   1) In Application Designer, select Action Export System XML.
   2) Export LIBRARY to library.xml.
   3) Edit library.xml with text editor.
   4) Locate uploadfile control inside dialog "ifimport".
   5) Modify event from "loadData" to "dolongop".
   6) Save changes to library.xml.
   7) In Application Designer, use Import Application Definition
   toolbar button to import library.xml.
