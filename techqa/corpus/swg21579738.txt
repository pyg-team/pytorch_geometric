QUESTION
 How do I install the transport files of the IBM InfoSphere Pack for SAP Applications 7.0 on an SAP system? 

ANSWER
In addition to installing the client and server components on the Information Server tiers, you also need to install / create the following two components on the SAP system:


 * RFC-enabled function modules (Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE and Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS) 
 * Appropriate profiles that can be assigned to the users. Profiles maintain a secure environment by providing the correct authorizations to the users according to SAP practices.


Note that the Pack for SAP version 7.0 objects for SAP are downward compatible with Pack version 6.5/6.5.0.1 (i.e., an IIS instance running 6.5.0.1 would work when connecting to an SAP system where the objects from Pack version 7.0 are imported) but this scenario is not recommended for more than a temporary setup. 

Step 1: Importing cofiles and data files 
The cofiles and data files must be copied from the client installation image to the appropriate directory onto the SAP machine before importing them. 

Procedure 
 1. Log on to the SAP machine as a system administrator. 
 2. The transport files are stored in the folder RFC\transports. Depending on the SAP system version, copy the files specified below to /usr/sap/trans/cofiles and /usr/sap/trans/data directories respectively on the SAP system by using one of the methods specified at points 4 and 5 (depending on your network configuration).  * For SAP version ECC 6.0 and later, unicode: Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS\unicode, Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE\unicode, profiles\unicode\ECC 
     * For SAP version ECC 6.0 and later, non-unicode: Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS\non-unicode\ECC, Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE\non-unicode\ECC, profiles\non-unicode\ECC 
     * For SAP version prior to SAP ECC 6.0, unicode: Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS\unicode, Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE\unicode, profiles\unicode\R3 
     * For SAP version prior to SAP ECC 6.0, non-unicode: Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS\non-unicode\R3, Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE\non-unicode\R3, profiles\non-unicode\R3
    
    
 3. Copy the cofiles and data files in the respective directories to /usr/sap/trans/cofiles and /usr/sap/trans/data directories respectively on the SAP system by doing one of the following, depending on your network configuration: 
 4. Accessible file system. If the file system for your SAP system is visible (for example, by NFS) on your InfoSphere Information Server system, you can copy the files using a DOS command or Windows Explorer. 
 5. Unmapped network drive. If the SAP system is accessible by the network, but it is not mapped as a network drive on the InfoSphere DataStage system, you can use FTP in binary mode to transfer the files using the directories specified above.


Step 2: Importing transport requests 

To import the transport request, the SAP Administrator can use one of the following two methods: 

Option 1. Importing using Transport Management System (using transaction STMS) 

Procedure 
 1. Log onto the target system and client as the SAP Administrator. 
 2. Create the development classes/packages named ZETL and ZETL_CTS that are assigned to a transport layer according to the system landscape for your company. You can use transaction SE80 to create the classes/packages. 
 3. Enter transaction STMS. The initial Transport Management System window opens. 
 4. Choose Overview > Imports. The system reads the import queues. 
 5. Select <SID> (or double-click <SID> in the queue column), then choose import queue>Display. 
 6. Choose Extras > Other requests > Add to add the transport request to the selected queue.
    Select the transport request number in the next window and continue.
    Repeat this step for the other transport requests. 
 7. Select the transport request in the import queue, and choose Request > Import. 
    Type the client number to which to import. Check the option "Ignore component version" on the Options tab, if available, and click "Continue".
    Repeat this step for each transport request.
    Note: Make sure to import the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE transport request before you import the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS transport request. 
 8. Verify that the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE and Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS RFC function modules and Z_DS_PROFILE and Z-DS_LOAD profiles are successfully imported and activated.


Option 2: Importing at the operating system level 

Procedure 
 1. Log on to the target system and client as the SAP Administrator. 
 2. Create the development classes/packages named ZETL and ZETL_CTS that are assigned to a transport layer according to the system landscape for your company. You can use transaction SE80 to create the classes/packages. 
 3. Add the transport request to the buffer using the following syntax:
    tp addtobuffer <transport request> <SID> 
    For example, tp addtobuffer P46K9 nnnnn DD1 
 4. Import the transport request using the following syntax (Make sure to import the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE transport request before you import the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS transport request.):
    tp import <transport request> <SID> client=<NNN>
    where <NNN> is a client number like 800. For example, tp import P46K9nnnnn DD1 client=800 
 5. Verify that the Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE and Z_RFC_DS_SERVICE_CTS RFC function modules and Z_DS_PROFILE and Z-DS_LOAD profiles are successfully imported and activated.
