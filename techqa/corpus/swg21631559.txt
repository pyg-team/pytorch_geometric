Title: IBM Content based searches fails after upgrading to IBM Content Search Services - United States

Text:
K2VQL; CBR_INVALID_SEARCH; convert the search TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to Content Engine 5.1 and migrating text collection indexes from Legacy Content Search Services (LCSE) previously created search templates are failing. 

SYMPTOM
Error Message:
The search could not be completed. The "Search Template name here" search is not compatible with the content search engine that is configured for the object stores that are included in the search. Ask your system administrator to use the Search Designer to convert the search to a compatible search type.

Exception Class:
com.filenet.wcm.toolkit.util.WcmException


CAUSE
When Legacy Content Search Services (LCSE) is no longer on the P8 environment search templates needs to be converted when using Workplace XT.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Search templates created when P8 was using LCSE Verity need to be converted when LCSE no longer is in the environment. Using Workplace XT if you check out a current search template, then check it back again it should ask you if you want to convert it, to using IBM Content Search Services, to which you select Yes. 

AE Workplace works a little different in that it does not ask you this. Using AE Workplace in order to update the search templates the following can be done;

- Check out search template and remove the content criteria
- Check in the search template
- Check it out again and re-add the content criteria then check it back in

*Note* Disabling IBM Legacy Content Search Engine cannot be reversed. Make sure that the index migration process is completed and searches are working correctly on IBM Content Search Services before you disable IBM Legacy Content Search Engine
