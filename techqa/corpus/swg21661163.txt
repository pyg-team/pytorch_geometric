QUESTION
 IBM HTTP Server uses password protected KDB files as their key store files. A user can set a password expiration date; or set it to never expire. How can a user run a command to check the password expiration information of a KDB file? 

CAUSE
IBM HTTP Server Information Center does not describe how to check password expiration.

ANSWER
Since GSKit level 7.0.4.11, gks7cmd command can check password expiry information. However, IBM HTTP Server Information Center does not describe how to check it. 

If you are using IKEYMAN to manage a key store file, it is easy to check password expiry. Click Key Database File from the main user interface, then click Display Password Expiry. A pop-up window will show the password expiry information. 

The syntax for displaying the expiry of the password associated with a key database
with gsk7cmd is as follows:
gsk7cmd -keydb -expiry -db <name> [-pw <passwd>] 

 

GSKit ships with another command, gsk7capicmd, which does not depend on Java. It can also check the expiry of the password associated with a kdb database. Its syntax is described in the following PDF file:
GSKCapiCmd Userâ€™s Guide [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/library/v61/ihs/GSK7c_CapiCmd_UserGuide.pdf]


These two commands will give the same information. However, the text of these commands' output are different. 

 

Although the Information Center does not describe the syntax to check password expiry, you can get a hint from gsk7cmd command help. When you do "gsk7cmd -help" from <web_server_root>/bin, you will see the '-expiry' action under '-keydb' object. 

 

Version 8.0 or higher ships GSKit 8.0. It no longer has gsk7cmd or gsk7capicmd. Instead, you should use gskcmd or gskcapicmd. These commands are run from the /HTTPServer/bin directory. 

 

By the way, many other IBM products use GSKit. The information described in this technote may not be applicable to those products. If you have problem checking password expiry information of the key store file used by another product, please open a PMR with the support team of that product. 

Password expiry for keystores is deprecated in GSKit version 8 and later, and may not be present in future releases.
