ANSWER
Background 
Several IBM ECM products contain digitally signed jar files that use a Java security certificate which expires on February 19, 2015. Most of these products already have newer releases that use an updated digital certificate. Customers will need to upgrade to these releases to avoid running with an expired Java security certificate.

For most products, expired certificates only affect java applets. The impact on product functionality depends on the version of JRE being used. For JRE versions lower than 1.7.0_51, a warning will be displayed informing the user that an expired certificate exists, and there will be an option to select “continue” as well as an option to remember the preference to continue. It is important to note that this is only a warning. For JRE versions of 1.7.0_51 or higher, the applets might not run. Please refer to the following tech note for more details.
Security warning messages or blocking for Java applets might occur in IBM ECM web clients because of changed signing requirements in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640073]

For the IDM Desktop products, certain executables, plug-ins and macros are also affected by the expired certificates and require re-signing. In these cases, an expired certificate may cause part of IDM Desktop to be blocked or may notify the end user that the application is unsecure.


When will the current Java certificate expire?

The Java Security certificate used in many IBM ECM products released in 2012 or earlier, will expire on February 19, 2015. However, most products already have new releases that use newer Java certificates that do not expire until 2016 or 2017. 


What IBM ECM products are affected? 

- IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine (AE)
- IBM FileNet Workplace XT (WPXT)
- IBM Content Navigator (ICN)
- IBM WEBi
- IBM eClient
- IBM CMOD Line Printer Viewer
- IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE)
- IBM FileNet P8 Process Engine (PE)
- IBM FileNet eProcess
- IBM FileNet IDM Desktop Web Services
- IBM FileNet IDM Open Client
- IBM FileNet Image Service Resource Adapter (ISRA)
- Daeja ViewONE

If your installed IBM ECM product is not listed here, it does not require resigned Jar files.


What will happen if I do not apply a resigned patch?

The behavior of modules with expired Java security certificates varies based on the nature of the module and the resources it is using. In general, if the JRE version being used is lower than 1.7.0_51 and the digital certificate expires, the browser will display a message dialog advising the user that the certificate has expired. This dialog will at most be displayed once per browser session the first time the expired signed jar file needs to be downloaded to the client browser. It is important to note that this message is simply a warning that is presented to the end user. Once the user selects "Run", the applet loads as expected. This certificate expiration will not cause any functional errors within the applets. Note that if the client browser has java caching enabled, the expired certificate message may not be displayed at all. 

For JRE versions of 1.7.0_51 or higher, the Java applets might not run. Please refer to the following tech note for more details.

Will IBM provide patches for the affected products?

IBM ECM has already provided interim fixes and/or fix packs for impacted products.

The attached PDF provides interim fix and fix pack information for each of the affected products. This document will be updated as further information becomes available.

Product versions identified in the PDF represent the minimum version that contains the new Java security certificate. All releases after the indicated version will contain the new certificate as well. This includes new releases, fix packs and interim fixes.

Where do I obtain the resigned patches?

The fixes referenced in the attached PDF can be found on IBM Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]


What if the version/patch of my IBM ECM product is not on the provided list?

You should plan to update each product to at least the minimum versions identified in the attached PDF. 

If updating is not possible, then there might be other options. 

1. If you are running with any version of JRE 1.6 or a version lower than JRE 1.7.0_51 and you already have your own valid signed Java security certificate from a trusted certificate authority, you can sign your ECM product jar files using your own certificate. A list of the required files for each product can be obtained from IBM Support.

2. If you are running with any version of JRE 1.6 or a version lower than JRE 1.7.0_51, you might also be able to create a self-signed Java security certificate and re-sign your ECM product jar files using this certificate. A list of the required files for each product can be obtained from IBM Support.

3. For some products you can request that specific ECM product jar files be re-signed on an exception basis. Note that product development may not be able to resign your specific level, and the process may take some time. To request an exception case, please contact IBM Support for assistance. You will need to open a PMR and provide IBM Support with the following information: 

- Business justification for the resign request stating: 
(a) the reason why you cannot upgrade to a patch level that already contains an updated Java certificate
(b) if you have a plan for upgrading your system to a patch level that contains an updated Java certificate in the future
(c) if you are on a product version that is past End of Support, that you have a support extension in place

- Release version and patch level of the product requested for Jar file resigning

Note that product development is not able to re-sign earlier versions of Application Engine and Workplace XT. Customers must use Application Engine 4.0.2.14 and either Workplace XT 1.1.5.2 IF1 or IF2.


How do we know the re-signed interim fixes and fix packs are compatible with our current installations?

The dependency matrices have been updated to include the released re-signed interim fixes and fix patches. The associated Readme files also contain dependency information. 

Compatibility matrices for P8 products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg27014734]
include the following products:
• IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine (AE)
• IBM FileNet P8 Process Engine (PE)
• IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine (CE)
• IBM FileNet Workplace XT (WPXT)
• IBM Content Navigator (ICN)

Compatibility matrices for FileNet legacy products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg27010082]
include the following products:
• IBM FileNet IDM Desktop Web Services
• IBM FileNet IDM Open Client
• IBM FileNet eProcess


How can I tell when the Java security certificate used in my current products will expire?

There are tools that can provide signed jar file certificate information. Please refer to this technote for additional details.
Viewing the Java security certificate in a Jar file [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696425]


After I upgrade to the new product releases that use the newer Java certificate, when will I need to upgrade again?

Active IBM ECM products such as IBM Content Navigator, FileNet Content Engine and FileNet Process Engine will incorporate newer Java certificates in to product releases each year. As long as you upgrade to at least one new interim fix and/or fix pack every 18 months, you will automatically pick up the new Java certificate.

Products on extended support will not automatically incorporate new Java certificates. Customers on these releases can request new Java certificates as needed (usually on the latest versions of the product).

What if I have other questions?

If you have any other questions about the Java re-certification for IBM ECM products, please contact IBM Support, Directory of worldwide contacts [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/]or open a PMR on-line via the Service Request [https://www-947.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/Home.action] tool.
