QUESTION
 How to collect data from IBM Datacap Taskmaster Clients and Servers. 

ANSWER
How to confirm the version of Taskmaster 

 1. Open the version.txt file (by default it is located in c:\Datacap). 
 2. Version.txt will not only contain the version information, but also the specific build number.

Issues encountered with the Taskmaster Server 

 1. Turn on both the Microsoft Windows Event logging and Datacap Tracing. Start -> All Programs -> Datacap -> Taskmaster Server -> Taskmaster Server Manager. 
 2. Click on the Logging Tab 
 3. System event log - If the issue is 100% reproducible (not intermittent), move Messaging Level to Info, critical, and serious. Once reproduced, send Windows Event Logs and move Messaging Level back to Critical Only. If the issue is very intermittent, set Messaging Level to Serious and Critical first.

 4. Datacap log - Verify that Output to file has been checked and the correct path has been specified in the text box. Note: moving the slider 2 notches from All is sufficient for troubleshooting. The All setting is for Datacap L3/Development.

 3. Click on the Log tab and verify that Enable log file has been checked. Remember that there will be multiple Taskmaster Client log files for a distributed Taskmaster Capture system (i.e. PC #1 is the Scanning station, PC #2 is the Rulerunner station, PC #3 is the Verify station, etc.). Collect all pertinent Taskmaster Client logs.
