Text:
ICA TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I use IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search 3.0.
I deploy ES P8 Remote Agent servlet on the FileNet P8 server.
According to Remote P8 Agent diagnostic page, "serviceuri" seems to be "iiop://<p8 server>:2809/FileNet/Engine" by default, however, my FileNet P8 server uses a different port number.
Can I modify the configuration for ES Remote P8 Agent servlet? 

ANSWER
To modify the configuration for ES Remote P8 Agent servlet: 

 1. Confirm that your "iiop//<p8 server>:<port number>/FileNet/Engine" works as expected with ES Remote P8 Agent diagnostic page. 
 2. Go to WebSphere application server installedApplication directory of FileNet P8 server and move into ESP8RemoteService installed directory. 
 3. Go to WEB-INF directory, open config.properties with a text editor, then you will find following lines that are commented out.
    ----------------------
    # URI string used for making P8 API EJB connection
    # By default, it's dynamically created based on local server name
    #param.serviceuri=iiop://<p8 server>:2809/FileNet/Engine 
    #
    # JAAS additional stanza name. By default it's "FileNetP8"
    #param.stanza=FileNetP8
    ---------------------- 
 4. Add the following line and save changes
    param.serviceuri=iiop://<p8 server>:<port number>/FileNet/Engine 
 5. Restart ESP8RemoteService application on FileNet P8 server 
 6. You should see "iop://<p8 server>:<port number>/FileNet/Engine" as default serviceuri at ES Remote P8 Agent diagnostic page.
