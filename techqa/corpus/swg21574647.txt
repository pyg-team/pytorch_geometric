QUESTION
 How to change session time out in TIP? 

ANSWER
The session time out can be controlled by modifying below files:
1. Make a backup copy of deployment.xml file before editing it.
2. Stop TIP server process.
3. Edit the following 

 * 
 * deployment.xml -
 * 


TIP 1.x:  * 


TIP 2.x: 
<TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc 

In this file, locate the following section and change the invalidationTimeout to a desired value (by default it is set to 30 minutes). If there is no activity in TIP for set time, the session will time out and user will be logged out of TIP. 

<tuningParams xmi:id="TuningParams_1226438889945" usingMultiRowSchema="false" maxInMemorySessionCount="1000" allowOverflow="true" schedule Invalidation="false" writeFrequency="TIME_BASED_WRITE" writeInterval="10" writeContents="ONLY_UPDATED_ATTRIBUTES" invalidationTimeout="30"> <invalidationSchedule xmi:id="InvalidationSchedule_1226438889946" firstHour="14" secondHour="2"/> 

4. Save the file and restart the TIP server process 

NOTE: 

In consoleProperties.xml which is located in 

TIP 1.x: <TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/applications/isclite.ear/deployments/isclite/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

TIP 2.x: <TIPHOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF 

The below property is to keep the TIP session alive for the time that is set. By default, it is set to 20 minutes. So, for every 20 minutes, it will make a call to TIP to keep it active so that the session will not get expired. 

<consoleproperties:console-property id="ISC.KEEPALIVE.INTERVAL" value="20"/> 

If you want the session to expire when there is no activity in TIP, please make sure that the above value is GREATER than the "invalidationTimeout" value that you set in deployment.xml.
