Title: IBM Switching TADDM to LDAP user registry to use SSL connection - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I currently have TADDM configured to use an LDAP User Registry for authentication. I plan to switch this configuration to use an SSL connection. What steps need to be taken and what TADDM properties will be affected? 

CAUSE
Updating LDAP user registry to use SSL.

ANSWER
If TADDM is already configured to authenticate with LDAP, and this is currently working correctly, we will focus on the properties necessary to support the SSL connection. First, you must set this property in collation.properties to tell TADDM to access LDAP over SSL. 

com.collation.security.auth.ldapUseSSL=true 

When you do this, you will need to also switch the ldap port to be the 
ldap's SSL port. The normal default port for SSL for LDAP is 636. Though, 
like most defaults, there is likely some way for the LDAP administrator 
to have customized this if they desired. 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapPortNumber=

The ldap server hostname stays the same unless you are using a 
different LDAP server: 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapHostName=

As well, unless you are using a different LDAP server with different 
credentials, there is no need to change the connection user or password when using SSL as opposed to just using the non-SSL connection. Just be sure these values are set to a BindDN and password that is able to bind successfully to the LDAP server.
com.collation.security.auth.ldapBindDN= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapBindPassword= 

Likewise, again unless you are using a different directory configuration, the following values are not affected by simply switching to use SSL: 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapBaseDN= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapBaseGroupDN= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapUserObjectClass= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapUIDNamingAttribute= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapGroupObjectClass= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapGroupNamingAttribute= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapGroupMemberAttribute= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapFollowReferrals= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapReferralLimit= 

In order to configure SSL between TADDM and an LDAP server, the following has to be done:
1) The LDAP server has to be enabled for SSL (based on the LDAP supplier's specifications - in general this involves creating a keystore and generating a server certificate to provide to the clients)
** Be sure the the server name used when generating the LDAP server 
certificate EXACTLY matches the name of the LDAP server as specified in 
the com.collation.security.auth.ldapHostName in collation.properties. 
You cannot , for example, use an IP or a short hostname in one but a 
fully qualified hostname in the other. ** 
2) Then on the TADDM server, you will need to import this LDAP server certificate into a truststore (jks) on the TADDM Server.
Update the following properties for TADDM to be able to locate and access this truststore: 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapClientTrustStore=
com.collation.security.auth.ldapClientTrustStorePassphrase=

This completes a 1-way SSL setup. For 2-way SSL, you would additionally need to: 
3) On the TADDM Server, configure a keystore (jks - can be the same store as the truststore in #2 above if desired) and generate a TADDM server 
certificate.
Update the following properties for TADDM to be able to locate and access this keystore: 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapClientKeyStore= 
com.collation.security.auth.ldapClientKeyStorePassphrase= 
4) Import this certificate into the LDAP server's truststore (again, based on
the LDAP supplier's specifications).

From a TADDM perspective, the tools you use for generating these keystores and certificates is left up to the SSL administrator's discretion. The TADDM keystore and truststore, as stated above, must be JKS. Refer to the LDAP provider's documentation for their requirements.
