ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description of Problem (full details)
   IBM Case manager is throwing CDEWG4230E error.
   
   Using FileNet Case Manager; open a case in IE 8. Select Edit in
   the Case Data Widget. Enter a value into any field. Press Save.
   
   Browser hangs for a long period (30-60 seconds). Get error "Case
   data could not be updated. (CDEWG4230E)"
   
   Same operation on Firefox works fine.
   
   
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Issue appeared after using case manager with IE 8.
   
   
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : yes
   
   Is there a workaround? : no
   
   What is the impact to the customer/system? : Unable to use IE8
   with Case Manager
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Yes
   By Who (L3, Support, etc.)
   
   Comment from L3:
   1. I copied the customer solution and deploy it in the local
   environment. Now, we can reproduce the customer issue. There are
   many groups and many properties in the Loan Case type. We
   suspect the issue is related to large ATOM parse in IE8.
   
   2. Reduce all properties that defined in Case Data, then add the
   properties by 30 every time. It works in IE8 till all
   properties are added. The difference with the original solution
   is that there is no group after update.
   
   3. This is a performance issue indeed.   The root cause of all
   different issue behaviors happening in customer's environment
   and
   dev's environment is the memory usage problem that happens in
   Case
   Data widget during the processing of large number of displaying
   properties. In investigation, we found IE8 will take more than
   1G memory
   in saving and rendering this type of case instance.  While IE
   occupied more than 1G memory, it works abnormally most of the
   
   time - the saving PUT request is not sent out at all though
   httpWatch reports that the request is sent out, and the return
   error code is a fake code since there is no real xhrPUT request
   sent out.  After updating some codes in Case Data and reducing
   the memory usage of Case Data, the saving action works normally
   on IE.
   
   Firefox has better memory management in JavaScript app, so it
   has no
   issue.
   
   I will test whether IE9 has better performance behavior later.
   And this issue should be a defect in ICM5.0.0.2.  I will double
   check  whether the ICM5.1 has the similar issue.
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   Using FileNet Case Manager, open a case in IE 8. Select Edit in
   the Case Data Widget. Enter a value into any field. Press Save.
   
   Browser hangs for a long period (30-60 seconds). Get error "Case
   data could not be updated. (CDEWG4230E)"
   
   Same operation on Firefox works fine.
