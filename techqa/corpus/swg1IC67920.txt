APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying a proxy gateway and creating virtual service
   within a proxy group a WSDL is used. If this WSDL only included
   SOAP 1.2 endpoints the WSDL will not be processed and the
   following error will be seen:
   CWSXM6008W:  A request to read the WSDL document
   http://localhost:9080/ServicesWeb/OrderV2_OrderHttpService/WEB-I [http://localhost:9080/ServicesWeb/OrderV2_OrderHttpService/WEB-I]
   NF/wsdl/Test_OrderV2.wsdl failed to find any services.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Integration Developer     *
   *                 v7.0.0.1 using a Proxy Gateway Pattern to    *
   *                 generate a Proxy Gateway mediation and       *
   *                 adding a SOAP 1.2 import. Once the module    *
   *                 is deployed to WebSphere Enterprise          *
   *                 Service Bus v7.0.0.1, virtual services for   *
   *                 the proxy gateway can be configured using    *
   *                 BusinessSpace by pointing to the WSDL        *
   *                 provided by a service endpoint. However,     *
   *                 BusinessSpace fails to recognise SOAP 1.2    *
   *                 services.                                    *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Services with WSDL containing SOAP      *
   *                      1.2 cannot be used to create a          *
   *                      virtual service via BusinessSpace.      *

   ****************************************************************
   Users can define a proxy gateway and add SOAP 1.2 imports via
   a WebSphere Integration Developer Proxy Gateway Pattern. When
   the proxy gateway module is deployed to WebSphere Enterprise
   Service Bus or WebSphere Process Server, BusinessSpace is used
   to define the services (as virtual services) that the proxy
   gateway will access.  To do this BusinessSpace allows you to
   point at a service endpoint WSDL description (e.g.
   http://hostname/endpointname?wsdl) which it then processes.
   However, services containing WSDL that is based on SOAP 1.2
   fail to be read correctly.
