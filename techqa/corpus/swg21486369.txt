Title: IBM Unable to start 'Sentinel RMS License Manager' Windows Service - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have installed the latest version of the Sentinel RMS License Manager. Installation completes without any error message, however I am unable to start 'Sentinel RMS License Manager' Windows Service.

How do I work around this problem? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem can occur under a number of conditions including the following:

1) Recent unscheduled shutdown/restart of hardware server.
2) Recent update of operating system (particularly a security update).

The specific characteristics of the behavior are:

1) Sentinel RMS License Manager unable to distribute licenses to client computer.
2) No 'Subnet Servers' present in the Sentinel RMS Server Administration (WLMAdmin) tool.
3) Inability to start the 'Sentinel RMS License Manager' Windows Service and/or error when attempting to start the Service.
4) Port 5093 and/or Port 5099 in use for UDP.

The behavior is caused by:

The 'Sentinel RMS License Manager' Windows Service cannot start because port 5093 (and/or 5099) is in use. The 'Sentinel RMS License Manager' Windows Service requires the ability to acquire this port for communication between the Sentinel RMS License Manager server(s) and/or the client computers to send and receive network licenses. During the shut-down/restart and/or update process, ports 5093/5099 

To resolve the problem:

This problem can only be corrected by forcing the process using ports 5093/5099 to cease to use the port. Performing this task depends upon the server operating system on which the Sentinel RMS License Manager is installed. If your operating system provides a mechanism to 'clear' an application/process from using an active port, then use this mechanism. Should your operating system not provide such a mechanism, the action known to consistently correct this behavior on server operating systems is a complete shut-down and start-up of the hardware server upon which the Sentinel RMS License Manager is installed
