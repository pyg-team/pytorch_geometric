APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When viewing exposed process values (EPVs) in the Process Admin
   Console (Admin Tools > Manage EPVs) the Description section
   displays HTML code tags instead of the description text.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IBM BPM V7.5.xx, the description of EPVs was stored in plain
   text. In IBM BPM V8.x, the text is stored in HTML. Security
   fixes ported from the V7.5.x versions still use the plain text
   format, which shows the HTML source text instead of the
   description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in an IBM BPM V8.5.6 cumulative fix that
   corrects the rendering to display the text again instead of the
   HTML.
   
   To determine whether the cumulative fix is available and
   download it if it is, complete the following steps on Fix
   Central:
   
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
     the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
     level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   
   2. Select Text, enter ?cumulative fix?, and click Continue.
