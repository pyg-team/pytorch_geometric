RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Steps to resolve this issue: 

 

 1. Add this new parameter, useBrowserAlertOnShutdown=false to the wcmJavaViewer.jsp that the Workplace XT is using and it's typically in the following location: 
    
    ViewOne Standard Viewer: <XT_install_path>\FileNet\WebClient\WorkplaceXT\UI-INF\jsp\ui
    ViewOne Professional: <XT_install_path>\FileNet\WebClient\WorkplaceXT\UI-INF\jsp\ui\iviewpro\
    
    Per the documentation link below, this parameter did not exist in 4.0.x but implemented in 4.1.x to support browser changes.http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTPHR_4.1.5/com.ibm.viewone.configuring/dvopr458.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTPHR_4.1.5/com.ibm.viewone.configuring/dvopr458.htm]
    
    
 2. There's another parameter annotationAutoPrompt relating to the prompt to save annotation and the default value is "true". Ensure this is not set to false.
    
    
 3. Change to the customer deploy directory 
    <XT_install_Path>\WebClient\deploy\ , backup and delete the existing web_client.war and web_client.ear. 
    Run the shell script to create a new war file "./create_web_client_war.sh" 
    Run the shell script to create a new ear file "./create_web_client_ear.sh" 
    
    
 4. Redeploy IBM FileNet Workplace XT to your web application server and restart the application. Ensure to delete the client browser cache, Java cache, viewer cache and the application server cache.
