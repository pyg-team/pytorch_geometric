Title: IBM Is it possible to change a username id in Maximo - United States

Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This documentation provides info about questions for changing username ids in Maximo 

SYMPTOM
For example: If a user Jane Smith (JSMITH) gets married and wants to use her new married name (Martin), is there a way to change her existing maximo account to JMARTIN ? 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The MAXUSER.USERID - this specific field identifies the user. The name or value must be unique for all User records. 

This explains why the MAXUSER.USERID in the Maximo Users application is Read Only and it cannot be changed on the Maximo UI (User interface). 

There is no current way to change the USERID value for an user once they are created. 

However, you can change the LOGINID, and you could create a new PERSON record if necessary and associate the new Person record. 

In the User application, the User Name (LOGINID) can be changed, this is the value used to login to Maximo. 

But the User value (USERID) is unique and cannot be changed. Maximo does not allow changing username due to audit purposes.

You can create a new specific user with all the new corresponding information to suit the new name that the user now has. 

Should you need any assistance, please contact IBM Maximo Support.
