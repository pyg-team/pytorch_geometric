 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document describes the system requirements for Optim High Performance Unload for DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows Version 6.1 

CONTENT


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Optim High Performance Unload performs high-speed, bulk data unloads for DB2 databases.

Optim High Performance Unload is a standalone utility program. It can run while the DB2Â® database manager is running and accesses the same physical files as the DB2 database manager. It can also run in a standalone mode and as a DB2 stored procedure.

You can run Optim High Performance Unload exclusively from the command line, or you can specify a control file for more complex unloads with the -f command-line option.

For more information, see Installation requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSC6UE_6.1.0/inmucon_installreq.html].
