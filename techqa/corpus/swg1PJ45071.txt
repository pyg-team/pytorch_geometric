APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Opening a viewer mapped document from the Case Information
   widget, when configured to open in a separate window, will cause
   the document to open in a separate viewer window.  When opening
   the first document in the Viewer, the focus will be shifted to
   the viewer window from the window where the Case is displayed.
   When opening a second document, the viewer window will add
   another tab and render the 2nd document, but it will not shift
   the
   focus to the viewer window.  If the viewer window is behind
   other windows on the desktop, the user will have to click to
   find the viewer window to see the rendered document.
   
   This only happens with the following conditions:
   1) Using the Chrome browser.  This works fine in Firefox and
   Internet Explorer, the focus will shift to the viewer window
   correctly.
   2) When opening the document within ICM pages.  Opening the 2nd
   separate documents using the ICN browse feature will put the
   focus on the Viewer window correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Possible workarounds:
   - Use the embedded viewer widget on the ICM page, and have the
   document open in the embedded viewer instead.
   - Close the viewer window after you are done viewing the
   document
   - Use Mozilla FireFox or Internet Explorer browser.
