APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After retrieving documents with circular relationships using the
   WSRR Content View in Studio, selecting 'Show Relationships'
   triggers a StackOverflowError.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When documents that have a circular dependency are retrieved by
   WSRR Studio and shown in the 'WSRR Content View', selecting
   'Show Relationships' will cause the following error as shown in
   the log:
   
   !MESSAGE Unhandled event loop exception
   !STACK 0
   java.lang.StackOverflowError
   at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.windowProc(Display.java:4541)
   at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SendMessageW(Native Method)
   at org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.SendMessage(OS.java:3012)
   at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree.CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT(Tree.java:925)
   at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree.wmNotifyChild(Tree.java:7143)
   ...
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Studio attempted to recursively expand the cicular relationship
   that leads to the StackOverflowError.
   
   The code has been modified to check for and handle this
   situation so that the StackOverflowError no longer occurs.
   
   The fix for this is targeted for inclusion in Fix Pack 3.
