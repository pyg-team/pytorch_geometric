ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: SAP CUA adapter 4.65.1009 does not cause the PASSCODE to
   be
   generated on a password change transaction as occurs during an
   add
   provisioning operation.
   
   Problem description:
   
   Customer states:
   
   "On a password change request, a new password isn't getting
   properly
   sent
   down to the child systems. With SAP version 7, there is both a
   BCODE and
   PASSCODE field on the user accounts. BCODE is there for backward
   compatability with
   pre-version 7 systems. In our environment, that means uppercase
   and 8
   characters. the PASSCODE is the "new" field and will accept up
   to a 40
   character password, in mixed case. It's this
   passcode that's not being replicated down to the child systems,
   and our
   SAP person believes he has found why in the BAPI that is called
   on a
   change (/TIVSECTY/TIM_USER_USR02_620). He sees where it copies
   the BCODE
   value down but not the PASSCODE."
   
   IF agrees with the customer's assessment and has asked to have
   an apar
   raised.
   
   Steps to duplicate:
   
   IF has duplicated per customer description of problem.
   
   
   Customer Recreate:
   
   Yes.
   
   
   Desired behavior:
   
   PASSCODE to be propagated to child systems on password
   change operation as it is on add operation.
