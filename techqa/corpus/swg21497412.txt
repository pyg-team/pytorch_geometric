Title: IBM Setting a default rule project for a specific user in Decision Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In Decision Center, can I specify the default rule project for the "Project in use" field in the Home tab when a user signs in for the first time? 

ANSWER
When you open Decision Center, you access the project you were working on the last time you closed, or the default rule project for first time users. By default the rule project is the first one in the list of existing projects in Decision Center. 

If you want to change the default rule project, use the set-config-param ant task to set the property last_project for a given user. 

For example, the following command sets the default rule project to myRuleProject for user myUser: 

ant set-config-param -Dkey=last_project -Dvalue=myRuleProject -Duser=myUser

When myUser signs in to Decision Center for the first time, the project shown in the "Project in use" field will be myRuleProject. 

For more information on the set-config-param ant task, refer to this documentation section [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global273.html?resultof=%22%73%65%74%2d%63%6f%6e%66%69%67%2d%70%61%72%61%6d%22%20].
