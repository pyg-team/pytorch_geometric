APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Stored procedure stage: When stored proc does not update any
   rows, it returns CLI_NO_DATA and aborts the job.
   
   Customer is running server job with STP stage. The STP stage
   invokes a stored procedure that updates a table. If the update
   actually updates rows, the call completes successfully. However,
   if the update does not update any rows, CLI_NO_DATA is returned
   and the entire job fails. The customer does not want the job to
   fail when this happens.
