PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to search PDM documents from the Search center portlet. When you go under Portal Administration >> Manage Search >> Search Scopes, you find that the default "Library Documents" scope is disabled by the system. 

SYMPTOM
PDM document search results are not returned by the Search center portlet.


CAUSE
This problem can happen after you upgrade the portal server. The PDM search scope and collection is hard-coded by the portal search engine.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use these steps to resolve the problem:


 1. Assuming that you are using a stand-alone portal server, you should have a "Default Content Model Search Service". Delete this search service as follows: 
    (Note: Doing this will delete all the collections created under this search service; however, they can be created again when done. Be sure to export each collection before these steps to ease in re-creating them.)  * Go to WebSphere Portal Administrative console 
     * Administration >> Manage search >> Search Services 
     * Delete "Default Content Model Search Service" (As noted above, this step will delete all the collections created under this search service. You need to export each collection before running this step, otherwise you will have to recreate all the collections again.) 
     * Restart the portal server, and make sure that "DefaultContentModelCollection" is created under "Search Collections" 
    
    
 2. Then publish any document using PDM portlet. This should make the default "Library Document" scope active again.
