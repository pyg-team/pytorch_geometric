QUESTION
 Why after upgrading IBM WebSphere Portal to version 6.0.1.4 is Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software v7 no longer able to publish to the server? 

CAUSE
In WebSphere Portal 6.0.1.4, a change to the communication protocol that Rational Application Developer uses to speak to the server was made. Rational Application Developer v7.0.0.7 and below do not yet support this protocol change.

ANSWER
A fix for this is available in Rational Application Developer v7.0.0.8 and later. 


Compatibility with WebSphere Portal 6.0.1.4 can be restored by upgrading to the latest version of Rational Application Developer v7.
