Title: IBM DataPower HTTP Service uses non-persistent connections - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does an HTTP Service configured on a DataPower appliance use persistent connections? 

CAUSE
Persistent connections should be disabled if using locally chained services in a DataPower Appliance. See Best Practices for WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances local interface traffic. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934] 


If a local HTTP Service handles local interface traffic, there may be a concern whether the HTTP Service uses persistent connections and, if so, how to disable persistent connections.


ANSWER
The HTTP Service on a DataPower Appliance does not use persistent connections. This means that there should be no concern about disabling persistent connections for this particular use case. 

This can be further observed by examining the HTTP Service response. For example: 

A GET request responds with an HTTP 1.0 response and a connection:close header.
