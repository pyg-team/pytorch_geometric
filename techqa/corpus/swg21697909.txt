PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you attempt to register an image using IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator, the user interface displays a "Failed retrieving images for the selected cloud group." error. 

SYMPTOM
The IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator user interface displays the following error: 

Failed retrieving images for the selected cloud group.
Error details: OpenStack reported the following message: com.ibm.openstack.api.OpenStackBadResponseException: Error 403: AuthenticationFailed 




The following error is seen in the Virtual Image Library SystemOut.log file:

...


CAUSE
Before the WebSphere Application Server 8.0.0 Fix Pack 9 upgrade, SSLv3 was enabled. The new version of Java has the SSLv3 capability disabled, by default, for security purposes.


ENVIRONMENT
This issue applies to IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator V2.3.0 Fix Pack 1 (2.3.0.1) and the Virtual Image Library with WebSphere Application Server V8.0.0 Fix Pack 9 (8.0.0.9).



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the Virtual Image Library SystemOut.log file on Central Server 2 (CS2), which exists in the /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/imageLibraryProfile/logs/imageLibraryServer/* directory.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Enable SSLv3 for Java in WebSphere Application Server.
    
    
 2. Restart the services.


You can then disable SSLv3 in the global WebSphere settings. RELATED INFORMATION
