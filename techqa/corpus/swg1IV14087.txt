APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After applyng 6.22 fp7, events that have a display item
   containing quotes are not processed correctly and fail to
   correlate properly after the display item is truncated during
   process prior to sending the event from the SUF to the TEMS.
   This causes the correlation of the events to fail since the
   display items no longer have an exact match.
   
   This issue is a result of the changes introduced for
   APAR IV04696 released in 6.22 fp7
   which provided script changes for the SUF to address
   issues with white space in the display item of events.  Those
   changes introduced an issue with the processing of display items
   with quotes.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local fix:  Remove the quotes from the display items
   
   Recreate:
   
   1. Create a situation that, when raised, will contain quotes in
   the
   situation_displayitem field.
   2. Configure the situation to forward to OMNIbus EIF probe.
   3. Clear or acknowledge the alert in the OMNIbus server.
   
   Results:
   1. The situation in ITM is not updated.
   2. The display item passed to ITM is incorrect, as observed in
   the event
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Bi-directional synchronization of a situation event consisting
   of a display item with single or double quotes does not work.
   
   
   The external procedures that handle synchronization invoke shell
   or batch scripts that do not handle the quotes correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  External procedures will no longer be used to handle the
   bi-directional synchronization. Instead, database query commands
   that write directly to the Situation Update Forwarder cache file
   will be used.
   
   Note: The Tivoli EIF Probe for OMNIbus must be at level 10.4 or
   later.  The probe must have the fix for escaped single-quotes,
   APAR IV03958 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV03958], for the display item to be correct in OMNIbus.
