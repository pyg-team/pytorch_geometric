ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Lotus Mobile Connect Mobility Client for Nokia devices has a
   problem with the Nokia E71x device.  The external symptom will
   show that the Mobility Client is able to be installed correctly,
   and the End User can create its first connection and connect
   fine.  However, after this the User Interface will not start at
   all.
   This problem is isolated to the Nokia E71x device.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install the temporary fix once it becomes available from the
   Lotus Mobile Connect Level 2 support team.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the Nokia E71x from AT&T            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Once a user installs Lotus Mobile       *
   *                      Connect (LMC) on an E71x they may       *
   *                      experience a hang or exit from the LMC  *
   *                      UI once they configure an account,      *
   *                      start LMC or attempt a connection.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Only install the version of LMC 6.1.3 with   *
   *                 this fix on teh E71x device.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   LMC creates proxy records in the PROXIES table when logging on
   to an account.  However, the proxy record was not being
   read appropriately and LMC was reading a Proxy record that
   had been written by AT&T rather than LMC.  Since AT&T
   also locked the record for update, LMC was getting an error
   and aborting the logon attempt.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A formal fix for this problem will be included in all product
   releases AFTER 6.1.3.  Until that time a temporary fix may be
   obtained from the IBM Lotus Mobile Connect Support Center.
