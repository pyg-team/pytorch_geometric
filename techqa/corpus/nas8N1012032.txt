Title: IBM Using Kerberos Authentication to an HTTP Server That Does Not Use the Standard Port 80 - United States

Text:
EIM; HTTP; Kerberos; SIGNON TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using an HTTP server that is listening on a port other than the standard port of 80, the Kerberos principal needs to have this as part of the host name. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When using an HTTP server that is listening on a port other than the standard port of 80, the Kerberos principal needs to have this as part of the host name; for example, HTTP/www.mycompany.com:8080@MYCOMPANY.COM. 

To add this principal in qshell, you should type the following:

keytab add HTTP/www.mycompany.com:8080@MYCOMPANY.COM -p password

where www.mycompany.com:8080 is the host name and port for the HTTP server 
MYCOMPANY.COM is the Windows domain
password is the Active Directory server account password 

The Active Directory account needs to be added with the same principal name.
