 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
There are multiple vulnerabilities in the IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2018-1301 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1301]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds access error after a header size limit has been reached reading the HTTP header. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the service to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140852 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140852] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

CVEID: CVE-2017-15715 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15715]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the < FilesMatch > expression matching '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename instead of the end of the filename. By matching the trailing portion of the filename, an attacker could exploit to bypass security controls that use the < FilesMatch > directive.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140857 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140857] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-15710 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15710]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HTTPD is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds memory write error. By sending a specially crafted Accept-Language header value, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the service to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140858 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140858] for the current score
