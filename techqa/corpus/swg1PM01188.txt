APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a step used a filter set, but the filter set made no matches,
   AND the step timed out - the step would be marked
   as passing.
   Without using filters, the timeout would fail the step, and if t
   here are no matches the step _should_ behave as if there were no
    filter sets used.
   
   Issue is similar to previous Build Forge 7.0.1 ifix1 defect PK53
   618.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   - Create project with a single step.
   - Create filter that is used to 'Set Fail' when pattern is match
   ed.
   ie: Action: Set Fail, Pattern: Failure
   
   - Configure step to timeout after 1 minute (60 seconds).
   - Set step to perform system sleep for over 1 minute.
   ie.
   sleep 120
   *Cannot use dot command .sleep, as this setting will override th
   e step timeout.
   
   - Run project
   
   Expected result:
   
   Step will fail due to timeout setting.
   
   Actual result:
   
   Step will stop after timeout is reached and be marked as 'Passed
   '.
   
   Workaround:
   
   None
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a step timeout occurs and a log filter is applied to the
   step the step will report a  pass when the step should fail
   as a timeout occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added checking to look for agent side timeouts.  If one is
   found then the filter should now return a fail.
