APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The PackageArch= parameter specified in the KNTWICMA.ver file
   for the Windows OS Agent (Itanium) incorrectly is specified
   as WINNT. The parameter should be specified as WIA64.  This
   requires a change to the .xml file that is used by BundleGen
   to produce the WIA64 package.
   
   This problem exists since ITM 621 FP3.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   1. Install ITM 622 FP2 Windows OS Agent (Itanium) on Windows
      2003 Itanium endpoint.
   2. Install ITM 622 FP2 TEMS on any Windows machine
   3. Execute:
       tacmd addbundles -i
       Z:\itm\622\fp3\rtm\tmv622mdx-d0249a-201009131023\upgrade\
       6.2.2-TIV-ITM_TMV-Agents-FP0003\WINDOWS\Deploy -t NT
   
       tacmd addbundles -i
       Z:\itm\622\fp3\rtm\tmv622mdx-d0249a-201009131023\upgrade\
       6.2.2-TIV-ITM_TMV-Agents-FP0003\WIA64\Deploy
   4. Execute:
        tacmd updateAgent -n <endpoint:NT> -t NT
   5. Observe that the following message is retured and the
      endpoint Agent is not updated.
   
      Error Message [An unexpected error occurred. The NT agent
      was restarted but the agent version is not as expected.
      Current agent version is 06220300 and the expected version
      is 06220500 .
   6. Also observe the failure message which appears in the
      "Abort IBM Tivoli Monitoring YYYMMDD HHMM.log file:
      8-11-2011 16:38:38 RC_INFO: Unsupported platform: WIA64
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To immediately workaround this problem, if the file on the
   endpoint machine:
   
   %Candle_Home%\InstallITM\ver\KNTWICMA.ver
   
   is edited with the following line changed from:
   
   PlatformArch=WINNT
   
   to
   
   PlatformArch=WIA64
   
   the updateAgent process will work as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Platform type of ITM Windows OS Agent for Itanium is wrongly
   reported in file KNTWICMA.ver
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Platform type in KNTWICMA.ver has been replaced with the
   correct value (WIA64)
