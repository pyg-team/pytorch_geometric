 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When generating an MS-Excel table in MS-Word, some of the 'tails' of letters are cut off. 

CAUSE
The wrong 'option' (at least, exactly) is used for the MS-Word table.
The rows in MS-Excel are showing the cutoff letters (requirement for a specific row height).

ENVIRONMENT
All Cognos Disclosure Management and Microsoft Office versions

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The row height in a MS-Word table has the following two options: "at least" and
"exactly".

This attribute can be controlled when generating Excel ranges in CDM:





- when at least one cell of a row in an MS-Excel printable range has the Wrap Text attribute on, then the entire row will be generated with the MS-Word "at least" attribute. This means that whatever cuts you might have in MS-Excel due to the row height, won't be reflected in the generated Word 


- when none of the cells that are part of an MS-Excel printable range have the Wrap Text attribute on, then the entire row will be generated with the MS-Word "exactly" attribute. This means that whatever cuts you might have in Excel due to the row height, will be reflected in the generated Word
