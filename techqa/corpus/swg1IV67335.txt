PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Ad hoc report users.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Users can perform a "Save As" of an ad hoc report by opening *
   * the report in Edit mode and changing the report title, then  *
   * saving.  This leaves the original report unmodified and      *
   * creates a new report that includes the modifications.  When  *
   * attempting this action with a report that does not use a     *
   * report object structure, users receive the error             *
   * "BMXAA8093E: The report could not be created and the cause   *
   * of the error cannot be determined."                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Install the appropriate iFix package.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

   the duplicated report.
