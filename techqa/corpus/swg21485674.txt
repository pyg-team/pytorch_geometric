 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using an IBM SPSS Statistics product. My product is configured to use a network license. When I start the Statistics program I am receiving an error message: 'A fatal error has occurred and the client can no longer communicate with the server.' The Statistics program opens. The 'Output1' window indicates a licensing error and the 'IBM SPSS Statistics processor is unavailable' message appears near the bottom of the Statisics window. I cannot use the program. How can I fix this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are multiple causes for this behavior.

The most common causes of this error are:

1) Incompatibility between the version of the Sentinel License RMS Licene Manager technology of the client and server.
2) Incorrect permissions settings on the local computer or user account.

If this error appears as a result of (1), the problem can be corrected by updating to the most recent version of Sentinel RMS License Manager version whenever updating/upgrading the IBM SPSS products licensed by a License Manager.

If this error appears as the result of (2), then applying the information below regarding the proper setting of Windows folder/file/registry permissions should correct the problem.

To run the Statistics program on a Microsoft Windows operating system requires a user account with the following settings -- for both operating system version and product version:

***Windows XP - Folder Permissions***
C:\Windows\system32 - Write
C:\Windows\Temp - Write
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SafeNet Sentinel - Modify
SPSS product installation directory - Modify

***Windows Vista & later - Folder Permissions***
C:\Windows\system32 - Write
C:\Windows\Temp - Write
C:\ProgramData\SafeNet Sentinel - Modify
Statistics product installation directory - Modify

***Statistics 15 or earlier - Registry Permissions***
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SPSS - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SPSS - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ntpad - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rainbow Technologies - Full Control

***Statistics 16 and later - Registry Permissions***
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Prefs - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Prefs - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ntpad - Full Control
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rainbow Technologies - Full Control
