ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Windows agent does not provide metrics related to VMware
   performance counters that are installed directly by WMware
   tools.
   The objective of the APAR is to provide two new attribute groups
   to provide this information:
   
   VM Memory
   VM Processors

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Windows agent does not provide metrics related to VMware
   perofrmance counters that are installed directly by VMware.
   
   Windows agent does not provide metrics related to VMware
   performance counters that are installed directly by WMware
   tools.  The objective of the APAR is to provide two new
   attribute groups to provide this information:
    - VM Memory: attributes to create situations that monitor
      counter information for VMware memory.
    - VM Processor: attributes to create situations that monitor
      counter information for VMware processor.
   
    Note: VMware Tools v5.0 or higher is a prerequisite for support
   for these new attribute groups.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added two new attribute groups to collect VMware performance
   counters (VM Memory and VM Processor).
