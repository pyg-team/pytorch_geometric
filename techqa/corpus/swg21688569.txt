WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

For the following bulleted components please use the following security bulletin from WebSphere in order to prevent the usage of SSL v3 by the server:

"Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173]" (#1687173)


 *  IBM Telephony Application Server (TAS) 


Please note that access to the admin pages for the Common Management Portal may still be using SSL v3. However, these communications should occur within a protected network, and are therefore considered less of a risk. IBM currently intends to release fixes for this shortly via this Security Bulletin.
