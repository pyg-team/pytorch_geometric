QUESTION
 In Cognos Report studio, there is a 'Solve Order' property that can be applied to certain types of data items. Is there an equivalent property in Workspace Advanced?

2) Navigate to the report in Cognos Connection. 

3) Click the 'Open with Report Studio' button under 'Actions' beside the report. 

4) In Report Studio, select the column header of the data item whose solve order you wish to change. 

5) In the properties pane you can edit the 'Solve order' value. 

6) Save the report. 

7) Open the report in Workspace Advanced again. 

The data item's values should now reflect the change in solve order.
