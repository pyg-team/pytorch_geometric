   ****************************************************************
   WebSphere Process Server caches EJB stubs that point to
   modules registered by the SCA runtime. These registered names
   can change when the application is restarted because a list of
   services queried by the SCA runtime and used to construct the
   module name does not have a pre-determined order. Therefore
   the Process Server stubs can fall out of sync with the SCA
   runtime and no longer find these services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SCA runtime no longer includes the specific service name
   as part of the registered module name. It cannot change
   between application restarts and will not fall out of sync
   with the Process Server stubs.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 1.0.1.15.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates

   The WebSphere Application Server V8.0.0.4 fix for this APAR
   will be delivered via APAR PM62057 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM62057]
