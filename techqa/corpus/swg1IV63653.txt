APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  RAS1 logs of the UNIX OS agent get flooded by error messages
   during the monitoring of processes. These errors are related to
   the UTF8 conversion of empty strings and they are harmless.
   They should not be printed at the default RAS1 trace level.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   Unix OS Agent release 6.30.02.06 and 6.30 FP3
   
   Diagnostics:
   Check RAS1 logs for messages like these:
   (53E3FA25.0190-E:kux03agt.cpp,784,"TakeSample") Error
   converting user name to UTF8; no conversion occurred.
   (53E3FA25.0191-E:kux03agt.cpp,795,"TakeSample") Error
   converting group name to UTF8; no conversion occurred.
   (53E3FA25.0192-E:kux03agt.cpp,804,"TakeSample") Error converting
   effective user name to UTF8; no conversion occurred.
   (53E3FA25.0193-E:kux03agt.cpp,813,"TakeSample") Error converting
   effective group name to UTF8; no conversion occurred.
   (53E3FA25.0194-E:kux03agt.cpp,834,"TakeSample") Error
   converting zone name to UTF8; no conversion occurred.
   They are repeated for some of the monitored processes, every
   time the Process group data collection takes place.
   
   Initial Impact: Medium

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Redundant UTF8 conversion errors in UNIX OS agent RAS1 logs.
   
   The RAS1 logs of the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS get flooded by
   error messages during the monitoring of processes.  These
   messages are related to UTF8 conversions of empty Unicode
   attributes and should not be actually printed out.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fixed to no longer print these error messages in the RAS1
   logs.
