APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You would like to install IBM SPSS Statistics 23 on Macintosh
   operating systems OSX 10.9.x or 10.10.x. Your macintosh computer
   interface use Japanese language. When you open Terminal.app on
   these computers and run the command Locale
   you see the system locale is Japanese as well:
   
   LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8"
   
   You downloaded the installer file for release 23
   SPSSSC_23.0_MAC_OS_ML.dmg on the Mac desktop and start the
   installer. However, on some Macintosh computer the installer
   does not start in Japanese language, whereas on other Macintosh
   computer the installer launch with Japanese language.
   
   This issue does not happen on each Macintosh computer 10.9 or
   10.10. The installer for Macintosh is created by a third party
   vendor.
   
   As a workaround to make sure to have the installation in
   Japanese language and
   to have release 23 launch in Japanese user interface language
   after installation you can perform a silent installation
   instead.
   1. Download:
       IBM SPSS Statistics Client 23.0 Mac OS Silent Multilingual
   (CN3ELML) 752 MB which is for example part of package: IBM SPSS
   Statistics Desktop 23.0 for Base and all Modules Mac OS
   Multilingual eAssembly (CRUM5ML)
   2. The silent installer file name is then:
   SPSSSC_23.0_MAC_OS_SILENT_ML.dmg
   3. Unpack this dmg file on a Macintosh desktop to obtain the bin
   file: SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin
   4. See the documentation for silent installation on
   Authorized_User_License_Administrator_Guide.pdf
   
   ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/s
   tatistics/23.0/en/client/InstallationDocuments/MacOS/Authorized_
   User_License_Administrator_Guide.pdf
   5. Edit installer.properties file in a text editor with your
   companies parameter and authorization code, installation
   directory etc. Put both files on a location on a Macintosh
   harddrive. It is important that this file is placed in the same
   folder as the installer file SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin
   6. Open a Terminal.app, cd to the location where you placed the
   installer files and run the command below with sudo permission:
   ./SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin -f ./installer.properties
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed for customers who need the fix
   prior to the next upcoming Fix Pack.
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI40529
   and technote 1959408 about about Interim Fix 013
   for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
