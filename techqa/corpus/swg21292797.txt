 RHEL6 requires xlibp files to be updated before using MS, otherwise the following java errors are seen:

This is caused due to the missing xlibp fedora core 6 updates files on the RHEL 50 OS.

ANSWER
Go to this website and download it: 

http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libxp&submit=Search+...&system=&arch= [http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libxp&submit=Search+...&system=&arch=] 

Install the missing xlibp files using the Fedora Core 9/10 updates. 

If you're installing on a Linux Intel-based architecture, narrow 
your search to "i386" (do a "uname -a" on your Linux box to 
see the version/kernel info first). 

Most likely, you'll need "libXp-1.0.0.-11.fc.9.i386.rpm" (as of this writing).

Do these commands to install and then verify its installed.

To install the package, do this command:
rpm -i libXp-1.0.0.-11.fc.9.i386.rpm (or your own package name)

To verify its installed, do this command:
rpm -q libXp-1.0.0-11.fc.9.i386 (without the "rpm" extension)

Then start the MS using the 'launchpad.sh' script and it should work just fine. 
No restart of the OS is required since this is Linux and not Windows.
