ABSTRACT
 IBM held a Support Technical Exchange Open Mic session on the topic of CICS event processing on 30 July 2009. This included a short introduction to the topic followed by a question and answer period in which a group of subject matter experts answered questions from customers. 

CONTENT
Starting with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1, CICS applications can act as a source of business events, without any changes or recompilation of the applications, using event specifications created using Eclipse-based tooling.


Since this open mic was created specifically for CICS TS V4.1, many features that have been introduced in newer releases of CICS are not included. You might also want to listen to the Ask the Experts Replay: Demystifying Event Processing in CICS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27041814] that was held on 5 June 2014 and includes information about releases of CICS TS up to V5.2. 

Open Mic sessions are conducted in a question and answer format. The table below provides a time index (minutes:seconds) to the recording and describes the questions or topics discussed. You can fast forward to any question using the time index. A table containing the panel of experts is also included.
