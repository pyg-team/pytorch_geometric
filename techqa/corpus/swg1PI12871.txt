APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A serveResource request that immediately follows a session
   timeout for an authenticated user, causes the session to be
   resumed.
   The recreated session does not contain any state information
   and thus the request is no longer treated as a resource serving
   
   request.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Try to avoid session timeouts by increasing session timeout
   window.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   timeout for an authenticated user, causes the session to be
   resumed.
   The recreated session does not contain any state information
   and thus the request is no longer treated as a resource serving
   request.
