APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   1. This is a data dependent issue.
   2. The drawing file contains large number of sheets with instant
   elements from other sheet in same drawing file.
   3. A single file is copy-pasted in same folder 4 time.
   4. This generates multiple copies of this file with names as bel
   copy of file 1, copy of file 2, copy of file 3, copy of file 4.
   5. The original file and its 4 copies are then opened in CATIA
   simultaneously.
   6. After opening the files CATIA becomes unresponsive.
   7. There is no response if click on File, Edit, View, Window, To
   Help etc commands.
   8. It is also not possible to close the CATIA session.
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   CATIA should work correctly and respond to commands.
   There should not be any loss of contorl.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SCENARIO:
   1. This is a data dependent issue.
   2. The drawing file contains large number of sheets with
   instantiated elements from other sheet in same drawing file.
   3. A single file is copy-pasted in same folder 4 time.
   4. This generates multiple copies of this file with names as
   below:
   copy of file 1, copy of file 2, copy of file 3, copy of file
   4.
   5. The original file and its 4 copies are then opened in
   CATIA simultaneously.
   6. After opening the files CATIA becomes unresponsive.
   7. There is no response if click on File, Edit, View, Window,
   Tools, Help etc commands.
   8. It is also not possible to close the CATIA session.
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   CATIA should work correctly and respond to commands.
   There should not be any loss of contorl.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   Additional Closure Information:
   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS;
   User is opening multiple drawing files containing large
   number of sheets in each drawing file.
   RESTRICTION EXPLANATION:
   In CATIA V5, Drawing application uses tab pages to visualize
   the sheets contained in a CATDrawing.
   Such tab pages are USER OBJECTS similar to a window, icon,
   menu etc.
   These user objects are managed by the operating system and
   not CATIA.
   .
   There is a limit to the total number of USER objects which
   can be managed by the operating system. When this limit is
   reached or exceeded, the applications managed by the
   operating system may become unstable and/or crash.
   .
   Depending on the machine configuration memory, other active
   user objects, other memory intensive application etc opening
   several CATDrawings containing large number of sheets in each
   drawing file may raise the number of USER objects up to the
   operating system limit or higher.
   This can lead to instability and/or crash.
   .
   Reason:
   The instability and/or crash reported in such scenario depend
   on the machine configuration.
   Stability of applications cannot be insured in case such a
   limit is reached.
   Depending on other running applications, machine
   configuration etc, the limit for USER OBJECTS may increase or
   decrease.
   Hence, it is not possible to generically and concretely
   specify what number of CATDrawing files or what exact number
   of sheets per drawing file will lead to this behavior.
   This depends on the machine / OS configuration and capability.
   .
   .
   RECOMMENDATION:
   User should not open multiple files having such large number
   of sheets simultaneously.
   Work on individual files as far as possible.
