QUESTION
 I am running IBM TRIRIGA and need to clear up its Application Server's cache area since it seems to be corrupt or I need to certify cache is really refreshed after new EAR file deployment. How can I do that? 

CAUSE
I have just deployed new IBM TRIRIGA EAR file or need to make sure no Application Server cache file is corrupt. 

ANSWER
IBM WebSphere:

If you are using IBM WebSphere as your Application Server product, the temporary files and cache folders are:

1) TEMP folders

ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\<app server profile>\temp\<node>\<app server> 
ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\<app server profile>\config\temp (if cluster in place)
ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\<app server profile>\wstemp (if any)

Examples:

ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\ctgappsrv01\temp\ctgnode01\server1
ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\ctgDmgr01\config\temp
ibm\websphere\appserver\profiles\ ctgappsrv01\wstemp

Stop the server (JVM) and delete the files in the folders above (1 and 2). They will be recreated at server's (JVM's) start up. 


Oracle BEA WebLogic

If you are using Oracle BEA WebLogic as your Application Server product, the temporary files and cache folders are:

bea\user_projects\domains\<domain>\servers\<app server>\tmp

Example: bea\user_projects\domains\base_domain\servers\AdminServer\tmp 

Log folder is under: bea\user_projects\domains\<domainname>\servers\<servername>\logs\ 
<servername>.log

Stop the server (JVM) and delete the files in the folders above. They will be recreated at server's (JVM's) start up. 


JBOSS 5.1

If you are using JBOSS 5.1 as your Application Server product, the temporary files and cache folders are:

<JBOSS server install>/default/tmp
<JBOSS server install>/default/work

The tmp directory is used for temporary storage by JBoss services. The deployer, for example, expands application archives in this directory.

The work directory is used by Tomcat for compilation of JSPs.

JBOSS 5.1 log folder is where the log files are written. JBOSS uses the Jakarta log4j package for logging and you can also use it directly in your own applications from within the server. Logging is controlled from a central JBOSS conf/log4j.xml file. Its log folder is:

<JBOSS Server install>/default/log

Stop the server (JVM) and delete the files in the folders above. They will be recreated at server's (JVM's) start up.
