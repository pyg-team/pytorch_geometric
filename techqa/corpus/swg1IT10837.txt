APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to start a channel using a TLS cipher running in an
   Oracle JRE the client certificate is not being sent, although
   client authentication is enabled. Error AMQ9637 (Channel is
   lacking a certificate) is logged in the queue manager error log.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users attempting a connection from a
   WebSphere MQ Classes for Java or JMS client to a queue manager
   secured with a TLS cipher, where the client is running in an
   Oracle JVM, and the queue manager's server-connection channel
   property SSLCAUTH is set to REQUIRED, meaning that client
   authentication is enabled for the handshake.
   
   For WebSphere MQ versions 7.5 and 7.1 this issue only affects
   TLS 1.2 ciphers.
   
   For IBM MQ version 8 this issue affects both TLS 1 and TLS 1.2
   ciphers.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The Oracle JVM did not create a default internal key manager
   object for TLS socket connections, meaning that the client's
   signed personal certificates were not available for client
   authentication during the handshake, causing the connection
   attempt to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An internal key manager object is now created for Oracle TLS
   connections, so the client's signed personal certificates are
   available during the handshake and the connection attempt
   succeeds.
