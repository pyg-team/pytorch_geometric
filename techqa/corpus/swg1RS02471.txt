APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installation of fixpack 2 for ODM Decision Server v8.0.1 on
   z/Linux fails:
   CRIMA1026E ERROR: Error during "install" phase:
   CRIMA1026E ERROR:   Cannot create symbolic link
   "/opt/IBM/ODM/jdk/bin/java" for target file
   "/opt/IBM/ODM/jdk/jre/bin/java" A file with this name already
   exists.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - Install Decision Server AND Decision Center 8.0.1 (all
   features from Decision Center can be deselected)
   - Update Decision Center  with 7.5.0.4-WS-ODM_JDK-LINUX-IF050 (
   package s390x)
   - Update Decision Server and Decision Center to 8.0.1.2
   
   In the end you have Installed Packages:
        1-. [X] Decision Center 8.0.1.2
          2. [X] IBM&#171; Java&#214; SDK 6.0 SR16 FP20 6.0.16.20
        3. [X] Decision Server 8.0.1.2
   
   Note: Installing Decision Center allows to apply the iFix.
   Applying the iFix prevents the ODM 8.0.1.2 fixpack from
   upgrading Java (hence works around the initial problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When installing ODM DS 8012 z/Linux it fails during JRE
   installation because of Java dependencies
   which needs to be changed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
