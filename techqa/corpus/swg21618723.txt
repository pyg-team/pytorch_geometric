Title: IBM Security change doesnt work with ESAdmin console or search application of IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search. - United States

ICA security TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After configuring global security or after disabling global security and restarting the esadmin sessions why am I still unable to login (when enabling security) or still able to login (when disabling security) into the ESAdmin console or search application? 

CAUSE
Changed credentials have not been propagated to the application server instance

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The security change while saved and accepted by the application server does not get propagated to all the servers. ESAdmin and search application are running on the ESSearchServer instance. So unless the ESSearchServer recognizes this change the applications on it will not obey. 


To allow the ESSearchServer to pick up this security change stop and restart the ESSearchServer 

stopserver ESSearchServer 

startserver ESSearchServer 

If you are disabling security you will still need to provide the username and password of the administrator before running the stopserver command. The startserver command will not ask for a username and password.
