 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I configure System Dashboard to count users and track usage for ECM P8 license compliance? 

CAUSE
System Dashboard includes tools to track user usage.

ANSWER
 

The ability to track user usage (including infrequent users) were introduced into FileNet Content Manager version 5.2.0 FP2 (and higher) and IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition version 8.5 (and higher). The tools to do the data collection and reporting are including as part of IBM System Dashboard for ECM 5.0.0 FP1 (and higher). If the customer uses these versions, then the system can be configured to collect and report detailed user usage information (including the infrequent user counts) suitable for license compliance auditing and reporting.

1) The ilmtcollector and ilmtreporter tools are the official way to gather, count, and report User and Infrequent User metrics in CPE 5.2.0 FP2 (and higher) and CMEE 8.5 (and higher).

2) There are no ideal tools to count User and Infrequent User metrics for CE 5.0 to 5.2.0 FP1. The recommendation to customers is to upgrade to 5.2.0 FP2 or higher.

3) If the customer cannot upgrade, then it is possible for them to build custom software to gather User counts. This can be built using custom software to call the PCH Listener APIs. However, the data gathered with this method cannot be perfectly accurate, so at best, it can be a good approximation of User counts and Infrequent User counts. IBM can provide suggestions on how this can be built, if needed.

4) In any case, this data is owned by the customer. So, it is up to them to ensure data security and data integrity and to prevent fraudulent manipulation of this audit data.

Here's some documentation on setting up the ILMT Collector and ILMT Reporter tools:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.sysmgr.admin.doc/p8pdb138.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.sysmgr.admin.doc/p8pdb138.htm]

The versions of P8 products that support user usage tracking are: FileNet Content Manager version 5.2.0 FP2 (and higher), Content Foundation version 5.2.0 FP2 (and higher), and System Dashboard 5.0.0 FP1 (and higher). Please note that the tools "ILMT Collector" and "ILMT Reporter" are part of the System Dashboard 5.0.0 FP1 (and higher) product.

Assuming the customer is using those versions, here's how it works:
1) Customer must enable the ILMT Collector to run daily (according to the documentation link I sent earlier).
2) Customer can run ILMT Reporter reports anytime they want to see user usage data. (optionally, customer can query usage database directly for more details).
3) After 12 months of user usage data collection, an accurate report of "infrequent users" can be generated using the ILMT Reporter. ILMT/SUA is not needed for this feature.
4) If the customer installs ILMT/SUA, then ILMT/SUA will be able to recognize Content Manager installations on machines in their network and report that inventory. However, ILMT/SUA 9.2 (and earlier) are not able to automatically read the user usage reports generated by the ILMT Reporter. Those user usage reports can be manually read by a human, but not automatically loaded into ILMT/SUA 9.2.
5) It is expected that the next release of ILMT/SUA (probably 9.2 FP1 in mid-2015) will be able to automatically read the ILMT Reporter output for better centralized reporting within ILMT/SUA.

CE 5.2.1 fully supports Infrequent User licensing and the Dashboard 5.0.0.1 tools support accurate reporting of the user usage data.

In addition, for CE 5.2.1 specifically, the usage collection is turned off by default, but it's easy to turn it on with the following JVM parameter: "-Dfilenet.pch.ILMT.MAX_HISTORY=2500000"

This Technote discusses the above JVM parameter in a bit more detail:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21683571 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21683571]

Also, this link discusses how to monitor the ILMT related counters using the Dashboard GUI:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.sysmgr.admin.doc/p8pdb142.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNW2F_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.sysmgr.admin.doc/p8pdb142.htm?lang=en]

Once the JVM flag is correctly set, the ILMT Collector needs to be run daily to collect and archive the usage data into the database. If the JVM flag is set and the ILMT Collector is running daily, the customer can run the ILMT Reporter anytime they want to view user usage reports.
