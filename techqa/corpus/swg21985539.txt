QUESTION
 What Transport Layer Security (TLS) version is used for Identity Insight 8.1? 

CAUSE
Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol that provides communications security and data integrity between two communicating computer applications.


ANSWER
For almost all implementations of Identity Insight, we use the WebSphere default security choice.

In the <install>/ewas/pro/config/cells/DefaultCell/security.xml, you will find a section with the alias of NodeDefaultSSLSettings. 

By default the security protocol is set as:

sslProtocol="SSL_TLS"

Check the WebSphere documentation to see what the defined protocol is: "SSL_TLS - which is SSLv3 and TLSv1".

The default TLS version can be changed, however, please consult IBM Technical Support for assistance.
