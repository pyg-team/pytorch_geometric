Title: IBM Premature End of Script error when running a CGI script using IBM HTTP Server - United States

Text:
perl; cgi; scriptsock TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive a premature End of Script error when running a CGI script using IBM HTTP Server 

CAUSE
You are able to run the Perl script as a cgi from the command line, but when you run it through the IBM HTTP Server, you receive the following error in the HTTP Server error.log file and the script returns with a blank page to the browser: 




[Tue Oct 21 15:14:21 2008] [error] mod_ibm_ldap: failed to search 'LDAP 
Realm' with filter
'(&(cn=Rtail_Log_Viewer.Group.sbt_admin)(|(objectclass=groupofnames)(obj
ectclass=groupofuniquenames)))': (85) Timed out 
[Tue Oct 21 15:14:36 2008] [error] [client 192.0.0.0] Premature end of
script headers: rtail.cgi, referer: https://mycompany.com:443/rtail/ 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You had multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server and each instance was sharing the same file and path for the ScriptSock directive. When using multiple instances of the IBM HTTP Server, where files are stored under the IHS_install_root/logs directory, those files cannot be shared between instances. So each instance must have unique values for the ScriptSock directive.

See the following link and heading for other directives that require unique values when using multiple instances: How can I run more than one instance of IBM HTTP Server from the same installation directory? [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/ihsdiag/questions.html]

The above link can be found in the IBM HTTP Server Diagnostic Tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&uid=swg24008409].
