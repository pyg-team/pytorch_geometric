QUESTION
 How to clear a process hung in TCP I/O state? 

ANSWER
There are three options:
1. Issue a NETSTAT DROP command to break the connection for that PROCESS and the 
process should end (it should go to a TI RE status).

2. Bring up Connect:Direct with Initialization parameter QUIESCE=YES, delete the process
that was hung. Resume Connect:Direct by going to the ADMIN panel, then the MD panel, 
type R on the RESUME/QUIESCE line.

3. Bring up Connect:Direct with Initialization parameter TCQ = COLD (This option will 
delete all processes in the TCQ and should be used only as a last resort.)

Note: Using initialization parameter TCP.TIMER is recommended to avoid this condition.
