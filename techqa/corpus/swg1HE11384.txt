APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Content Collector services cannot be started. If you try
   to start a service manually, the following error message is
   displayed:
   
   Error 14001: This application has failed to start because the
   application configuration is incorrect.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  IBM Content Collector v2.2.0.1 requires the Microsoft Visual C++
   2005 Redistributable Package KB2467175 or later.  However, if
   you install an outdated version of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
   runtime, this older version might uninstall the version of the
   Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that is installed with IBM Content
   Collector.
   
   So if you install a product that includes an outdated
   Redistributable Package, like for example the client components
   of IBM InfoSphere Classification Module 8.7, Microsoft Visual
   C++ 2005 Redistributable Package KB2467175 might be uninstalled
   and IBM Content Collector stops working properly.
   
   Run Windows Update to install the current Microsoft Visual C++
   runtime again.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you installed an outdated version of the Microsoft Visual C++
   2005 runtime, this older version might have uninstalled the
   version of the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that was installed
   with IBM Content Collector.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Content Collector now includes a later version of the
   Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 runtime, that will not be uninstalled
   by an outdated version.
