QUESTION
 I have made my description field wider using a width="500" tag added in the XML, but the text does not fill the area it just resulted in more white space. Is there a way to get more text to display? 

ANSWER
There is a wrap length property used to determine where to break (or truncate)
the string. 


The wraplength value is used to determine where to break (or truncate)
the string. If it is set to 40, it will break sometime before 40 (or truncate).
It doesn't matter how wide you make the table, it will just cause extra
white space.
The break/truncate will still occur even though the column seems wide
enough to hold it all.

You can set the wraplength value to be wider, so more text appears in the field before truncating.

In the System Properties application select the webclient.wraplength property and set to your desired length say 100.
Save. Select the property checkbox and select Live Refresh from the toolbar. 


There is also a property to turn off the wrap functionality, webclient.wrapreadonlycolumns
= false
