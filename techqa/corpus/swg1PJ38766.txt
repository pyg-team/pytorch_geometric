PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users creating a Stored Search or Search Template with an    *
   * object store that has a lot of document classes and customer *
   * properties.                                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The Search Designer tool used to create Search Templates and *
   * Stored Searches was retrieving more property descriptions    *
   * than it needed.                                              *
   * This created a performance issue for users with an object    *
   * store that has a lot of document classes (~500) and custom   *
   * properties (~120).                                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to the Workplace XT fixpak 1.1.4.11.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The inefficient calls have been optimized in the Workplace XT
   fixpak 1.1.4.11 to retrieve no more than it needed.
