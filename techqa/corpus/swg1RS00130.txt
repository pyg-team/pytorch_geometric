APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are two UUIDs in a DT template, one for the template, and
   the other for the sample decision table within.
   Each time when the DT template is imported from RTS to Studio,
   the DT UUID (<decisionTable><uuid>) in the template displays a
   different value.
   When source control is used to manage files, this change in the
   DT template content can make it difficult for the user to
   determine whether a DT template definition has changed.
   For instance, userA publishes the DT template from Studio to
   RTS; userB imports the template from RTS to a new workspace and
   compare with the copy in source control repository, he will see
   the file marked as changed even if the template definition is
   untouched.
    Description
      There are two UUIDs in a DT template, one for the template,

   (<decisionTable><uuid>) in the template displays a different
   value. When source control is used to manage files, this change
   in the DT template content can make it difficult for the user to
   determine whether a DT template definition has changed. For

   userB imports the template from RTS to a new workspace and
   compare with the copy in source control repository, he will see
   the file marked as changed even if the template definition is
   untouched.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  manually compare DT template content to determine whether a
   change is in the definition or only in the UUID
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  There are two UUIDs in a DT template, one for the template, and
   the other for the sample decision table within.
   Each time when the DT template is imported from RTS to Studio,
   the DT UUID (<decisionTable><uuid>) in the template displays a
   different value.
   When source control is used to manage files, this change in the
   DT template content can make it difficult for the user to
   determine whether a DT template definition has changed.
   For instance, userA publishes the DT template from Studio to
   RTS; userB imports the template from RTS to a new workspace and
   compare with the copy in source control repository, he will see
   the file marked as changed even if the template definition is
   untouched.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been modified to prevent this issue by not showing the
   second UUID anymore.
