Title: IBM PureApplication System shared monitoring service endpoint prompts for login with message KFWITM001W - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Selecting the Endpoint link for a running instance of the PureApplication shared monitoring service results in an unexpected login prompt accompanied by a warning message
. 

SYMPTOM
Error message KFWITM001W Unable to connect to Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server might accompany the login prompt.


CAUSE
This login prompt and KFWITM001W warning can appear for a few reasons: 

 * Attempting to launch the console with expired credentials/token 
 * Launching the console with stale browser cache/login 
 * Launching the console while the Hub-TEMS is not running

ENVIRONMENT
A shared monitoring service is available for deployment on PureApplication System. When deployed, the shared service Endpoint can be accessed by selecting 

 * 
 * Workload Console > Instances > Shared Services > System Monitoring
 * 


and then selecting the Endpoint link just to the right of label: Hub-TEMS (ITM-Hub-TEMS) A pop-up displays with the Endpoint information, for example: 

PureApplication System Monitoring Portal: https://ip-address:port/IWDLICServletWeb/IWDLICServlet 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve a problem with login, use the following corrective measures: 

 * Avoid attempting to launch the console using a bookmarked browser link or by opening an old Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) file. These contain a single-sign-on token for login that has a very short expiry. Attempting this will result in a login credential error which will cause this login prompt to display. Always launch the monitoring console using a link from the PureApplication System User Interface. 
 * Sometimes, a stale login or token can be retained in the browser cache and can affect logins to the monitoring console. If this happens, try clearing the browser cache, and logins. Then attempt to launch the console. 
 * Enable the active Java Console in your browser following the steps in the technote in the Related URL section below. 
 * Sometimes a connectivity problem can occur between the TEPS and HubTEMS. In this case, it is helpful to restart the TEPS and/or the HubTEMS in the shared service using the operations on the Manage -> Operations page. If this doesn't help, then restarting the entire shared service may resolve the problem.
