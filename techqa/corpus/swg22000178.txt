QUESTION
 How to update the JDBC drivers that are provided with IBM Data Studio integrated with or the Data Management Perspective in IBM Developer for z Systems? 

CAUSE
JDBC drivers have security updates and fixes similar to product updates. This technote describes how to find, apply, and confirm they are being used.

ANSWER
IBM Data Studio provides updates to the 4.1.2 release of the product through APARs. 

Those APARs can be found here:
https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%CB%9CInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+Data+Studio&release=4.1.2&platform=All&function=all [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%CB%9CInformation%2BManagement&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+Data+Studio&release=4.1.2&platform=All&function=all]


To pick up the newest version of the driver, disconnect from the Database Connection and select Refresh and connect again.


To determine what driver version is the latest, refer to this technote on the IBM Data Server Drivers for JDBC and SQLJ: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866]


To check the existing driver version being used with the JDBC connection, either

1) perform the following command:


 * Open a DOS command window. 
 * CD to the folder where the db2jcc.jar is located. 
 * Run the following command:

java -cp ./db2jcc.jar com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Jcc -version 

The result should show something similar to: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


or 

2) collect a JDBC trace:  * Under Data Source Explorer, select your Database Connection. 
 * Select the Tracing tab. 
 * Uncheck the Disable Tracing. 
 * Point to a new trace File name. 
 * Select Trace Levels: Connection calls, Connects, Driver configuration. 
 * Add your password and then select Test Connection. 
 * Hit OK. 
 * Go back to Data Source Explorer and the Database Connection. 
 * Select the DB name and connect. 
 * Disconnect and go to the trace file named above.


In the trace file, the connection detail should list the driver version: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Driver version: 4.21.29
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
