APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Situations can exist where the volume state is shown as
   'mountableinlib' by the Query Media command while the Delete
   Volume command  fails indicating that the volume is
   'mountablenotinlib'.  This is typically caused by user error, a
   Move Media command was used to check the volume out of the
   library and the volume was subsequently checked back into the
   library using Checkin Libv without first running a Move Media
   command to update the volume state.
   The following message is observed as a result of trying
   to return the volumes to scratch by issuing a Delete Volume
   command.
    ANR1425W Scratch volume xxxxxx is empty but will not be
   deleted - volume state is "mountablenotinlib"
   The ITSM MESSAGES manual needs to be updated.
   
   
   
   
   The message text of ANR1425W should be updated with a detailed
   explanation of why the message is issued and the User Response
   section should be updated with the actions for resolving
   the problem.
   
   TSM versions affected: All
   Initial Impact: Low
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Check the affected volumes out of the library, the remove=no
   option may be used to prevent actual volume movement.  Run 'Move
   media * stg=* wherestate=mountablenotinlib wherestatus=empty',
   then check the volumes back into the library using Checkin
   Libvolume.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TSM users that use MOVE MEDIA to check   *
   *                 a volume out of the library and then use     *
   *                 CHECKIN LIBVOL to check the volume back      *
   *                 into the library without first running a     *
   *                 MOVE MEDIA command to update the volume      *
   *                 state.                                       *
