Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM MQ and IBM MQ Appliance are vulnerable to SWEET32 Birthday attack (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability affects IBM MQ and IBM MQ Appliance, that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information when using a channel CipherSpec that uses the Triple-DES algorithm. The affected CipherSpecs are:

- TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US
- FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
- ECDHE_ECDSA_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA256
- ECDHE_RSA_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA256 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
