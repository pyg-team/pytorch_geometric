APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary:
   
   The customer is trying to generate reports based off of the RPE
   templates. Using diagram.dta
   (C:\Users\[User]\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\8.1.3\Share\RPE\Templates
   \ProjectContentReport) and the elevator sample project, the
   report only generates what seems to be document headers. See
   attached screenshot.
   
   Is this the correct output? If not, how can we get it to show up
   properly? The customer has reported that several templates don't
   work properly, but obviously we'll try and troubleshoot this one
   first.
   
   See attached video (.fbr) for reproduction steps. I was able to
   reproduce and got the exact same result.
   
   
   Full description from the customer:
   
   "Tools > Publish > Generate Report presents several report
   templates.  I am using the standard Elevator sample.  Some of
   the reports work, but some do not.  The attached video shows
   that the Diagrams template creates a report with nothing in it.
   I see this with other models too.  It seems to be an error.  Am
   I doing something wrong or is this a major defect? "
   
   Business Impact
   
   This is from a Sales Rep:
   
   "This is a basic functionality that needs to work, easily
   and well.  I have a  prospect that is about to compare this with
   Sparx EA"

   I can also reproduce this via the Tools menu. No diagram images.
   
   However, the same template "Diagrams.dta" via RPE generates the
   report containing diagram images.
   
   It appears this was defective before and fixed:

   Looks like a regression defect to me. The workaround is to use
   RPE (requires license)  or to use R+
