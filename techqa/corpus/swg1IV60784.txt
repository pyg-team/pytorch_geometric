APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This Latest Scan Import column seems only display the date after
   the first Initial Software Scan task is done on the ILMT agent
   and after the Upload Software Scan result task is done for the
   very first time.
   
   
   Any new software scan is done afterward,  this Latest Scan
   Import column won't get updated.
   
   
   Looking at the Software Scan Status analysis, it shows the Last
   Software Scan time being updated but somehow this Latest Scan
   Import column in the Computers view never get updated regardless
   how many time the Import task is executed successfully.
   
   
   Explanation:
   
   That column will only be updated if there is change in content
   of the cit scan file. By default the cit scan is run every 7
   days.
   
   If you initiate the software scan manually then it will create a
   new scan file with an updated date. However, if the contents of
   the file do not change then the date in the report Computers for
   the column Latest Scan Import will not be updated.
   
   This is working as designed but it is not documented.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As soon as there is any new IBM product installed on the agent
   and is discovered by the SW scanner,  the scan results will be
   uploaded, processed and imported into the ILMT database (SUADB).
   This column will be updated.
