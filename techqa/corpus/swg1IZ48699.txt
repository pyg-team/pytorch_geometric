   is defined in lower case at the TEMS.
   
   After upgrading from ITM 6.1 to ITM 6.2, all usernames defined

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Text has been added to the ITM 6.2.2 Troubleshooting Guide in
   Chapter 4 on page 65 specifying the following:
   
   After upgrade from v6.1 to v6.2, all usernames defined in
   uppercase are not be able to login at the portal server.
   
   If security validation is enabled through a UNIX or Linux
   monitoring server and the User IDs are defined in uppercase at
   the portal server, but the User ID is
   defined in lower case at the monitoring server, this problem
   occurs.
   Disable security validation at the hub monitoring server.
   Logging into the portal server changes all the User IDs? cases
   to match the case as defined at the hub monitoring server.
