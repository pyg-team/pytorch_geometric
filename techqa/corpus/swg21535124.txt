PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CMB2174E - C:E TCP THREAD TERMINATION ERROR DETECTED ON FTPC0001 BY STFTPC00. ERROR CODE=S906. (SCI72236) 

SYMPTOM
CMB2174E - C:E TCP THREAD TERMINATION ERROR DETECTED ON FTPC0001 BY STFTPC00. ERROR CODE=S906. 
CMB2115E - C:E TCP/IP TASK/THREAD FTPC0001 HAS TERMINATED WITH COMPLETION CODE=S906 . 
CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE STDSPLY EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT 
CMB2140I - C:E TCP RESTARTING THREAD FTPC0001. 
S906-08 
Exceeded maximum use count STDSTLY


CAUSE


Running over a month on CUM1205, When the S906 ABENDs started it looked like it was in a loop. The SCDSPLY repetitive LOAD which caused the client subtask to abend S906-08 along with message CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE STDSPLY EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT when 32K LOADs are reached. A LOAD occurs once for every client (C50) or server session (S30) initialization. The solution is to load SCDSPLY once at C:E initialization, save the EPA in the SCB, and copy that into the SMTCB STDSPLY field at client and server initialization. The customer had to cancel the job & recycle both tasks.



All running well now.
Note: Secondary error found after abend. Parm DIALOG_FTP=* was on in the ODF causing excessive TRACE data and flooded the JES pool with messages of CEDEBUG (ITCQE tracing output).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Work-a-round:
Do NOT use DIALOG_FTP=* parameter in the ODF. Turn it on manually to debug an issue as needed (directed by Customer Support only)
NOTE if S906 occurs you will have to Cancel both jobs & Recycle both tasks. send both tasks & associated SVCDUMPS to Sterling Commerce.



Fix F34284 - is to be applied after Maintenance POST1205.P122704 and CUM1205 to resolve S90608 abend.





Subsequent fixes will address the other problems;ie messages of CEDEBUG (ITCQE tracing output).
