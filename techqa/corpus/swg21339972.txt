Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
I need to run multiple reports from the portal, and as soon as I open one report the viewer takes over the portal and I can't run multiple reports. How do I set each report to run in its own window? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Possibility 1:In Cognos Connection right mouse click on the report title and select "Open in New Window". 

 

Possibility 2: 

Create a portal tab with Cognos Navigator portlet on it. Configure the Navigator to show the Public Folders. In the properties of the Cognos Navigator portlet set option Open Links to "In a new browser window". Now use the portlet to open reports.
