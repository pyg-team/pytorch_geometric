APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Case Builder does not function correctly when a workflow field
   is used in an in-basket filter.
   
   The behavior will depend on the browser being used.  With
   Internet Explorer and Chrome, multiple exception are raised:
   
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2 Uncaught TypeError:
   Cannot read property 'text' of undefined_updateDisplayFromModel
   @ ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2setModel @
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2setModel @
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2setModel @
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2setModel @
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2editPressed @
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2(anonymous function) @
   dojo.js.jgz:15
   
   ../release/acm/custom/CaseBuilderBase.js:2 Uncaught TypeError:
   Cannot read property 'validate' of undefined
   
   With Firefox, the in-basket will open, as FF appears to ignore
   the error.  However, when the user clicks on the filter tab for
   that in-basket, the workflow field will be listed incorrectly as
   a case property.
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create simple solution with one property, and a role
   2. Add the case property to the in-basket filter for that role
   via In-baskets > In-basket Filters tab
   2. Create a simple task with one or more steps
   3. Open Process Designer; create a workflow field for task steps
   4. From Process Designer, add the workflow field onto the
   in-basket filter for the role
   5. Save and exit the solution from Process Designer
   6. Save and close the solution from Case Builder
   7. Open the solution from Case Builder again
   8. Click on the in-basket tab, then click on the role to expand
   
   Expected result:
   The in-basket is expanded, then clicking on the In-basket
   Filters tab to see a case property, and the workflow field on
   the filter page
   
   Actual result:
   Firefox: The in-basket is expanded, however, clicking on the
   In-basket Filters tab shows displays both as case properties.
   Chrome & IE: The in-basket is not expanded.  Multiple exceptions
   are raised.
   
   This was reported by a customer running on IE.  However, they
   were able to use FF as a temporary workaround.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Running Case Builder via supported versions of Firefox will
   expand the role in-basket as well as the associated in-basket
   filter

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * It is recommended to apply 5.2.1.6-ICM-FP006 or later to     *
   * resolve this issue.                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue is addressed in 5.2.1.6-ICM-FP006 and later.
   
   The builder code has been corrected to correctly expand the
   in-basket and display workflow fields when they are part of an
   in-basket filter.
