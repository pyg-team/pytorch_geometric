APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following SQLERROR may be seen on zOS when a flow performs
   some non-coordinated database work in an ESQL node
   before performing any MQ work in the flow:
   
   
   +BIP2322E MQXXBRK EG1 44 DATABASE ERROR: SQL STATE '2D521';
   NATIVE ERROR CODE '-926'; ERROR TEXT '{DB2 FOR OS/390}{ODBC
   DRIVER}
   {DSN10015}   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -926, ERROR:  ROLLBACK NOT VALID
   IN
   IMS, CICS OR RRSAF ENVIRONMENT
   DSNT418I SQLSTATE   = 2D521 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
   DSNT415I SQLERRP    = DSNXEEZ SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR
   DSNT416I SQLERRD    = -120  0  0  -1  0  0 SQL DIAGNOSTIC
   INFORMATION
   DSNT416I SQLERRD    = X'FFFFFF88' X'00000000' X'00000000'
   X'FFFFFFFF'
                         X'00000000' X'00000000'
   
   For instance this could occur if a flow starts with a timeout
   node running in automatic mode,
   which then propagates to an ESQL Compute node which performs
   some database work with commit set to yes,
   which then propagates to an MQOutput node
   when a message is put to a queue.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V10 on z/OS who use MQ nodes
   and perform non-coordinated database work.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The following SQLERROR may be seen on zOS when a flow performs
   some non-coordinated database work in an ESQL node before
   performing any MQ work in the flow:
   
   +BIP2322E MQXXBRK EG1 44 DATABASE ERROR: SQL STATE '2D521';
   NATIVE ERROR CODE '-926'; ERROR TEXT '{DB2 FOR OS/390}{ODBC
   DRIVER}
   {DSN10015}   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -926, ERROR:  ROLLBACK NOT VALID
   IN
   IMS, CICS OR RRSAF ENVIRONMENT
   DSNT418I SQLSTATE   = 2D521 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
   DSNT415I SQLERRP    = DSNXEEZ SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR
   DSNT416I SQLERRD    = -120  0  0  -1  0  0 SQL DIAGNOSTIC
   INFORMATION
   DSNT416I SQLERRD    = X'FFFFFF88' X'00000000' X'00000000'
   X'FFFFFFFF'
                         X'00000000' X'00000000'
   
   This is because the product was connecting to MQ when the
   private RRS context for the non-coordinated database work was in
   place instead of the global one. This then leads to MQ
   performing transaction work under the wrong
   context and leads to later errors from DB2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has changed to ensure the correct RRS context is in
   place before connecting to MQ.
