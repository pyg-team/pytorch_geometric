SQL2514 migration restore TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 While migrating the db2 databases from older version to newer version using the off line restore command fails with SQL2514N error. Why? 

CAUSE
The version of db2 that you are trying to migrate is more than 2 levels down. i.e. You are trying to migrate a v9.1 db to v10.1 or v9.1/v9.5 db to v10.5 versions which are NOT compatible and NOT supported.

ANSWER
Temporarily migrate the db to supported db2 levels of v9.5 or v9.7 first and then upgrade to the desired level of db2.
