APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The javadoc for WCM states that the interface DocumentId is
   serializable. However, the serialization of a DocumentId fails
   with a
   java.io.NotSerializableException as at least one of its fields
   seems to
   be not serializable (DocumentType).
   
   
   java.io.NotSerializableException:
   com.ibm.workplace.wcm.api.WCM_DocumentType at
   java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(ObjectOutputStream.java:
   1184)
   at
   java.io.ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteFields(ObjectOutputStream
   .java:15
   38)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Code fix needed
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WCM DocumentId is not Serializable
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Exceptions are coming because interface DocumentType is not
   serialized
