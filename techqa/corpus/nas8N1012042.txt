Title: IBM Message DFU0007 When Running DFU Commands - United States

Text:
DFU; MSGDFU0007 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document explains why executing a DFU command would return a message DFU0007. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document explains why executing a DFU command would return a message DFU0007. 

DFU command line commands cannot be executed within DFU itself. If a user issues a STRDFU followed immediately by a CHGDTA, the user will receive a message DFU0007 stating that DFU is already active.

This is because you cannot execute DFU commands from the command line in DFU. If a user calls a program or goes to a different menu from this menu and runs a DFU command, they will also get this message because DFU is still active in the background. To confirm that DFU is still active, you should check the callstack. It will have the programs QDZCPP and QDZMAIN listed if DFU is active.

Type Program Statement Procedure 
QCMD QSYS /0517
QUICMENU QSYS /00C1
1 QUIMNDRV QSYS /060F
2 QUIMGFLW QSYS /04D7
3 QUICMD QSYS /056E
QDZCPP QSYS /00F4
QDZMAIN QSYS /0049
4 QUIMGFLW QSYS /04D7
5 QUICMD QSYS /056E
QUICMENU QSYS /00C1
6 QUIMNDRV QSYS /060F
7 QUIMGFLW QSYS /04D7
8 QUICMD QSYS /056E

Resolution: Use the numbered options within DFU to execute DFU commands, or exit DFU using F3/F12 and then run the commands.
