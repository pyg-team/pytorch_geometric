APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When selecting "WebSphere Agent Summary Status" workspace for
   the ITCAM  Agent, user can't see the real application server
   subnode names on the dashboard. All application servers nodes
   are displayed as "server1".  It is very difficult to get server
   information for a specific application server, because they all
   have the same name.
                                       .
   Users Affected:
   Users who installed ITCAM for AD 7.1 WAS agent TEPS supports
   (tps) on previously installed supports for 6.2 release.
                                                       .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The file kyn_tepeval.jar contains classes which come from the
   6.x release and which are loaded prior to classes from 7.1.
   Removing kyn_tepeval.jar fixes the problem.
   Move file kyn_tepeval.jar (located in
   <ITM_HOME>/<platform>/cq/Products/kyn/kyn_tepeval.jar on Unix
   and <ITM_HOME>\CNPS\products\kyn\kyn_tepeval.jar on Windows) to
   a temporary location outside the $ITM_HOME directory and restart
   TEPS.
   This should solve the issue by causing kwj_tepeval.jar to be
   selected and used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ***************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITCAM for Application Diagnostics 7.1 users
   * who installed ITCAM for AD 7.1 WAS agent TEPS supports (tps)
   * on previously installed supports for 6.2 release.
