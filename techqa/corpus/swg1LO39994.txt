ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customers environment is at follows:
   The server is Windows 2003 eng server
   Domino 8.0.1 english with 211.161 fix applied on Win XP and IE 6
   
   
   I reproduced used Domino 8.0.1 english with 211.161 fix applied
   on Win XP and IE
   6.
   1) I open the mail file of a user whos name does not contain any
   umlaut
   or special characters. For this example I used a user called
   "Ronan
   Redican"
   
   2) I choose the option "Open Mail for...", this is located at
   the bottom
   of the options in the left frame underneath "Tools".
   
   3) This opens a small seperate window which asks "Select whose
   mail to
   open". I select the drop down menu and this opens another
   seperate
   window allowing me to select addresses.
   
   4) I navigate until I find my desired user named "test       ".
   I select
   this user and chose ok. This name is now seen in the "Select
   whose mail
   to open" window. I now choose ok.
   
   5) This window now hangs, without opening the mailfile. The
   status bar
   at the bottom of that window oscillates between "Opening page
   
   http://..." and "Done". This appears to be an infinite loop.
   
   
   
   Using a user without any umlaut in their name shows no issue.
   
   
   This issue lies with fix 211.161
