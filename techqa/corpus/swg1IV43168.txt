ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM:  In Change app, after adding a Job Plan to the Change,
   the long descriptions from Job Plan's "Risk Assessment" &
   "Committee Review" and not getting placed in the Change
   record's corresponding long description attributes.  That is,
   the long descriptions are missing from the Change record's rows
   in the "Technical Assessments" and "Business Assessments"
   tables (both on the Assessments tab of the Change app).
   
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:  no
   
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   1) GoTo > Planning > Job Plans
   2) create new Job Plan with the following details:
   2.1) "Default WO Class" = CHANGE
   2.2) give the JP both a short and long description (button to
   enter long, of course)  (this step is not necessary but will be
   used to contrast)
   2.3) give it tasks and give each a short and long description
   (this step is not necessary but used for contrast)
   2.4) Click on "Change Assessment" tab
   2.4.1) give it at least one "Risk Assessment"
   2.4.2) give it at least one "Committee Review"
   2.4.3) for both the "Risk Assessment" and "Committee Review"
   give them both short and long descriptions
   2.5) Save the JP
   3) GoTo > Change > Changes
   4) create new Change record with the following details:
   4.1) click on "Schedule" tab
   4.2) enter the previous JP into the "Job Plan" field
   4.3) Notice the following correctly:
   4.3.1) Change record's main short and long description fields
   populated from the JP's main
   4.3.2) Change's Job Plan short and long description fields
   populated from JP's main
   4.3.3) Change's listed tasks all have both the short and long
          descriptions
   4.4) click on the "Assessment" tab
   4.5) expand any row in the "Technical Assessment" section.
   (These are the rows from the JP's RiskAssessment section).
   Notice they have the short description but not the long
   description!  (click button to confirm long description is
   missing)
   4.6) expand any row in the "Business Assessment" section.
   (These are the rows from the JP's CommitteeReview section).
   Notice they have the short description but not the long
   description!  (click button to confirm long description is
   missing)
   
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:   No long description getting
   added to the "Technical Assessment" section and the
   "Business Assessment" section from the JobPlan's
   Risk Assessment section and Committee Review section,
   respectively.
   
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:  That those long descriptions in the
   Job Plans get copied to the those long description
   fields in the Change record.
   
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   Change attribute that should be populated but
   is not (same for both):
   PMCHGIAASSESMENT.DESCRIPTION_LONBGDESCRIPTION
   
   
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   - CCMDB: 7212
   - MBS : 7.1.1.10
