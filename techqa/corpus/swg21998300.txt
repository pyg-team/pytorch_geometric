 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Event Listeners are taking too long to respond or they are not alive 

CAUSE
Event listeners are part of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SI) alert and reporting service. Alerts are generated as part of an internal service which is described in more detail here:http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/sb2bi/v5r2/topic/com.ibm.help.reporting_services.doc/SI_RprtgSvcs_ProcessFlows.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/sb2bi/v5r2/topic/com.ibm.help.reporting_services.doc/SI_RprtgSvcs_ProcessFlows.html]
They're typically caused by a network delay, a database pool connection break-down or the connection to the database going down and are not usually a cause for concern. However, analysis of all the SI logs could provide more insight into these messages.
