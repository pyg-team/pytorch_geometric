 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On AIX, after appling MQ IF03 to a Messaging agent V06.01.00 the
   MQ and MC agents do not start after configuring.
   The error reported in the log file is:
   "xec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program
   /apps/candle/aix513/mc/bin/kmcrca
   because of the following errors:
   0509-150   Dependent module libkra.a could not be loaded.
   0509-022 Cannot load module libkra.a.
   0509-026 System error: A file or directory in the path name does
   not exist."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem can be solved installing the ITM v6.2 32 bit User
   Interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue only occurs on 3 platforms and only with ITM62.  The
   patch installer does not check 32/64 bit agent framework but
   forbiden Messaging agents to use ITM62 libraries.
   
   Already add the check for 32/64 bit.  The new installer will be
   involved in 6.0.1.1-TIV-XEforMsg-IF01
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Missing the check for the installed modules (32/64 bit).
