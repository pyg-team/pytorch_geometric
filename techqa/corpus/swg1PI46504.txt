APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During the upgrade process, Installation Manager fails with
   error CRIMA1217E indicating that a problem happened in the
   post-install.xml script during the uninstall phase of
   Worklight V6.0.
   The corresponding worklight-uninstall.log file in the
   Installation Manager logs directory reveals that a wrong
   Deployment Manager (Dmgr02) was attempted to be started instead
   of the expected one (Dmgr01).
   
   Excerpt of the trace

LOCAL FIX
 *  Start the deployment manager of the cell where Application
   Center was deployed before proceeding to the upgrade with
   Installation Manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users who installed WebSphere Application Server Network     *
   * Deployment (WAS ND) with several Deployment Managers on the  *
   * same machines and who are trying to upgrade IBM Application  *
   * Center using Installation Manager.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When IBM Application Center V6.0.x is deployed on a WAS ND   *
   * configuration managed by a Deployment Manager that is not    *
   * the default then the upgrade may fail if this Deployment     *
   * Manager is not started during the upgrade process. The code  *
   * of the upgrade process only handles the default WAS ND       *
   * Deployment Manager.                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A validation was added to the code to select and start the
   correct WAS ND Deployment Manager before performing the upgrade.
