APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If database migration were to fail while migrating the system
   catalog table SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS, due to the migrating database
   containing corruption, we will not have enough diagnostic
   information to identify the table that is corrupted.
   
   Without this fix, customers will need to restore their downlevel
   backup images back to the downlevel release, then would require
   a *special build* to find out which table is actually corrupted.
   
   With this fix, the db2diag.log will contain sufficient
   information such that no special build would be required, hence,
   allowing us to cleanup the corruption on their downlevel
   database much quicker.
