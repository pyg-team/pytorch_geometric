Title: IBM MQIVP MQ installation verification program fails - United States

Text:
initialize Just-in-Time Compiler; interpreter; java; MQIVP JIT TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You run the IBM MQ Javaâ„¢ installation verification script, "java MQIVP", and you receive a warning message. 

SYMPTOM
"Warning: Failed to initialize Just-in-Time Compiler. Will use interpreter."

In addition, this problem occurs when the java -version command is issued.


CAUSE
The TSO user region size is too small.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Allocate a larger user region size to allow JVM initialization to complete successfully. This can be accomplished by increasing the SIZE parameter on the TSO/E LOGON screen. 

 
Additional Information
Some customers increased their TSO/E log-on Region SIZE and the problem continued. We found that they had an IEFUSI Exit which limited the amount of storage that could be allocated.
