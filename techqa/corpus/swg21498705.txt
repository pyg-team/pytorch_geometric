Title: IBM Some IBM applications that are provided with the product might require the optional EJBDeploy tool - United States

Text:
WASV8RNotes; V8RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unexpected errors might occur if applications that are provided with IBM WebSphere Application Server, such as the samples, require the optional EJBDeploy tool for pre-EJB 3.0 modules but the feature is not installed.

This feature is selected by default during WebSphere Application Server installation; but you can clear this selection during installation or uninstall it later. 

Note: WebSphere Rapid Deployment requires the optional EJBDeploy tool for pre-EJB 3.0 modules and does not work if the feature is not installed. 

SYMPTOM
If you see either of the following messages, for example, you should install the EJBDeploy feature: 

WCMD0005E: This command cannot execute because the EJBDeploy optional feature has not been installed. 

ADMA0245W: EJBDeploy feature is not installed. Cannot execute "deploy enterprise beans" option. 

Other possible error messages can be generated from script commands that depend on the existence of the ejbdeploy command-line script. In these cases, you might see an error such as one of the following examples: 

ejbdeploy: command not found 

'ejbdeploy' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 

Tools that invoke EJBDeploy directly might display the following exception: 

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibm.etools.ejbdeploy.EJBDeploy 

If the EJBDeploy feature is not installed, WebSphere Rapid Deployment displays an error message similar to the following example:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main
at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:434)
at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:646)
at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:358)
at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:612)
Could not find the main class: org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.
Program will exit


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you deploy and use applications that might require pre-EJB 3.0 modules, include the optional EJBDeploy feature in all WebSphere Application Server installations that will be used by servers running the pre-EJB 3.0 applications. 


If errors occur for applications and the errors indicate that the applications require pre-EJB 3.0 modules, make sure that the optional EJBDeploy feature is installed. If the feature is not installed, install it as described in the WebSphere Application Server Version 8 Information Center [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=matt&product=was-nd-mp].
