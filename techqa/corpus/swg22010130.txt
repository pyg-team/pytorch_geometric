Title: IBM Cache space reach 80 percent and Subscription stops - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Subscription stops reading the Archive logs because the cache space reached 80 percent. 

We have the cache set at the max of 2048MB. If this is not enough, then what can we do? 

ANSWER
Assuming the subscription is in replication continuous. The target isn't receiving data fast enough so we continue to read and cache. At some point we need to stop caching or we'd blow out real/aux storage. Once the data can be sent we will read more and cache new data, since the sent data can be pruned out of the cache. 

We should not cache more than 80% of 2G of data with no where to send it. Please look into the target site to see why they can't process the data received. 

Cache space in source should not be the problem.
