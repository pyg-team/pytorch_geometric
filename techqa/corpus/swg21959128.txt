Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM Tivoli Netcool System Service Monitors/Application Service Monitors (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects IBM Tivoli Netcool System Service Monitors/Application Service Monitors. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
SSM 4.0.0 FP1 - FP14 and Interim Fix 14-01 – Interim Fix 14-06
SSM 4.0.1 FP1 – FP2 Interim Fix 02

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Modify the INIVAR FileTransferSSLCipherSuite in init.cfg. This is currently: 

 FileTransferSSLCipherSuite=AES:3DES:DES:!EXP 

Disable the DHE and EDH Ciphers by changing it to the following and restarting SSM: 

FileTransferSSLCipherSuite=AES:3DES:DES:!EXP:!DHE:!EDH 

Note that as this is a new INIVAR this mitigation requires applying either of the following fixes first:
SSM 4.0.1.2 Interim Fix 2 - http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002115 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002115] 
SSM 4.0.0.14 Interim Fix 6 - [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002120]http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002120 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg400002120] 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
