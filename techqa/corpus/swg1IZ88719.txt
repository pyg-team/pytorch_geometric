PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Universal Agent UTCTOLOCALTIME function does not work on UNIX
   and Linux platforms.
   
   Universal Agent UTCTOLOCALTIME function does not work on UNIX
   and Linux platforms.  On UNIX and Linux platforms, when defining
   an attribute to be derived per UTCTOLOCALTIME function, the
   resulting value appearing in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal is
   incorrect; it displays as a '^' character rather than as a
   mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss formatted value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Universal Agent was changed to assign correct size for internal
   data item used in the processing of a UTC value to LocalTime
   value.
