Title: IBM Logging Identical Event Suppression Tuning Considerations - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are there any tuning considerations when using IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance Log Target Identical Event Suppression? 

CAUSE
The user may want to consider the impact of using Identical Event Suppression in environments with many log targets or many unique log events.

ANSWER
The Identical Event Suppression feature allows for the suppression of identical log events that are generated by the same configuration object over a configurable time period. 

When enabled, the Log Target retains a reference to each processed event for a configurable period of time. 

Until this period expires, the Log Target will not process the same event from the same configuration object.

Since the Log Target retains a reference to each processed event during the configured suppression period, several factors should be considered for tuning to allow for acceptable memory usage for the environment:

a) the number of log targets using this feature may impact how much memory may be needed

b) the number of unique log events generated may impact how much memory may be needed

c) the length of the suppression period may impact how much memory may be needed

For environments generating a very large amount of unique log events, the suppression period should be tuned to a shorter time in order to prevent unnecessary memory usage since a long suppression period will cause the storing of references for a longer time.

For environments using many log targets with this feature, the suppression period should be tuned to a shorter time in order to prevent unnecessary memory usage storing the references for a longer time.
