 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I activate the IBM WebSphere Portal Web Content Manager feature? 

ANSWER
With all of the IBM Intelligent Operations Center components running, log on to the application server in the standard topology, or log on to application server 1 in the high availability topology, and run the following commands in a command window: 

 1. su - ibmadmin 
 2. cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile/ConfigEngine 
 3. ./ConfigEngine.sh configure-wcm-authoring -DPortalAdminPwd=your_wpsadmin_password-DWasPassword=your_admin_password


Log out of WebSphere Portal and then log on again. There is a new Applications tab in Administration > Portal Administration.
