APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In some cases release builder can produce a diff script which
   attempts to create a child content node before creating a
   content code of the parent.
   For example if a tree of page nodes have been moved to a new
   root node.
   Then release builder creates a diff script that sets a delete
   action on the "old" root node (correct) but does not recreate
   the subtree being moved (incorrect).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Edit the resulting delta XML document. Change the order of the
   <content-node action="update" ..> sections.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In some cases release builder can produce a diff script which
   attempts to create a child content node before creating a
   content code of the parent.
   For example if a tree of page nodes have been moved to a new
   root node. Then release builder creates a diff script that sets
   a delete action on the "old" root node (correct) but does not
   recreate the subtree being moved (incorrect).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new rule has been implemented that marks a content node
   dirty if a parent node has been flagged as deleted. This ensures
   that the complete subtree is recreated.
