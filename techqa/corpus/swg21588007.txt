Title: IBM Mustgather: Gathering data for diagnosing a Java Exception on AIX®, Linux, Windows and z/OS® - United States

Text:
AIX Linux Windows z/OS Java Exception Gather MustGatherDocument TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If your Java application throws a Java exception on any one of the operating systems such as AIX®, Linux, Windows and z/OS®, there are a number of diagnostic data files that are useful for diagnosing the problem. This mustgather document describes about the diagnostic data files to be collected and the procedure to collect the same. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following set of diagnostic data files will be required to diagnose the java application exception:
1. Javacores generated that are specific to the exception
2. Core dumps generated that are specific to the exception
3. FFDC(First Failure Data Capture) logs such as Standard output, Standard error, System out
4. Any stand alone test case


For these diagnostic data files to be created, check that the system is configured correctly as per setup [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=727&uid=swg21588003] document. 

Please collect the diagnostic data files during the time of the java application exception as per the below steps: 

1. Collect the FFDC logs containing the complete exception stack trace and the details of the thread that produced the exception. 

 Whenever a Java application exception occurs, the exception stack trace is sent to FFDC logs such as Standard error logs, System out logs and System error logs.

2. Collect the javacores and core dumps generated specific to the Java exception reported.

Please note that all the javacores generated can be found in the current path and the names of them will follow the below format:
Javacore : javacore.<time stamp>.<id>.txt

For AIX®, Linux and Windows operating systems, the core dumps generated can be found in the current path and the names of them will follow the below format:
Core dump : core.<time stamp>.<id>.dmp

Run the JExtract tool against the generated core dump using the following command:
<installpath>/jre/bin/jextract [coredump]

For 64bit JVM enabled with -Xcompressedrefs option, please use
<installpath>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [coredump] 

Save the resulting archive file, which has a name in the format of
core.<time stamp>.<id>.dmp.zip

For z/OS® operating system, the transaction dumps will be generated as standard MVS™ Dump data sets and the names of them will follow the below format:
Transaction dump : %uid.JVM.TDUMP.%job.D%y%m%d.T%H%M%S 

3. If possible, please give us a stand alone test case to recreate the exception.

After collecting all the above diagnostic data files, you can submit them for help with diagnosing the problem.
