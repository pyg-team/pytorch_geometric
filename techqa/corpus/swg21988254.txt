CONTENT
After upgrading to z/OS 2.2 or a newer maintenance level of z/OS 2.1 customers running WebSphere Application Server V7, V8.0 and V8.5.x Full Profile, or V8.5 Liberty profile could potentially encounter problems with applications using JRIO. The issue can manifest itself via messages like "FMC00142E Profile not found for configuration", or failures when accessing VSAM datasets.
Resolution:
This problem is addressed in Java APAR PI58684. 


PI58684 JRIO RecordFile.exists() may return incorrect value. Some of JRIO classes may throw unexpected exceptions

This APAR will be fixed in the following Java Releases: 
7 R1 SR3 FP40 (7.1.3.40) 
7 SR9 FP40 (7.0.9.40) 
6 R1 SR8 FP25 (6.1.8.25) 
6 SR16 FP25 (6.0.16.25) 


How to obtain the fix:
The respective ifixes to upgrade the SDK level for WAS V8.x (all profiles) can be downloaded from Fix Central
