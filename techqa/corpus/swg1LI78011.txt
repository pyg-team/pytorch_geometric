LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IBM API Management V3.0, when an attempt is made to load a
   WSDL, if this WSDL is invalid and fails to load, further
   attempts to load other WSDLs may cause the user interface to
   hang.
   
   The problem was occurring because the content of the invalid
   WSDL (or WSDL that Load failed) was still in an internal cache.
   A fix has been implemented clear the cache and update it with
   the content of the WSDL that is currently in the Load process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is targeted for inclusion in IBM API Management fixpack
   V3.0.0.1
