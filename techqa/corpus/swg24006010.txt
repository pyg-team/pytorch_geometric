Document #1142001, "EasySync Pro sync software not recognized by Palm Tungsten T3, E, C, and Treo" at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg21142001 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg21142001]

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
IMPORTANT: By downloading and using this Code, you agree to these terms and conditions:

The software samples, updates and fixes ("Code") available in this archive or on this web site for this Program are copyrighted materials. By clicking the download link below, you agree that the Code is provided under, and is subject to, the terms and conditions of the license agreement(s) which accompanied or were contained in the copy or copies of the Program for which you are obtaining the Code. You are not authorized to install or use the Code except as part of a Program for which you have a valid Proof of Entitlement or other authorization as specified in such license agreement(s). You further agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and export regulations.

While a successful installation may be possible without completing all of the following steps, Product Development strongly recommends that you complete each step:

1. Completely uninstall EasySync Pro 4.2.1.

2. Completely uninstall Palm Desktop and HotSync Manager.

3. Launch the Microsoft Windows Registry. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Windows Registry is central to the operation of Windows, and any changes must be performed with care. As with any configuration change, it is highly recommended that customers have complete backups of computer systems and data files before attempting the following procedure, in order to facilitate recovery from system file corruption or other possible failures. Lotus does NOT recommend that customers make changes to the Windows Registry without the assistance of Microsoft Technical Support. Further, customers who manually modify the Windows Registry may not be eligible for Microsoft Technical Support until Windows is reinstalled. Customers making changes to the Windows Registry do so at their own risk.

From the Windows Taskbar, click Start --> Run --> type "regedit" (without quotes) --> OK. Locate and delete the following registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\U.S. Robotics

4. Locate and delete the Palm directory, usually at C:\Program Files\Palm.

5. Reboot your computer.

6. Install the Palm Desktop software and HotSync Manager.

7. Install EasySync Pro 4.2.1 but DO NOT LAUNCH.

8. Double-click the following link and download the .ZIP file to your computer: 

ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/lotus/fixes/easysync/ESP_Palm421Patch.zip [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/lotus/fixes/easysync/ESP_Palm421Patch.zip]

9. Before launching EasySync Pro for the first time, unzip the patch, ESP_Palm421Patch.ZIP, and place the following files in the C:\Program Files\Common Files\XCPCSync\Translators\3cmPlm directory. Overwrite any existing files if prompted to do so.

- rsCondut.dll
- rPalmEN.dll
- AutoDet.exe
- rstPilot.dll
- readme.txt

10. Remove the check from the Mail option in the EasySync Pro Available items list, since the Tungsten devices use VersaMail, not EasySync Pro. Leaving Mail checked will cause the sync to hang. 

11. If you use the Notes Journal Database, then it is OK to leave Notes checked in the EasySync Pro Available items list. Otherwise, uncheck this option.

NOTE: After the patch is installed, the HotSync Conduit list shows both the Palm conduits and the EasySync Pro conduits. This may cause a problem where the Palm device syncs data to the Palm Desktop Software and EasySync Pro does not sync any data. To ensure that this does not happen:

a. Open the HotSync Manager and choose Custom. 
b. Select the Palm conduits for Mail, Address, ToDo, and Calendar. Click Change.
c. Set the sync to "Do Nothing." Check the option, "Set as default" and click OK.

12. Proceed normally with synchronization.
