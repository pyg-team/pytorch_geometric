Title: IBM Streamtool getlog file StreamsLogs.tgz does not contain all logfiles - United States

Text:
StreamsLogs.tgz; contents; getlog; Streams TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the StreamsLogs.tgz file not contain all logfiles from the command streamtool getlog? 

CAUSE
A possible cause is if a .bashrc file contains an echo command. One way to check is to SSH to a Streams node and see if output is produced from echo when logging in.

ANSWER
A potential workaround is to insert the following line in front of the echo command in the .bashrc file: 

[[ $- == *i* ]] &&

Example:

[[ $- == *i* ]] && echo "**** I am $USER ****"

NOTE: This does not occur with the Streams 4.x product and later.
