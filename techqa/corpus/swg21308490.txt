QUESTION
 Where can you find the IBM® Rational® Application Developer server logs? 

ANSWER
If you are having a problem running, deploying, or publishing your web application from Rational Application Developer, you may be asked to supply the server logs. Depending on which version of Rational Application Developer and which server is involved, these can be in different places. 




Name Location of Default location Workspace Your current workspace. Rational Application Developer v6 Rational Application Developer v6 C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0 Rational Application Developer v7 Rational Application Developer v7 C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70 Rational Application Developer The version of Rational Application Developer in use;
May be v6 or v7, depending on which one is in use. WebSphere Test Environment WebSphere Test
Environment v5 <RAD>\runtimes\base_v5 WebSphere Test
Environment v5.1 WebSphere Test
Environment v5.1 <Rational Application Developer>\runtimes\base_v51 WebSphere Application Server v6 WebSphere Application
Server v6 <RAD>\runtimes\base_v6 WebSphere Application Server v6.1 WebSphere Application
Server v6.1 <RAD>\runtimes\base_v61 Portal Test Environment 5.1 Portal Test
Environment v5.1.0.x C:\Portal51UTE\ WebSphere Portal Server v6 WebSphere Portal
Server v6.x C:\IBM\WebSphere\ 
What files to supply for each type of Server:


 

Server Type Requested logs are the contents of the directory
(or directories) WebSphere Test Environment 5 

or 

WebSphere Test Environment 5.1 Workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmpN

N = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. WebSphere Application Server 6 Rational Application Developer>\runtimes\base_v6\profiles\ <ProfileName>\logs\<ServerName> 

Where: 

 * <ProfileName> = the name of the Server Profile in use; 

typically "default"  * <ServerName>= the name of the Server in use; 

typically "server1" WebSphere Application Server 6.1 Rational Application Developer>\runtimes\base_v61\profiles\<ProfileName> \logs\<ServerName> 
See entry for "WebSphere Application Server 6" for definitions of 
<ProfileName> and <ServerName>

Portal Test Environment 5.1  *  C:\Portal51UTE\AppServer\logs C:\Portal51UTE\PortalServer\log 

WebSphere Portal Server 6  *  C:\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\logs C:\IBM\WebSphere\PortalServer\log 


Assuming the default location for your installation, here is how to interpret the above: 

If you are using WTE 5.0 or WTE 5.1, the server logs are in the directory <Workspace>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp N 
N = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. ; depending on how many servers you've defined. 

If you are using RAD v6 and WAS 6.0, the server logs are in the directory 
<RAD6>\runtimes\base_v6\profiles\<ProfileName>\logs\<ServerName> 

If you are using RAD v7 and WAS 6.0, the server logs are in the directory 
<RAD7>\runtimes\base_v6\profiles\<ProfileName>\logs\<ServerName> 

If you are using RAD v7 and WAS 6.1, the server logs are in the directory 
<RAD7\runtimes\base_v61\profiles\<ProfileName>\logs\<ServerName> 

Where:  * <ProfileName> = the name of the Server Profile in use; 
   typically "default" 
 * <ServerName>= the name of the Server in use; 
   typically "server1"


In the case of either the PTE51 or WPS, you have to gather the logs of the associated WebSphere Application Server (the AppServer directory) and the logs from the PortalServer directory as well. This is why two (2) directories are listed for the PTE51 and WPS types. 

If your problem is easily reproducible, the best procedure is to: 
 1. Reproduce the problem, 
 2. Stop the server(s) involved, 
 3. Exit Rational Application Developer 
 4. Gather the <Workspace>\.metadata\.log file and ZIP it. 
 5. Gather the server logs, from the location(s) outlined above; generally, ZIPPING each directory listed in the table above works best! 
 6. Send the logs to IBM Support.
    Note: It is quite possible the files will be too large to e-mail, in which case they can be sent using FTP. Follow the procedure outlined in the Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support [http://ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html].
