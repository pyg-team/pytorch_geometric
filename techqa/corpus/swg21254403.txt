Title: IBM ARSDOC error when retrieving documents for distribution. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I'm receiving the following error when running the OnDemand Distribution Facility (ODF):

ARS04460E ARSDOC error: ERROR FROM GETDC Return Code = 00000002 Function = 00000001 Errnum = 00000133 

The Appendix C. Messages section of the OnDemand Distribution Facility Installation and Reference Guide does not provide much information on the message. What do the return code, function, and errnum values mean? 

CAUSE
The message number ARS04460E is a general message for displaying the returned values when accessing the server for a document to be distributed. Most errors are documented on the OnDemand system log so that you can go there to find the cause and resolution of the problem. However, some errors are detected after the server has returned the necessary information. In the case noted here (Errnum = 00000133) the error was because there was insufficient space in the /tmp directory on the HFS.

ANSWER
Space may be limited because the user's user ID has reached the storage utilization limits imposed, because the /tmp directory is too small, or because the /tmp directory is full of unwanted data. Choose from the following actions: 

 * Increase storage utilization limit for the user ID. 
 * Increase the size of the /tmp directory. 
 * Clear the /tmp directory of old files.
