Title: IBM Coding IIB or WMB ESQL to use singles quotes in the DOCTYPE declaration - United States

Text:
MQIINFO DOCTYPE double quotes single TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You use the XML tab within your IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) message to specify the PublicId and the SystemId for the DocType Declaration. You type in the string without any quotes. The system generates these fields with double-quote marks surrounding the string, however the receiving application had specified these strings be surrounded by apostrophes. See example below:

Generated from WebSphere Message Broker (WMB): 

<!DOCTYPE ciflob01 PUBLIC "xml file for CIF LOB updates" "CifUpdatedReq.dtd">

Application Requirements Specifications:

<!DOCTYPE ciflob01 PUBLIC 'xml file for CIF LOB updates' 'CifUpdatedReq.dtd'>

You want to know how to generate the single quotes. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
According to the XML standards a double quote is required where you want a single quote. IIB and WMB follow these XML standards and thus are required to build the DOCTYPE declaration with the double quotes. There is not much that can be done to change this.

You could try converting the data to a BLOB before output, and then replacing the double quotes with single quotes.
