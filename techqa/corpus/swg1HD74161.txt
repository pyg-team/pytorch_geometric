PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   CATIA
   Incident Diagonosis
   .
   FTA/MEASURE RESULTS INCONSISTENT AFTER
   UPDATE AFTER EDITING FEATURE
   .
   EXPLANATION:
   .
   "Update all" updates the position of the
   constrained components so as to satisfy the
   constraint requirements. For Update All ,order of
   updates in update all function will not change.So
   with Automatic update in part and changing to
   Automatic Update is doing the same.Thus part is
   updated and hence measure is also getting updated
   in correct order and measure result is not
   modified.And shows desired correct behaviour
   .
   BYPASS:
   .
   First By-Pass
   (Other Setting same but instead of Uncheck this option)
   "General/Parameters and Measure/Measure
   Tools/Automatic update in product".
   .
   Use ( Select this option)
   "General/Parameters and Measure/Measure
   Tools/Automatic update in part"
   .
   Second  By-Pass:
   .
   (Other Setting same instead of Uncheck this option)
   "Infrastructure/Part Infrastructure/General/Update"
   sets "Manual" .
   .
   Use ( Select this option)
   "Infrastructure/Part Infrastructure/General/Update"
   sets "Automatic".
   .
   Third ByPass:
