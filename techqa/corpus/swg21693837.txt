QUESTION
 How do I monitor StoredIQ service status and restart services that have stopped? 

CAUSE
There are times where you may need to restart a service due to it becoming zombied, or to increase the logging level or after applying a patch. The following commands outline how to do so on the Appstack and the Dataserver and Gateway servers.

ANSWER
To get service status on the Appstack: 

Issue command: /siq/bin/monit summary

To get service status on the Dataserver and Gateway:
Issue command: service deepfiler status

To restart all services on the Appstack:
Issue command: /siq/bin/monit restart all

To restart all services on the Dataserver and Gateway:
Issue command: service deepfiler restart

To restart an individual service on the Appstack:
Get service name from: /siq/bin/monit summary 
Issue command: /siq/bin/monit restart <service_name>

To restart an individual service on the Dataserver and Gateway:
Get service name from: service deepfiler status 
Issue command: /usr/bin/monit -c /etc/deepfile/monitrc restart <service_name>
