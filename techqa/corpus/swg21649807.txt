You can use the following property names: 

 * For a Deployment Manager profile: bpm.dmgr.profilePath 
 * For a Custom profile: bpm.de.node.#.profilePath


For example: 
bpm.dmgr.profilePath=/usr/IBM/bpm85/profiles/DmgrProfile 
bpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:\\Program Files\\WebSphere\\profiles\\MyCustomProfile1  

For Microsoft Windows, you can use double backslashes or forward slashes. For example: 

bpm.de.node.1.profilePath=c:/Program Files/WebSphere/profiles/MyCustomProfile1 

 

Note: If you are creating the profile makes sure a profilePath value does not exist. The parent directory of the profile path should exist and the user should have write privileges to create a new directory. 


For example, if you want to create a profile under the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory. Create the/usr/BPM850profiles directory, but do not create the /usr/BPM850profiles/myProfile directory.
