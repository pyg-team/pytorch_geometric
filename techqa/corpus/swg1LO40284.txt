APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is requesting the ability to ensure the Notes Client
   version
   information captured in the Person Document is current without
   keeping
   historically client version detail.  This could be achieved
   several ways:
   
   1 - Allow the Notes Client version data to expire, for example
   after
   60 days or 90 days (something Admin settable) and the data is
   removed.
   The benefit is for those users who have a PC that is replaced,
   after 60
   or 90 days the old PC is no longer listed on the person doc.
   
   
   
   2 - The ability to go in an manually delete a single entry from
   a specific
   person document
   
   
   3 - the ability to have the client re-populate the version
   information.
   If we are dumping data not modified in the last 60 or 90
   days, then every 30 days, the client should rewrite the client
   version.
   this should be a programmed / scheduled event.
