PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are unable to publish, test or debug an application from IBM Rational Application Developer v7.5 on IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Edition, when a deployment manager is being used. 

CAUSE
WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (ND) Edition is not supported to publish, test or debug an application from Server Tools (Assembly and Deployment Tools) in Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software 7.5 when the server is configured to use the network deployment features of the product. This is also stated in the IBM Rational Application Developer Assembly and Deployment Tools document. (Reference)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use WebSphere Application Server management tools, such as Administrative Console, to deploy and test an application for WebSphere Application Server ND Edition. Alternatively, stop the deployment manager and deploy the application to the "Application Server" profile type to mimic the behaviour of the Base Edition.
