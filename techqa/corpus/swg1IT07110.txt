 *  STRRTC - 455783
   SF / SF

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue:
   If you have a rule that monitors when an MQ MFT agent is
   stopped, then when the rule is triggered it will cause about 100
   alerts to be created.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix:
   Changed the logic behind the MQ MFT monitoring so that it looks
   for Agents with a status that contains STOPPED instead of
   matches STOPPED.
