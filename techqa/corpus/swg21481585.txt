Title: IBM SPSS 16 for Windows will not recognize UNC paths in File->Open dialogs - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using SPSS for Windows in both local and distributed mode (i.e., connected to SPSS 16 Server for Windows) and it appears that I can no longer use UNC path designations to navigate in the File->Open dialog boxes. If I choose File->Open->Data, for example, and enter 

\\myserver

in the File name field and enter, I get this response in an error pop-up:

\\myserver
File not found. Please verify the correct file
name was given.

All I can do is click OK. The only way I can navigate to files held on remote file servers is via 1) My Network Places, 2) a mapped drive letter, and 3) browsing to the file in Windows Explorer and double-clicking on it. Options 2) and 3), of course, are not options when working in Distributed Mode.

This seems to be an artifact of the new Java-based dialog boxes.

There is actually one other option: If I know the entire route to my file name and can enter the whole thing:

\\myserver\path\filename.sav

Then it will find the file properly. But that's just too burdensome to have to do.

Is there anything to be done? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been filed with SPSS Development. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

At present, other than specifying the enitire UNC path down to the filename, the workaround is to specify at least both the servername and share: \\servername\share 

In SPSS 15 we used the native Windows file dialogs which did fully support UNC server names. In versions 16 and later we use Java-based file dialogs. And the problem is due to a limitation in Java 1.5 that has been fixed in Java 1.6. We are currently planning to incorporate Java 1.6 into Statistics release 18.0.
