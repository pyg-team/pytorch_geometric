QUESTION
 How can you use domain certificate categories and lists objects in the IBM QRadar Network Security (IQNS) Outbound SSL Inspection Policy? 

ANSWER
In the Outbound SSL Inspection Policy, there are two domain certificate object types that allow you to customize inspection rules.

The domain certificate category objects allow users to select pre-defined categories as determined by X-Force.

The domain certificate list objects allow users to specify individual domains. 

Note: The domain certificate category objects and domain certificate list objects can reside within the same Outbound SSL Inspection Policy rule.

To assist you in the configuration of the domain certificate, see the IBM knowledge Center: Configuring custom domain certificate category objects [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.3/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_configuring_custom_domain_certificate_category_objects.htm] and IBM Knowledge Center: Configuring custom domain certificate list objects [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.3/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_configuring_custom_domain_certificate_objects.htm].

Definitions of Domain Certificate:


 * A domain certificate is the SSL certificate that is presented by a web server to secure communication and includes the site domain name. It does not have to be issued by an external certificate authority (CA). 
 * A domain certificate category is an X-Force predetermined category that you can use to restrict the types of domain certificates that users can access on your network.
   
   Example: When a user tries to access a banking website, we will access certain domain certificates issued by the banks in order to have a secure transaction.
   
 * A domain certificate list can be used to allow or deny access to a list of specific URL domains independent of a domain certificate category.


Conditions for a successful deployment : 
 1. The XGS appliance is deployed in front of the client segment. 
    
 2. IP routing is enabled on the appliance because the inspection port pair requires an IP address and default gateway. 
    
 3. The appliance signing CA is trusted by clients.
    
    Notes: 

 * The static Routes page provides support for intermediate routes between the ISNP and the client subnet. 
 * For XGS firmware version 5.2, the Outbound SSL Inspection requires an IP address on the inspection port. This is not required in XGS versions 5.3 and up. 
   
   

As a best practice : 

Limit the traffic being inspected by adding the external facing adapters to the External_Networks subnet object when used as the destination in a Outbound SSL Inspection rule. 
 1. In SiteProtector, open the Outbound SSL Inspection Policy.
    
 2. Expand the left panel Network Object (drag and drop on Rules).
    
 3. Under the Subnet folder, find the External_Network. Right click and select Edit.
    
    Note: This is a shared object and if you have several XGS appliances in your site, you may want to create separate External_Networks_<XGSName> objects instead of editing the default one.

 4. The Edit Subnet Address window will open. Here you will add the Name, Subnet Address, and Comments.
