QUESTION
 The next leap second will occur on 2016 December 31, 23h 59m 60s UTC. Will this have any impact on Security Guardium time? 

ANSWER
The Guardium clock is based on the underlying Redhat operating system. For detailed information about how Redhat handles leap second issues see here:

https://access.redhat.com/articles/15145 [https://access.redhat.com/articles/15145]
The result is that a patch must be installed to keep the time correct on your Guardium appliance after December 31 2016:

For Version 9 appliances -> Ad hoc patch p1087 has the fix (p500 or higher GPU is a prerequisite). This fix will be included in the next bundle patch after p703.

For Version 10 appliances -> Ad hoc patch p126 has the fix (p100 is a prerequisite). This fix will be included in the next bundle patch after p125.

If you cannot find the correct patch on fix central, please contact technical support.
