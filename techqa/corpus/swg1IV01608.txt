LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Splitting a topology view in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal ITCAM
   for Transaction Reporter workspace does not save changes after
   split and dismissal of properties dialog.
   
   The ITCAM for Transactions Reporter agent delivers product
   provided topology view workspaces.  If you split a topology
   view, then make changes to the properties of that view the
   changes do not get saved when you dismiss the properties dialog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A Java class cast exception was being thrown and not properly
   caught.  Fixed the code so when a view is split and the
   properties are changed the changes are correctly reflected when
   the properties dialog is dismissed.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Press the workspace save button, leave the workspace and come
   back.  The changes are saved when the workspace is saved and
   reloaded.
