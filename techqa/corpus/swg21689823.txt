Title: IBM java.io.IOException: Too many open files detected in the seas.log file - United States

Text:
java.io.IOException: Too many open files fast wakeup condition; SSP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 "java.io.IOException: Too many open files" detected in the seas.log file on an IBM Sterling Secure Proxy Engine node. There were no errors in the seas.log file on the server where IBM Sterling External Authentication Server is installed.




SYMPTOM
Could not handle fast wakeup condition - before accept connection - java.io.IOException: Too many open files



CAUSE
The java.io.IOException: Too many open files is an indicator that the nofiles ulimit is not sufficient. Sockets on a UNIX/Linux system are handled as files and as such if there are not enough file handles available this will impact the ability of Sterling Secure Proxy to service connection requests and cause other errors such as the fast wakeup error seen. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the the "ulimit -n" value for Sterling Secure Proxy, it is recommended it be set to unlimited.
