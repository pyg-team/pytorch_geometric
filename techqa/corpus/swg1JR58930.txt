ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:Ã˜
   While Upgrading to BPM 8.6 CF201712, customer failed at profile
   upgrade step. The exception below can be found at the log of
   BPMConfig -upgrade profiles.
   =======
   [12/19/17 8:08:15:152 GMT] 00000001 BPMConfig     E
   com.ibm.bpm.config.BPMConfig main CWMCB0046E: The
   'setGenericJVMArguments' command failed: ADMF0002E: Required
   parameter
   genericJvmArguments is not found for command
   setGenericJVMArguments.
   ========
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  During profile upgrade to CF2017.12, the following WebSphere
   variables in the generic JVM arguments of the IBM BPM server are
   replaced by their respective values: IBMSCMX,
   IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON, and IBMJITPMC. If the generic JVM arguments
   contain other WebSphere variables, the BPMConfig -upgrade
   command attempts to resolve them at the node level. This attempt
   fails if the WebSphere variables are defined at the server
   level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An interim fix that restricts attempts at variable resolution to
   only the IBMSCMX, IBMGCPOLICY_GENCON, and IBMJITPMC variables is
   available for CF2017.12 on Fix Central.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Before starting the deployment manager for the first time after
   applying CF2017.12, manually replace server-level WebSphere
   variables like SERVER_LOG_ROOT in the generic JVM arguments.
   When the profile upgrade has successfully completed, change the
   generic JVM arguments back to use the WebSphere variables you
   want to use.
