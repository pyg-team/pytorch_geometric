Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat affect IBM Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Apache Tomcat is shipped as a component of RLKS Administration and Reporting Tool (RLKS ART). Information about multiple security vulnerabilities affecting Apache Tomcat, version 7.0.52, have been published in this security bulletin. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-6816 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0762 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to process the user supplied password if the specified user name does not exist by the Realm implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct a timing attack and determine valid usernames on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118407 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118407] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6797]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a local attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system, caused by an error in the ResourceLinkFactory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to arbitrary global JNDI resources.
CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118403 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118403] for the current score
