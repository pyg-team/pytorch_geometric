PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During the installation of Maximo for Utilities 7.5.0.1 you may run in to a update error on script HF7501_10 

SYMPTOM
Updatedb fails with the following error due to a missing column. 

-- Script: Successful
-- Calling the dbchange file : HF7501_10 Mon Feb 08 09:45:57 MST 2016
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
* freeform: update JOBTASK table
*/
update jobtask set crewworkgroup = plusdworkgroup where plusdworkgroup is not null and crewworkgroup is null
;

BMXAA7025E -- Script failed while running.;
BMXAA8313E -- A statement failed to execute inside a freeform statement. See the nested exception.;
sql#904;
ORA-00904: "PLUSDWORKGROUP": invalid identifier


CAUSE
During the installation for the Utilities 7.5.0.1 hot fix script HF7501_10 may throw the above error. This can occur if the previous script had already dropped the column. 

In your updatedb logs you may see the following messages before the error occurs. 

/*
* Drop attributes from Mbo JOBTASK
*/
delete from maxattribute where attributename = 'PLUSDWORKGROUP' and
objectname = 'JOBTASK'
;

// Deleted 1 record.

delete from maxattributecfg where attributename = 'PLUSDWORKGROUP' and
objectname = 'JOBTASK'
;

Because the drop has already happened the updatedb fails when during the attempt to set crewworkgroup equal to plusdworkgroup. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem and bypass the error we can alter the jobtask table to add plusdworkgroup back. This will allow the hotfix to drop it again on script HF7501_10 without failure. 

The following alter can add the column back to the jobtask table. Once added re-run updatedb and allow the process to drop the column once more.

alter table jobtask add (plusdworkgroup varchar2(8) NULL);
