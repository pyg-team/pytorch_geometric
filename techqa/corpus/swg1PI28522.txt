ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DFHRM0107 Intersystem communication failure received during
   syncpoint
   PERFORM_COMMIT processing.
   .
   After migrating from CTCS 3.2 to 5.1, DFHRM0107 appears
   indicating a comms failure.
   .
   The dump shows a task issue EC LINK requests that result in
   a DPL request over an IPIC session. Eventually, the program
   terminates and issues an implicate syncpoint. A Perform_Prepare
   is sent over the IPIC session successfully but when the
   Prepare_Commit is sent it fails
   L802F WB 0D00 WBSV  ENTRY READ_REQUEST
   L802F WB 0D18 WBSV  *EXC* LAST_BODY_NOT_RECV
   L802F SO 0201 SOCK  ENTRY RECEIVE
   L802F SO 0202 SOCK  EXIT  RECEIVE/EXCEPTION
   UNKNOWN_SESSION_TOKEN,
   .
   The CICS change team have commented that the implementation of
   IMPLICIT FORGET flow during SYNCPOINT is the cause of the
   RM0107.
   At pre CTS 4.1 the FORGET flow is always expected to be received
   as a response to COMMITED flow sent....
   .
   This APAR has been taken to investigate the problem.

   *                      failure received during SYNCPOINT       *
   *                      processing between a CICS TS 5.1        *
   *                      and a CICS TS 3.2 connected by IPIC.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The IPconn is set up between a CICS TS 5.1 region and a CICS TS
   3.2 region. After the DPL requests,  the SYNCPOINT processing is
   started. The CICS TS 5.1 firstly sends a PREPARE request and
   received a properly response. Then it sends a COMMITED flow.
   As the CICS TS 3.2 does not support IMPLICIT FORGET, a FORGET
   flow is always expected to be received, as a response of the
   COMMITED flow. The problem is the received FORGET response is
   treated as a request instead, which causes the DFHRM0107.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHISUOW has been changed to make sure the FORGET flow is
   received and processed as the response of the COMMITED flow,
   if IMPLICIT FORGET is disabled.
