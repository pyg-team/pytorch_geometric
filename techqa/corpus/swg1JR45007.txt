APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Nothing found in the Online documentation
   for BPM v7.5 and BPM V8 about teamworks.MQMessage class. Found
   an entry in the release notes from WLE
   7.1 about WebSphere MQ integration:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wle/v7r1/index.jsp?topi
   c=%2Fwle [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wle/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fwle]
   %2Frn%2Ftopic%2FWhats_changed_in_TeamWorks_710_rn.html
   "Previous releases of Lombardi Teamworks 6 provided support for
   WebSphere MQ or WebSphere embedded messaging for the product's
   internal queues. WebSphere MQ is not supported for the product's
   internal queues in this release. The Java Integration component
   that allows process applications to interface with WebSphere MQ
   is still available and supported."
   But could not found any entry for MQMessage within the WLE 7.1
   online documentation.
   
   Same for teamworks.JMSMessage.
   If we support these both classes, they should be mentioned in
   the InfoCenter. Their usage pattern, especially when to use
   which class. Their restrictions, MQMessage seems not usable if
   one uses SSL communication between BPM and WebSphere MQ.
   JMSMessage seems to be not usable when using MQ as JMS provider.
   
   Customers await complete section about integration between BPD
   processes and JMS provider esp. MQ in both directions (putting
   msgs on queues and getting msgs from queues).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users using Teamworks.JMSMessage class to   *
   *                  create/retrieve JMS messages from MQ.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Documentation on how to use the class   *
   *                      is missing.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   There is no documentation from BPM on how to use the
   Teamworks.JMSMessage class and what is supported with this
   feature.  Without proper information regarding the class,
   users cannot properly implement this into their application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  New documentation will be created outlining the details of
   this class.
