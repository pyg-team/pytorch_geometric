PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to open any C&DS job: 
Error opening job faultString: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle

Also the PEB portal for C&DS does not work: "System unable to connect to server." 

SYMPTOM
Attempting to open any C&DS job (even a brand new job that was just created) results in an error seen in the client and the spssemgr.log that looks like this:

ERROR com.spss.mgmt.prms.ui.editors.PrmsClusterEditor - Error opening job.

Additionally, attempting to access the C&DS peb Deployment Portal results in an error that says: 

 

"System unable to connect to server." 

But connecting to the Deployment Manager web portal does work.



CAUSE
These problems can be caused by WebSphere being improperly configured to use a SSL certificate whose signer is not added to the local trust store for WebSphere


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review your WebSphere logs, and check to see if there are any SSL engine errors like these::

cds.log:
ERROR [class] Servlet error
javax.servlet.ServletException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:
General SSLEngine problem

SystemErr.log:
SystemErr R
javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General SSLEngine problem

SystemOut.log:
E CWPKI0022E: SSL
HANDSHAKE FAILURE: A signer with SubjectDN "CN=SPSS, DC=XYZ,
DC=com" was sent from target host:port "SPSS:9443". The signer
may need to be added to local trust store
"<PATH>/trust.p12" located in SSL configuration alias
"NodeDefaultSSLSettings" loaded from SSL configuration file
"security.xml". The extended error message from the SSL handshake
exception is: "PKIX path building failed:
java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid
certification path to requested target".



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure the SSL certificate being used by the WebSphere profile is part of the local trust store for WebSphere and is properly configured within WebSphere. Please consult WebSphere documentation or contact WebSphere support if you are not sure how to correct this problem.
