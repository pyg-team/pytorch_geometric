ANSWER
 

The following lists a very brief description of some of the MAIN processes referred to by Guardium. 

The list is not exhaustive and is subject to change at any time. 

NOTE 
some of the must_gathers provide a list of processes running at the time the must_gather is taken in a file a called running_system_processes.txt. The must_gather files can be viewed via fileserver at any time

Common processes



process / name purpose mysql Internal database system that contains the session data etc from the STAPs nanny a main overseeing process - controls restarting other processes when needed. snif The Guardium sniffer process that processes STAP data coming from DB Servers. 
- analyzer - analyzes and filters the data based on the Installed Policy 
- parser - parses the sql to get the object/field/verb etc 
- logger - logs this data to Internal Database for use by GUI reports etc. sniffer_buffer_usage Collects a periodic (every minute) snapshot of the sniffer and system performance - data can be seen in Buffer Usage Monitor report tomcat used by the Guardium GUI classifier (guard-classifier) - listens for distributed tasks like VA and data marts. rds (rds_retriever) - associated with snif - used to monitor Amazon Relational Databse Service (RDS) sqlsession_watch checks and reacts to long sessions on the Guardium Appliance Internal Database. ame_process AME interface to the tomcat/GUI 

Other processes / daemons 

process / name purpose install_patch.sh runs every 2 minutes to initiate installation of any newly requested patches guard-cas.sh Change Auditing System (CAS) listener process guard_sender sends email alerts etc. guard_filetransfer used to send newly created files (eg Archives /Exports etc) and sends them 

Main Aggregation / backup processes 
You may also notice the following activities at time when Aggregation processes are running 

process / name purpose archive generating Archive file(s) export generating export file(s) and sends to an Aggregator import imports the files that have been sent from other appliances (eg export files from a Collector) backup turbine_backup.sh - System backup process (for CONFIG / DATA )
