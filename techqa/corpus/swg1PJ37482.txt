   COMMENTS:
   The Monitoring Agent for z/TPF is composed of agent
   applications and agent application support files. The agent
   applications run on Windows only and are the pieces that
   communicate with TPF. The agent application support files are
   the pieces that function with the components of an ITM Tivoli
   Monitoring (ITM) environment.
   
   The Monitoring Agent for z/TPF installer run on the Windows
   platform only and can install the agent applications and/or the
   agent application support files. If the ITM environment is
   running on linux or AIX, a separate installer is required to
   install the agent application support files on those platforms.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
   This APAR creates an application support installer (ASI) to
   install agent application support file on linux or AIX. This
   installer is in addition to the Windows agent installer. The
   new ASI is available for download for z/TPF and TPF4.1
   customers from the TPF Tools web page
