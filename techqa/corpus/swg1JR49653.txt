    [2/22/14 6:17:32:512 IST] 00000013 TimeoutManage I   WTRN0006W:
   Transaction
   0000014456FD6B1F00000001000002AF027A469C93CAB9EA26C01F0A4D47CADB
   9F3DE8530000014456FD6B1F00000001000002AF027A469C93CAB9EA26C01F0A
   4D47CADB9F3DE85300000001 has timed out after 1200 seconds.
    [2/22/14 6:17:32:516 IST] 00000013 TimeoutManage I   WTRN0124I:
   When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction
   is, or was most recently, associated was
   Thread[WorkManager.default : 4,5,reserved: WC_demo]. The stack
   trace of this thread when the timeout occurred was:
      java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method)
   
   java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite(SocketOutputStream.java:
   103)
   
   java.net.SocketOutputStream.write(SocketOutputStream.java:147)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Quick Publish is designed to handle publication of a small
   changes in a timely manner. The stagingprop utility should be
   used to propagate much larger loads.
    Note that the stagingprop utility can be configured to only
   propagate specific tables from the staging environment to
   production.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
