APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you start a business process definition (BPD) instance by
   using a start message event that has a condition that evaluates
   to false, the BPD instance must not be created but it is.
   To remove the unwanted BPD instance, the data must be deleted.
   However, deleting the data might cause a deadlock. As a result,
   the unusable BPD instance remains
   in the system.
   
   If you select this unusable BPD instance in the Inspector view
   of IBM Process Designer, you receive an error message similar to
   the following error message:
   
   BPDInstanceData with ID BPDInstanceData.<XXX> not found.
   
   If you try to delete that BPD instance from the Inspector view,
   you get the same message and the BPD instance remains in the
   system.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  BPD instances triggered by start message events must not be
   created when the message contains a condition that evaluates to
   false. However, these BPD instances are created. To rectify the
   situation, a cleanup is performed in the same database
   transaction. If the cleanup fails (perhaps because of a database
   deadlock), some BPD instance references remain in the database.
   These references are still visible and cause the BPD instances
   to be unusable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that corrects the error
   handling so that no instance fragments remain after the
   instance creation is rejected by the start message condition.
