   operating systems OSX 10.9.x or 10.10.x. Your macintosh computer
   interface use Japanese language. When you open Terminal.app on
   these computers and run the command Locale
   you see the system locale is Japanese as well:

   You downloaded the installer file for release 23
   SPSSSC_23.0_MAC_OS_ML.dmg on the Mac desktop and start the
   installer. However, on some Macintosh computer the installer
   does not start in Japanese language, whereas on other Macintosh
   computer the installer launch with Japanese language.

LOCAL FIX
 *  To make sure to have the installation in Japanese language and
   to have release 23 launch in Japanese user interface language

   instead.

       IBM SPSS Statistics Client 23.0 Mac OS Silent Multilingual
   (CN3ELML ) 752 MB which is for example part of package: IBM SPSS
   Statistics Desktop 23.0 for Base and all Modules Mac OS
   Multilingual eAssembly (CRUM5ML)
   2. The silent installer file name is then:
   SPSSSC_23.0_MAC_OS_SILENT_ML.dmg
   3. Unpack this dmg file on a Macintosh desktop to obtain the bin
   file: SPSS_Statistics_Installer.bin

   5. Edit installer.properties file in a text editor with your
   companies parameter and authorization code, installation
   directory etc. Put both files on a location on a Macintosh
   harddrive. It is important that this file is placed in the same
