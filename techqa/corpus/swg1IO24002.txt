IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1 Fix Pack 4 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FDatacap+Taskmaster+Capture&fixids=8.1.0.4-Datacap-Taskmaster-WIN-FP004&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using DotScan, with default ISISScan panel, to scan
   documents.  They have it configured to show Image View window
   with Vertical thumbnails.
   
   When DotScan is first launched, for the first batch scanned,
   users can CTRL-click or Shift-Click and multiselect pages in the
   Batch view window to perform actions (e.g. Delete).
   
   However, for all subsequent batches (after first batch is
   Submitted or Cancelled), the multiselect in the batch view no
   longer works.  If, however, you disable thumbnails in the image
   view window, then you can multiselect pages in the batch view
   window again.
   
   But. customer requires to be able to view thumbnails and be able
   to multiselect images in the batch view.  And this does work
   correctly for the very first batch only.
