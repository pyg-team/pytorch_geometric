APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There exists common.properties parameter "search_ignorecase
   parameter" whether search is case sensitive or not.  This
   parameter affects only search on String attributes using Rich
   search in UI. Doing Search using Query Language (QL) is not
   affected.
   In order to do case insensitive search using QL, there exists
   function upper(). The string attribute you want to search then
   needs to be contained in function upper()  and you will have to
   convert the matching string yourself to uppercase.
   e.g. if you want to run case insensitive search on String
   attribute Displayname,  you would use query like:
          select item from catalog('My_Catalog') where (
   upper(item['My_Primary Spec/Displayname'] )  like 'ITEM%' )
   Category based search is always case sensitive, in both, UI and
   QL.
   This along with Query Language sample should be updated in
   infocenter.
