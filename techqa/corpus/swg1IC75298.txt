APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The command amqrrmit -m MQQMGR returns
   **Warning: Unable to identify the Master Repman CPU **
   Following the warning  a large number of FDC's are being
   generated with the  Probe Id RM527001.
   
   
   Probe ID - RM527001
   Component - rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket
   Major Error Code - OK
   Probe Description - AMQ6125: An internal WebSphere MQ error has
   occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *   Increased the lock limit .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   In some complex cluster configuations with
   large numbers of cluster members, large numbers
   of objects, or frequent changes to cluster
   objects, the repository managers in a queue
   manager are unable to distribute a complete set
   of object metadata information,  resulting in
   repeated FDCs from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket, with
   probe RM527001, and cluster objects not being
   visible in some CPUs in the queue manager
   reporting the problems.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   The buffer used to distribute metadata
   between the repository managers  running in
   a queue manager has a fixed upper limit.
   Once this limit is reached, the repository
   information on that queue manager can become
   inconsistent between the CPUs running
   repository managers.  The repository
   implementation was changed to allocate a
   larger buffer initially, and to make the
   maximum size configurable.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *   In some configurations, terminating the slave
   repository manager processes individually will
   cause the cluster information to be loaded
   directly from the repository queue and restore
   the consistency, however, subsequent object
   changes or expiring object subcriptions will
   cause the slave repository managers to begin
   generating the FDCs again.
