PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Sometimes its useful to get an earlier release of the IBM JDK such as 1.4.2 or 1.5 to test your application with an older compatible release of Java. This technote describes how to do that. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Some commands in ITM or ITCAM for SOA don't always work with the latest and greatest Java. The supported levels are usually JRE 1.4.2. or 1.5 and higher for some ITM 6.2.x versions. Just in case you want to use a lower level of JRE that's still compatible and supported, this is how you can get it.

- pick your OS
- login if needed
- download the file, unzip/untar
- change permissions if needed
- install it to a temp directory


If you prefer you can add this JRE to your PATH variable for it to be picked up when you start your application.
