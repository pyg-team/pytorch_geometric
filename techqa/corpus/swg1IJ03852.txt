LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An incorrect call by the jvm while setting the group owner of
   the shared cache control files causes the group owner id to take
   a default value. Due to this, other users belonging to the same
   group as the creator are not able to access the cache, even when
   the groupaccess subparameter has been specified along with the
   -Xshareclasses option.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The jvm has been changed to correctly set the group owner of the
   shared cache control files to the group of the cache creator.
