 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 PowerKVM is affected by vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. IBM has now addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-8610 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8610]
DESCRIPTION: The SSL/TLS protocol is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when processing ALERT packets during a SSL handshake. By sending specially-crafted plain-text ALERT packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume all available CPU resources. Note: This vulnerability is called "SSL-Death-Alert".
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118296] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3731 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3731]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read when using a specific cipher. By sending specially crafted truncated packets, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using CHACHA20/POLY1305 to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121312] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
