ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When 'AND and OR' and 'Show Operators' options are specified to
   be
   hidden in a search template definition, the options are still
   displayed in the seach template UI at run time.
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1  Create a new search template and clear the Show ANDs and ORs
   option under the Tools > Options > Search Template tab.
   2  Browse to the Search Template and select it to open the new
   Workplace XT UI.
   
   Search designers can optionally define the Search Template to
   hide "AND and OR" and "Show operators" options during runtime
   from Tools > Options > Search Template Option. However,
   Workplace XT was not honoring the option and showed "AND and OR"
   and the search operators to the users although the option was
   set to hide these criteria.
   
   Actual Results:
   
   The AND and OR operators are displayed in the search template
   UI.
   
   Expected Results:
   
   The AND and OR operators should not be displayed in the search
   template UI.
