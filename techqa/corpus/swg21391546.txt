QUESTION
 When you use a Take Action command to run a robotic script, the command indicates that it ran successfully. Why does the script sometimes fail to run?. 

ANSWER
In ITCAM for Transactions, the Take Action command performs rudimentary error checking. When you launch the Take Action command to run a script, the Take Action dialog displays a message indicating that the command processed successfully. For example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&amp;aid=1]

To use the Take Action command to run a script manually, you need to enter the script name and file type correctly. The pop-up only indicates that the command is syntactically correct and that a playback is scheduled on the selected agent. The message does not indicate whether the script started or ran correctly on that agent. 

Determining the Script Name and Type

In the Navigator tree in the TEP console, navigate to the Application Management Console > Robotic Scripts workspace. Examine the Robotic Scripts workspace. The scripts that have been uploaded to the Application Management Console (T3 agent) and their file types are identified here. Note that the script filenames end in the file type extension '.zip'.

Using Take Action Commands to Run Scripts Manually

1) First, you need to know the script name and whether it is a Rational Performance Tester (RPT) script, or some other robotic script. Find this information in the Robotic Scripts workspace.

2) Select the Robotic Response Time node in the Navigator tree where you want to schedule a playback for this script. For example:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&amp;aid=3]

3) Right click the node and select the Take Action command. Slide your cursor over to the right to the secondary pop-up window. Choose the Select entry in the pop-up menu. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&amp;aid=4]

The following dialog displays:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=5]

4) In the Name entry, click the down arrow and select Run Robotic Script. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=6]

5) A secondary dialog pops up. In the Edit Argument Values pop-up, enter the robotic script type from the following list:


 * Value Script Type
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=7] 

Enter the script name exactly as it appears in the Robotic Scripts workspace, without the script type prefix. That is, enter the script name PlantsByWebSphere.zip, not RPT/PlantsByWebSphere.zip. For example, to run the PlantsByWebSphere.zip script, enter the following parameters: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&amp;aid=8] 

Click OK to complete the command. 

6) In the larger dialog box, select the agent where you want to run the script. Then, click OK to enter the command. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&aid=9] 

 

7) The Action Status popup displays the message Executed successfully. Note that the message Executed successfully only means that the command is syntactically correct and that the playback is scheduled on the selected agent.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21391546&amp;aid=10] 

 

Indications that the Take Action Command is Faulty 

In this example, if you enter the script name as PlantsByWebSphere instead of PlantsByWebSphere.zip (the .zip filename extension is important), you see the following two messages in the Situation Event Console. Here it is important to pay attention to the time on the local host that you entered the Take Action command.

 * 
 * Could not obtain a list of uploaded robotic scripts


To display the Situation Event Console, select the same Robotic Response Time node in the Navigator tree that you selected to enter the Take Action command. In the following example, these two warning messages are the first two messages displayed in the Situation Event Console. Resolve the error by repeating step 5 with the correct argument values.
