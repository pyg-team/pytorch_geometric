 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why am I getting the error, 'Failed retrieving bean metadata.netezza.max.stmt.handles'? 

ANSWER
When using the JDBC driver, one connection instance can only execute a single query at a time. This means that if one query is already executing on a specific connection instance, no other queries can be sent for parallel execution. If you run multiple queries using the same connection instance, you might encounter an error similar to the following: 

 * 
 * Error[1]: Failed retrieving bean metadata.netezza.max.stmt.handles


This can occur when passing the same connection instance in multiple threads and all or some of these threads are trying to send queries for execution. 

Currently, PureData System for Analytics does not support using the JDBC driver in a multi-threaded fashion.
