PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  This APAR affects users who are reading the *
   *                  Information Center for WebSphere            *
   *                  Application Server Version 7.0 to install   *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Information Center for WebSphere    *
   *                      Application Server Version 7.0 does     *
   *                      not document several critical steps     *
   *                      that the user needs to perform to       *
   *                      make the installation of a Web server   *
   *                      plug-in less error prone.               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   version 7.0 does not clearly define how to add the location of
   the GSKit to the library path and add the GSKit properties so
   that the Web server plug-in starts properly. This information
   would make the installation of the Web server plug-in easier
   and less prone to unexpected results.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Troubleshooting Web server plug-ins installation and
   removal" topic in the Information Center for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 7.0 will be updated to include a new
   item under the "Miscellaneous messages, hints, and tips"
   heading. The new item, which will be listed as "Add the
   location of GSKit to the library path and add GSKit
   properties" is described in the following text:
   
   Add the location of GSKit to the library path and add GSKit
   properties
   
   Users of Web server Plug-ins for IBM WebSphere Application
   Server 7.0.0.0 with Web servers other than the IBM HTTP server
   need to run the following script:
   
   setupGSKitLibPath.bat (for Windows)
   setupGSKitLibPath.sh  (for Linux)
   
   This script adds the location of GSKit to the library path. An
   Apache 2.22 (Linux) example for completing this process follows:
   
   Run <plug-ins_root>/bin >setupGSKitLibPath.sh
   Start the Web server <apache_root>/bin > httpd
   
   Also, you need to add the GSKit properties for other Web
   servers and make the appropriate changes in the httpd.conf
   configuration file. The installer does not set these properties.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the current
   documentation before you read this text. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   and select the version and product that is appropriate for
   your WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the May 2009
   update to the Information Centers.
