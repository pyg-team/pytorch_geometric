PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <This problem is fixed. When the po is marked as Pay On
   Receipt, the Receiving process creates Invoice at the save of
   the receipt.  The Work Order is at a different site than the
   originating PO. There was mismatch of the sites when the
   Invoice object tried to fetch the PO record, causing the null
   pointer exception problem. The problem is fixed in the
   Receiving object passing the correct POSITEID.>
