APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you have variables with the same name but of different types
   on two distinct process applications, then a task query may
   return proper values of this variable for tasks from a process
   application, and null values for tasks from the other business
   application.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
   IBM Process Federation Server
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue occurs because of regression introduced with interim
   fix JR56068 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR56068].
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM Process Federation Server
   cumulative fix 2016.12 that ensures task queries of variables
   with the same name but of different types are handled properly.
   
   To determine whether the cumulative fix is available and
   download it if it is, complete the following steps on Fix
   Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral):
   
   1. On the Select product tab, select WebSphere as the product
   group, IBM Business Process Manager (Standard or Advanced) from
   the WebSphere options, All as the installed version, and All as
   the platform, and then click Continue.
   2. In the Text field, enter "cumulative fix?, and click
   Continue.
   3. Download the fix pack named
   "pfs.8570.delta.cf2016.12.repository".
   
   After you apply the fix, rebuild the Process Federation Server
   indexes from scratch:
   1. Shut down all the Process Federation Server nodes.
   2. Delete the elasticsearch directory on all nodes. This
   directory is in the same location as the Process Federation
   Server server.xml file.
   3. Restart the Process Federation Server nodes.
