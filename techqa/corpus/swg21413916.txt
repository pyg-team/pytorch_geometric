TSA; DB2; 9.5; installation TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer wants to confirm if the TSA integrated into DB2 9.5 was installed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There isn't any DB2 or Tivoli command to check this. Fortunately, there are some alternatives that can be explored:
1. Check the TSA install log. The installSAM utility generates a sequence of log files that are named sequentially, for example: 

/tmp/installSAM.<log-number>.log 

where log-number identifies the log file in the sequence. 

2.Run " lssrc -g rsct_rm " which is an OS command. An output like the one below will be generated: 
Subsystem Group PID Status 
IBM.ConfigRM rsct_rm 589876 active 
IBM.CSMAgentRM rsct_rm 549096 active 
IBM.ServiceRM rsct_rm 561372 active 
IBM.GblResRM rsct_rm 643140 active 
IBM.RecoveryRM rsct_rm 303300 active 
IBM.vsd rsct_rm 286904 active 
IBM.TestRM rsct_rm 282724 active 
IBM.StorageRM rsct_rm 618560 active 
IBM.ERRM rsct_rm inoperative 
IBM.AuditRM rsct_rm inoperative 
IBM.HostRM rsct_rm inoperative 
IBM.LPRM rsct_rm inoperative 

If IBM.RecoveryRM is part of the output then TSA was installed.

3. Check /usr/sbin/rsct/bin for the binary of IBM.RecoveryRMd.
