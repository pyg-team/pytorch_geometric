Ask the Experts session 
06 October 2015 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:02 General introduction 03:50 Introduction of Panel of Experts 05:55 Technical introduction 06:37 What causes CWRLS0030W or DCSV8030I messages in the SystemOut.log file? 09:29 What causes HA instability or "split brain" issue? 11:06 Do my cellnames need to be unique? 12:43 What is the consequence of having multiple ORBs in my JVM from running ORB.init()? 19:57 I see strange / unpredictable WLM behavior or performance problems. How do I figure out the problem? 32:40 What is the role of HA Manager Bulletin Board service? 33:45 What is the role of the nodeagents location service daemon for ORB high availability and load balancing? 38:06 Customer environment has one JVM that is hanging and is unable to start another JVM. Why is this occuring? How can this be resolved? See "CWRLS0030W message continuously logged and WAS fails" in Related information for link referenced in this answer. 39:44 Do we see any message in SystemOut.log before we enable ORB Trace to identify multiple ORBs? 42:17 We see CWRLS0030W or DCSV8030I messages in the systemout.log. What is the solution to fix that, so that the JVMs doesn't wait for the go-ahead from the HA manager? Is there any permanent fix for this other than restarting the HA manager itself? See "Top 10 things to know about HA Manager" in Related information for link referenced in this answer. 45:35 What is the recommended cell size or core group? See "How to set Protocol" in Related information for link referenced in this answer. 48:40 What is the correct way to bootstrap? See "Getting an initial context" in Related information for link referenced in this answer.. 50:20 On z/OS, if node agent is not started will this prevent WLM from work properly? 51:23 What is the consequence of having multiple ORBs in my JVM from running ORB.init()? 53:28 What is meant by good system for core-group? 54:47 For the workaround, how do we get the JVM property to ignore transaction recovery? See "3 Ways to Resolve CWRL0030W" in Related information for link referenced in this answer. 55:22 Closing remarks 58:42 End of Call
