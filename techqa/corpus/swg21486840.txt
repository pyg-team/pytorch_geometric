 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible to use a specific Collaboration & Deployment Services (CADS) feature that allows integration with Tivoli? 
In other words, if Tivoli (TWS Tivoli workload Scheduler) can invoke CADS processes or jobs, and also if CADS can invoke Tivoli jobs? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collaboration & Deployment Services (CADS) has the ability to execute jobs/job steps based on the actions of an outside program (in this case Tivoli). 
CADS will monitor a topic attached to a JMS (Java Message Server) queue. Once a specific message is received, CADS will launch the job/job step. 
A similar behavior is now available for CADS to triggers external jobs/tasks, review the Message-Based Schedule Settings within the User Guide
