PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational ClearQuest Web client does not load or displays "Your session has timed out" when you work with records. 

SYMPTOM
The ClearQuest version 8.0.0.x Web client on Windows 64-bits does not load. If it does load, you see error messages such as "Your session has timed out" with every action. 

This also happens after a clean installation of the product. 

CAUSE
ClearQuest Web does not recognize IBM HTTP Server (IHS) installation, if its installation path includes parentheses.


IHS uses C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\HTTPServer as the default installation directory. This path includes parentheses characters on Windows 64-bit. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify the installation directory that IHS uses.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Consider the following steps.




 1. Uninstall ClearQuest and IHS.
    
    
 2. Install IHS into a directory that has no parentheses in its path. Use an alternate location such C:\IBM\HTTPServer.
    
    
 3. Re-install ClearQuest.
