QUESTION
 How do I configure custom properties for the WebSphere Application Server V8.5 Liberty profile? 

ANSWER
There are many custom properties available for the WebSphere Application Server V8.5 Liberty profile. The elements, attributes and sub-elements that can be configured are listed on the product documentation page - Liberty profile: Configuration elements in the server.xml file [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/autodita/rwlp_metatype_core.html].
If you are working with IBM Support, or resolving an issue independently through the IBM Support Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support], you might also be asked to set a custom property.

WebSphere custom properties for the Liberty profile are set in the server.xml file of the application server.

Note: For the default server instance, the server.xml file is located in the following location:

<liberty install root>/usr/servers/defaultServer/server.xml 

 

For example: To configure the deferServletLoad web container custom property


 *   * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
   
   


Add the following line to the server.xmlconfiguration file: 

<webContainer deferServletLoad="false"/> 


Note: To configure a Java Virtual Machine custom property, set the property in the jvm.options file. This is described in section "Customize JVM options by using jvm.options files" in the following Knowledge Center article... 

Customizing the Liberty environment [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_admin_customvars.html?cp=SSEQTP_8.5.5&lang=en] 

The server management script searches for jvm.options in two locations: ${wlp.install.dir}/etc/jvm.options and ${server.config.dir}/jvm.options. If both files are present, the options in the ${server.config.dir}/jvm.options file are used.
