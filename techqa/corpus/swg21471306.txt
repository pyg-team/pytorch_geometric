PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We are encountering records that have a task associated with it but there is only a single record associated with it.


CAUSE
The reason you are seeing these "lingering tasks" is due to the dynamic nature of our tasks within our system. For example, Let’s assume that you have member A and member B from the same source and they have a Potential Duplicate (PD) task, where member A was the trigger member (the member that triggered the PD task to be created). Later, there is an update to member B where his data changes so much that the two records no longer score above the Clerical Review threshold. The task within the mpi_entxtsk_XX table does not get removed. This is because we only store the information for the trigger member in the task table and the trigger member was not updated (member A). This is why when you inspect the task you are only seeing one record (member A).

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the "lingering task" simply set the status to “resolved” and save.
