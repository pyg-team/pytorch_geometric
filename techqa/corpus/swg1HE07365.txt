ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   -The PART/DOCUMENT drop-down list is randomly disabled in the
   search panel of 3DCOM (see enclosed screenshot "Disabled
   crop-down list.tif")
   -This issue is the result of a corrupted
   PRODUCTEC175-DES-FUEL.EC175-FUEL01.06.1705.19.04.xml file in
   the 3DCOM cache (ie variable CATCDMA.VPM.XML.STORAGE)
   -If we delete this file, then a new xml file is generated and
   the drop-down list is enabled.
   -But this new xml file may be overwritten a few hours or day
   later, and the issue then appears again.
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   The PART/DOCUMENT drop-down list in the search panel
   shouldn't be disabled.
