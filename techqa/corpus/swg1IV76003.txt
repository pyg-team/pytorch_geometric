APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Information supplied to kd4agent from DataPower Data Collector
   identifies fault records. Service Inventory contains a count of
   fault records ( Services_Inventory_610.Fault_Count ) and the
   Fault Log contains individual fault records (
   Fault_Log_Table_610 ). It has been observed that there are
   missing individual fault records from the Fault Log, which is
   caused by the kd4agent removing them prior to historical
   collection. The records are removed to keep the in-memory count
   within the configured kd4.ira.maxMetricsRecords limit.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the Fault Log (Fault_Log_Table_610).
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When the number of records in memory
   * exceed the configured kd4.ira.maxMetricsRecords limit the
   * oldest records are removed. If these records are faults they
   * are also removed even if they have not been added to the
   * history. This is not ideal.
   *
   * Interim Fix 7 fixes this, by prioritizing faults contained in
   * memory that haven't yet been added to the history. Faults
   * that have been collected in the historical take sample may be
   * deleted. Faults that haven't been added to history may be
   * deleted if and only if all the records contained in memory
   * are faults that haven't been added to history.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply IFix 7 when available.
