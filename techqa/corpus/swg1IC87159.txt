APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you run a simple task on WLE 7.2 FP4, then wait for the
   timeout to hit it and then click "Done" button on the coach. You
   will see the instance failing (status failed) and you are not
   able to run the task via AE again, even though you can run this
   task again via Portal. The next task will not be generated due
   to failed instance.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Instance of the process fails when the coach hits the timeout.
   The change introduced in 7204 essentially did a string
   comparison on an error message ( "session expired..) and if the
   comparison returned true, then throw  the  "Task Closed"
   exception message. The session expired exception may have no
   bearing on Tasks, in such cases the code was unnecessarily
   disrupting the BPD run by throwing "Task is already closed"
   exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Exception handling is taken care to pass on appropriate
   messages.
