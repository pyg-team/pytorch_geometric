APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SRM Catalog search gets this error:
   
   BMXAA4210E - Database error number 1795 has occurred.
   ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000
   
   SystemErr.log shows:
   --------------------------(begin)-------------------------------
   [6/18/09 10:32:20:996 CDT] 00000060 SystemErr     R
   java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions
   in a list is 1000
   
   [6/18/09 10:32:21:002 CDT] 00000060 SystemErr     R  at
   oracle.jdbc.driver.DatabaseError.throwSqlException(DatabaseError
   .java:112)
   ---------------------------(end)--------------------------------
   
   Development looked into this and determined the error was
   because the ServiceCatalog search is hitting an Oracle
   limitation that our search should have coded a check.  For
   ServiceDesk the search just displays the first 500 objects or
   the value set in Maximo property GlobalSearch.maxCount.
   ServiceCatalog's search does not have the limitation check for
   this error message and needs to work the same way as the
   ServiceDesk search.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The work-around is simple.  When you get this error it means
   your search is too broad and would take too long.  So, add to
   your search string.  You can add using the + sign as this is
   the AND operator.  That is, if you did a search for "equipment
   + server" and get this error, then narrow the search with
   something like "equipment + server + error".

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will be delivered via TSRM 7.1.0.5.
