Title: IBM How an HTML report can be delivered to a mail recipient - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If an HTML report is scheduled to be delivered by email, then it can be attached as HTML, MHT or embedded to mail body. This technote is to explain when all three cases are expected. 

CAUSE
Unable to determine in which format an HTML report will be delivered: MHT, HTML or embedded as email body.

ANSWER
IBM Cognos delivers email with HTML report based of below rule:

1. HTML report embedded as email body.

Expected when:


- HTML report is scheduled to be sent by email
- Email body is blank
- "Include a link to the report" option is not selected 

-"Attach the report" option is selected

Other output formats as PDF or Excel can be attached as well, HTML will be embedded as email body.

2. MHT report attached to email.

Expected when:

- Something has been added to email body or "Include a link to the report" option is selected
- Report contains items which can not be bundled in HTML file like: images, gradients, charts etc. 

Modern Cognos 10.x style does contain such bundled items, thus by default all 10.x style reports will be delivered as a MHT file. The reason for this was that HTML format does not support built in resources,while MHT format allows you to bundle additional items. The HTML files can contain links to such items, but these items can not be bundled.

3. HTML report attached to email.

Expected when:

- Something has been added to email body or "Include a link to the report" option is selected
- Report does not contain any item to be bundled to HTML file like: images, gradients, charts etc. 

To obtain the HTML attachment rather than MHT, legacy Cognos 1.x or 8.x style must be used for report. 
If you want to configure Report Studio to use 1.x or 8.x style for existing report:
- Open a report in Report Studio
- Open menu: File > Report properties > Set 'Report styles' to 8.x or 1.x
- Save the report and schedule to be sent by email

If you want to set the previous 8.x report style as defeault style for new reports, set the 'Override 10.x styles with 8.x styles on new reports' option in Tools > Options > Advanced tab.
