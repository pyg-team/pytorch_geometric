APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a model, on adding a ??Usage?? dependency from class B to
   class A, and setting it to 'Implementation' usage, should add a
   #include 'A.h' to the implementation file for class B. It does,
   however, it also adds a forward declaration of class A to the
   specification file of class B. This should not happen and it
   causes problems.Only Want the Usage dependency to generate the
   #include in the implementation file,And not to create a forward
   declaration.Unchecking the property
   'CG:Configuration:GenerateForwardDeclarations',which overrides
   the CG:Dependency:UsageType does not help. Neither the WA of
   Creating a new stereotype (NoForwardDec) applicable to 'Class'
   and deselecting the 'GenerateForwardDeclarations' property.
   Further applying the stereotype to any class to stop the
   redundant forward declarations, also dont help.Because, Its the
   use/include of a class that is causing the forward
   declaration,not the class itself.Also, the scenario of using
   class B by implementation/#include in one place and in another
   place using the same class B by forward reference.So cannot turn
   off forward reference for class B.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When Usage is set to Implementation, a forward declaration
   is still generated in the specification file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The property GenerateForwardDeclarations now exists under
   CPP_CG::Dependency. You can set the value of this property
   to False, and the forward declaration will not be generated
   for the dependency.
