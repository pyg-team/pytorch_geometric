APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There is no maxmessage defined for the error
   oslc#stableresourcenotfound
   
   Steps to reproduce
   
   The error occurs when the stableid can't be found when querying
   through multiple pages of OSLC data.
   
   When the error occurs the logs print the message
   oslc#stableresourcenotfound instead of an associated maxmessage
   entry describing the cause of the issue.
   
   Open Database Configuration and select messages, then filter
   for stableresourcenotfound and no results will be returned as
   the Message Group and Key are not defined for the error.
