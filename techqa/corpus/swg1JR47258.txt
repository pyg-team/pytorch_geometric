ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Process Monitor tool available in the Process Admin console is
   a great tool to perform general monitoring of your process apps
   (BPD's and services) but it's also a great tool to identify and
   halt a process and/or service that ran into a loop in BPD
   and/or service engine.
   
   The only disadvatage sometimes is when the system is hung
   because of the loop and you can't get into the Process Admin
   console because everything is hung or very slow and it takes
   forever to get to Process Monitor because of high CPU etc but
   the JVM is still alive, it did not crash. it's just that CPU is
   spining cycles executing the loop.
   
   So, it would be great to -
   
   a) Have a tool that would dump the same data in a text format,
   it can be done through a wsadmin (for ex) command that would
   dump the same data into a file. This might work in those cases
   when the system is hang and you cannot get to Process Admin
   console.
   b) the second function in wsadmin would be to halt the
   service/process - same as you can do in Process Monitor but
   using the command this time, again for the purpose of hang/not
   able to login to process admin console.
