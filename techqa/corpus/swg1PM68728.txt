APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE CSQQCON2 EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT
   in the IMS MPRS which then cause any new scheduled transactions
   to fail with an MQRC of 2129.
   Our observation after applying the maintenance is that the
   issue is totally resolved if IMS/MQ programs have been relinked
   using the new version of CSQQSTUB.
   The use of the base V701 CSQQSTUB together with UK63858
   (PM26058 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM26058]) will cause CSQQCON2 to be loaded repeatedly with
   no deletes, even if explicit MQDISCs are issued by the
   application.
   .
   
   Coding an explicit MQDISC in the application does not make a
   difference.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Relink IMS/WMQ programs using the new version of
   CSQQSTUB.
   Recycle the IMS MPRS frequently to avoid the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: IMS applications compiled with a        *
   *                      version of CSQQSTUB at base V701 level  *
   *                      may receive CSV002I indicating that     *
   *                      requests for module CSQQCON2 exceed     *
   *                      maximum use count.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Any IMS applications which were compiled with the base V701
   level of CSQQSTUB will not delete their copy of CSQQCON2 when
   the application does an MQDISC. If the application continues to
   do MQCONN then CSQQCON2 will have been loaded more than the
   allowed maximum and message CSV002I will be issued.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to check which version of the stub has
   been used (base V701 level or otherwise) so that the correct
   action can be taken on whether to delete CSQQCON2 when an MQDISC
   is done.
