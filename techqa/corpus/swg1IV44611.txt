APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description: When the ISAMESSO adapter service is setup to
   point at a
   load balancer or IHS server URL that is in front of a cluster
   of IMS
   servers, then requests from the adapter fail or don't have
   expected
   results.  The problem is with jsessionid cookie information not
   being
   maintained in the adapter requests.  When the add requests
   fails, it
   shows misleading response message of following, which is not
   the reason
   of failure.
   
   "ERROR User ID already registred to the server"
   
   The IMS/WAS server logs will show following corresponding root
   cause of
   the failure.
   
   6/12/13 15:03:34:426 CDT] 00000033 ProvisioningS I   SOAP
   service
   failed: Caught exception while getting registration status for
   IMS user
   '<domain name>\<username>'
   encentuate.ims.result.ImsException: Session does not exist in
   IMS.
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate: Install/setup a 2-node IMS cluster with IHS
   server
   in front of the 2 nodes.  Then with the ISAMESSO adapter
   service, set
   the "ISAM ESSO Server DNS name or IP" and "ISAM ESSO Server
   Port"
   values on service form to point at the IHS server and not
   directly at
   one of the IMS servers.  Then submit add request and this will
   fail, or
   run reconcile, which will succeed, but return no accounts to
   TIM server
   
   Desired Behavior: The ISAMESSO adapter should function
   correctly when
   pointing at IHS or load balancer hostname/IP and port that is
   in front
   of a cluster of IMS servers.
   
   Environment: ISAMESSO 5.1.11 adapter, IMS/ESSO 8.2, TIM 5.x/6.x
   
   Work around:  Configure the service form information of the
   ISAMESSO
   service in TIM to point directly at one of the IMS servers
   itself.
