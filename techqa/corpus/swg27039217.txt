COLLECT DATA INFORMATION
Instructions for using "getsadata" to collect diagnostic data within all TSAMP environments. Data collection strategy for all TSAMP environments. Includes details specific to "trace spooling". TRACING AND LOGGING
How do I setup syslog on AIX in such a way as to capture all relevant messages and errors from TSAMP and RSCT sub-systems, and the DB2 automation scripts ? How can I setup trace spooling for my RSCT and TSAMP Daemons so I can keep more historical information of the clusters trace, trace_pub and trace_summary logs? To prevent loss of trace data due to wrapping of standard trace files, use the configuration below to save round-robin trace files for IBM.RecoveryRM and IBM.GblResRM in a separate directory. Trace Spooling can require a significant amount of storage. Is there a way to take advantage of the multiple round-robin trace files without the actual spooling of trace files to another storage location ? COMMON PROBLEMS (GENERAL)
The "lssam" command is hanging. How can I troubleshoot and resolve this type of problem ? To force the Master IBM.RecoveryRM (RecRM) daemon hosted by one node to move to another node, the following information is available. Domain does not come online on both nodes when viewed from the perspective of each individual node. "lsrpnode" from each node shows itself online and the other node as offline. Issuing lsrpnode command shows that the local node is online but the remote node is offline while the other server shows the reverse. Whichever node the command is issued on shows online, while the other node is always shown as offline. The clustered nodes exist in different subnets. COMMON PROBLEMS INVOLVING REBOOTS
Within a Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (TSAMP) solution, what would trigger a reboot of the server by the cluster software (RSCT) ? One of the nodes of a two node cluster is rebooting intermittently When the primary server in my 2 node cluster goes down, the network adapter on the standby server starts being reported as malfunctioning or offline as well. This often prevents a failover or causes unexpected outages on the standby server. COMMON PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO DB2 ENVIRONMENTS
After some maintenance activities on the standby server, the TSAMP managed DB2 instance cannot be restarted. It stays "Offline" and its overall group shows "Failed offline" HADR Resource Group not coming online on available node even though the resource group is unlocked and Nominal=Online db2haicu fails to create resource group and db2diag.log shows the error: 2661-011 The command specified for attribute MonitorCommand is NULL, not a absolute path, does not exist or has insufficient permissions to be run. db2haicu was used to build a HADR automation policy without error but the DB2 instance resources on each node both show Pending online permanently. The underlying DB2 engines are running and the HADR database is currently peer connected. Performed a controlled HADR takeover which was successful from the perspective of db2pd, but TSAMP's 'lssam' command shows the HADR group locked and Pending online. The ServiceIP remains offline on both nodes and there is a control flag set to SuspendedPropagated. A network outage affected the public NIC on the primary HADR server but there was no automated failover. The only change in the 'lssam' output was the NIC (on the primary server) within the db2_public_network_0 equivalency changing to Offline.
