ERROR DESCRIPTION

   feature.These include:

   no Bus concept in Websphere Application Server Liberty Profile.
   2) Rectify the jmsMajorVersion and jmsMinorVersion in
   JMS-Connection metadata.
   3) Print high-message threshold in logs when queue's max depth
   have been reached.
   4) User-name must be printed in logs when there is an
   authentication failure.
   5) Remov duplicate CWSID0122I messages in logs when messaging
   engine id is not provided in the server configuration file.
   6) Rename "WebSphere Embedded Queue Connection Factory" to
   "Embedded Messaging" and in the same way for Topic Connection
   factory and Connection Factory
   7) Prevent destination UUID's from being printed in the logs
   when a destination is deleted.
   8) Fix NullPointerException when wasJmsServer-1.0 feature is
   removed.
   9) Remove irrelevant messages like CWSIP0181W and CWSIU0006I
   from appearing in logs when a RECEIVE operation is being
   performed in queue.
