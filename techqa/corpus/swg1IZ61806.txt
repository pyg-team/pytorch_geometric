APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem is actually the "keyboard layout". The language is
   fine as
   seen in the OSD GUI screenshot.
   The problem is that deployment through OSD unwarrantly causes
   other
   keyboard layouts to be added and the default layout to be
   changed to
   Canadien Multilingual.
   
   The same image, not deployed with OSD, doesn't have this
   behavior.
   I haven't found anything in the OSD Gui to configure keyboard
   layouts.
   
   So basically, i wanted to know how and why OSD does this?
   Is it linked to the language setting in the OSD Gui? If so, was
   that by
   design?
   Or is there another way to explicitly configure the keyboard
   layouts
   independently from the Language setting?
   <snip>
   
   L3,
   
   See above customer response.
   
   1) How are other keyboard layouts added?
   
   2) How is the default keyboard layout set?
   
   Action Planned: Await L3 update.
   ################################################################
   in order to meet the customer requirement
   we have changed the behaviour as follow:
   if the regional setings are manually put in the custom
   "unattend.txt"
   file,
   then system profile webui Language setting will not be used,
   for example if these lines are added to the custom "unatted.txt"
   file:
   **************************
   &#65528;Regional Settings&#65410;
   SystemLocale=0c0c
   UserLocale=0c0c
   InputLocale=0c0c:00001009
   **************************
   then the webui Language setting is ignored.
   I have tested and deployed the above settings and the OS got the
   keyboar
   d layout Canadian French and the language French(Canada)
   The TPMFOSD7.1.0.0 build is "build-081.15", more details follow
   in the
   email.
   We added this behavour to align the product to the Microsoft
   instructions about its unattend.txt file:
   "Language - This setting specifies the language that is
   installed. If
   this setting is specified, the SystemLocale, InputLocale,
   UserLocale,
   and MUILanguage settings are ignored."
   Note, if Language is entered in TPMfOSD custom unatted.txt file
   then the
   webui Language setting is ignored.
   Could you please open an APAR and check that the fix is working?
