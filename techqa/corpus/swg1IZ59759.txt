ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer tried to start multiple MQ Monitoring agents on i5/OS
   at the same time as auto start jobs of QMQM subsystem. From time
   to time some agents get a CPF1049 and hang.

   V7.0.0 Fixpack 2.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On i5/OS, if customer configures the jobs for starting multiple
   mq agent instances as auto start job entries as QMQM subsystem.
   From time to time, mq agent hang and gets CFP1049 error after
   IPL or during start of QMQM subsystem.

   be failure to start when other messages. Code change is made in
   KFP100 program to add delay time to retry to start kmqlib
   subsystems if one mq agent encounters the CPF1049. It may take
   several seconds until all mq agents instance can be started up.
