PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After successful login to TRIRIGA, Oracle reports invalid username/password messages to the server.log

The TRIRIGA application authenticates the user and lets them in, but while using the application they will get a MID error on-screen that correlates to an Oracle message in the logs that indicates the Account is locked (ORA-28000). 

This can be tracked back to another Oracle message related to invalid username/password (ORA-01017)


SYMPTOM
server.log contains error: 


Caused by: org.springframework.jdbc.CannotGetJdbcConnectionException: Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied DSRA0010E: SQL State = 72000, Error Code = 1,017


Followed later by:


Caused by: org.springframework.jdbc.CannotGetJdbcConnectionException: Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: ORA-28000: the account is locked DSRA0010E: SQL State = 99999, Error Code = 28,000



CAUSE
The repeated invalid username/password messages caused Oracle to lock the account

This is due to a bug in Oracle. See: Oracle server side jdbc thin driver throws ORA-01017 [https://community.oracle.com/thread/2188514]
