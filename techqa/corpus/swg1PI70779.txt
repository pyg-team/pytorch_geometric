APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Explorer for z/OS - zExpl v3.0
   
   When you open a COBOL program that references a large dataset
   (for example, 30k members) in the SYSLIB associated with the
   edited COBOL member, then refreshing the progam will lead to a
   long wait.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using IDz, when a user opens a COBOL member associated with a
   large SYSLIB (containing a dataset of 30k+ members), the time it
   takes to resolve all copybooks is significantly longer than it
   was in previous RDz releases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolving copybooks was taking much longer than it used to
   because large datasets in the SYSLIB were being refreshed.  The
   refreshes were introduced as part of the fix for a copybook
   lookup issue to ensure the latest host data but it turns out
   they are not needed to retrieve the latest copybooks.
   
   The fix can be obtained in z/OS Explorer v3.0.1.2 located here:
