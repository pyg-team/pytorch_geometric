   The abend occurs while comparing the SSLPEER value for the
   channel against the DN attributes in the certificate due to an
   attempt to access storage beyond the end of the SSLPEER string.

   *                      or starting on the failed dispatcher.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During startup for a channel using SSL/TLS, the Distinguished
   Name in the peer certificate is compared against the values
   specified in the SSLPEER attribute of the channel definition.
   During this comparison it is possible for storage beyond the
   end of the SSLPEER string to be accessed, and if this storage is
   unavailable, the reported abend 0C4 can occur.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  rsxCompareSSLPeerStrings is updated to check the remaining
   length of the SSLPEER value to avoid the invalid access to
   storage beyond its end, and prevent the abend occurring.
