APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Incremental backup of VM may fail with an ANS9921E error when
   the VM disks are on NFS datastores. This occurs as the total
   disk size is incorrectly set during incr backup when disk is on
   NFS datastore. This problem only affects disk verification, all
   data is backed up correctly.  Full backup is not affected, the
   observed behavior is that the initial incremental performed
   after the full backup is successful, but subsequent incrementals
   fail with ANS9921E.
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:  Trace with SERVICE VM flags will show
   a valid diskSizeonDisk value for full and initial incremental
   backup, and will show 0 for the diskSizeonDisk on the second
   incremental.
   FULL and INCR show
   04/22/2016 13:02:21.606 [006276] [876] :
   ..\..\common\vm\vmbackvddk.cpp(11172):
   Disk Objinfo: diskObjInfoVersion:  4
                 diskCapacityInBytes: 64424509952
                 diskSizeOnDisk:      64424509952
                 diskIncrementalSize: 0
                 diskStatus:          0
                 diskLabel:           Hard Disk 2
   Second IFINCR
   04/22/2016 13:16:52.057 [006052] [4648] :
   ..\..\common\vm\vmbackvddk.cpp(11172):
   Disk Objinfo: diskObjInfoVersion:  4
                 diskCapacityInBytes: 64424509952
                 diskSizeOnDisk:      0
                 diskIncrementalSize: 0
                 diskStatus:          0
                 diskLabel:           Hard Disk 2
   So we are unable to determine the size on disk, as occurred
   before, on the second IFICNR.
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   TSM client 6.3.2.3, 6.3.2.4, 6.4.3, 7.1.2
   
   MDVPARTL 7.1.2
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Performing a full VM backup will resolve the error, however, it
   can reoccur.  Alternatively, setting VMVERIFYIFLATEST NO should
   allow the backup to continue as the disk size check is bypassed.
   Note that utilizing this option can introduce exposure to
   unrecoverable backups.

   * 7.1.6                                                        *
   * Note 1: The Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) Client is a         *
   * prerequisite to using the Data Protection for VMware. In     *
   * Data Protection for VMware environments, the TSM Client is   *
   * also known as the data mover.                                *
   * Note 2: This is subject to change at the discretion of IBM.  *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Size is now correctly set for disks on NFS datastore.
