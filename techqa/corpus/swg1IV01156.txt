   ABSTRACT:             NULL EXCEPTION THROWN TO TBSM WHEN NO
   AGENTS ARE
   ONLINE
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When no agents are online the ITM Web Service throws a NULL
   EXCEPTION.
   This indicates a problem, but not what the problem is.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   Have all agents off a particular type.  For example, have all
   Windows
   agents offline.
   
   Issue a TBSM data fetcher request for Windows agent data.
   
   In the SystemOut.log there should be an exception from the ITM
   Web
   Service saying no agents are online.
   
   LOCAL FIX:
   None.
