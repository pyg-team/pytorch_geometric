ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Quintus Number: 225756
   
   We are using Rhapsody 7.5 on Windows XP.
   I have followed the flow in the QQ300 May 2009 1. Student
   Workbook on
   my
   harmony project.
   I have created the activity diagram for my use case (in
   DeconflictApproach
   LegBlackBoxView). ?When I try to create an Actor Pin from the SE
   Toolkit,
   I receive the following error:
   ---------------------------
   CreatePortsAndInterfaces
   ---------------------------
   Run-time error '-2147221494 (8004000a)':
   Method '~' of object '~' failed
   ---------------------------
   OK
   ---------------------------
   
   
   I can't reproduce the error on the unsanitized model.  However,
   in
   resolving another issue, I think a couple of things may be
   contributing.
   Firstly, I believe I was running the Rhapsody Developer for C++.
   Secondly, I was performing an action in the process (see paths
   below)
   that
   also may have interfered with the execution of the script.
   On the subject model, I performed the following
   1) I open the model in Rhapsody Developer for Systems Engineers,
   2)  perform Project ?right-click?-? Change to-? SysML.
   3)  Project?right-click?-? SE Toolkit-? Convert to Harmony
   Project
   4)  Use Case ?right-click?-? Create System Model From Use Case
   5)  Navigate to my Use Case-?activity diagram
   6)  action ?right-mouse click?-? Add actor pin
   7)  receive the following error message
   ---------------------------
   CreatePortsAndInterfaces
   ---------------------------
   Run-time error '380':
   Invalid property value
   ---------------------------
   OK
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is a file called LinkWizardUserStereotypes.ini
   in the
   Rhapsody install directory.  Remove it and try performing the
   operation again.
