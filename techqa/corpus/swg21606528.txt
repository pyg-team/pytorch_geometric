Title: IBM Non-administrative users cannot launch Sales Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Non-administrative users cannot launch sales center after local administrative user has completed the Sales Center installation. 

SYMPTOM
When local administrative user follows the steps below, Sales Center hangs on the splash screen without any error messages or notification: 

1. Installs the WebSphere Commerce V7.0 Sales Center client on Windows XP or Windows 7. 

2. Log on as a non-administrative user. 

3. Launch Sales Center.

CAUSE
Windows XP or Windows 7 multi-user permission to write/execute files.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
By looking at the trace-log-X (number of logs).xml files, we can see the following errors:

Caused by: org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: CWPIH0029E: The attempt to perform a file copy specified by the feature com.ibm.esupport.client.product.SSC4TNF.feature install handler failed. The requested operation was file.copy.2=C:\IBM\WebSphere\SalesCenter70\rcp/startcollector.bat C:\IBM\WebSphere\SalesCenter70\rcp/eclipse/plugins/com.ibm.esupport.client.product.SSC4TNF_4.0.0.20090318-1704/payload/startcollector.bat.
....
Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\IBM\WebSphere\SalesCenter70\rcp\startcollector.bat (Access is denied.)

The local user does not have necessary permissions on the working directory.

Local users must have "execute" privilege to run the C:\IBM\WebSphere\SalesCenter70\rcp\startCollector.bat. in this case.

The error log shows that the user ( non-administrator ) has insufficient access to the file. So we need to ensure that the user who is launching Sales Center has sufficient access to the working directory. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these steps to fix the problem (Solution A or Solution B):

Solution A
1. Uninstall Sales Center.
2. Remove workspace folder (C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Lotus\XPD).
3. Remove the Sales Center install directory as well.
4. Follow the Information Center URL to re-install the sales center by using local admin user: Installing the Sales Center client using Lotus Expeditor Client Management [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wchelp/v7r0m0/topic/com.ibm.commerce.telesales.admin.doc/tasks/ttr_xcminstall.htm]. 

5. Launch the sales center with a non-admin local user.



If Solution A does not work, then try Solution B below: 


Solution B
1. Open C:/Documents and Settings/<user-logon id>/Application Data/Lotus/XPD/.configrcpinstall.properties.
2. Modify the property install.configuration from user to multiuser. For example: install.configuration=multiuser.
3. Clear the workspace generated during installation (C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Lotus\XPD).
4. Launch sales center with non-admin local user.
