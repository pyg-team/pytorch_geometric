APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When installing ODM 8.6 using IM console mode, the installation
   fails with errors such as:
   CRIMA1217E  ERROR  A problem occurred during the execution of
   the /u01/iim/var/adapters/ant/Operational Decision Manager V8.
   6/com.ibm.websphere.odm.rules.ilmt_8.6.0.20140507_2330/update_
   ilmt_ear.xml file.
   ERROR: The following error occurred while executing this line:
   /u01/iim/var/adapters/ant/Operational Decision Manager V8.6/com.
   ibm.websphere.odm.rules.ilmt_8.6.0.20140507_2330/update_ilmt_
   ear.xml:209: The following error occurred while executing this
   line:...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The recommended approach is to first install the product using
   the Installation Manager graphical user interface and record a
   response file (with the -record option) that can then be used
   for command line installations. See: https://www-01.ibm. [https://www-01.ibm.]
   com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.7.0/com.ibm.
   silentinstall12.doc/topics/t_silent_create_response_files_IM.
   html?lang=en
   Another option is to follow instructions in "Installing on
   multiple workstations" where the response files are  edited
   manually:

   ibm.odm.distrib.install/topics/con_inst_silent_mode.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.6.0/com.ibm.odm.distrib.install/topics/con_inst_silent_mode.html]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The custom panel do not work properly in console mode and
   values are not requested during installation
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  When using imcl command line to install use
   -properties user.wodm_was_home=/path/to/AppServer855,user.w
   odm_admin_username=websphere,user.wodm_admin_password=websphere,
   user.confirm_password=websphere,user.lic.dc=full
   The important properties for the licensing are:
   for DC:
   user.lic.dc   can take full or express according to the license
   the customer has bought.
   For Decision Server :
   user.lic.dsr  =  full|rules|express    : full for Decision
   Server licence  , rules for Decision Server for Rules license
   , express for a Decision Server Express license
   user.prod.dsr =  true|false    :  true if the customer has
   production license , false otherwise.
