LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of WebSphere Application Server
   Version 7 for whom either the Windows reg.exe command is
   restricted (anyone who must comply with Federal Desktop Core
   Computing policy) or unavailable (users of Windows 2000
   Professional).
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   As part of the application server startup on Windows, the
   WebSphere MQ Resource Adapter (shipped as part of WebSphere
   Application Server Version 7) runs the reg.exe command to find
   out which version of WebSphere MQ is installed. An IOException
   was thrown when this check was made by users for whom the
   reg.exe command was restricted or unavailable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The check performed by reg.exe is purely informational, so it
   is not necessary to throw an exception if this cannot be done.
   
   The IOException is no longer thrown.
