Title: IBM Monitor JAVA heap memory for TNPM -Wireless - United States

Text:
Performance; GCMV tool TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 System is working slowly or performance of system is a quite bad, after running a TNPM- Wireless commands or Tools. E.g. Loader/SBH/Report/Summary.

Sometimes due to heavy load on AS Server or amount of process too high in that case, Server cannot run smoothly, it’s impacting on the performance of the system. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In such kind of scenario we must have to run the memory monitor tool. 

To check the heap size of the memory. It‘ll helps to check the ratio of consumption through the graph.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For TNPM-Wireless memory monitor, we suggest you to use the Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer tool. 


Please check below steps to install the Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer tool.


Before going forward towards GCMV you must have to install IBM Support Assistant Workbench platform. 


Click on below link to download the IBM Support Assistant Workbench platform from the web.

IBM Support Assistant Workbench 

To install GCMV in the IBM Support Assistant Workbench follow the steps in the technote How to Install and Run Tools through the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013279]. Whilst following the instructions in the technote please note that in the Tools Add-ons dialog GCMV is listed under the 'JVM-based Tools' folder as 'IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools - Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer for ISAv4'

Once you install the IBM Support Assistant Workbench into the linux zone, Please check below steps to open on your Linux machine.

Before opening GCMV tool you have to add the -Xhealthcenter -verbose:gc -Xverbosegclog:/tmp/my.vgc.log command on the jvm-default.ini file from location /appl/virtuo/conf/as/

Restart the AS server, after restart you can see the my.vgc.log file into the /tmp directory.

Steps to open the GCMV.

1. Open the linux zone using VNC.
2. Go to /opt/ibm/IBMSupportAssistant_41/rcp
3. Run rcplauncher script.
4. Select below highlighted option from below snippet.
5. Install the GCMV tool from the update option.
<Refer Img1>
6. It will take sometimes to update the plugins and loading the tool.
7. Once you install successfully, click in Analyze problem
<Refer Img2>
8. Select the GCMV tool from the list.
<Refer Img3>
9. Load the GC logs on below location, and click on the Next.
<Refer Img4>
10. Once you put the GC logs you will able to see the below screen to check the heap size of the machine.
<Refer Img5>
In the blue lines you can see the used heap size (After collection), It’s show that how much memory consuming after processing the TNPM tool, According to this we have to check memory and check if need to increase the memory.
