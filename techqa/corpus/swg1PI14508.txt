ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 21 or release 22 as 32
   bit application on Windows 7 64 bit computers.
   E.g. you installed
   SPSS_Statistics_21_win32_.exe on C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\21
   SPSS_Statistics_22_win32_.exe on C:\Program Files
   (x86)\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\22
   
   However, you noticed that this installation created a folder
   directly on C:\ which should not be allowed:
   The folder is C:\SYSWOW64 and contains a file
   WindowsAccessbridge-32.dll.
   
   Instead Statistics 21 or 22 32 bit installtion should use the
   file WindowsAccessBridge-32.dll which is already there on
   Windows 7 64 bit computers in folder C:\Windows\SYSWOW64.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development to confirm if the
   folder C:\SYSWOW64 can be deleted without affecting
   functionality of Statistics 32 bit installations on 64 bit
   perating system.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a future release. As a
   workaround you can delete the folder C:\SYSWOW64 and its file
   manually unless you do not use JAWS enablement. Another option
   is to install Statistics 21 and 22 as 64 bit application on the
   64 bit operating system.
