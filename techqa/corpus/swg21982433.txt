SUMMARY
 Several security vulnerabilities have been found in glibc module of IBM Security Proventia Network Enterprise Scanner. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2014-9761 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9761]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the nan function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111085] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-8778 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8778]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bound memory access and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111086 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111086] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-8779 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8779]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the catopen function. By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111087 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111087] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the gethostbyname_r() and other related functions. By sending a specially-crafted argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system elevated privileges or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500] for the current score

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVEID: CVE-2015-5229 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5229]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the return of memory areas containing non-zero bytes by the calloc implementation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash or hang.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110711 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110711] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-8776 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8776]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service. By passing out-of-range time values to the strftime function, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault or obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110675] for the current score
