QUESTION
 This technote provides details on the error message SQLPG_LOGR_RECREATE_LOGFILE "Loggw cannot find log file, need loggr to recreate it", which might appear in DB2Â® for Linux, Unix and Windows Version 9.7 db2diag.log file. 

CAUSE
This is message can be seen when a log file is renamed or removed and DB2 tries to use it later, but the file is no longer there. It is possible a script or user removed DB2 logs located in the active directory.

ANSWER
 

You may notice a similar message logged in the db2diag.log:

INSTANCE: db2inst1 NODE : 000
EDUID : 3857 EDUNAME: db2loggw (SAMPLE) 0
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, data protection services, sqlpgasn2, probe:2950
RETCODE : ZRC=0x871000E8=-2028994328=SQLPG_LOGR_RECREATE_LOGFILE
"Loggw cannot find log file, need loggr to recreate it"

This message is generated when the DB2 instance attempts to write log records to a pre-allocated log file, but it finds that the log file does not exist. This should not happen under normal conditions, but DB2 will allocate the file again and continue processing. The database server could not determine when the log file was removed, just the point in time the DB2 instance tried to use the log file and found it missing. 
This error indicates that some DB2 logs were removed from the active directory after they were allocated. Ensure no scripts or user interaction is moving DB2 logs from active directory.
