   Steps taken. Note that order of step (1) and (2) is not
   important. :-
   
   1) Install PATROL Agent
    a) Unpacked the PATROL_for_Servers-Windows_4100.tar. It will
   create psx_cd_ALL_4100.zip and psx_cd_ALL_4100.tar (both contain
   identical data).
   
    b) For Windows, easily extract psx_cd_ALL_4100.zip which will
   create bmc_products\ directory with product data.
   
    c) Extract ins_WINDOWS_7555.zip on the same directory as step
   2) which will overwrite bmc_products\ with installer data.
   
    d) Run bmc_products\setup.exe to start the installation.
   
    e) On "Select System Roles" page, check "Managed System" check
   box.
   
    f) On "Select Products and Components to Install" page, check
   "PATROL Agent for Microsoft Windows".
   
    g) On "Provide the PATROL Default Account Properties" page, put
   user Windows login Name and Password.
   
    h) On other page, just left default entries. Next until Finish
   
   2) Install BMC Patrol probe
   
   3) echo %PATH% and make sure below entry have been added. It was
   added during Patrol Agent installation. It is the path to all
   require DLL location.
   
   C:\Program Files (x86)\BMC Software\Patrol3\bin>echo %PATH%
   C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windo
   ws\idmu\common;C

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for BMC Patrol on Windows
   operating systems.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When trying to run the probe on a Windows operating system, the
   user is presented with an error message regarding missing DLL
   files. The current probe reference guide does not specify that a
   BMC Patrol Agent must be installed on  the same host where the
   probe is installed. Installing an agent on the same host
   provides the runtime library dependencies required for the probe
   to run successfully.
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   The product documentation will be updated and released at the
   end of the current release cycle.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new section, Windows Installation Prerequisites, will be
   added to the installation sections of the probe reference guide.
   This section will describe the installation of a BMC Patrol
   Agent instance and subsequent changes to the %PATH% environment
   variable.
   
   Related changes will see the existing installation section of
   the guide replaced by new, updated installation sections and
   the existing Definition Files section replaced by a
   Configuration section. The Summary section will be updated with
   the requirement to install the BMC Patrol Agent.
   
   The Windows Installation Prerequisites section will contain the
   following text:
   
   To run the probe on a Windows operating system, you must first
   install an instance of the BMC Patrol Agent on the same host
   where the Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for BMC Patrol is to be
   installed. This is required even if you have agents installed on
   other hosts. Installing an agent on the same host as the probe
   provides the runtime library dependencies required for the probe
   to run successfully.
   
   You can obtain the BMC Patrol Agent installation files from BMC
   Software, Inc.
   
   After you have installed the BMC Patrol Agent, verify that the
   %PATH% environment variable contains <PATROL_HOME>\bin, where
   <PATROL_HOME> is the location of the BMC Patrol Agent
   installation. The default location for the agent installation is
   C:\Program Files\BMC Software\Patrol3\.
   
   To verify the %PATH% environment variable, enter the following
   command at the command prompt: echo %path%
   
   After you have installed the BMC Patrol Agent and verified the
   %PATH% environment variable, you can proceed to install the
   Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for BMC Patrol.
