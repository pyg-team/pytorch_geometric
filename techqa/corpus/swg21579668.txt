Title: IBM Error - The method cannot be called because application server security is enabled - United States

Text:
SYNCNODE; LDAP; The method cannot be called because application server security is enabled TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Application server security, ie. LDAP, has just been enabled using Microsoft Active Directory. Now when trying to login to Maximo, the following error occurs:

"The method cannot be called because application server security is enabled".



CAUSE
In a network deployment topology, if security is not enabled during profile creation and you decide later to enable it, you must run the syncNode command on each federated node to synchronise the nodes in the administrative console. If security was enabled during profile creation, these steps are unnecessary. 

ANSWER
Run the syncnode command from the command line.


Here are the steps: 

1) Stop the Node Agent service. 

2) Open a command prompt and change directory to "WAS_HOME/profiles/profileName/bin/" 

3) Run syncNode.bat <dmgrHost> <dmgrSOAPport> -username <username> -password <password> 

*note* username and password above will be your Websphere login. 

4) Start the Node Agent 

5) Start MXServer in the Websphere console 

NB: You can get the correct hostname and port for the above command from this file: 

<profile_home>/properties/wsadmin.properties 

Example of the syncnode command:
C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\ctgAppSrv01\bin> 
syncNode max8ora.myldapsrv.ibm.com 8879 -username wasadmin -password Maximo09 

You should now see the login dialog box asking for username and Password. Enter your credentials and you will now be able to login.
