ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ v7.0 supports Microsoft Windows Server 2008 queue
   managers in an MSCS configuration. However, the manuals do not
   document the steps required to configure an MSCS queue manager
   resource using the new user interface 'Failover Cluster
   Management' provided on Windows Server 2008.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Any users of WebSphere MQ in an MSCS HA environment on Windows
   Server 2008.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The problem was that the manuals did not contain any additional
   information with respect to the configuration of queue manager
   resources under MSCS on Windows Server 2008.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The manuals should be updated under the following URL:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ib
   m.mq.amqzag.doc/fa14240_.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqzag.doc/fa14240_.htm]
   
   Sys Admin guide->Configuring WebSphere MQ->Supporting the
   Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS)->
   Creating a queue manager for use with MSCS->Putting a queue
   manager under MSCS control:
   
   Under there is a section on Putting a queue manager under MSCS
   control:
   
   This needs to be modified into two sections:
   
   Section 1: Non windows Server 2008
   The existing instructions can be placed here.
   
   Section 2: Windows Server 2008
   New steps as follows:
   
   1.
   Log in to the cluster node computer hosting the queue manager,
   or log in to a remote workstation as a user with cluster
   administration permissions, and connect to the cluster node
   hosting the queue manager.
   
   2.
   Start the Failover Cluster Management tool.
   
   3.
   Open a connection to the cluster as follows:
   Right-click Failover Cluster Management->Manage a Cluster...
   
   4.
   In contrast to the group scheme used in the MSCS Cluster
   Administrator on previous versions of Windows, the Failover
   Cluster Management tool uses the concept of services and
   applications. A configured service/application contains all the
   resources necessary for one application to be clustered. In
   order to configure a queue manager under MSCS:
   Right-click Services and Applications->Configure a Service or
   Application...
   
   5.
   Proceed through the wizard creation steps. Select 'Other
   Server' on the 'Select Service or Application' panel.
   
   6.
   Select an appropriate IP address as a client Access Point.
   Please see Section 1 for additional information regarding IP
   resource instance configuration.
   
   7. Assign a storage device for exclusive use by the queue
   manager. This device should have been previously created as a
   resource instance. Please see Section 1 for additional
   information regarding storage device resource instance
   configuration.
   
   8. Tick the IBM MQSeries MSCS resource on the 'Select Resource
   Types' panel. Complete the remaining steps in the wizard.
   
   9. Before bringing the resource online, the IBM MQSeries MSCS
   resource needs additional configuration. Select the newly
   defined service which should contain a resource called
   'New IBM MQSeries MSCS'.
   
   10. Right-click->properties on the MQ resource. Modify the name
   of the resource if required. Proceed through each of the
   properties tabs to configure the resource. Steps 7-9 in Section
   1 can be used to configure the resource.
   
   As an additional note, there is a current section regarding
   Parameters specific to creating a resource. LooksAlive/IsAlive
   is mentioned here however the default times are incorrect. The
   isAlive poll interval default is 30000ms as opposed to 3000ms.
   Furthermore, this default has increased to 60000ms on windows
   Server 2008 systems.
