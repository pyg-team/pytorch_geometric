 This document discusses current information related to the end of support of the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v7.0 and v8.0 products on the IBM i OS. 

CONTENT
After April 30th, 2018, the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v7.0 and v8.0 products will no longer be fully supported by IBM on the IBM i OS. Please refer to the following document for detailed support information for the WAS v7.0 and v8.0 products on the IBM i OS.
Official Support Statement for the IBM WebSphere Application Server Product on the IBM i OS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020185] 

IBM recommends clients migrate to IBM WAS v8.5.5 or v9.0 and use IBM JDK 8.0 64 bit (57xxJV1 Option 17). For WAS v8.5.5, fix pack 8.5.5.9 or later is required to support JDK 8.0. You will need to make sure you have 8.5.5.9 or later installed in order to switch your WAS profiles to use JDK 8.0. If you are currently on an older fix pack level, you might have to switch your profiles to use JDK 7.0 first until you upgrade your WAS fix pack version. 

 More information on IBM JDK 7.0, 8.0 and migration to WAS v8.5.5 or v9.0 can be found here in the following IBM Technical documents.
