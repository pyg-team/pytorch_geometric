Title: IBM Why am I getting 'license renewal date passed' message? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When launching SPSS I am getting 'Your license renewal date has passed. SPSS will stop working if a new license is not installed soon. If you don't want to see this message again, run expoff.bat in the SPSS directory' even after having used the authorization code that should 'renew' the license expiration date. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The most likely explanation for this message is that the expiration date has passed and a new license has not yet been entered. Verify with your local administration if the 'renewal' of the license agreement has been completed. If you received new license/authorization codes and this message still pops up, the behavior may be due to the license file (lservrc) not being properly updated during the licensing process. To address this cause, delete the license file (lservrc) located in the product installation directory and run the License Authorization Wizard using the updated license authorization code. 

On Windows operating systems, the license file (lservrc) is located in a different product directory based upon:

(a) The bit-version of the operating system (32-bit/64-bit).
(b) The bit-version of the product (32-bit/64-bit).
(c) The product name.
(d) The product version. 

In the following directory descriptions

(i) Replace <PROD> with the product name (examples: Amos, Statistics, Modeler).
(ii) replace <VER> with the two-digit version number of the product (example: 24).

\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\<PROD>\<VER>\ 

\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SPSS\<PROD>\<VER>\ 


On Mac operating systems, the license file (lservrc) is located in a different product directory based upon:


(a) The product name.
(b) The product version. 

In the following directory descriptions

(i) Replace <PROD> with the product name (examples: Statistics, Modeler).
(ii) replace <VER> with the two-digit version number of the product (example: 24). 


/Applications/IBM/SPSS/<PROD>/<VER>/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents/bin/
