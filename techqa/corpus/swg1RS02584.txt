APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This problem affects ODM 8.7.1.2 Rule Designer, Decision
   Service project and Cobol XOM.
   When
   - creating decision service project with Cobol XOM from a
   decision center,
   - after importing Java project associated to the Cobol BOM
   - the resources/xom-libraries/...-xmarshaller.jar file
   disappears
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Regenerate the ...-xmarshaller,jar with update from the Rule
   Designer decision service project properties / Cobol Management
   / Cobol Execution Object Model
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When creating a decision service project  with Cobol XOM from
   Decision center, and trying to import this project including
   its Java project associated to the cobol BOM, the
   resources/xom-libraries/...-xmarshaller.jar file disappears.
   The problem comes from the missing "cobol-xom" folder in the
   rule project after it has been fetched from Decision Center by
   a synchronization. The cobol-xom folder is not handled by the
   DC synchronization.   So a project downloaded from DC do not
   include it, So the XOM of the rule project is incomplete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed.
   the fix must be activated by user with a system property for
   Designer (in eclipse.ini)
   -Dcom.ibm.rules.zrules.marshallerJarsInResources=true.
   By default the marshallers are still generated into folders
   /cobol-xom and /pli-xom.  With this property set to "true", the
   marshallers are generated into /resources/cobol/marshallers and
   /resources/pli/marshallers  (which is the default on trunk and
   v89updates)
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Regenerate the ...-xmarshaller,jar with update from the Rule
   Designer decision service project properties / Cobol Management
   / Cobol Execution Object Model
