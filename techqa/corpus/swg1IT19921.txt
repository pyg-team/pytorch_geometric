ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Demand Routing (ODR) has problems routing to application
   servers that are new in a collective.
   
   One issue was an application not being available after a
   re-deployment.
   
   The way to get the application reachable again was to restart
   the Datapower appliance. Restarting the controllers did not
   help.
