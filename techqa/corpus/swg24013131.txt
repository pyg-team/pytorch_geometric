ABSTRACT
 A potential synchronization issue may arise when two or more EJB jars in the same EAR are accessed at about the same time. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
PK29976 resolves the following problem: ERROR DESCRIPTION: When there are two or more EJB Jars in the same EAR there is the potential to encounter a synchronization issue because. the EJB Jar files are beneath a common parent, simultaneous calls to different EJB Jar files can result in simultaneous calls to retrieve the deployment descriptor of the shared parent EAR. Concurrent access to EJBs is causing concurrent access through to application data. An example of the exception seen in the log file: EJBContainerI E WSVR0068E: Attempt to start EnterpriseBean MyBean#MyEJB.jar#Mytest failed with exception: com.ibm.etools.j2ee.commonarchivecore.exception. DeploymentDescriptorLoadException: META-INF/application.xml !Stack_trace_of_nested_exce! com.ibm.etools.j2ee.commonarchivecore. exception.EmptyResourceException: META-INF/application.xml LOCAL FIX: PROBLEM SUMMARY USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Service users on versions 6.0.2 and 6.1. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A potential synchronization issue may arise when two or more EJB jars in the same EAR are accessed at about the same time. RECOMMENDATION: None When there are two or more EJB Jars in the same EAR, and at least two or more are being accessed at roughly the same time, there is the potential to encounter a synchronization issue. This issue can arise because the EJB Jar files are beneath a common parent and thus simultaneous calls may be made to retrieve the deployment descriptor of the shared parent EAR. Concurrent access to EJBs is causing concurrent access through to application data. An example of the exception seen in the log file: EJBContainerI E WSVR0068E: Attempt to start EnterpriseBean MyEar#MyEJB.jar#MyTestBean failed with exception: com.ibm.etools.j2ee.commonarchivecore.exception. DeploymentDescriptorLoadException: META-INF/application.xml !Stack_trace_of_nested_exce! com.ibm.etools.j2ee.commonarchivecore. exception.EmptyResourceException: META-INF/application.xml PROBLEM CONCLUSION: This fix provided the code necessary to avoid the synchronization issues described above. The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fixpacks 6.0.2.17 and 6.1.0.4.
