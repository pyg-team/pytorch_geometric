Title: IBM IZ97315: THE SOFTSCANS ARE NOT WORKING CORRECTLY - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Agent in 'incomplete status. Jar file being replaced:
   
   <LMT_dir>/eWAS/systemApps/isclite.ear/lmt_admin.war/WEB-INF/lib/
   com.ibm.
   license.mgmt.core.jar
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Jar file replaced
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem was caused by not changing the ADM.AGENT->NODE_ID
   field during VM Manager task while the virtual topology
   (AGT_VM_REL / VM) was created correctly.
   In this way, when node name changes, the change is not reflected
   in in the ADM.AGENT->NODE_ID field.
   The ADM.AGENT->NODE_ID is used only on UI. For PVU calcualation
   the node is taken from vm topology, so this issue has no impact
   on correctness of PVU calculations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this issue will be included in the following
   deliverables:
   
      | fix pack | 7.2.2.0-TIV-ILMT-TAD4D-FP0001
   
   (Fix Pack 1 for 7.2.2 release)
   
      | fix pack | 7.2.1.0-TIV-ILMT-TAD4D-FP0002
   
   (Fix Pack 2 for 7.2.1 release)
   
   The Fix Packl for 7.2.2 release will be delivered earlier than
   for 7.2.1 release, so the alternative to wait for Fix Pack 2 for
   7.2.1 will be to upgrade the server to 7.2.2.1.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  No temporary workarounds.
