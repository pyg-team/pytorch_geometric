QUESTION
The Recent Contacts feature is a view in the personal address book of Lotus Notes 8 client containing a local cache of people that you frequently collaborate with. Names are automatically populated in this view when you read mail from or send mail to a particular user. 

Is there a limit to the number of entries that can be populated in this view?

ANSWER
There is a limit of approximately 3000 contacts that can be added to the Recent Contacts view.

In 8.5.2, a notes.ini parameter was introduced to allow users to set a limit on the number of recent contacts that are added to the personal address book. Refer to technote 1430597 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430597] "Is it possible to limit the numbers of the recent contact list in the Personal Address Book?" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430597].
