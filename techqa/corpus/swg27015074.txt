ABSTRACT
 Currently, some of the PTFs for WebSphere MQ for i5/OS exceed the maximum size to allow them to be 'immediately' downloaded from Fix Central. This document outlines how you can download and order these PTFs from the Fix Central Web site. 

CONTENT
 Due to the size of some of the PTFs for WebSphere MQ for i5/OS, you will currently be unable to 'immediately' download the complete set of PTFs from Fix Central. The instructions below outline how you can overcome this problem, so that you may obtain the latest PTFs.




To obtain this maintenance, you should order one of the three following Group PTFs (dependent on your operating system version):

Selecting the WebSphere MQ PTFs When you initially log on to Fix Central [http://www-912.ibm.com/eserver/support/fixes/fixcentral/main/iseries/] to obtain the WebSphere MQ PTFs, you should ensure that you select the "Groups, HIPER, Cumulative fixes" option.

Server: iSeries family
Product of fix type: OS/400 and i5/OS
Ordering option: Groups, HIPER, Cumulative fixes
OS level: V5R3, V5R4, V6R1 or V7R1

You will then be presented with a number of download screens which you should complete. Please note that the screens shown below show the WebSphere MQ v6.0 PTFs as an example. The equivalent for v7.0 and V7.1 PTFs are almost identical.

The Group, HIPER, and Cumulative screen (shown below) will allow you to select the applicable Group PTF for the WebSphere MQ product and add this PTF to your download list.

Select the Group PTFs you need from the following:



[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&amp;aid=1] WebSphere MQ v6.0 WebSphere MQ v7.0 WebSphere MQ v7.1 i5/OS V5R3 SF99303 SF99331 - i5/OS V5R4 SF99304 SF99332 - i5/OS V6R1 SF99350 SF99351 SF99351 i5/OS V7R1 - SF99359 SF99359 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&aid=2] 

Once the appropriate Group PTF is selected, the next screen presented is the Packaging options screen. If you require the complete contents of the Group PTF ensure that you select the first three options (do not select the last option) in the " What are your order options?" section (shown below). 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&amp;aid=3] 

The next screen displayed is the Download options screen. There are two main download/order options available for these PTFs, both of which are explained below: 
 * Option 1: Downloading a CD-ROM Image 
 * Option 2: Ordering a CD-ROM


Note: Due to the current size limitation the " Immediate download over the Internet (HTTP)" option is available but does not work for all of the WebSphere MQ PTFs, so should not be used.

Option 1: Downloading a CD-ROM Image The Download options screen allows you to modify how the Group PTFs are downloaded. This screen plus notes on how to download a CD-ROM image of the WebSphere MQ PTFs to an FTP Server can be found below.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&amp;aid=4] 

When downloading a CD-ROM image, please note the following: 

 1. You should not select the "Immediate download over the Internet (HTTP)" option, as the size of these PTFs means that they can not be downloaded using this method. 
 2. You will need to select the "Download CD-ROM image to FTP server (FTP)" option. Please ensure that the size is set to "Maximum allowable" when selecting this option. The directory name and file name will automatically be populated. 
 3. You do not need to select the "Mail order on CD-ROM if the total size exceeds the limits you selected above" option.


Once you have entered this information and selected continue, you will be prompted to enter your system information. Follow the instructions, if successful you will see a Summary screen with the following message and will also be sent further instructions in a email informing you how to complete the download.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015074&amp;aid=6]
