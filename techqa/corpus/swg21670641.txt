CONTENT
IMPORTANT: This document contains important updates regarding IBM i PTFs required before installing the IBM i OS agent.
The IOA Cache Battery function was introduced in ITM 6.2.3 and requires IBM i PTFs to be installed. The QSMRTVBTC API is used to retrieve IOA cache battery information. Important PTF's have been released by IBM i to update the QSMRTVBTC API to ensure appropriate requisite PTFs are on the system. These PTF's addressed a condition where incorrect output caused a severe problem and were released as high impact pervasive (HIPER) PTF's. The following table lists the HIPER PTF's that are required before installing the IBM i OS agent. This table supersedes the information found in the ITM 6.3 IBM i OS Agent user documentation for installation requirements.
