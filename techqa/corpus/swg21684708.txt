QUESTION
 Is it possible to move controls across applications within Maximo? 

ANSWER
You must edit the presentation.xml files to move a control or a group of controls from one application to another. 
1. Open the source application in the Application Designer and click Export Application Definition. The XML definition opens in the browser.

2. Save the XML definition to a file.

3. Open the target application and perform the same steps to export the XML definition and save it to a file.

4. Open the XML file for the source application in a text editor. 

5. Locate the control ID or the section control ID that you want to move. You can use the unique control ID that is listed in the Control Properties window to search for the control in the XML file.

6. Select the relevant code and copy it to the clipboard.

7. Open the XML file for the target application in a text editor. 

8. Navigate to where you want to insert the control and Paste the code that is stored on the clipboard.

9. Save both XML files. 

10. Open the target application in the Application Designer and click Import Application Definition. 

11. Specify the target application XML file that you modified, and click OK.

Results - 

When you copy a multipart text box control to a different application, the control must link to an attribute that exists in the main object table for both applications. If the attribute relationship does not exist, the multipart text box control in the target application does not contain any property values.
