QUESTION
 How can I adjust heap memory in TIP and are there any guideline to follow? 

ANSWER
You can find the current heap size by running below command: 

 * 
 * 

In the output look for process which belongs to TIP. -Xms256m, -Xmx500m parameters show the value for initialHeapSize and maximumHeapSize. 

Follow below steps to change heap size. 

 1. Stop Tivoli Integrated Portal 
 2. Change to the tip_home_dir/profiles/TIPProfile/bin directory. 
 3. Use the wsadmin command to increase the heap size for the JVM, as follows: 
    wsadmin.sh -lang jython -conntype NONE 
 4. At the wsadmin> prompt, issue the following commands, where xxx is the new heap size value, in megabytes.
    
    jvm=AdminConfig.list("JavaVirtualMachine") 
    AdminConfig.modify(jvm, '[[initialHeapSize xxx]]') 
    AdminConfig.modify(jvm, '[[maximumHeapSize xxx]]')
    AdminConfig.save()
    
 5. exit 
 6. Restart the Tivoli Integrated Portal Server. The changes take effect when the Tivoli Integrated Portal Server is restarted
    
    

See below Technote (section: Check the maximum heap size) for guidelines on heap size. They are same as Websphere.
