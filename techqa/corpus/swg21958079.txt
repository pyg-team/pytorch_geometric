QUESTION
 What users are needed to set up HA (High Availability) for DB2? 

ANSWER
Depending upon what option of High Availability you wish to implement, the following user's are needed at a minimum or have user's with these credentials:
DB2 Instance Owner and DB2 Database Owner - for DB2 related tasks.

Operating System Admin Team - For "Root Access" tasks that need to be completed.

System Administrators for hardware - To complete hardware related tasks and configurations of all the servers involved.

System Network Administrators - To complete network related tasks and configurations.

Collectively, all of the above teams combined would be needed to install, configure, monitor/maintain a DB2 HA (High Availability) environment.
