QUESTION
 Which version of Rational Team Concert plugin can be installed with Rule Designer/Rule Studio? 

ANSWER
To install Rational Team Concert (RTC) plugins alongside Rule Designer/Rule Studio plugins in the same Eclipse, you need to make sure that the version of RTC is compatible with the same version of Eclipse with which Rule Designer/Rule Studio is compatible.

The Eclipse compatibility for RTC and Rule Designer/Rule Studio is detailed below: 
- Rule Studio in WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 requires Eclipse 3.4. 
- Rule Designer in WebSphere Operational Decision Management (WODM) V7.5 and V8.0 require Eclipse 3.6. 
- RTC 3.0.1 is built on top of Eclipse 3.5.2, but may be installed into an existing Eclipse 3.6 with IBM Installation Manager (IM) [https://jazz.net/library/article/708/]
- RTC 4.0 requires Eclipse 3.6.2


 
Therefore: 

- WODM Rule Designer (7.5 and 8.0) may share the same Eclipse installation as RTC 3.0.1 (provided it is installed in Eclipse 3.6 ) as well as RTC 4.0. 

- JRules 7.1 Rule Studio may not share the same Eclipse installation with RTC (neither 3.0.1 nor 4.0).
