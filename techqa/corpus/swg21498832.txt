Title: IBM A SIP Registration failure message might appear when an unauthorized user joins a call - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The Web A/V client uses an LPTA token, which it sends to the Proxy/Registrar. If the user is logged into the Proxy (through Meetings LiveName integration) for more than the token's time-out period, the LPTA token expires; if that user tries to enter an A/V-enabled room, the Proxy/Registrar server sends the "unauthorized" error. 

The user can work around the error by logging out, and then logging back in, which creates a new session with a new LPTA token. 


SYMPTOM
An error message such as, "SIP Registration failed for the user", appears when a user attempts to join an A/V meeting.


CAUSE
The LTPA token has timed out.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It is important that the token time-out be set (in the Domino Web SSO configuration document) to more than the default value of 30 minutes to avoid this issue in the long A/V calls.
