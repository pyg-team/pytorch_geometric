Title: IBM Minimum authorization required for SAP agent logon userid - United States

Text:
authorization minimum IBMMON_AGENT profile settings agent userid SAP MySAP /IBMMON/AUTH TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the minimum authorizations required for the userid used by the ITM MySAP agent to logon a SAP system? 

ANSWER
By default, the MySAP agent uses the userid IBMMON_AGENT, that is created when ITM transport are imported in the SAP system, together with /IBMMON/AUTH role and profile.
If you don't want to use the default userid and profile, you need to create your own userid and provide it with a set of minimum required authorization settings.
Depending on the transport level, the required authorization may vary, but you can always refer to the values specified for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile available in the transport.
By looking at this profile, you can obtain the needed authorization information.
In example, for MySAP agent 6.2 IF16, those are the authorization defined for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657458&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657458&aid=1]

You need to define your own userid providing the same set of authorization showed for the /IBMMON/AUTH profile to have mySAP agent performing successful data collection even using a non-default userid.
