APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION

   experience progressive slowness during save operations.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  We save the content of each WYSIWYG handler for future use. If
   many instances of a coach are in one layout (one layer in the
   embedded coach view hierarchy), then we get the handler once for
   each item.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that ensure that only one call is made for any JS/HTML handler.
