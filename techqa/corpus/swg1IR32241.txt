Title: IBM IR32241: WITH EXPANDED ITEM RECORD, SELECTIVE ITEM RECORD WILL NOT CREATE CORRECT ITEM RECORD LENGTH.***FIX IN ERROR. SEE IR36312** - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Selective Item Record Report will not create batches with the
   correct length, if other than 46 byte records are used in the
   Item Record file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WITH EXPANDED ITEM RECORD ON 4680/90 SUPERMARKET,
   SELECTIVE ITEM RECORD REPORT WILL NOT
   CREATE FULL ITEM RECORDS WITH CORRECT LENGTH
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code that creates addmi batches was not taking into
   account the expanded item record nor addmi's limitation
   of only adding records up to 69 bytes in size.
   HOW TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM:
   With an item record file with item records of at least
   70 bytes in length and EM installed.
   Perform a search that yields some item records(any type)
   After output is displayed press F3 to exit and at the
   SIR menu press F9 to create an addmi batch.  With the
   fix installed, the operator will be warned that they
   can only modify records with addmi and will be prevented
   from attempting to select to add the item records.
