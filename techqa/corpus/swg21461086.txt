Title: IBM My custom Microsoft .NET application that calls IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine COM API compiles, but gets runtime error 80040154 when calling Interop.FNCE methods. - United States

Text:
CE COM API 3.5 Interop VIsual Studio .NET CLSID TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the custom application attempts to execute methods of the Interop.FNCE.dll at run-time, it may receive the following error: 
"Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {A1010FEC-1AA9-11D3-9E74-00104B291933} failed due to the following error: 80040154." 

CAUSE
The IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine COM API must be installed on each system where the application will run. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine 3.5, the Interop.FNCE.dll is not provided as part of the API set, however any Microsoft Visual Studio .NET project that references the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine COM API layer (FNCE.dll) will build an interop dll. When copying the application from one system to another, the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine COM API must be installed on each system where the application will run.
