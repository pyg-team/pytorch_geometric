Title: IBM Not able to create a local user in DASH - United States

Text:
DASHL2; DASHL2CONF; permissions; filebased repository; user create TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer was not able to create a new user in the local filebased repository of Dashboard Application Services Hub. 

CAUSE
DASH was installed as a non-root user, but was started as root, which changed file ownership and permissions.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The system log will show errors like the following: 

[6/30/15 14:21:46:316 NZST] 00000040 FileDocument E ADMR0104E: The 
system is unable to read document 
cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/ 
WEB-INF/isc.dir/WP300/prefs.xml: java.io.IOException: Permission denied 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the DASH installation was done as a non-root user, check the DASH installation for files owned by root. For example: 

Change directories to the DASH installation directory (usually /opt/IBM/JazzSM). 

Execute: 
find . -user root | xargs ls -latr 

Change ownership of any files that are owned by root back to the user that was used to install DASH.
