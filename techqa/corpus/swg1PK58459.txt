ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 does not state that an application server
   within a federated node should not be controlled as a
   Windows service.
   
   Federated nodes can be managed using the node agent with
   the monitoring policy.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The documentation needs to state that application servers
   within federated nodes are managed by the node agent and
   should not be listed as a Windows service.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "WASService command" topic has been updated to include the
   following statement:
   "Do not add an application server that is part of a federated
   or managed node as a Windows service. Use the node agent to
   manage federated nodes."
   
   In addition, the following text was updated in the same
   "WASService command" topic:
   "After creating a custom profile, you must federate the node
   to create a node agent server on the node. You can also use
   the administrative console of the deployment manager to create
   application server processes on the node. You can create a
   Windows service for the node agent server process."
   
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might have been made
   before you read this text. To access the latest on-line
   documentation, complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format", click
   the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere Application
   Server documentation is available in both an online version
   and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version. For more
   information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the following
   Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation in its eclipse/plugins
   directory. The plug-in is available from our product library
   page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the September
   2008  update to the information centers.
