QUESTION
 What is the support status for Leap Second with different products in the IBM Rational brand? 

CAUSE
A leap second will be inserted at the end of December 31, 2016 at 23:59:60 UTC.

ANSWER



 * Rational Apex Ada: The supported platforms of Apex do not support leap seconds, so Apex does not support leap seconds. It is possible to configure UNIX operating systems to support leap seconds, but that is not the default. 
 * Rational Application Developer: Not impacted. Product does not use timers in such a way that a Leap Second would cause a problem. 
 * Rational AppScan Standard, Source, Tester, and Enterprise: Not impacted. 
 * Rational Build Forge: Not impacted. 
 * Rational Change: Not impacted. 
 * Rational ClearCase: Not impacted. 
 * Rational ClearQuest: Does not support. Do not carry out ClearQuest activities during Leap Second (11:59:60). 
 * Rational DOORS: Does not support. Product depends on operating system time for all time-related activities. 
 * Rational DOORS Next Generation: Does not support. Impact is not known. It is advisable to avoid updating data during the leap second.
