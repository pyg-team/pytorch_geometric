 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error message creating DB2 datasource for TCR 3.1.3: 

QE-DEF-0285 The logon failed. 
QE-DEF-0325 The logon failed for the following reason: 
RQP-DEF-0068 Unable to connect to at least one database during a 
multi-database attach to 1 database(s) in: 
testDataSourceConnection 

ENVIRONMENT
TCR 3.1.x connecting to DB2

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
cd to the /opt/IBM/JazzSM/profile (equivalent) directory and enter the following command: 

 
ln -s /home/db2inst1/sqllib/lib32/libdb2.so reporting/cognos/bin/libdb2.so 

to create a symlink in TCRHOME, which points to lib32/libdb2.so on the DASH + TCR + DB2 Server. 

To confirm that all libs can now be located, please cd /home/db2inst1/sqllib/lib32 and run the command 

ldd libdb2.so 

and check that none of its dependencies are missing.
