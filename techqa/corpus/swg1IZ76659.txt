ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  E-Signature (E-Sig) authentication invalid when LDAP is enabled
   
   1) Log into Maximo on a LDAP enabled system.
   2) Go to database configuration - Select Action - Manage
   Admin Mode - Turn on Admin Mode - E-Sig prompt.  Enter the
   username/password used to login.  Error message appears
   BMXAA3840E - The electronic signature entered is not valid for
   the user currently signed in to the application!
   
   Property mxe.convertloginid=1.  Loginid values in Maximo are
   stored in uppercase.  Loginid values in the repository are
   stored in uppercase and app server is set to ignore case when
   authenticating.  The user is able to initially log in to Maximo
   using uppercase (and any case wouild work as well).  The ESig
   dialog is preloaded with uppercase loginid (which is correct
   because this is the value from the database), but this is not
   considered valid.  This is because the ESignature class is not
   considering the mxe.convertloginid property when comparing the
   loginid to the principal.
