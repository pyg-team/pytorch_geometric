ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer upgraded ISAM appliance from 8.0.1.3 to 9.0.3.0 and
   noticed that certificate revocation status checking was failing
   after the upgrade.
   
   Example of Reverse Proxy settings:
   [ssl]
   ocsp-enable = yes
   ocsp-url = http://ocspresponder/ocsp [http://ocspresponder/ocsp]
   
   Inspected OCSP request however looked as following:
   http://ocspresponder/ocsp/ [http://ocspresponder/ocsp/]
   
   Failure to check the certificate revocation status is caused
   by the trailing slash " / " added at the end of defined
   ocsp-url setting. Regardless the value defined in the ocsp-url
   the triggered request always has trailing slash.
   
   Because OCSP responder was not expecting trailing slash at the
   end of request it responded HTTP 404 and thus causing
   certificate revocation status checking to fail.
