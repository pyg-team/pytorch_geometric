PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM may       *
   *                      ABEND0C5 while performing RACF database *

   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF provided.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM is unable to detect the presence
   of RACF template extensions while processing a z/VM RACF
   database or an UNLOAD data set generated by zSecure Collect for
   z/VM.
   This may result in:
    - An ABEND0C5 during RACF database MERGE processing;
    - RACF segments missing from the STATUS AUDIT option TEMPLATE
      lists;
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  zSecure Manager for RACF z/VM has been modified so it correctly
   detects the presence of RACF template extensions in RACF data
   from z/VM systems.
   As a result:
    - RACF database merge processing completes normally;
    - RACF segments are correctly included in the STATUS AUDIT
      option TEMPLATE lists;
