Title: IBM HOW TO: Filter a crosstab to show measures relative to the change in another measure. - United States

Filter, Tuple TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes one approach to use MDX-like expressions in Report Studio to create a report that only shows data for items where other data has changed between two periods. In the attached sample, we create a report that that shows the change in revenue for the Email order method by Sales Territory, and we only show sales terriroties where Mail revenue has decreased by more then $500,000 

ENVIRONMENT
This sample was built against Cognos 8v2 MR2

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The attached sample can be run against the Cognos sample package and PowerCube "Great Outdoors Company". Consult your documentation for instructions on installing this sample if you don't have it already. The report shows two crosstabs; the first shows our desired result, and the second shows the results before the filter is applied.

The first step in this report is setting up the dimensions and the default measure (Revenue). Because we're looking to compare specific years, we use specific members of the Years category. This gives us single values in each column to look at. We also select specific members of the Order Method dimension, because we're going to be comparing specific values.

Now that we have the data to look at, we add a calcualation to figure out the difference between [2004] and [2005]. We do this by using the "tuple" function. The tuple function allows us to look up a specific piece of information in the crosstab. We use the expression:
tuple([Revenue],[2006])-tuple([Revenue],[2005])
This expression looks up the value for [Revenu] in the column [2006] and subtracts the value for [Revenue] in the column [2005]. We don't specify the row because we want to get a different value for each row, and the tuple function will default to the 'current' row in its evaluation.

Now that we have the difference between the two years, we can use this value to filter the sales territory. We do this by modifying the existing expression for sales territory, and adding a "Filter" function to it. The filter function takes the set of members (in this case, all of the sales territories), and returns only those members who meet the expression in the filter. This expression makes use of another tuple function to look up the value of [Diff] (our caluclation) for the row [Mail].
