PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Streamer and Redaction server components of the IBM PIE viewer pro fail to load due to a missing jar file after installation of Workplace XT 1.1.5.2 Interim Fix 001. 

SYMPTOM
After the installation of XT with the PIE pro viewer, trying to view an image or a pdf file fails with the following message in the viewer window:

Hint: use the zoom in button of the viewer to enlarge the text for reading.

Unable to open <url address>

Error:java.io.IOException:

Server returned HTTP response code 500 for URL: <url address>

Error: Please make sure this file can be accessed and that it is a supported file type.




CAUSE
Workplace XT installs the Daeja Viewer files. Since Workplace XT 1.1.5 Fix Pack 2 Interim Fix 001 the Daeja viewer version was updated to version 4.0.48. Daeja introduced a change with the requirement of a jar file for the server components, Redaction and Streamer. This is the jiserver-external.jar file. The WorkplaceXT installer does not put down this file that is required in 4.0.48 version of the pro viewer.


ENVIRONMENT
Windows

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Locate the Streamer log file at: <install path>/FileNet/ImageViewerPro/LogFiles/iviewpro.streamer.log
Search for the following error entry: 
iviewpro.streamer> ERROR: Could not find required jar + jiserver-external.jar on the classpath.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Contact IBM Daeja or FileNet Content Management support for a copy of the missing jiserver-external.jar file.

Once you have a copy of the file take the following action:

1. Place the file in the <install path>\webclient\WorkplaceXT\WEB-INF\lib directory.
2. Following the P8 Workplace XT documentation, rebuild the war and ear files and redeploy the Workplace XT application.
