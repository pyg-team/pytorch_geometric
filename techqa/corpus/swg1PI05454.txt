APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Worklight 6.0 is deployed on WAS Liberty Profile 8.5.5,
   and Application Center is in use, the HTTP response headers for
   HTTP "GET" requests that retrieve items from icon storage
   include "Last-Modified" dates in an incorrect format.  The
   dates are returned in the format used by the Unix "date"
   command.  RFC 2616 requires that these dates be in the format
   specified by RFC 1123; RFC 2616 also specifies that dates
   should be accepted in the format specified by RFC 1036, or in
   the Unix "asctime" format, but discourages producing dates in
   these formats.  The Unix "date" command date format used in
   this instance is not compliant with any of the permitted date
   formats.  In an envrionment where the Worklight Server is
   behind an HTTP server that strictly enforces the date formats
   specified by RFC 2616 (such as IBM HTTP Server), "GET" requests
   that return a "Last-Modified" date in a bad format may fail.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Developers that make use of the IBM Worklight Application    *
   * Center REST services.                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When accessing the REST service to get an application icon,  *
   * the "Last-Modified" header date is formatted using a         *
   * non-standard format.                                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been fixed so that the "Last-Modified" header is
   generated using the standard rfc 1123 date format.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fixpack 6.0.0.2 and fixpack 6.1.0.1.
