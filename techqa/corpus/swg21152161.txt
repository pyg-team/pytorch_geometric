QUESTION
 Which are the known limitations, issues and workarounds for IBM Rational Robot against Microsoft .NET controls? For these controls Robot uses the Robot .NET Enabler. 

ANSWER

GroupBox, PictureBox, Panel, Splitter
Robot recognizes these objects as Generic objects. Limited properties might be accessible by using the Object Properties verification point. You can use the Alphanumeric verification point to obtain the visible text. 


DomainUpDown, and NumericUpDown
Robot recognizes these objects as Generic objects. To automate testing against these controls, click in the edit box and use the 'up' and 'down' cursor keys. When you want to capture, you use the edit box, not the cursor keys. 


LinkLabel
The Object Properties verification point is unable to obtain link details. That means the URL. 


CheckBox
Robot recognizes a CheckBox as a PushButton object type. The Object Properties verification point cannot access properties beyond those provided for the PushButton. If you need to verify the CheckBox state, the Region Image verification point might be a workaround. 


RadioButton
Robot recognizes a RadioButton as a PushButton object. The Object Properties verification point is unable to access properties beyond those provided for a PushButton. To verify the control's selection state, the Region Image verification point might be a workaround. 


DataGrid
Robot recognizes a DataGrid as a Generic object. An Object Properties verification point has limited access to the properties.verification point.
A way to do automate testing against the DataGrid control 

Select cell contents, individually, or with multiple-selection. 

Then copy onto the clipboard, type Ctrl + C. Do not select with the mouse, but rather with the keyboard. You use the keys 'Home', 'End', 'Shift' and the cursor keys to achieve the most resilient recording possible. You can then accomplish verification with the Clipboard verification point. 


The 'Shift' key enables you to select entire rows and columns. Also this selection you can copy onto the clipboard and verify in the same manner.
The AlphaNumeric and Object Data verification points can verify single cell contents. 


CheckedListBox
Robot recognizes a CheckedListBox as a Listbox. The Object Properties verification point cannot determine if a check box has a check mark. If you need the CheckBox state verification, the workaround is to use the Region Image verification point. You can verify selected text with the Alphanumeric verification point. You can get a list of items with the Object Data verification point and the List property of the Object Properties verification point. 


ContextMenu
Robot recognizes a ContextMenu as a PopUpMenu. Verification of menu contents requires the following workaround. 

 1. Right-click to display the context menu. 
 2. Then use an Image verification point in the approximate area of the menu (which will not be on the screen). 
 3. Then, play back the script and replace the empty image that was first recorded with the new image that now includes the menu.



Purify, Quantify & PureCoverage 
Robot does not support usage of Purify, Quantify & PureCoverage in conjunction with .NET.
