Datastage Hierarchical stage Split batches TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Would like additional information as to when to set the "Split Data Into Batches = Yes" within the Hierarchical Stage properties. 

CAUSE
Additional information required as to how and when to use this feature as it's currently not captured in the online documentation at the time of the creation of this document. This will also be captured in future product documentation .

ANSWER
Enter Yes to split the large input data into multiple batches based on a unique batch split key. The Split data into batches option is used to avoid memory issues. Specify a unique key column value for Batch split key. Specify a value for Batch split key Value Order according to whether the the information coming into the stage has been sorted in ascending or descending order on the batch split key.
The input data from all the input links is split into multiple batches.Each batch contains the input data records identified by the specified unique value for the Batch split key. If the given key matches for all the input data then all data will be processed in a single batch. 

For example:
If there are two input files "Employee" and "Address". The employee details and address details having a common column "Employee ID".
The batch split key would be the common key and the batch split key order would be either ascending or descending.

This will result in an xml file being generated for every Employee ID.

Additional Information:

Windows operating systems has a limitation of 2 GB process memory on a 32bit architecture. That can result in memory issue for large data sets. We can overcome this problem by increasing the number of nodes to execute job. In case of non-windows IS server, we can increase the heap size of the Hierarchical stage more than 2GB on a 64bit operating systems.
