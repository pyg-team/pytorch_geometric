Title: IBM JDBC returns an IP address instead of the hostname of the client for CURRENT CLIENT_WRKSTNNAME register. - United States

Text:
CURRENT CLIENT_WRKSTNNAME; hostname; IP address; JDBC TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does JDBC returns an IP address instead of hostname of the client for CURRENT CLIENT_WRKSTNNAME register after upgrading to V10.1 or higher? 

CAUSE
Starting with versions 3.65 and 4.15 of the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ, the default for db2.jcc.enableInetAddressGetHostName is false. For versions 3.64 and 4.14 or earlier, the default is true.


ANSWER
db2.jcc.enableInetAddressGetHostName property specifies whether the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ uses the InetAddress.getHostName and InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName methods to determine the host name for an IP address.

If it is set to true, the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ uses the InetAddress.getHostName and InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName methods to determine the host name for an IP address. If set to false, it uses the InetAddress.getHostAddress method to return the IP address. The returned IP address is used in place of the host name.
