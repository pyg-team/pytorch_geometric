Title: IBM Trouble Shooting Security Environment Configuration issues for Cognos Disclosure Management - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There are many issues with security environment settings that can lead CDM users not able to acccess the CDM database. 

SYMPTOM
Unable to access the Cognos Disclosure Management (CDM) database


ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are the areas to focus on trouble shooting security environment for Cognos Disclosure Management (CDM)


Validate CDM applications server configuration:
Pre-requisites: 

 * .Net Framework (on Windows Server 2012 make sure that the .net framework feature is properly installed) 
 * Visual C++ 2008/2010 Redistributable x64 
 * Windows Server roles and features


IIS Configuration:  * HTTPS protocol and SSL certificate. For additional information on SSL Certificates please refer to the following link: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQK59_10.2.3/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.cdm_ig.10.2.3.doc/c_cdm_ig_ssl_certificates.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQK59_10.2.3/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.cdm_ig.10.2.3.doc/c_cdm_ig_ssl_certificates.html] or http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695463 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21695463] 
 * Feature specific configuration (for example: Windows authentication)


Optional configurations:  * net.tcp protocol must be enabled on the parent website and added to the CDM server web application (required for integrated windows auth.) 
 * net.pipes protocol must be enabled on the parent website and added to HFMx86 web application (required for HFM 11.1.2.2 or higher versions of HFM client) 

*** CDM users should refer to the installation and configuration guide for CDM, especially to ensure the required settings are matched with the correct versions. 

The following areas can be trouble shooting as part resolving security issues with Cognos Disclosure Management: 

Troubleshooting CDM application deployment related issues:  * Open CDM URL in Internet Explorer on CDM Server and Client machines 
 * Ping CDM Server FQDN (that the SSL certificate was issued to) from the CDM Client 
 * Check CDM Server and Client logs 
 * Check EventViewer logs on CDM Application Server machine 
 * Check CDM Server IIS CGI and ISAPI restrictions (the used version of .net Framework should be allowed ) 
 * Check that the used .net Framework is properly registered to IIS.


Troubleshooting CDM Active Directory or CAM Security Configuration: 
Generic:  * Check CDM Server and Client logs


Active Directory Source:  * Check domain name of the CDM Client and Server machines 
 * Many issues are specific to customer environment (AD configuration/structure) 


CAM Source:  * Make sure CAM pre-requisites are installed 
 * Check C8ITK logs (they have a different location than CDM logs) 
 * Validate the URLs as well as other settings within the IBM Cognos Configuration File - 
 * Check your security directory server connection and confirm the credentials entered at login. http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21624618 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21624618]

Sample of Scenarios for Security 

Scenario 1 - Users leaves company and then returns
When creating users in CDM, we import the account from AD. Company have a situation where a CDM user let the company - the account was disabled in CDM. They were rehired, an their AD account was recreated (having a different SID then their original AD account). When we re-enabled the account in CDM, the user receives an authentication error. We tried re- importing the account from AD, but are getting a message that the user ID already exists. 

Solution:
The externalID is the AD ObjectGUID, they can just replace the value of the new user in the cdm core.Users table.
