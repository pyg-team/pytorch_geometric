Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM MQ Appliance has addressed vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-10009 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10009]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSH could allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the loading of a specially crafted PKCS#11 module across a forwarded agent channel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write files or execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 6.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119828 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119828] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6515 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6515]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSH is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to limit password lengths for password authentication by the auth_password function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an overly long string to consume all available CPU resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115911 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115911] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6210 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6210]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSH could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the increased amount of time it takes to calculate SHA256/SHA512 hash rather than BLOWFISH hash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a covert timing channel to enumerate users on a system that runs SSHD.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115128 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115128] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
