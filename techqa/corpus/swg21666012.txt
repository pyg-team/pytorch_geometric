QUESTION
 How to login into IBM Security AppScan Enterprise Console configured to use Windows Authentication with a different user name on the same machine. 

CAUSE
With a specific browser/ISS configuration, users login into AppScan Enterprise without any username/password prompt. However sometimes there is a need to use a different windows account on the same machine. Is there a way to be promted a credentials instead of automatically logging in?


ANSWER
This is a Windows question (since the credentials are managed by IIS and the browser, for example Internet Explorer).

In my Internet Explorer I set "Tools -> Internet Options -> Security -> Custom Level... -> User Authentication" to "Automatic logon only in Intranet zone" (see the attached screenshot) and when I need to login with another user I do one of the following:\

1. Open another a browser (a browser from a different company).
For example, if I'm logged in with user1 in Internet Explorer, I use Firefox browser for user2.

2. If I'm logged in with user1 using Internet Explorer, and I want to log in with user2 also using Internet Explorer, I close *all* instances of Internet Explorer and then open a new instance of Internet Explorer to access ASE.
Note that I need to close all instances of Internet explorer on my machine, to get a prompt with a new instance of IE. If you set "User Authentication" to "Prompt for user name and password", IE will prompt you for user every time you access ASE with a new browser tab.

There is a similar setting in Firefox.
