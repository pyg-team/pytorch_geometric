Title: IBM Examine procedure cause a Server crash when Client connected to UNIX Servers and other procedures fail to render tables when light table option is activated - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0 on a Client Windows, Macintosh or Linux system connected to a Statistics 19 Server installed on a UNIX platform (AIX or Solaris). On Edit - Options - Pivot Tables tab I have activated to create all pivot tables in lightweight mode: "Render tables faster" (lightweight tables option).
After that I would like to create some charts and tables with the EXAMINE procedure (Analyze - Descriptive Statistics - Explore menu). However, I get a system crash when I try to execute EXAMINE. For example on a Windows Client connected to a UNIX server I get the Assertion failed error message below:

Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
Assertion Failed!
program: C\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\19\stats.exe
File: V:\backend\omfactry\Factory.cpp
Line 237

Expression: parms[parmNum].get()
Abort / Retry / Ignore

I have also noticed that some other procedures like ONEWAY, UNIANOVA, MANOVA, GLM and REGRESSION does not crash the system but no lightweight tables are created and rendered when the Client is connected to the UNIX Server, why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to IBM SPSS Development. This issue is resolved with the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FixPack 1.

As a workaround please download the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 FixPack 1 and install it for your Client or Server operating system. The Fixpack can be obtained from IBM FixCentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] webpage. 

Please read the installation instructions included in the downloadables. 


Select "Information Management" as product group and SPSS Statistics as product. As installed version select 19.0.0.0 and select the operating system Platform where you have installed the application. 

For example if you have installed on Windows 32 bit operating system the relevant FixPack would be: 

19.0-IM-S19STATC-WIN32-FP001 (This is FixPack 1 for Statistics Client 19.0.0.0 Windows 32 bit)
