Q. Where can I find a list of what's new in 8.5.2 for XPages and Domino Designer?

What's new in 8.5.2. For XPages? [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/Whats_New_in_852_for_XPages]
What's new in Domino Designer 8.5.2? [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/domhelp/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.designer.domino.ui.doc/wpd_whatsnew.html]

Tip: For details on improvements to the "Lotus Domino Designer User Guide" help plugin, see the wiki article titled "Lotus Domino Designer help updates for 8.5.2 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/Why_does_the_Help_in_NotesDomino_8.5.2_still_say_8.5.1]".


Q. For XPages, what options are there for debugging JavaScript on the server? 

Currently we do not have an assembly debugger which can be run from Domino Designer. So to debug JavaScript you must emit print statements to the Domino server console and get the debug output there. 

To debug XPages itself, you can use a tool on OpenNTF named Medusa [http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/project.xsp?action=openDocument&name=Medusa] developed by an IBM Business Partner. It allows you to understand how an XPage is constructed and what are its components. 

Q. Is relational database support in place for XPages in 8.5.2? 

No. Relational database support is currently provided by the JVM because it's done through JDBC. So it is not visible inside Designer or inside XPages as a feature but if you install their JDBC driver into your JVM and then you connect to your JDBC data source using JTS techniques than it is doable. So all things are in place except it's not visible from Designer and we don't have a custom data source that it's pointing to from Designer.

Q. Is there also support for Lotus Connections (LC classes)? To be able to use the LotusScript extension classes that were available in previous versions, like lsx. 

You cannot use LSX from XPages unless you put them into an agent and you call the agent using the new feature that calls an agent on top of an in-memory document. Else you have the other database connectors that you can use like LEI, because at the end those are just Domino documents and could be used from an XPage. 

But if you can direct connect to your database through JDBC, that's probably the better solution.


Q. It's my understanding there is currently in 851 a restriction against an XPages calling a Web service on the same server, is that true and has it been fixed in 852. 

True, not fixed. In fact well known issue w/ most HTTP servers because they are not recursive so you cannot call another service from the same server using the HTTP stack. Basically you can come to have a thread locked when doing that. So right now it may seem to work when you do it, but if you add a high load of users then it can go to a dead lock and become completely unpredictable so I would advise you to not do that. We don't have a good fix.


Q. Can XPages be used for Domino applications like client based applications?

XPages support for Notes clients was introduced in 8.5.1. 


Q. So we can use all the features of XPages in Notes client applications, right? 

Yes. Right now when you write an XPage it will run as-is in the Notes client unless you < > call the server itself and you emitted some URL (?) that are dependent on the server. The XPages itself does not do that..everything that you're doing is going through the Notes Web container but if you hardcoded some Domino URLs than that won't work. But XPages itself works perfectly on the Notes client.


Q. Will Notes 852 provide type-ahead functionality for all code areas like LotusScript?

In LotusScript we've added the Eclipse editor support for the database script. 852 does not yet address Web Service Consumers or Web Service Providers which are probably next on the list. The Form View shared action use of LotusScript has not yet been upgraded to use the new Eclipse-based editor, that is something we expect to do one by one in the future. We may for forms & views just provide a dialog-based editor, but that's not committed to any release but it's something we would like to do for consistency and usability. 


Q. Will there be a drag and drop feature for attachments in XPages? 

Yes. We're working internally on this. This is a feature we want to provide through the XPages extension library, in fact we want to take advantage of the HTML 5 drag and drop capability and leverage them for this purpose. 

We will try to put them into the extension library. Will go to OpenNTF first, you won't have to wait for that to be released.


Q. Is there any way to speed up the Designer client startup time on Windows XP? 

There were some suggestions from customers recently to have that start in the background or questions does XPages runtime start in the background. 

For 851 there was a requirement not to do that. But we can reexamine that particular requirement now given that we're on our second release and that XPages is an established part of the client. 

Q. Are there any new options for pre or post save processing from XPages? 

An XPage is not linked itself to a document but it contains data sources and the data sources feature a set of events that are triggered when the document is loaded, created, or saved. So this is the right place where to put your code when both events happen. This is well documented. 


Q. Is there any way to save rich text content in XPages as Notes rich text without converting them as MIME or is there any way to use iNotes rich text editor in other apps?

No. 

1) Because XPages is running on the Web and right now the editors that are running on the Web are HTML based so they must be converted to HTML prior to being displayed by a browser and then when they are saved back they are saved back to a database they are saved as HTML MIME.

2) Cannot use iNotes editor but in 852 we are providing the CKeditor which is very nice currently being used by multiple Lotus products like Lotus Connections and Lotus Quickr. Use 852 and you will have a far better rich text experience Web editing experience. 


Q. Are there plans to allow multiple Notes and Designer to run on one machine. 

This is something we want to address in a future release.



Q. Any direction towards making the Designer to run on the Mac platform? 

Has been some talk of it, on the list, but not on top of the list. Our goal is to first improve the performance and the quality and make sure it works absolutely right and supports all the features at least on the Windows platform first and then expand to other platforms. It's predominantly a testing effort rather than a development effort. We do need business use cases will help us push the priority justification. 


Q. Is it correct that some capabilities can be met via extensions? If so, is that going to work on Notes client? 

Yes. The XPages extension will work on the client and on the server. It requires some plug-ins to be deployed on the client, so there are techniques for deploying those plug-ins. 



Q. Are there any plans to improve the use of document locking when using XPages. 

No plans yet. Right now you can already use document locking by calling the back-end classes API and on the different events on the data source you can ask for a document to be locked. but there are no particular plans to enhance that in the data source right now. 



Q. Sometimes when XPage is submitted it adds SessionID to the URL and some JavaScript stops working. What's that SessionID?

This is due to the way HTTP is working. HTTP is stateless so the browser must pass an ID to the server in order to keep a session open on the server. There are two ways for passing this ID. 

1- Passing the ID as part of the URL
2 - Passing the ID as part of the cookie from the browser

The second way is the preferred way. But for the first page the XPages engine doesn't know if the browser that is connecting to the page is supporting cookies or not, so it tries first by passing an ID and a cookie. And on the second request it looks for the cookie, and if the cookie is there it removes the ID from the URL. So if you look at all the application servers they are all working like that. Now there is a property in XPages that says 'assume that the client has cookie', and in these cases do not use a session ID at all. So that would break some browsers that do not support having cookies enabled. 


Q. We are planning to implement an XPage-based Notes-client home page for a customer. Do you have any suggestions about it? 
A. For general XPage design suggestions and ideas, the Designer Wiki has several good posts to use to get started --> Search Results [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=Developing%20XPages%20Web%20applications]
