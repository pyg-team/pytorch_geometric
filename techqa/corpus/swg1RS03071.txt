APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A ruleset from an archive built with build command and deployed
   to the RES using Deploy RuleAppArchive button in the res
   console makes an error when selected in the res console:
   Invalid XOM resource name
   This is linked to the extra ruleset-property in archive.xml
         <ruleset-property>
   
   <ruleset-property-name>ruleset.managedxom.uris</ruleset-property
   -name>
   
   <ruleset-property-value>resuri://ruleapp_1.0/1.0</ruleset-proper
   ty-value>
         </ruleset-property>
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You need to replace "resuri" by "reslib" in the archive.xml in
   the ruleApp archive:
   
   - generated version:
   <ruleset-property-value>resuri://ruleapp_1.0/1.0</ruleset-proper
   ty-value>
   - workaround:
   <ruleset-property-value>reslib://ruleapp_1.0/1.0</ruleset-proper
   ty-value>
   Once fixed, you can deploy this archive and it works.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Deploying a ruleapp built with Buid command from Res Console
   failed with the following error:  "Invalid XOM resource name".
   This is caused by the extra ruleset property in the archive.xml
   file:
   <ruleset-property>
    <ruleset-property-name>ruleset.managedxom.uris</ruleset-propert
   -name>
   <ruleset-property-value>resuri://simple_dep_1.0/1.0</ruleset-pro
   erty-value>
    </ruleset-property>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Replace "resuri" by "reslib" in the archive.xml in
   the ruleApp archive:
   <ruleset-property-value>reslib://ruleapp_1.0/1.0</ruleset-proper
   ty-value>
