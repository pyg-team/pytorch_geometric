ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer reports a documentation problem as
   follows: "We are using the
   Installation and Configuring webSphere Process Server
   document for version 6.1.0. We plan to install a Deployment
   Environment
   using the Remote Messaging and Remote Support pattern. Our
   installation
   is on AIX will use a remote Oracle 10g database. Our DBAs will
   perform
   the database creation tasks.
   
   Consequently, we have chosen to ?Delay execution of database
   scripts?
   per instruction step 3b on page 88. The documentation shows that
   database scripts for the CommonDB will be copied to the
   directory,
   ?profile_root/dbscripts/CommonDB/oracle/db_name?.
   
   In step 4 on page 90, the process reported a Success status for
   the
   install.
   
   Step 5 on page 90 instructs to ?Ensure that the check box to
   launch the
   First Step Consoles"
   
   The Results section on page 90 indicates the database should be
   started.
   However, there is no reference to build or configure the
   database. We
   would have expected the documentation to indicate that if the
   ?Delay
   execution of database scripts? option was selected in step 3b on
   page
   88, that the database should now be constructed, and that a
   reference to
   those instructions be included at this point. These instructions
   should
   include all databases required to support the selected
   Deployment
   environment. For instance*,
   ?If the ?Delay execution of database scripts? option was
   selected in
   step 3b on page 88, complete the Prerequisites for creating or
   augmenting profiles on page 152.
   Refer to Creating the Common database manually before profile
   creation
   or augmentation on page 158.
   Etc?
