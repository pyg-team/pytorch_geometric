ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During an IBM PureApplication Systems fixpack upgrade there are
   system checks performed to verify the health of the system both
   before and after the upgrade.
   
   One of these checks verifies the state of the high availability
   system. There is an additional check that should be added to
   this code.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The code that was checking for the internal health of the
   system network was not checking for the health of the workload
   data synchronization network.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Corrected the code to check the workload data synchronization
   network in addition to the other internal health checks.
