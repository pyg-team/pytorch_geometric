Title: IBM DFHFC0304 and DFHFC0959 during initialization of CICS on z/VSE - United States

Text:
START STARTUP CSD 8809 0004 564805400 RB0P R411 R111 5648-054 5648054 kixinfo TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You start up your CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA (CICS TS) V1.1.1 region and get a failure when the DFHCSD is being opened. The return code from VSAM indicates an abend has occurred. All of your CICS regions share the same CSD 

SYMPTOM
DFHFC0304 [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/dfhwg409/1.26.31] Dump taken due to a file control OPEN/CLOSE error.

DFHFC0959 [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/dfhwg409/1.26.86] Open or close of file DFHCSD failed. CICS detected an error. Return code - 8809,0004


CAUSE
A program check occurred in ASG-TMON for z/VSE module TVSE094.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Just prior to the DFHFC0304 message being issued in the trace, you can see that the file control OPEN/CLOSE subtask failed. This is running under the initialization task III.


AP 00DE SKP EXIT USER-CODE-FAILED REQ(0405) FIELD-A(01080004 ....) FIELD-B(00904404 ....)

Just prior to this trace entry, there is a GETMAIN for a TACB. When you view the AP domain and locate the III task, you can find the DFHTACB. The registers and PSW point into a TMON module and the interrupt code is 0006 8010


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply fix TU00312 from [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21380855&amp;aid=1]ASG [http://www.asg.com/].
