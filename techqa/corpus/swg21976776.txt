Title: IBM Microsoft Edge Browser support with ECM client products - United States

Text:
Edge; browser TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote describes Microsoft Edge support with ECM client products including IBM Content Navigator, Workplace (Application Engine) and WorkplaceXT. The Microsoft Edge browser represents an evolutionary change from previous Internet Explorer browser editions. One of the more significant changes is the removal of ActiveX controls which among other things allows for Java plugins to enhance browser capabilities. This has varying levels of impact on ECM client products.

The Edge browser can be used with ICN 2.0.3 FP6 and later releases. The following issues and limitations were found during the qualification: 


Daeja ViewONE viewers
- The Daeja ViewONE Professional viewer is Java applet based and will not run with the Edge browser. The only supported Daeja viewer with the Edge Browser is the Daeja ViewONE Virtual viewer.

CM8 viewers
- The CM8 applet viewer is Java applet based and will not run with the Edge browser. Alternatives are to use either Internet Explorer 11 or Firefox.

Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) viewers
- AFP 2 PDF conversion: A PDF document is produced but cannot be viewed because the Adobe Reader plugin does not work with Edge browser since it is an ActiveX plugin which is not supported in the Edge browser. Some web browsers have preferences that enable viewing a PDF in Adobe Reader. For example, you can configure Chrome to use the Adobe Reader via its System Viewer preference. Alternatively, either Internet Explorer 11 or Firefox can be used with the Adobe Reader.
- Line data 2 PDF conversion: The AFP Viewer plugin fails to load in the Edge browser since it is a Java plugin which is not supported in the Edge browser. Alternatives are to use either Internet Explorer 11 or Firefox.
- Line data: The CMOD HTML viewer will not be able to open line data files if ICN is configured to open files by MIME type. This has been fixed in CMOD V10.1.0 Fix Pack 2.

File Tracker
- The File Tracker Java applet will not load since it is a Java plugin which is not supported in the Edge browser. Alternatives are to use either Internet Explorer 11 or Firefox. The ICN team might also look in to alternative implementations of File Tracker that are not Java applet based.

Drag and Drop
- This feature is not offered in the Edge browser so ECM client products can no longer utilize it. ICN will evaluate supporting this feature if it becomes available in a future Edge browser release.

Date Time Picker control
- The Date Time Picker control icon must be double clicked to be activated (normally a single click should activate the control). This issue has been traced to the Dojo toolkit version currently being used with ICN. In a future ICN release, ICN will pick up an updated Dojo toolkit that resolves this issue.


Both Workplace and WorkplaceXT cannot be certified with the Edge browser. There are many significant areas in these products which utilize Java plugins and thus are not able to run. It is recommended that customers using Workplace and/or WorkplaceXT use only the Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 browser in Enterprise Mode.
