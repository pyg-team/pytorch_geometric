QUESTION
 How can you import data from Borland Caliber requirements management into IBM Rational Requirements Composer (RRC)? 

CAUSE
 

Data needs to be imported into RRC as part of migration from Caliber to RRC.


ANSWER
 

You can import data from Caliber to Rational Requirements Composer using a two step process.



 1. Convert your Caliber data to CSV format.
    
    Refer to your Borland documentation for information on how to do this. 
    
    Note: To account for the tab continuation marks you can use a comma as the field separation mark.
    
    
 2. Import the CSV file data into RRC.
    
    Follow the steps documented in Importing CSV files into a requirements project [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/clmhelp/v4r0m3/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.rational.rrm.help.doc/topics/t_import_csv.html&scope=null]
    
    

Note: You should try the migration process out on a test server before you import to your real server (in case there are any data problems). 


The following documentation will help to explain the CSV file format and import process:
