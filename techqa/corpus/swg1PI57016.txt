APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When controlled files were launch from within Rhapsody if they
   are not
   closed before another instance of Rhapsody is open you will
   receive the
   error message in the Rhapsody console log output.
   
   This is the sequence that produced the error:
   
   I had opened these files and then I had to close Rhapsody for
   some problem I was experiencing.
   Neither Rhapsody or I closed the files that were launched from
   within Rhapsody.
   
   When Rhapsody was opened again and the controlled files were
   still open from the previous instance and I received this error
   from inside the Rhapsody client log display:

   it is
   being used by another process.)
