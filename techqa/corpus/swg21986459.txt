Title: IBM ITCAM4Tx : AMC Editor multiple, parallel, simultaneous, concurrent access - United States

Text:
several access at same time 71AMCON-PLAN; 71AMC Editor-GEN TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can 2 users access simultaneously the AMC Editor from the ITM TEP GUI? 

CAUSE
No statement exists for this question in official ITCAM for Transactions product documentation in IBM Knowledge Centre

ANSWER
Yes, nothing prevents user 'A' and user 'B' to login to the TEP GUI and launch Application Management Configuration (AMC) Editor concurrently. Nothing prevents this from happening.

There is no warning in place in AMC Editor GUI to alert one user that another user is currently creating or modifying one particular profile or application for example.

So user A can create a profile A, but later on, or simultaneously, user B can decide to modify same profile A (if he can see it after closing and restarting AMC Editor,) and only the latest update is saved. So some updates can be lost during simultaneous use of the AMC Editor, if modifying the same element.

The best approach is to have a strong separation in business application ownership. Define different teams and AMC Editor users to handle totally different sets of applications. Define naming conventions to distinguish business applications and lines of ownership. This helps avoid profile and application transactions names overlapping. 


This is similar to RPT test script and application naming approach, Refer to the Related URL link below.
