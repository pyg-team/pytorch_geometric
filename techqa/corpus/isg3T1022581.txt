Title: IBM How can I stop cl_query messages in VIOS syslog? - United States

Text:
syslog VIOS VIO cl_query TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are these errors and how can I stop them? i.e.



Jul 27 07:24:13 <VIOS_hostname> caa:info syslog: caa_query.c 

cl_query 2370 515 Query failed: line 2332: The system call does not exist on this system.

Jul 27 07:24:13 <VIOS_hostname> caa:info syslog: caa_query.c 

cl_query 2370 515 Query failed: line 1978: The system call does not exist on this system.


CAUSE
CAA (Cluster Aware AIX) is an infrastructure for cluster service. 
The cl_query messages are CAA informational messages that, by design, are expected even when the VIOS partition is not part of a Shared Storage Pool (SSP).





ANSWER
If the VIOS is not part of an SSP, the informational messages can be ignored.
