APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#act
   ion=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=21879 [https://servrtc.canlab.ibm.com:10100/ccm/web/projects/ServDB#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=21879]
   
   This issue only happens on those batches which have already been
   handled (such as Scan) in the same logon session. For example,
   you scanned a batch, and verify it after the rulerunner work is
   done, no log off.  The reason is that the batch attribute object
   was not cleaned correctly in wTM when releasing batch.
