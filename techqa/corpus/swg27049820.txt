v2230rlsnotes RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 Fixes are available in the 2.2.3 release to address the SWEET32 Birthday attack vulnerability. 

CONTENT
Problem: As described in CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183], OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.


Instances (deployed workloads) and the PureSystems® Manager are vulnerable to this issue and require separate solutions to address the vulnerability. These solutions do not need to be performed at the same time; they are independent.

Resolution: For steps to address the vulnerability for both instances and the PureSystems Manager, see the 2.2.3 product documentation for your system:
