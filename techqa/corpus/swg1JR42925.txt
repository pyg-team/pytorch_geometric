ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Show Instances function in the Cognos Report Viewer widget
   does not filter instances in the wired Instances widget based on
   the filter defined in the Report Viewer widget.  Although not
   all filters can be supported, it is possible in certain use
   cases to have the Instances widget append a Cognos filter to the
   existing filter in the Instances widget to produce the desired
   result (the default behavior of the Instances widget is to
   replace its filter with the Cognos filter).  The "filter append"
   capability needs to be added to the Instances widget to support
   this (along with a way to configure whether "filter replace" or
   "filter append" is used by the widget).
