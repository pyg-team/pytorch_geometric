ABSTRACT
 SupportPac CA1N provides tools to enable CICS Transaction Server V3.1 or V3.2 to publish and retrieve WSDL documents to and from the IBM Service Registry and Repository (WSRR). 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac enables Web Service Description Language (WSDL) files derived from CICS application interfaces, to be automatically published from the z/OS environment to WSRR where they can be accessed by other Web applications. The SupportPac also enables retrieval of WSDL files from WSRR into the z/OS environment where they can be modified and "reverse engineered" into new CICS application high level language (HLL) structures.

Possible Uses
When enabling your CICS application to be a Web service provider, you can use the CICS Web services assistant (DFHLS2WS) provided with CICS TS V3* to generate the WSDL interface from your programs HLL structures. You can then use this SupportPac to automate the publication of this WSDL directly from z/OS to WSRR.

When developing a CICS application that invokes a Web service, you can use this SupportPac to automate the retrieval of the WSDL document from WSRR directly to z/OS. You can then use the CICS Web services assistant (DFHWS2LS) to generate the HLL structures needed to pass data to CICS when invoking the Web service. 

This SupportPac is compatible with CICS TS V3.1 and CICS TS V3.2. If you use CICS TS V4.1, available from June 2009 onwards, then this SupportPac is not required because the functionality it provides is included with this release. See the CICS TS V4.1 on-line Information Center topic Enhancements to the Web services assistant [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.whatsnew.doc/wsrr/dfhe4_overview.html].

Skill Level Required
The SupportPac is aimed at experienced CICS system programmers who are responsible for installing and customizing CICS. Knowledge of basic UNIX commands and the Javaâ„¢ configuration on the target systems are required and familiarity with the Web services support available in CICS TS is useful.

What's New In This Release
This SupportPac has been upgraded to category 3 - IBM Service is available for this SupportPac for as long as the CICS product with which the SupportPac is to be used is generally supported by IBM.

The utility for retrieving a WSDL document from WSRR, DFHSR2WS, has been enhanced to retrieve imported documents stored in WSRR. The document to be retrieved is now identified using name, namespace and version where previously a unique identifier supplied by WSRR was required.

The utility for publishing a WSDL document into WSRR, DFHWS2SR, has been improved to make the setting of user properties more intuitive.
