Title: IBM License Authorization Wizard or other license check methods show earlier expiration date than expected - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I thought my license was supposed to expire on a particular date, but in trying to check my expiration date, the software seems to indicate an expiration date 30 days or a month earlier than I expect. 

SYMPTOM
I see an earlier expiration date when using one of the following methods: 

1) Running the License Authorization Wizard 

2) Running "showlic.exe" from the Licensing directory 

3) If using SPSS Statistics, running the "SHOW LICENSE" command 

4) If using SPSS Modeler, using the menu options "Help" -> "About..." and clicking "Addidional Details"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is due to a 30-day grace period after the license expires. After the expiration dates shown using the methods above, the license enters a 30-day grace period in which the users will receive a warning that the license has expired. The software will still function, however, until 30 days beyond the listed date. The drop-dead date may be seen by running "lsdecode.exe" from the Licensing directory, and in some cases, may be in the comments of the "lservrc" file, also in the Licensing directory. This period between the listed expiration date and the drop-dead date is intended to give ample time to obtain or update license codes before the software stops working.
