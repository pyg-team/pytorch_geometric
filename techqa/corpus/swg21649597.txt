QUESTION
 Is applying WAS SDK service release updates to Tivoli Integrated Portal supported? 

ANSWER
Yes. Tivoli Integrated Portal versions 2.2 and higher supports independent installation of WAS SDK service release updates. In other words, the SDK service release does not have to be applied by way of a TIP fix pack. Follow the installation instructions provided with the Websphere SDK service release to apply the update.

IMPORTANT: Please note that applying Websphere fix packs independently is NOT supported. Additional TIP code is required for WAS FP compatibility. Therefore, WAS fix packs can only be applied by way of a TIP fix pack.
