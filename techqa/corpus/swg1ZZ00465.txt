   Upon building ICO 2.4 environment, unable to open the ICO Admin
   UI, getting error:
   
   OperationalError at /
   
   
   No exception message supplied
   
   Request Method:  GET
   Request URL:  https://<servername>.ibm.com/ [https://<servername>.ibm.com/]
   Django Version:  1.6
   Exception Type:  OperationalError
   Exception Location:
   /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ibm_db_dbi.py
   in connect, line 587
   Python Executable:  /usr/bin/python
   Python Version:  2.6.6
   Python Path:
   
   ['/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/wsgi/../..'
   ,
    '/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard',
    '/usr/lib64/python26.zip',

    '/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg-i
   nfo']
   
   
   ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
   
   The abvove error indicated that horizon coulsd not connect to
   its backend, and it turned out that the dash user password was
   expired, and client had to reset it.
   For this customer, the DB is not on CS1,
   so he had to first change the dash user password on the DB
   server. When the user can connect on the DB server, then next
   step is to follow the ICO instructions to update the dash
   password that will be used when connecting from cs2, etc via the
   following link:
   https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0.1/co [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4KMC_2.4.0.1/co]
   m.ibm.sc
   o.doc_2.4/r_how_to_change_the_various_passwords.html
   
   Therefore, the ICO documentation on the above mentioned link
   needs to be modified to reflect steps for customer environments
   where the DB is not on CS1.
