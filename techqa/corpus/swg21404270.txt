QUESTION
 How to install a fix pack for the embedded WebSphere Application Server provided by Secuirty Directory Server / Tivoli Directory Server? 

CAUSE
Security Directory Server (SDS) / Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) provided embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) to deploy and use with SDS / TDS Web Administration Tool. 
For maintenance purposes it may be necessary to install a fix pack for the eWAS. This tech note applies only to the eWAS. If you are using full WebSphere please refer to WebSphere documentation for the appropriate fix pack install procedure.


ANSWER
This fix pack install procedure only applies to a given eWAS version with the same version's fix packs. For example, installing eWAS fix pack 6.1.0.35 on top of eWAS 6.1.0.13. 

Do not use this procedure to migrate/upgrade from one version of eWAS (6.1) to another version of eWAS (7.0). 

The following table shows different levels of eWAS provided by SDS / TDS: 

IBM Tivoli Directory Server embedded WebSphere Application Server V6.3 7.0.0.7 V6.2 (AIX, HP-UX, Linux and Solaris) 6.1.0.13 V6.2 (Windows) 6.1.0.17 V6.1 (All platforms) 6.1.0.7 Procedure: 1. Identify the eWAS install location. (eWAS_install_location) 

Here is the default install location of eWAS if SDS/TDS provided install shield GUI was used during products installations. 

V6.3.1: 

AIX, Solaris: /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.3.1/appsrv
Linux: /opt/ibm/ldap/V6.3.1/appsrv
Windows: <ISDS_V6.3.1_install_location>\appsrv 

V6.3: 

AIX, Solaris: /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.3/appsrv
Linux: /opt/ibm/ldap/V6.3/appsrv
Windows: <ITDS_V6.3_install_location>\appsrv 

V6.2: 

AIX, HP-UX, Solaris: /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.2/appsrv
Linux: /opt/ibm/ldap/V6.2/appsrv
Windows: <ITDS_V6.2_install_location>\appsrv 

V6.1: 

AIX, HP-UX, Solaris: /opt/IBM/ldap/V6.1/appsrv
Linux: /opt/ibm/ldap/V6.1/appsrv
Windows: <ITDS_V6.1_install_location>\appsrv 

2. Find the eWAS version that is in use and determine the need for fix pack installation: 

# for AIX, HP-UX, Solaris and Linux, open a login shell
cd <eWAS_install_location>/bin
./versionInfo.sh 

# for Windows open a command prompt:
cd <eWAS_install_location>\bin
versionInfo.bat 

Refer the following page for latest recommended eWAS fix pack level to use with an associated SDS / TDS version:
Directory Server Recommended Fixes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=767&uid=swg27009778] 

3. Download eWAS, its associated WASSDK fix packs and the required Update installer: 

Refer the following page for the download information on eWAS and associated SDK fix packs:
embedded WebSphere fix packs (for eWAS provided by Tivoli Directory Server) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=767&uid=swg21404665] 

4. WebSphere Update Installer must be used to install eWAS and WASSDK fix packs. 

Install Update installer if its not installed already.
Installation Instructions: 

 *  Ensure that you have stopped eWAS and related processes. The product to be updated must not be running while you apply maintenance. Download the most recent Update Installer package that matches your platform from the Download package section of this page. Extract the downloaded Update Installer package (zip or tar file) to a temporary directory. Navigate to the UpdateInstaller subdirectory. Use the installation wizard to install the Update Installer by running the install or install.exe executable. On Windows systems, run the command install.exe by double-clicking on the icon, or running it directly from a command prompt. On UNIX-based systems, run the command ./install to launch the Wizard interface. 


Complete details on how to install the Update Installer can be obtained from Installing the Update Installer for WebSphere Software [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_updi_install.html]. 5. Install eWAS and its associated WASSDK fix packs 

 *  Run the backupConfig command to back up configuration files. See Backing up and restoring administrative configurations [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tcfg_svr_conf_backup.html] in the on-line Information Center. Verify required disk space, as described in the readme file for the maintenance package. Stop all application server processes, Stop all Java processes, if necessary. The product might not continue to operate successfully if you attempt to install Fix Pack while embedded WebSphere Application Server related Java processes are still running. Download the eWAS and WASSDK maintenance packages into the update installer maintenance directory:
   <updi_install_root>/maintenance, where <updi_install_root> is the installed location of the Update installer. To install downloaded maintenance packages, refer to instructions found in the Update Installer installation documentation directory:
   <updi_install_root>/docs/readme_updateinstaller.html 
   Additional instructions can be found in the Information Center, Installing Maintenance Packages [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tins_ptfLevels.html]. Installation instructions are summarized and repeated here for convenience only, refer to the preceding official published sources. Open a command shell window and change directories to the <updi_install_root> install location of the Update Installer.
   cd updi_install_root Use the "update" command to install the maintenance package that you downloaded into updi_install_root/maintenance directory. The Update Installer wizard can run in silent mode without graphical user interface and responsefile can be configured for automatic installation. 
   responsefile template is provided in <updi_install_root>\responsefiles\install.txt
   Update this install.txt file to point to eWAS install location and to the maintenance folder. 
   
   Here is Example contents for install.txt for Windows®:
   -W maintenance.package="C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\UpdateInstaller\maintenance"
   -W product.location="C:\Program Files\IBM\LDAP\V6.2\appsrv"
   -W update.type="install"
   
   ./update.bat -silent -options <updi_install_root>\responsefiles\install.txt
   
   For Linux® or UNIX® platforms:
   Example contents for install.txt
   -W maintenance.package="/opt/IBM/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller/maintenance"
   -W product.location="/opt/ibm/ldap/V6.2/appsrv" 
   OR
   -W product.location="/opt/IBM/ldap/V6.1/appsrv" 
   -W update.type="install"
   
   ./update.sh -silent -options <updi_install_root>/responsefiles/install.txt
   Graphical user interface mode is available by running the update command without any parameter: 
   For Windows®:
   update.bat 
   
   For Linux® or UNIX® platforms:
   ./update.sh The logs for update will be available in <appsrv_install_root>/logs/update folder. Refer to the following file for detailed information about using the update command:
   updi_install_root/docs/readme_updateinstaller.html 

6. Verify the eWAS version after fix pack installation: 

# for AIX, HP-UX, Solaris and Linux, open a login shell
cd <eWAS_install_location>/bin
./versionInfo.sh 

# for Windows open a command prompt:
cd <eWAS_install_location>\bin
versionInfo.bat 

7. Proceed to start your eWAS.
