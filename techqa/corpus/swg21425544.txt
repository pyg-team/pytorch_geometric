 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is it possible to migrate decision tables created with JRules 6.7 Rule Studio to JRules 7.0.2 (and later versions like JRules 7.1.X) programmatically? 

ANSWER
Attached is an eclipse plug-in we developed to migrate decision tables from JRules 6.7 to 7.0.2 (and later patch/minor levels). 

To install it, 
1. copy the jar to <JRules_HOME>/eclipse/dropins;
2. restart Rule Studio; 
3. then you will see a new menu "JRules Add-on" between "Run" and "Window". 

To use this plugin, 
1. select "Migrate DT" option from "JRules Add-on" menu;
2. select the rule project that contains the decision tables for migration, click "OK";
3. the decision tables of JRules 6.7 will be migrated to JRules 7.0.2 (and later patch/minor levels) with message "decision tables migrated". 

You can disable the automatic build from "Project" menu if it is memory consuming. 

Note that errors from the migration need to be manually fixed afterwards.

Note: sometimes the plugins cache of eclipse needs to be cleared for a new plugin to be activated. Use the option -clean when starting eclipse to reset the cache.
