APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   The RAS1 logs of the Linux OS Agent at the default ERROR level
   get flooded by messages that should not be printed as they are
   not errors actually.
   This occurs every time data collections for the "Linux CPU" or
   "Linux CPU Averages" attribute groups take place.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This issue affects the 6.30 Linux OS Agent version and following
   fixpacks.
   
   Diagnostics:
   At the frequency defined for situations on the "Linux CPU" or
   "Linux
   CPU Averages" attribute groups these kind of messages can be
   found in
   the RAS1 logs:
   
   (552CCDEF.0002-10:klz05agt.cpp,101,"TakeSample") Retrieving CPU
   statistics.
   (552CCDEF.0003-10:klz05agt.cpp,101,"TakeSample") Retrieving CPU
   statistics.
   (552CCE67.0000-10:klz05agt.cpp,101,"TakeSample") Retrieving CPU
   statistics.
   (552CCE67.0001-10:klz05agt.cpp,101,"TakeSample") Retrieving CPU
   statistics.
   
   Initial Impact:
    Low, RAS1 logs become harder to review

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  RAS1 log of the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS flooded by
   informational messages.
   
   
   The message "Retrieving CPU statistics" gets printed by default
   in the RAS1 logs of the Monitoring Agent for Linux OS every time
   a situation on the "Linux CPU" or the "Linux CPU Averages"
   attribute groups runs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Message now only printed at the Detail RAS1 tracing level.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   | FixPack    | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0006
   | InterimFix | 6.3.0.5-TIV-ITM_LINUX-IF0001
