   VB : Error when we want to have mass on a
   CATPart with a VB macro
   Retrieving the selected component
   The FindObject method is used on the Selection
   object with the string "CATIAProduct" to retrieve
   the selected oProduct (see Product ).
   Compute the inertia
   GetTechnologicalObject method, with the
   string "Inertia", is used to compute the oInertia
   object (see Inertia ) related to the oProduct
   component
   .
   Correct Application
   this VB macro
   Sub CATMain()
   Set oActiveDoc = CATIA.ActiveDocument
   Set oProduct = oActiveDoc.Product
   Dim oInertia As AnyObject
   Set oInertia = oProduct.GetTechnologicalObject
   ("Inertia")
   Dim dMass As Double
   dMass = oInertia.Mass
   msgbox dMass
   End Sub
   .
   only works on a CATProduct or in a CATPart under
   a RootProduct
   .
   you will see in Automation doc that the method
   GetTechnologicalObject("Inertia") is only valid on
   Product
   .
   Retrieving the selected component
   The FindObject method is used on the Selection
   object with the string "CATIAProduct" to retrieve
   the selected oProduct (see Product ).
   .
   Compute the inertia
   GetTechnologicalObject method, with the
   string "Inertia", is used to compute the oInertia
   object (see Inertia ) related to the oProduct
   component
