ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The error message, "The image is too larger for the printed
   page!" that is displayed in the Daeja viewer contains a typo.
   The word "larger" should changed to "large."
   
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   Within Workplace XT, open the image in the viewer. The key to
   reproducing this issue is to ensure that you select the
   preference for printing original size. If you do not select the
   preference, the viewer fits the printout to page and will not
   display the header that has the typo. Selecting the preference
   for printing original size takes the single page TIFF file that
   is like an 11x14 size and tries to print it on a 8x11 page. The
   printed page will now show a header text of "The image is too
   larger for the printed page!"
   
   Actual Results:
   Message has typo.
   
   Expected Results:
   No typo in the message.
