Notes :

#1 : Known issue : If the TCR 2.1 Interim Fix 3 and above is applied before upgrading TCR 2.1 -> TCR 2.1.1, the upgrade would fail with an error “CTGTRI674E The installation was not completed. Check the log files for details. Composite Offering Installer (COI) installer component reported the following step failure: .” in the TCR211InstallMessage00.log file.

The workaround is to manually amend the installer file :-

<TCR 2.1.1 installation file>/TCRInstaller/COI/PackageSteps/TCRCore_Upgrade/META-INF/packagedIU.xml

At the line below (occurs twice in the file) :-
<supersededFixes>TCR-2100-0001 TCR-2100-0002</supersededFixes>

Amend as per below :-
<supersededFixes>TCR-2100-0001 TCR-2100-0002 TCR-2100-0003 TCR-2100-0004 TCR-2100-0005</supersededFixes>

Save and close the file. Proceed with the TCR 2.1.1 installation.

#2 : TIP 2.2.0.7 must be installed on top of TCR 2.1.1 platform.

#3 : TCR Fix Pack 6 must be applied on top of TIP 2.2.0.7.
