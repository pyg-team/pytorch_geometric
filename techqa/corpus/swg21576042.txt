 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I verify that the IBM MantraVM service is disabled? 

ANSWER
Note: This document applies to Netezza Release 5.0.8 and later.
The MantraVM service is enabled and disabled using the mantractl command. Changes made using this command do not affect the current session but will apply to the next reboot. To start and stop the service for the current session, use the service mantra commands.

For example, you can stop the currently running MantraVM service by logging in as root and running the service mantravm stop command. However, to disable the service the next time the system boots, use the following:


 * /nz/mantravm/mantractl disable


To check the status of the service, login as root and use the service mantravm status command: 
 * [root@nzhost1 ~]# service mantravm status
 * 
 * Service status: stopped
 * 
 * mantractl flag: disabled


When you reboot the system after disabling the service, the crm_mon output shows that mantravm has been started. The service mantravm status command, however, correctly shows the service as stopped and the mantractl flag as disabled. 

The crm_mon output is not a correct reflection of MantraVM status. Instead, it is reporting that the HA manager (on the NPS system) made an attempt at starting the service. The actual MantraVM status is reported through the service mantravm status command--if it reports that MantraVM is stopped and disabled, then the underlying service is not up. 

There are a few ways that you can confirm this: 
 * The web interface for the MantraVM should not be accessible. Test it by entering https://<ip_address_of_machine>:8333 
 * You should not see any output when you list mantravm processes with the processes ps –ef|grep mantravm command. 
 * When you list vmware process, ps –ef|grep vmware, you may see some orphaned processes, but not anything that contains vmware-vmx. 

For detailed instructions on enabling or disabling the MantraVM service, refer to Chapter 15 of the IBM Netezza System Administrator’s Guide.
