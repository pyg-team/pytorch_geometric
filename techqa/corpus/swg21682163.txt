QUESTION
 Downloading and installing the Tomcat Apache server in preparation for ITCAM monitoring. 

ANSWER
So you want to download, install and monitor the Apache Tomcat server on your Windows system but don't quite know where to start? 

Well, start here...

A. How to download the Apache Tomcat Server:
v5.5 is here: https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.26/bin/ [https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.26/bin/]
v6.0, v7.0, v8.0 is here: http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html [http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html]- 
- click on the version on the left and download the zip file to your C:\temp directory
(Note: We don't support the actual Apache Tomcat server itself. For help with that, consult one of the many online forums.)

B. How to install the Apache Tomcat Server:
Installing is super easy, there's no GUI to run, there's no silent install, nothing.. Simply extract the zip file to your C:\Program Files(x86)\ dir. (Or any dir you want.) See my example here.. extracted to C:\Program Files(x86) directory. You will find a sub-directory under this directory called apache-tomcat-5.5.26 (or whatever version you install.)

In this example, am using Apache Tomcat v7.0.55. 
Set the JRE_HOME and check your java version. Then run the startup.bat script which will start the Tomcat Server.

(To stop the Apache Tomcat Server, simply run the shutdown.bat script from the same bin dir.)

D. How to login to the Apache Tomcat server admin console:
Bring up your browser, and simply point to your server on port 8080 (default) like this:
http://<hostname_or_IP>:8080

E. How to monitor Apache Tomcat server:
- download and install the latest version of ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.x
- configured the ITCAM agent and DC
- restart your Server, login to your TEPS and observe data
