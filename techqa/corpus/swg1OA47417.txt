PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All IBM Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for Messaging:    *
   *                 WebSphere MQ Monitoring 7.3.0 users.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Start Date and Start Time           *
   *                      attributes of the Current Queue         *
   *                      Manager Status attribute group          *
   *                      returns "n/a" for active queue          *
   *                      managers on z/OS.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The Start Date and Start Time are two new attributes added
   in 7.3.0. The MQ agent code sets values for distributed
   queue managers, but not for queue managers on z/OS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is modified to return data for queue managers on
   z/OS too.
