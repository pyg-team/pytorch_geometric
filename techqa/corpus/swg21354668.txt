Title: IBM Model exported from an incompatible version of Architect - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following error is returned when importing an Architect 7.0 model (.cemx format) into Architect 7.1:

Your attempt to import an exported model file has failed. The file may not have been created by exporting a model (it may be the model itself), or it may have been exported from an incompatible version of Architect.

Please ensure that this file was properly exported from a previous version of Architect 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error message can occur if Series 7 version 2 is referencing a different namespace than 7.0. To resolve this issue:

1. Open the model in Architect 7.0.
2. Select Tools/Prepare for Deployment.
3. Check 'Move model to a namespace on a different authentication source'.
4. Export the model to a .cemx file with the security removed.

You should now be able to import the model in the 7.1 version of the application.
