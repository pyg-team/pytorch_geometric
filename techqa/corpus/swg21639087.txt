Title: IBM Adding a Modeler Server to C&DS resource definition fails - United States

Text:
resource definition modeler server adapter add lax_vm failed missing TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to add a Modeler Server under resource definitions using IBM Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0 results in "Error creating new server definition".


SYMPTOM
The full error is: 
Error creating new server definition
Reason:
;nested exception is:
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect




CAUSE
Modeler adapters for C&DS did not apply successfully.

ENVIRONMENT
Modeler server 15.0 installed on RHEL 5.5

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the Modeler adapters are not successfully applied resource definitions cannot be added. 
The adapters may have appeared to apply successfully and the following steps will help determine if they did in fact apply successfully: 

1. Upon first contact after applying the adapters the Deployment Manager should be prompted that updates are available. Check the spssemgr log to see if updates were pushed down. If there are no updates available you will see something like this: 
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - Archive location is http://host:port/pem/update
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - Searching for updated features at http://host:port/pem/update
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - Local site configured site file: C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Collaboration and Deployment Services\5.0\Deployment Manager
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - C:\Users\<user>\Application Data\IBM\Deployment Manager\5.0 has been added as a configured site
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - Going through the feature list.
WARN com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller - No features to install

2. If the adapters successfully applied the following logs should be in the <repository installation directory>/log directory:
packageManagerTool.log
packageManager_ant.log

3. If the adapters were successfully applied the staging directory should show the modeler base, modeler adapters and scenario plugin packages. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply the adapters using the Lax_VM command. 

1. Check the iengine.log to find the java path used for the appserver. It would look like this: 
appserver_jvm_path=<path>

2. When pointing to this java in the Lax_VM command you will need to point the path down to the bin directory

3. Apply the adapter by adding this parameter 
LAX_VM /data1/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/bin/java
