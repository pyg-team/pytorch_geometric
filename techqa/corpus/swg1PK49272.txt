   !ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.validation 4 0 2007-07-05 12:41:50.245
   !MESSAGE
   *** ERROR ***: Thu Jul 05 12:41:50 CEST 2007

   resource.impl.ResourceSetImpl$1$DiagnosticWrappedException:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The error is happening because the underlying webservice model
   is not being initialized in the validator.  The fix for this
   APAR is to ensure initialization of the model occurs and is
   currently targeted for inclusion into Rational Application
   Developer fixpack v7.0.0.5 and WebSphere Application Server
   Toolkit fixpack v6.1.1.5.  Please refer to the Recommended
   Updates page for WebSphere Application Server Toolkit delivery
