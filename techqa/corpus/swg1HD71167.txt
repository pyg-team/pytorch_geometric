ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CMP : IR FOR TCK_NAME PROBLEM WITH
   PARALLEL INSTALLATION R17/ R18
   .
   1/ When using R18
   - open a command window
   - initialize TCK on RADE R18 with this command :
   E : >%RADE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY_R18%
   \intel_a\code\command\tck_init.bat
   - Launch R17 profile with E : > tck_profile
   V5R17_B17
   - Check TCK_NAME with E : > env | grep
   TCK_NAME
   => TCK_NAME does not exist.
   .
   2/ When using R17
   - open a command window
   - initialize TCK on RADE R17 with this command :
   E : >%RADE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY_R17%
   \intel_a\code\command\tck_init.bat
   - Launch R17 profile with E : > tck_profile
   V5R17_B17
   - Check TCK_NAME with E : > env | grep
   TCK_NAME
   => TCK_NAME exists.
   .
   When launching R17 profile with TCK R18,
   TCK_NAME variable does not exist but the variable
   exists when profile R17 is launched with R17 profile.
   .
   Expected Result : TCK_NAME must exist for both
   R17 or R18 profile.
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   CATIA
   Incident Diagnosis
   TCK_name is not valued in the case of using a
   tck_profile R17 after a tck_init of R18 because
   the SCM Client TCK profile script fails.
   .
   The problem is more generally to use a TCK profile
   generated by an installation of a R17 (or by
   previous release) with TCK init scripts and tools
   delivered by a R18 and next releases.
   .
   Restriction Explanation
   The problems is :
   .
   - TCK_ROOT_PATH does not include the OS
   name until R18. Consequently TCK profiles until
   R17 (including it) need to add each time they use
   TCK_ROOT_PATH the OS name after. So using the
   tck_init delivered with a R18 release with a
   profile generated by a R17 RADE installation will
   have the side effect to add twice the OS name
   where the path in used (typically doing a
   tck_profile).
   .
   Possible By-Pass
   Being given that this profile is generated during
   the GA release installation and cannot be modified
   after by a SP installation and since no client use
   SCM, a bypass is to empty the batch file used by
   the SCM profile.
   .
   o Steps to find the batch to empty
   .
   > %RADE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY_R17%
   \intel_a\code\command\tck_init.bat
   > tck_list V5R17_B17 all
   > Locate the line beginning by SCM_V5R17_B17
   and edit the file adl_profile_cli.bat (the complete
   path appears on the line bellow SCM_V5R17_B17)
   > Edit it and delete its content.
