PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  IMS Connect SSL port has been enhanced to support TLSv1.1
   and TLSv1.2 protocols.
   
   HWSSSL00
   - add support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.

           IMS Connect security support
   
   Add TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 to the bulleted list:
   
     The IMS Connect SSL interface includes support for:
       * SSL Version 2.0
       * SSL Version 3.0
       * Transport Layer Security (TLS) Version 1.0
       * Transport Layer Security (TLS) Version 1.1
       * Transport Layer Security (TLS) Version 1.2

   Change GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS description:
   
     A null-terminated character string that specifies the ciphers
     to enable for SSL V3.0, TLS 1.0, and higher protocols.
   
   Also add a reference to z/OS Cryptographic Services manual
   for a full list of supported cipher specs.
   
   Change GSK_PROTOCOL_SSLV2 Note description:
   
     Note: All SSL V2.0 non-US encryption schemes have been
     decrypted. Therefore, SSL V2.0 should not be enabled unless
     the client does not support SSL V3.0, TLS V1.0, or higher
     protocols.
   
   Add GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_1 and GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_2 after
   GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1.
   
     GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_1
       Used to enable or disable TLS V1.1. Possible values are
       GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_1_ON and GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_1_OFF.
   
     GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_2
       Used to enable or disable TLS V1.2. Possible values are
       GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_2_ON and GSK_PROTOCOL_TLSV1_2_OFF.
