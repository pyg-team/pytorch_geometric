APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Linux OS Agent
   Problem Description:
    In some cases the Linux API function used to retrieve
    the DNS_Name could fail and return NO_DNS_ENTRY.
    COGNOS based reports with TCR require a meaningful
    value for the LAT_DNS_NAME in the Linux_IP_Address_DV
    table to allow populate scripts to run successfully.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   Set following tracing in lz.ini:
     KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:klz27 ALL) (UNIT:kralz27b ALL)
   Refresh the "Network" workspace in TEP portal to drive
   real-time data collection for the LNXIPADDR attribute.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Value "No_DNS_Entry" for
   Linux_IP_Address\DNS_Name attribute prevents
   scripts for Cognos reports to run successfully.
   
   The scripts that populate the Tivoli Data Warehouse with the
   list of managed systems available for running the OS Agents
   Cognos reports are based on the DNS_Name attribute.
   For systems whose IP address is not registered in the DNS sever
   this evaluates to "No_DNS_Entry".
   These systems are excluded from OS Agents Cognos reports.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An environment variable, KLZ_USE_HOSTNAME, is introduced. When
   it set "TRUE" and the DNS server does not have an entry for
   the requested IP address, then the DNS_Name attribute
   is filled with the local machine hostname, as returned by the
   gethostname API.
   
   Install Actions:
   Set the environment variable KLZ_USE_HOSTNAME in the Monitoring
   Agent for Linux OS configuration file.
