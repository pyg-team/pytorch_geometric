 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Power System Firmware is affected by openssl vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVE ID: CVE-2013-4353 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353]

DESCRIPTION: A carefully crafted invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception. A malicious server could use this flaw to crash a connecting client. This issue only affected OpenSSL 1.0.1 versions.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90201 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90201] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)



CVE ID: CVE-2013-6449 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6449]

DESCRIPTION: A flaw in OpenSSL can cause an application using OpenSSL to crash when using TLS version 1.2. This issue only affected OpenSSL 1.0.1 versions.
OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the ssl_get_algorithm2 function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted traffic from a TLS 1.2 client to cause the daemon to crash. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90068 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90068] for the current score 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
