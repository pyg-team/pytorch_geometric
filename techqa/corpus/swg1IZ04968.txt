   oldValue=nodes 0 .CLOB_FIELD_NAME;         item=NewObject();
   item.CLOB_FIELD_NAME=oldValue +  ANY OTHER STRING;
   item.KeyField=<value>;        //to insert new row
   AddDataItem('DataType_Name',item);      //update the existing
   field      nodes 0 .CLOB_FIELD_NAME=oldValue +  another updated
   value ; 6) Check the log file and observe the following error:
