PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading to TRIRIGA 3.4.2 we found that after logging in we cannot change tabs on any forms (Lease Abstract as an example). Instead we see a message indicating: 'This document you requested has moved temporarily' and it shows a very long HTTP... URL. It changed from HTTPS to HTTP.

The same error message is encountered when attempting to run BIRT Reports.




SYMPTOM
This issue did not occur in Internet Explorer 11 but was seen in Firefox and Chrome. Under Firefox and Chrome the issue is not encountered when going to the TRIRIGA application directly. It was only seen in an environment using SSO, SSL and a webserver.


CAUSE
Oracle Weblogic Configuration

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It was found that Tririga 3.4.2 is using Mbean attributes. The issue is resolved by enabling this Weblogic setting. 


MBean Attribute:
WebAppContainerMBean.WeblogicPluginEnabled 

Setting this Attribute in Weblogic resolved the issue.
