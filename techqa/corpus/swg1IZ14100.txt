ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the tivoli_eif probe to receive events, the sending
   application should use a ConectionMode of connection_less.
   
   
   The tivoli_eif probe may not receive events after a restart if
   the connections to the probe are made ( from any eif sender e.g.
   TEC ) using a connection mode of connection_oriented ( co )
   
   i.e.  In the config file of the software sending TEC format
   events to the tivoli_eif probe one of the following is used.
   
   ConnectionMode=co
   ConnectionMode=connection_oriented
   
   If the probe did receive events successfully after a probe
   restart where a connection_oriented mode is used, then the first
   event sent after the restart would still be lost -
   see APAR IY43685 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY43685] for details of this EIF restriction.
   
   To ensure event delivery use ConnectionMode=connection_less.
