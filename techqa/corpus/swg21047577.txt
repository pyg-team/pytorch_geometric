PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You follow the instructions to add EYU9XENF to the TSO authorized command table. But, when you enter the command from ISPF as "TSO EYU9XENF" you receive the following message text:

Authorized command 'EYU9XENF'. Return code = 20 . Reason code = 56 . Invocation error - System error encountered invoking authorized command 'EYU9XENF'. 

SYMPTOM
If the command is invoked from TSO READY outside of ISPF, the following messages are received:

IKJ5664I EYU9XENF ENDED DUE TO ERROR+

If you enter "?" for additional information you receive:

IKJ5664I SYSTEM ABEND CODE 047 REASON CODE 00000000

The Abend047 indicates an unauthorized program issued a restricted SVC .


CAUSE
The message is coming from the TSO/E command service facility IKJEFTSR as part of the TSO command processor. The TSO/E Programming Services manual documents the return and reason codes from IKJEFTSR . The return code 20 and reason code 56 indicate the command is authorized but could not be found in an authorized library.

The library in STEPLIB would lose authorization if a non-authorized library was also in the STEPLIB concatenation. The active STEPLIB can be verified by issuing a TSO LISTALC command to see the library allocation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Correct the TSO STEPLIB library allocation to ensure all concatenated libraries are authorized OR invoke EYU9XENF using a TSO batch job as follows:


//EYU9XENF JOB (nnnn),'userid',CLASS=A,REGION=32M,MSGCLASS=A,
// NOTIFY=userid
//EYU9XENF EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,
// REGION=2M,DYNAMNBR=99
//STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=&HLQ..SEYUAUTH
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *
EYU9XENF
/*
Replace the userid with your TSO userid, nnnn with job account information and &HLQ with the CPSM high level qualifier of the SEYUAUTH dataset.
