ANSWER
In this scenario, it's likely that you need to add your Maximo domain site to the Compatibility View dialog in the Internet Explorer browser. 


1. In Internet Explorer 10 or 11, Go To Tools | Compatibility View Settings
2. Add your Maximo website domain into the "Add this website" field, then press the Add button
3. Click the Close button
4. You will have to restart your browser for it to take effect

For example, my Maximo login URL is similar to:

http://testing.example.ibm.com:9876/maximo/webclient/login/login.jsp [http://testing.example.ibm.com:9876/maximo/webclient/login/login.jsp]

So, the string that I entered in the Compatibility View field in IE is "ibm.com".
