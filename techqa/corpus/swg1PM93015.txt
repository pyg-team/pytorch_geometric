ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ---------------------------------------------
   Users Affected:
   
   Users trying to install ITCAM MS on a Windows 2008 Server where
   ITM 6.3 is already installed
   
   ---------------------------------------------
   Problem Description:
   
   Can't install ITCAM for Application Diagnostics V7.1 Managing
   Server (CZE39EN) on Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit if ITM 6.3 is
   on the same box.
   The installer hangs at 'Your system in being analyzed' panel -->
   'Checking ITM TEPS
   
   This is caused on some machines by a problem with
   registryUtil.exe, which is not returning registry entries in a
   box where ITM 6.3 is installed, but still creating an empty file
   which is causing the hang.
   
   On other machines registryUtil.exe is not creating any file at
   all on a box where ITM 6.3 is installed, which is causing no
   discovery for TEPS but installation can go on.
   
   The MS installation works fine on servers where ITM 6.2.3.x is
   installed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  MS installer was hanging when trying to get the TEPS home from
   windows registry during TEPS validation. This was because
   windows regsitry was not returning the values properly and there
   was no checking for null values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added the checking for null values. Also added another mechanism
   to get TEPShome (using regedit instead of registryutil.exe).
