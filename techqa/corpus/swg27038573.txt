 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The IBM QuickFile Version 1.1.0.1 Release Notes document supplements IBM QuickFile Version 1.1 documentation. 

CONTENT
Release notes are updated with each release of the product and contain last-minute changes and other important product information. Read the document before installation. 


Visit Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] for information about resolved issues and for firmware upgrade files. 

Upgrade considerations 

If you upgrade to QuickFile 1.1 as a virtual appliance, you can take a VM snapshot of the QuickFile server. You can use this snapshot to restore the instance if the firmware upgrade fails and the automatic rollback that occurs after a failed upgrade also fails. For more information, see the VMware documentation. 

Important: If you deployed a version 1.0.0.0 .ova file, you cannot take a VM snapshot because VMware generates an error. 


Operations 

Review the following list to identify information that affects operations:


 * If you define more than 2000 users and you add users to groups when you use the wizard, you might experience performance issues. If performance prevents you from managing groups, use the API calls for this task. See the group API information at developerWorks [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home/wiki/W2b2738f2ab4d_4ec0_b10d_ea5256c858e7/page/IBM%20QuickFile%20Developer%20Documentation] for instructions on using the API calls. 
 * When a user sends a file with the Firefox browser and Accept third party cookies is disabled in the browser privacy settings, the file might go into a paused state. The user receives the following message: After uploading, unexpected response code is received from the server. The response code is 401. 
   
   Complete the following procedure to fix this problem:
   1. From Firefox, click Tools > Options > Privacy
   2. Enable Use custom settings for history. 
   3. Make sure that Accept third-party cookies is checked. 
   
   

 * Unregistered users might be unable to upload a file when they use Internet Explorer version 9 and Gmail by Google. The following error message is displayed: An error has occurred. Please contact your administrator. Details: Unable to get value of the property 'hide': object is null or undefined. 
   
   Complete one of the following tasks to fix the problem: 
   
    * Copy and paste the link from the email into the browser URL bar. 
    * Use a different browser to open the link. 
   
   
 * If SSL is enabled, but the user receives an error that the certificate is not trusted, the user also gets the error, 
   ssl_error_rx_record_too_long
   
   To fix the problem, the user clears the browser cache or browser history. Then, try the connection again.

 * If an administrator configures an SMTP server to enable SSL, the administrator must edit the SSL configuration and add the SMTP server certificate into the truststore. 
 * If you enable LDAP, an LDAP user is not displayed in the user list until the user signs on to QuickFile. 
 * If you modify a task interval and use a CRON notation, the next run interval might be delayed. 


Database Review this list of database considerations before you install the product: 

 * If you have multiple QuickFile servers in a workgroup, all servers must use the same time zone and NTP server.
