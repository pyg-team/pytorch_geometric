 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A fix is available for IBM SONAS, for the OpenSSL security vulnerabilities found in January 2015. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

OpenSSL is used in IBM SONAS for providing communication security by encrypting data being transmitted.


CVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a flaw when handling malicious messages. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99703 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99703] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability and perform unauthorized actions.

CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99709 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99709] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security when using RSA. RSA is one of the algorithms used for secure data transmission. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 1.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99708 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99708] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in one of its functions. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources, resulting in a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99704 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99704] for the current score
