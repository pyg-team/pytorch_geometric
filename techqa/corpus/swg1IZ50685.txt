APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The existing Mobility Client for Nokia devices will not cleanly
   install on the Nokia 5800 due to some installation checks which
   fail with this device.  This problem is only present with the
   Nokia 5800.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Obtain the temporary fix from Level 2 support once it becomes
   available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users installing Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.3  *
   *                 on Nokia S60 5th Edition devices.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The existing Mobility Client for Nokia  *
   *                      devices will not cleanly install on     *
   *                      the Nokia 5th edition devices due to    *
   *                      some installation checks which          *
   *                      fail with these devices.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Only install the version of LMC 6.1.3 with   *
   *                 this fix on Nokia S60 5th Edition devices.   *
   ****************************************************************
   The CommsDat table definitions changed on the 5th edition
   device (specifically the 5800) where the HomeIAP field of the
   VPN_SERVICE record is no longer 0.  The LMC install program
   had a sanity check on this field to ensure that it was always
   zero, which is no longer the case.  This check was removed so
   the install could complete cleanly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A formal fix for this problem will be included in all product
   releases AFTER 6.1.3.  Until that time a temporary fix may be
   obtained from the IBM Lotus Mobile Connect Support Center.
