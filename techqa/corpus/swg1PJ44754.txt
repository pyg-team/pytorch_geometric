APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ACCE cannot create index jobs for documents with titles longer
   than 64 characters.
   
   When trying to index a single document with a long
   DocumentTitle, the following error occurs:
   2017-03-07T09:52:00.045 45F0ABCB ENG  FNRCE0010E - ERROR method
   name: validatePropertyValue principal name: p8iccuser Global
   Transaction: true User Transaction: false Exception Info: The
   value given for a property or list element lies outside the
   permitted range or value set, or exceeds the maximum length
   allowed. The length of the value (65) specified for property
   DescriptiveText exceeds the maximum permitted length (64).
   \ncom.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCE0010E:
   E_BAD_VALUE: The value given for a property or list element lies
   outside the permitted range or value set, or exceeds the maximum
   length allowed. The length of the value (65) specified for
   property DescriptiveText exceeds the maximum permitted length
   (64)
   
   The reason for the failure is that when creating the index job,
   CPE tries to copy the DocumentTitle into the DescriptiveText
   property of the index job, which is limited to 64 characters.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a new document with a DocumentTitle property longer
   than 64 characters.
   2. Access the document in ACCE
   3. Go to Action -> Index -> Index for Content Search
   Result:  No error in ACCE, but the error is displayed in the
   logs, and the requested document is not indexed.
   
   ACCE should truncate the Document Title property to 64
   characters when it is copied into the Descriptive Text property
   of the index job.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround: Create a search for this specific document and
   enable Bulk Actions -> Index for Content Search.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.7-P8CPE-IF003and 5.5.0.0-P8CPE and higher.
   When creating the index job, CPE tries to copy the DocumentTitle
   into the DescriptiveText property of the index job, while
   copying truncated the DescriptiveText more than 64characters.
