Title: IBM Process Inspector can inadvertently delete or terminate more instances than you expect - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 When you use the Process Inspector tab from the Process Admin console, you can search for a set of instances that you then select to terminate or delete. Without APAR JR51909, the text search filter is not incorporated when selecting all instances to terminate or delete. However, the displayed list of instances is based on all filters. 

CONTENT
Not having APAR JR51909 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR51909] might result in the loss of production instance data. Therefore, apply the fix or avoid using the affected Process Inspector functionality. 

JR51909 impacts all versions before IBM Business Process Manager 8.5.6. In 8.5.6 the inspector was redesigned for performance improvements and is not impacted by this problem. 

For interim fix JR51909 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR51909] for IBM BPM V8.0.1.2, V8.0.1.3, V8.5.0.1, and V8.5.5.0, go to Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral]) and search for JR51909:


 1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
    
    
 2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR51909, and click Continue. 

 * 



Impacted Use Case The following steps would lead to the possibility of having extra instances terminated or deleted. 

 1. In the Process Inspector tab of Process Admin console, use the filter by options on the left side to load a particular set of instances and click Refresh. 
    
    
 2. Then use the search bar in the upper left corner to further narrow the list of instances. 
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963283&amp;aid=1]
    
    
 3. Click Select All and choose the option for terminate or delete. 
    
    
 4. Without APAR JR51909, this would lead to the terminate or delete option acting on the list of instances from step 1. With the fix it would properly use the list of instances from step 2. 


The Select All option in Process Inspector should not be used without first applying APAR JR51909. Instead, select each instance individually to act on the instances.  

Recovery Options 

Instances that have been deleted or terminated cannot be recovered. You can no longer run these instances. However, you can perform either of the following options to help recover from accidentally terminated instances: 

 * If you have backed up the environment to allow you to roll back to a previous time frame, then restore your environment and database to a state before you terminated or deleted instances. 
 * Depending on how flexible your app is and how much data you still have for the removed instances, create new business process definition (BPD) instances to replace the removed ones.
