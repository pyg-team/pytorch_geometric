   *                      2- An enhancement to the DROP line      *
   *                      command on panel ADB21S allows the      *
   *                      user to turn off the DROP confirmation  *
   *                      when dropping multiple table spaces.    *
   *                                                              *
   *                      - A new field on the DROP confirmation  *
   *                      panel ADB26DS 'Drop Table Space'        *
   *                      allows the user to turn off subsequent  *
   *                      DROP line commands issued from          *
   *                      panel ADB21S.                           *
   *                                                              *
   *                      - Set the 'Show this panel prior to     *
   *                      each drop' field to NO on panel         *
   *                      ADB26DS to bypass the confirmation      *
   *                      panel ADB26DS for subsequent            *
   *                      DROP line commands.  This field         *
   *                      is only shown when panel ADB26DS        *
   *                      is called from panel ADB21S. Once       *
   *                      set to NO, the setting remains until    *
   *                      exiting ADB21S, at which point it is    *
   *                      reset. The setting is not saved to      *
   *                      the user's profile. A YES value is      *
   *                      only allowed when the 'Display Drop     *
   *                      Impact Report' field is set to NO.      *
   *                      - If the 'Show this panel prior to      *
   *                      each drop' field on panel ADB26DS       *
   *                      is set to NO, and the 'Display Drop     *
   *                      Impact Report' field is YES or          *
   *                      BATCH, DB2 Admin issues message         *
   *                      ADB811E:                                *
   *                                                              *
   *                      ADB811E NO is not valid for this        *
   *                      option because Drop Impact Report is    *
   *                      specified as YES or BATCH.              *

   ****************************************************************
   The following enhancements are delivered:
   
   1 - A new DROP primary command is available on panel
   ADB21S 'Table Spaces' which allows the user to drop
   all the table spaces listed on the panel.
   
   2- An enhancement to the DROP line command on panel
   ADB21S allows the user to turn off the DROP confirmation
   on panel ADB26DSwhen dropping multiple table spaces.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Enhancements delivered.
   
   A new message ADB811E is added:
   
   ADB811E NO is not valid for this option because Drop
   Impact Report is specified as YES or BATCH.
   
   Explanation:
   If you set the 'Show this panel prior to each drop' field to
   NO,  then you can not set the Display Drop Impact Report
   field to YES or BATCH. The settings are not compatible.
   System Action:
   Processing stops.
   User Response:
   Set both the Display Drop Impact Report and Show this
   panel prior to each drop fields to NO.  Alternatively,
   specify YES or blank in the Show this panel prior to each
   drop field and specify YES or BATCH in the Display Drop
   Impact Report field.
