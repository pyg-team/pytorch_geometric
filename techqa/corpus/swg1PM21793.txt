APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TM1 version is 9.5.1.??The issue is that when we access to
   the TM1Web through Firefox web browser to open a cube view and
   try to type numbers or characters in a cell, sometimes the
   typing characters or numbers are not inserted correctly, only
   leaving just one last character or number in a cell.??I attach a
   screen cam.?In this screen cam, we tried to populate 4 cells in
   a cube view by key typing. We typed '12345' in each cell. The
   first three cells worked fine. However, the last cell, as you
   can see, had only '5' after all because 1,2,3,4 characters were
   deleted by subsequent typing.??I don't catch the rule regarding
   in what circumstance this unexpected display occurs, but this
   happens often.??As long as I tested, IE seems okay without this
   bug.??Many users are using Firefox because TM1 Web shows poor
   performance in IE. (Actually the poor performance in IE was also
   main issue on this site and we recommended Firefox for TM1 Web).
   So this can be a critical if this is not resolved.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  use the IE, but the cusotmer do not want this. At the beginning,
    they decided to use the Firefox for the performace.
