APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   IBM i OS agent fails to install on Japanese Katakana/Kanji
   system when user follows install instructions in the
   documentation.  The user documentation does not provide guidance
   that the user may need to change the CCSID of the job before
   running the install or uninstall commands on affected systems.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In a Japanese Katakana/Kanji environment and job CCSID 5026,
   there is a need to configure the codepage for the job execution
   environment by issuing the CHGJOB command before performing the
   RSTLICPGM commands.
   
   For example, this is a Japanese Kanji DBCS environment where the
   install failed:
   
      Primary Language:     2962 (Japanese Kanji DBCS)
      Secondary Language:   none
   
   The job CCSID of the job running the install needs to be
   configured before performing the RSTLICPGM as follows:
   
       CHGJOB CCSID(5035)
   
   followed by the documented steps for RSTLICPGM which are:
   
       RSTLICPGM LICPGM(5724C04) DEV(*SAVF) RSTOBJ(*PGM)
   SAVF(CCCINST/A4520CMA)"
       RSTLICPGM LICPGM(5724C04) DEV(*SAVF) RSTOBJ(*LNG) LANG(2924)
   SAVF(CCCINST/A4520CMA) LNGLIB(5724C04)"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM i OS agent fails to install or uninstall on Japanese
   Katakana/Kanji system in some codepage environments.  The
   install or uninstall program may not work correctly on systems
   where the job CCSID is 5026 or 290, which are typical Japanese
   Katakana/Kanji systems.  Other languages (job CCSID's) that may
   be affected are:  Simplified Chinese (935, 1388), Traditional
   Chinese (937), or Korean (933).
   
   The CCSID of the job that runs the install or uninstall program
   determines if this problem occurs.  CCSID's where the lowercase
   a-z are not in the same location as CCSID 37 will cause the
   install or uninstall to fail.  The job CCSID can be changed to
   CCSID 37 before running the install or uninstall command to
   avoid this problem.
   
   Having English installed or not installed as a secondary
   language does not affect this problem.
   
   Symptoms of the failed install or uninstall include:  messge id
   CPF3D95, messages in the job log that indicate "object not
   found", or an IFS directory that has incorrect characters in the
   path name.
   
   The user documentation does not provide guidance that the user
   may need to change the CCSID of the job before running the
   install or uninstall commands on affected systems.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The install and uninstall programs have been changed
   so that the job will be changed to CCSID 37.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The following steps can be used to change the job CCSID before
   running the install or uninstall commands and then restore the
   original job CCSID after the install or uninstall commands are
   complete.
   
   1. Note the current job CCSID and default CCSID using DSPJOB,
   option 2. For example:
   Coded character set identifier . . . . . : xxxx
   Default coded character set identifier . : yyyy
   
   2. Change the job CCSID.
   CHGJOB CCSID(37)
   
   3. Run the install / uninstall command.
   
   4. Restore the original CCSID with the following commands. It is
   important to change to the default job CCSID before
   changing to the original job CCSID so that the IGC job attribute
   is properly reset.
   CHGJOB CCSID(yyyy)
   CHGJOB CCSID(xxxx)
