Title: IBM Unable to install silently WebSphere eXtreme Scale on an existing WebSphere Application Server installation - United States

Text:
install silent WXS WAS ODM extreme scale event TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You get the error "The installation package 'IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale for WebSphere Application Server V8' requires components supplied by other packages" when you run the WebSphere eXtreme Scale silent install script that is provided by Operational Decision Manager on an existing WAS installation. 

SYMPTOM
The following error displays when running the silent install of WebSphere eXtreme Scale (WXS) provided by Operational Decision Manager (ODM) on an existing WebSphere Application Server (WAS) installation: 

> imcl input WXS_Silent.xml -acceptLicense 

ERROR: The installation package 'IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale for WebSphere Application Server V8' requires components supplied by other packages. 

The required components might be supplied by the following installation packages: 
Package: WebSphere Application Server V8.5 
Package: WebSphere Application Server V8


CAUSE
The 'profile' property to be set in 'WXS_Silent.xml' in place of '!WXS_PROFILE_ID!' must be the name of WebSphere Application Server package already installed and that you want to augment with eXtreme Scale:

<offering id='com.ibm.websphere.WXS.was8.v86' version='8.6.0.20121115_1941' profile='!WXS_PROFILE_ID!' features='xs.core.feature,xs.client.feature,xs.liberty.feature,xs.server.feature,xs.console.feature' installFixes='none'/>

If you have installed WAS using the packages and silent install script provided by ODM, you will set that value to the same value set for in the WAS script ('!WAS_PROFILE_ID!'). 

But if you are installing WXS on an existing WAS installation, you will need to use the value set by IM for that existing WAS package.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the correct IBM Installation Manager (IM) "Installed Package" name or "Package Group Name" as the WAS profile in the WXS_Silent.xml (to replace !WXS_PROFILE_ID!). 

 

You can find this name in IM under "File > View Installed Packages" in the first column "Installed Packages". It is also referred to as "Package Group Name" in other sections of IM. 

For example: 'IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V8.5'. 

 

Also that name can be found in the IM 'installed.xml' generated when exporting the IM data with "Help > Export Data for Problem Analysis". It is the ID attribute of the location tag, for example: 

 * 
 * <location 
 * id='IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V8.5'
 * kind='product' path='C:\Program Files\IBM\ODM85\WAS\AppServer'>
