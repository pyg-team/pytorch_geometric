   Adding a database user registry on i5/OS
   Migrating the security configuration
   Adding a database user registry on i5/OS
   Adding a database user registry on HP-UX
   Adding a database user registry on AIX
   Adding a database user registry on Solaris
   Adding a database user registry on HP-UX
   Adding a database user registry on Windows
   Adding a database user registry on Linux
   Adding a database user registry on Solaris
   Configuring a property extension database on i5/OS
   Adding a database user registry on Linux
   Adding a database user registry on Windows

   Configuring a property extension database on Linux
   Configuring a property extension database on Solaris
   Configuring a property extension database on Windows
   Configuring a property extension database on HP-UX
   Configuring a property extension database on AIX
   
   
   Have this step:
   If the WebSphere Application Server installed PK66195 and you
   installed WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0, perform the following
   steps:
   
   ...
   
   If the WebSphere Application Server did not install PK66195,
   copy the above library files into the appserver/lib directory
   prior to starting the server.
   
   That needs the following corrected as follows:
   If the WebSphere Application Server did not install PK66195,
   copy the above library files into the appserver/lib directory.
   Then stop and restart server1 and WebSphere_Portal servers to
   load the library files.
   
   Because failure to load the library files will cause subsequent
   tasks to complete incorrectly.
