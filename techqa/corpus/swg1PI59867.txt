APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You will see failures in application processes which call
   generic processes when you modify properties on a generic
   process. The error will involve unresolved components.  You will
   also see the failures when you are importing/updating an
   existing application process and the import changes property
   names.
   
   For example,
   Setup Steps:
   For a generic process which calls a custom plug-in step that has
   input properties:
   Plug-in property 1 default value = ${p:process.property.1}.
   The generic process has in process property of:
   ${p:process.property.1} with a
   default value of ${p:applicationTemplate.property.1}
   With an application template process that calls that generic
   process, using the 'Run generic process' step.  That process has
   in Application process property of
   ${p:applicationTemplate.property.1} with value of "some value".
   All of this works correctly.
   
   
   Breaking Steps:
   
   Update the plug-in step to take in a new property. Plug-in
   property 2 default value = ${p:process.property.2}. Upload the
   plug-in. In the generic process add a new Process property.
   ${p:process.property.2} with a default value of
   ${p:applicationTemplate.property.2}. Go to the application
   template process and add a new application process property
   ${p:applicationTemplate.property.2} with value of "new value".
   If you do these steps and run the app process again it should
   fail saying that it can't resolve the property
   "${p:process.property.2}".
   
   
   Example 2:
   
       In a new instance of UCD recreate the generic process and
   application template process in the state of setup.  After you
   make the changes to the generic process that are included in the
   'Breaking Steps', export the process and put in the plug-in that
   has the plugin.xml step. Import that plugin into the new UCD
   instance you just set up.  Add the application process property.
   ${p:applicationTemplate.property.2} with value of "new value".
   Try and run the application, you should get the same error you
   got above.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround:
   
   Go the application process open the step, press OK, and then
   save the application process.
