For complete details please reference the Announcement Letters for WebSphere Distributed [https://ibm.co/2w6thhF] and z/OS [https://ibm.co/2vsuUJz] environments.
IBM recommends moving your existing applications and workloads to later versions of WebSphere and Java runtime to avoid potential end of support situations affecting your core business applications. WAS V8.5.5 and V9.0 are available today at no additional charge to WAS clients with active subscription and support. 

Moving your applications to newer versions of WebSphere requires planning and preparation. The following resources and programs will help you plan and implement a successful upgrade.
