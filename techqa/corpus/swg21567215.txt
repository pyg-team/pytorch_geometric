QUESTION
 Where can I find the Datastage DB2 Connector Stage documentation?


ANSWER
The DB2 Connector stage documentation can be found in the IBM Information Server (IIS) Information Center (InfoCenter) after installing Information Server 8.1 Fixpack 1 (FP1) (or higher). 

NOTE: IS 8.1 FP1 does additionally require APAR JR36509 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=14&uid=swg1JR36509] to be applied to ensure latest DB2 Connector stage documentation. This patch can be downloaded from this link. [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm/Information+Management&product=ibm/Information+Management/IBM+InfoSphere+Information+Server&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=is8101_doc_JR36509_server_client_multi&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc] 

To open the InfoCenter, log into any IIS client (DS Administrator, DS Designer, etc) and press F1 to open the InfoCenter. After the InfoCenter opens, expand the following sections to find the documentation for the DB2 Connector Stage: 

Connecting to external sources -> Data sources -> IBM DB2 database -> IBM DB2 connector

The DB2 Connector stage documentation can also be accessed from within the DB2 Connector stage properties dialog by selecting a property and clicking the Help button in the lower-left hand corner of the dialog. This will launch context-sensitive help. Help topics for the Usage and Load control properties can only be accessed this way. These help topics are not visible in the topic index within the InfoCenter.
