[5/1/13 2:06:52:547 GMT-07:00] 000000c7 MethodDelegat A SECJ0055E: Authentication failed for tw_admin. The user id or password might have been entered incorrectly or misspelled. The user id might not exist, the account could have expired or disabled. The password might have expired.



CAUSE
One common reason for this issue is an expired or improperly changed password for the tw_admin account. This account is used to execute system activities in the stock product. An incorrect password for the tw_admin account across all the configuration settings causes an impossibility to execute all System tasks as well as UCAs.

By default, stock accounts, including tw_admin, are stored in the Process Center or Process Server database (internal security provider). If these accounts are moved to an external security provider, such as a corporate LDAP server, review the account expiration settings.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete one of the following tasks: 

 * If the tw_admin account is defined in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, verify whether the account is expired or disabled. Enable the account, if necessary.
   
   
 * If you know that the password has been changed using the Process Admin Console recently, restore the previous password using Process Admin Console. Then, restart the environment.
   
   
 * If you need to change the password of tw_admin account see the process that is described in the Changing the default user passwords on IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21448216] document.
