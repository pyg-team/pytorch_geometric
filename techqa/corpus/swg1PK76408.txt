   ****************************************************************
   The description of the Enable caching field that is contained
   in the "Caching action settings" topic needs to be rewritten
   to make the description more meaningful.
   
   A description of the Limit URL pattern field needs to be added
   to the topic "Rewrite action settings."
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The description of the Enable caching field, that is contained
   in the "Caching action settings" topic, will be updated to read:
   
   Enable caching
   
   Specifies whether or not to enable caching for the proxy
   server.
   
   You must enable caching before you can provide a value for
   Default expiration or Last modified factor. If a value is
   specified for Last modified factor, then the value for Default
   expiration is not used.
   
   Avoid trouble: If caching is disabled, the proxy server does
   not cache the uniform resource identifier (URI) that is
   associated with the proxy rule expression. For example, if a
   request comes in and it matches the rule expression for a
   proxy virtual host, then the actions associated with the rule
   expression, including the caching action, are executed. The
   rule expression may or may not include an explicit URI or
   URI group. If a request matches a rule expression with an
   action of caching disabled, the proxy server does not cache
   the response for that request.
   
   The following description of the Limit URL pattern field will
   be added to the topic "Rewrite action settings:"
   
   Limit URL pattern
   
   Specifies to match a request URL to rewrite in the response
   message. Limiting the URL pattern prevents the proxy server
   from rewriting all URL patterns in the response message of a
   certain page, allowing the proxy server to skip parsing
   responses for other pages if there are multiple pages. This
   setting is only valid when the action type is absolute URL
   response or relative URL response.
