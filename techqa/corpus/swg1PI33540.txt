APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description:
   
   IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) version 5.0.1 has a
   regression where any CR newline in the Test Case Design section
   editor will translate into a new step in the generated test
   script.
   
   In the earlier version RQM 3.x, a piece of text pasted into the
   test case design section generates into a test script with one
   step containing that text.
   
   In RQM version 3.x using the combination of "Shift+Enter"  on
   the keyboard for a new line in the Test Case Design section will
   generate into an additional test script step.
   Just a CR newline would not trigger the generation of a new
   step.
   
   
   Expected results:
   
   In version 5.0.1 the expected outcome is described in the
   Knowledge Center help topic &#65411;  Creating manual test scripts from
   the test case design&#65411;   at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.1/com.i
   bm.rational.test.qm.doc/topics/t_create_testscript_auto.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.1/com.ibm.rational.test.qm.doc/topics/t_create_testscript_auto.html] and
   states:
   
   " 1.    Open the test case to add a test script to.
     2.    Click the Test Case Design section.
     3.    To begin typing statements, click Add Content.
     4.    Enter each step on a new line, which is separated by a
   line break.
     Groups of steps that are not separated by line breaks are
   included in the same step."
   
   Actual result:
   
   In version 5.0.1 we see a new test script step for every line in
   the Test Case Design.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Once the test script is generated a user can manually change the
   information by cutting and pasting it to the first step.

   * In the Test Case design section type the follow:             *
