APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using Datacap navigator to scan and upload
   documents.  A test batch contains about 10 pages totaling
   approximately 20-30MB of data.
   Uploading this batch through navigator takes approx. one to one
   and half minutes to complete.
   
   If the same pages are uploaded through tmweb, it takes about 10
   seconds, so navigator is about 5x-6x slower.
   
   We ran several tests to try and narrow down where the slowness
   is occurring.
   
   First, they ran the client browser on teh WebSphere server
   itself to eliminate any possible network delay due to sending
   the images from the client station to the WAS server.   There
   was only about a 2 second difference in total time taken when
   the browser was on the WAS server vs. on a remote client station
   (see files client_on_was_server.txt and remote_client.txt).  So,
   network delay is not significant.
   
   We also ran the wtmsample program from developerworks to test
   the wTM component. The wtmsample program, run from the WAS
   server, was able to upload the same set of images in about 10
   seconds (see file wtmsample_upload.txt).  So, wTM does not seem
   to be the source of the delay either.
   
   So, it seems to be some sort of processing on the WAS server
   itself that is responsible for the delay seen.
