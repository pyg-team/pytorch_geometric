3. Put IA9C/jpluginx/GetEnvNode.jar file in the directory.
4. Start the broker to implement the change and to ensure that the existence of the new file is detected.

CAUTION: Do not put the GetEnvNode.jar file in the WebSphere Message Broker installation directory, as it could be overwritten by the broker.
