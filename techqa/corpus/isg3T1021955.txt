Title: IBM Security Bulletin: PowerKVM D-Bus vulnerabilities: Multiple CVEs - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 PowerKVM has multiple D-Bus vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-7824 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7824]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an incomplete fix related to an error in the dbus-daemon. By sending an excessive number of file descriptors, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the dbus-daemon to reach the RLIMIT_NOFILE and cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/98576 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/98576] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3635 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3635]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the dbus-daemon. By sending an overly long D-Bus message, a local attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the dbus-daemon to crash. 
CVSS Base Score: 4.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96006 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96006] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3636 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3636]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the dbus-daemon. By sending an excessive number of file descriptors, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the dbus-daemon to reach the RLIMIT_NOFILE and cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96007 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96007] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3637 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3637]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to the attachment of a file descriptor to a D-bus message. By sending a specially-crafted message using the dbus-daemon, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to kill processes and cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96008 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96008] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3639 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3639]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to incomplete connections. By making repeated connection attempts, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96010 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96010] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3638 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3638]
DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to method call replies. By sending the maximum number of parallel method calls, a local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. 
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96009 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96009] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

Effective CVSS Score: 4.60
