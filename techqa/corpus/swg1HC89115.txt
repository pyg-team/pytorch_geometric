ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Large assembly model, which size is above 300 Mbyte, is used
   as usual in F&A account.
   In this case, we have met run-time error in the process of
   generating drawing with CATIA V5R7 SP4.
   This is also happened with increased real memory - 3Gbyte.
   We have tested it in the two types H/W - IBM Intellistation
   and HP. And, we can not open about 280 Mbyte in Win 2000.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   WHEN GENERATING DRAW WITH LARGE ASSEY, SYSTEM I
   S DOWN.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   An enhancement is now available on R10 and
   R9 SP3 for view generation from big assembly.
   It uses the graphical representation of 3D geometry
   (.cgr files), see the documentation
   Generative Drafting / What's new / Generating CGR Views
   to inquire about use and limitation.
   .
   When working on R9, you have to export a specific environment
   variable to activate this functionality:
   export DrwDevCGR=1
   .
   With this enhancement, I could create some views from your
   assembly (SS1700ASS.CATProduct + AFA1-ass.CATProduct)
   (front view xz and front view xy).
   This new method uses less memory than the existing method.
