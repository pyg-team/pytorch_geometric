PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When accessing IBM FileNet IDM Web Services 4.0.3 FP1 through Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, users were seeing the "Netscape Communicator" error message. 

SYMPTOM
 "Sorry, the IDM Web Services 4.x application is not currently compatible with Netscape Communicator. Contact your System Administrator for assistance."


CAUSE
Internet Explorer 11 is officially supported with IDM Web Services FP 5 or higher. In addition, IDM 4.0.3 Web Services and Open Client do not work with IE 64-bit edition; hence, users of 64-bit client machines will have to work with the 32-bit version IE. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Applying IDM Web Services 4.0.3 FP5, and Interim Fix pack 1012 resolved the error message "Sorry, the IDM Web Services 4.x application is not currently compatible with Netscape Communicator. Contact your System Administrator for assistance."
