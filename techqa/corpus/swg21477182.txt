Title: IBM Capabilities and limitations of the SPSS/Statistics Student Version - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What are the capabilities and limitations of the IBM SPSS Statistics Student and Graduate Pack software packages? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The SPSS Student Version allows for up to 50 variables and 1,500 cases.

The data dropdown menu in the Student Version does not contain the Restructure, Merge Files or Aggregate Options. This version is unable to read IBM SPSS Statistics command syntax, and scripting and automation capabilities are unavailable. Add-on modules cannot be used with this package. 

If you require use of one of these options you should purchase the IBM SPSS Statistics Graduate Pack. 

The SPSS Statistics Graduate Pack is not limited in the number or cases or variables that can be used. Standard GradPack includes the following modules: 

- Statistics Base 

- Advanced Statistics 

- Regression.
