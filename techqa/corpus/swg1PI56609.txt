   ****************************************************************
   When an ODBM application runs with multiple threads, a deadlock
   
   condition may occur when more than one thread attempts to access
   
   the same database resource simultaneously.
   
   
   
   In the reported scenario, a large number of transactions
   
   accessing the same database resource are sent to ODBM.  Each
   of these transactions results in an ODBM thread, so there are
   
   multiple units of work on multiple ODBM threads contending for
   
   the same resource.  Each thread performs a number of calls that
   
   query or update the database, followed by a syncpoint call to
   
   commit the changes to the database.
   
   
   
   If the external client application is running a large enough
   
   number of threads, it is possible for all available ODBM threads
   
   to be consumed by units of work that are waiting for the
   
   database lock.  If at this time, the unit of work that holds the
   
   database lock is waiting for a thread, we have a deadlock
   
   situation -- the UOW holding the lock cannot commit until a
   
   thread becomes available, but no thread will become available
   
   until one of the UOWs obtains the lock so it can complete its
   
   work.  This deadlock is not resolved, resulting in hung threads.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new TCB queue is defined for ODBM to be used specifically for
   syncpoint calls.  This prevents the deadlock situation by
   ensuring that syncpoint and non-syncpoint calls are not
   contending for the same ODBM threads.  The work that is
   currently handled by the existing ODBR TCB queue will now be
   split between the ODBR queue and a new TCB queue, ODBC.  ODBC
   handles syncpoint requests and ODBR handles non-syncpoint
   requests.
   
   Module changes
   --------------
   
   Define a new TCB type, ODBC
   ---------------------------
   CSLDBTCI -- Define the new ODBC TCB.
   
   CSLDBAWI -- Define the AWE server that will service
   the new TCB queue.
   
   CSLDAWXI -- Define function codes for the new TCB queue.
   
   CSLDCODE -- Add the new request codes for the ODBC TCB.
   
   CSLDTRC  -- Define a new function code and trace type for ODBC
   TCB.
   
   CSLDST1  -- Define a new trace code for the ODBC TCB type.
   
   CSLDANCH -- Define new fields and constants to manage the
   thread counts for the ODBC TCB queue.
   
   CSLDBAW0 -- Define the AWE server for the new ODBC queue.
   
   CSLDBTC0 -- Add a new type definition for the ODBC TCB.
   
   CSLDXIN0 -- Add the ODBC TCB type to the ODBM SCI Input Exit
   function code table.
   
   
   Process database calls using the new TCB type
   ---------------------------------------------
   CSLDBR00 -- Process AWEs coming from the new ODBC queue.
   The processing performed by this module is nearly identical
   for the ODBC and ODBR queues.  The differences are that for
   ODBC AWEs, the ODBC queue count is decremented instead of ODBR,
   and the new function code is reflected in the trace entry
   written to the ODBM trace table.
   
   CSLDBR10 -- Process AWEs with the new function code.  Within
   this module, ODBC and ODBR AWEs are processed identically.
   
   CSLDDM00 -- Route syncpoint-type requests to the ODBC TCB queue
   instead of the ODBR TCB queue.  The following code points are
   routed to the ODBC queue.  All others are routed to the
   existing ODBR queue.
   - Commit
   - Rollback
   - DPSB function
   - Syncpoint request only for the following subcodes:
     - Prepare
     - Commit
     - Begin new UOW request
     - End association with UOW
   
   CSLDREG0 -- Route the DPSB calls that are generated internally
   following a deregistration request to the ODBC queue.
   
   
   Initialization, termination, recompiles
   ---------------------------------------
   CSLDIN00 -- Initialize the ODBM anchor block with the number of
   ODBC TCBs attached to the new queue by BPE.
   
   CSLDSP00 -- Clean up terminating ODBC TCBs.
   
   CSLDIT00 -- Recompile for CSLDANCH changes.
