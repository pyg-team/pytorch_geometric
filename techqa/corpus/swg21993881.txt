QUESTION
 Users are unable to move forward in the test because the same message continues popping up. 

ANSWER
User may call in stating the test keeps saying â€œRepeat Question or Next Question, and that they cannot move forward. If you click anywhere on the test page that is not correct it will bring up the "repeat question/next question" option right away. Users need to make sure they believe they have completed the question properly, finishing all steps before hitting next question. If they do not believe that they have completed the question, click repeat and try again. You will not be able to scroll up and down or open drop down menus that don't directly correlate to the question.
