PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data to collect in the case of a WebGUI fix pack installer failing to complete successfully. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Items to collect: 

1. the response file from the install image (typically called sample_response.txt or sampleFP_response.txt)

2. the output of running listIU.sh from the DE (Deployment Engine) of the installation
- for installations installed as root this will be /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/listIU.sh
- for non-root installations this will be $HOME/.acsi_<hostname>/bin/listIU.sh where $HOME refers to the user used to install

3. tar of the DE logs
- for root installations this is /usr/ibm/common/acsi/logs/*
- for non-root installations this is $HOME/.acsi_<username>/logs/*

4. tar of the TIP logs
tar cfv tiplogs.tar tipv2/logs/*

5. tar of the TIPProfile logs from ../profiles/TIPProfile/logs/*

6. the installer log located directly under $HOME for a non-root user or in the / directory for root and typically called IBM_Tivoli_Netcool_OMNIbus_Web_GUI_<fpnumber>_Install-00.log

7. tar of WebGUI package installer logs
tar cfv installerlogs.tar netcool/omnibus_webgui/_uninst/OMNIbusWebGUIFP<n>/*
