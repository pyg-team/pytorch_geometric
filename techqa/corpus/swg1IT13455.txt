APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Intermittent timeouts may occur to the IMS server.
   
   
   [0x80e006bf][network][error] mpgw tid(13816541)[10.1.0.1]: A
   timeout occurred when reading or writing through the default
   identity processor.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add SSL Proxy to connect directly to the IMS server instead of
   dpimsssl://.  For example, if the original config is:
   
   MPGW(dpimssl://)  --> (SSL) IMS Connect
   
   change it to:
   
   MPGW(non-SSL)  --> SSL proxy --> (SSL) IMS Connect
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are all customers using IMS Connect.
   
   
   Transactions with the IMS Connect service might hang for
   certain response sizes, be it via SSL or without.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.14 and 7.1.0.11
