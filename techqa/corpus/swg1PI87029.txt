APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WAS ND 8.5.5.12 on Windows
   
   Changes made to an ODR port (PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS /
   PROXY_HTTPS_ADDRESS), such as modifying the port value or
   disabling transport altogether, are not reflected in the
   High
   Availability Plugin. The resulting plugin-cfg.xml still
   shows
   the previous configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1) Make desired change to the odr port.
   2) Bounce the odr so that the associated transport chain is
   forced to reload.
   3) Bounce the dmgr - at that point HA plugin-cfg.xml
   regenerates correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server WAS ND using On Demand Routers.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Disabling PROXY_HTTP(S)_ADDRESS         *
   *                      transports of On Demand Routers is not  *
   *                      reflected in the plugin-cfg.xml.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Disabling PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS or PROXY_HTTPS_ADDRESS transports
   of On Demand Routers is not reflected in the High Availability
   Generated plugin-cfg.xml when the service has been configured to
   include stopped ODRs i.e. cell custom property
   'ODCPluginCfgOdrIncludeStopped_<definitionID>' with a value of
   'true'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The High Availability plugin-cfg.xml Generator has been altered
   to properly handle disablement of PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS or
   PROXY_HTTPS_ADDRESS transports of On Demand Routers.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   packs 8.5.5.13 and 9.0.0.6.  Please refer to the Recommended
   Updates page for delivery information:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  After disabling PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS or PROXY_HTTPS_ADDRESS
   transports of an On Demand Router (ODR), stop the ODR processes,
   restart the Deployment Manager, and then start the ODRs.
