APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a new snapshot is installed (deployed) to a connected
   Process Server, some snapshot-specific runtime state is copied
   from the source snapshots to the new snapshot. This includes
   Environment Variables, Exposed Process Values (EPVs) and
   Participant Group membership. A similar process occurs when
   using the Sync Settings feature to synchronize EPV values
   between snapshots.
   
   For EPVs, only values with an Effective Time that occur in
   the future are migrated to the target snapshot. This may cause
   problems for tasks that are not using the "In-Progress Tasks
   Use New Values" feature, as the value seen by the task may
   change to the default value in the new snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   IBM BPM administrators
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY: (one line description)
   During the installation of a snapshot, Exposed Process Values
   (EPVs) are not migrated correctly.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION: (Also, Please identify the root
   cause and any possible steps that could have been taken in order
   to prevent this APAR. )
   When a new snapshot is installed to an online process server,
   the snapshot-specific runtime state is copied from the source
   snapshots to the new snapshot. This state includes environment
   variables, EPVs, and Participant Group membership information.
   This issue also arises when administrators use the Process Admin
   Console to synchronize snapshots.
   
   Only EPVs with an effective time that occurs in the future are
   migrated to the target snapshot, which might cause problems for
   tasks that are not configured to use the "In-Progress Tasks Use
   New Values" feature. These problems occur because the value
   might change from the current value (either default or
   explicitly set value) that is defined in the source snapshot to
   the default in the new snapshot.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix for IBM BPM V7.5.1.1 merges all EPVs into the target
   snapshot so that tasks that use the "In-Progress Tasks Use New
   Values" feature continue to work as intended.
