 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running DataStage job with BW Extract stage receive the following error:

Message: main_program: Fatal Error: Fatal: Shared library (dsbwextr.so) 
failed to load: errno = (2), system message = ( 0509-022 Cannot load module /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSComponents/bin/dsbwextr.so
0509-150 Dependent module librfccm.o could not be loaded.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the latest version of the SAP RFC library on your client and server. 

Due to the export restrictions we are unable to ship platform-specific thread-safe SAP RFC library called LIBRFCCM.O version 4.6D or later.Contact your SAP Administrator to obtain this library from SAP Service Marketplace Web site. 

 

On Unix the suffix for this RFC library may vary slightly according to your platform: 

AIX - librfccm.o 

Solaris - librfccm.so 

Linux - librfccm.so 

HP-UX platforms require the SAP dsrlib.sl library in addition to the RFC library. Copy both the RFC library and the dsrlib.sl library from the SAP Service Marketplace to the ../IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSComponents/lib directory on the computer where DataStage server is installed. 

You must ensure that this library is installed in the 'DSComponents/lib' directory under the Information Server install directory, e.g. /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSComponents/lib 

On Windows: 

The librfc32.dll should be installed in your Windows system32 directory.
