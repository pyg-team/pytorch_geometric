QUESTION
 This document describes how to increase the log load to avoid running out of extents for the catalog table space SYSLGRNGX. 

ANSWER
Symptom: You run out of extents for catalog table space SYSLGRNGX. The messages received are DSNP007i rc00d70014 type 220. How can you get more extents without taking a DB2 outage? You have the space. 
Cause: You have reached 123 extents on SYSLGRNX (251 extents on z/OS) and suspect that a batch job doing mass updates might have spiked the tablespace. The log load may be too low since you see several checkpoints per second during heavy night time batch processing. This behaviour would cause pseudo CLOSEs more often than in the day time. Pseudo CLOSE changes unused data sets to READ ONLY and terminates the open SYSLGRNX row for that data set. A higher log load would mean fewer checkpoints, and fewer data sets being pseudo closed, and hence, fewer SYSLGRNX rows. 

Action: Use Modify Utility and the logload parameter to keep SYSLGRNGX from growing too large in the future. 

 * Unload SYSLGRNX with DFDSS or DSN1COPY. 
 * Increase the primary allocation to fit all data within one primary extent. 
 * Reload SYSLGRNX (again with DFDSS or DSN1COPY). 


Normal production jobs do regular MODIFY DELETEs to get rid of old SYSCOPY records and old SYSLGRNX records.
