Title: IBM Data Studio can not save "Offline Automatic Maintenance" on a specific environment - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We upgraded from DB2 Workgroup Server Edition (WSE) V10.1 GA to DB2 WSE V10.1 FP5. 
Then installed Data Studio 4.1.1.0 (DS411) on Windows 2012 R2 64bit. Now, even if 
there is not error and get a successful message, we can not save desired 
"Offline Maintenance Window" values. Why not? 

CAUSE
It is an known limitation of current Data Studio and DB2 server.

ANSWER
Here is an example scenario. 

1. Install Windows 2012 R2 64bit

2. Install DB2 WSE V10.1 GA by Administrator -> 
Right click "setup.exe" and run as admin ->
Create DB2 instance -> No DB creation at this point -> no reboot

3. Unpgrade DB2 WSE V10.1 GA and DB2 instance to DB2 WSE V10.1 FP5 -> 
Right click "setup.exe" and run as admin -> reboot 

4. Install DS411 by Administrator ->
Right click "launchpad.exe" and run as admin -> 
Install Installation Manager first then install DS411

5. Open admin CLP -> db2sampl

6. Run Data Studio ->
Click OK for C:\Users\Administrator\IBM\rationalsdp\workspace ->
Right click on SAMPLE db at localhost under all databases ->
select "connect" -> Enter user name ADMINISTRATOR,
password and check save pw -> get connected.
Right click SAMPLE db -> select Set Up and Configure ->
Click Configure Automatic Maintenance ->
At "Configure Automatic Maintenance SAMPLE tab ->
Click "Offline Maintenance Window" -> 
All parameters are grayed out with below value (default) :
-----------
during the specified time
start time : 12:00 AM
duration : 3 hours
days: checked 7 days, Mon to Sun
range: All
-----------
Click "Create or update the maintenance window" ->
all parameters can be changeable ->
Change parameters as below value (desired):
-----------
not during the specified time
start time : 2:30 PM
duration : 3 hours
days: checked Wed and Sat only
range: All
-----------
Click "Command" and check the call statement
Click "Run" and then see messages, Succeeded.

7. Right click the SAMPLE db -> disconnect -> Exit DS by clicking 'X'

8. Run Data Studio ->
Right click on SAMPLE at localhost under all databases ->
Select "connect" -> get connected
Right click SAMPLE db -> select Set Up and Configure ->
Click Configure Automatic Maintenance ->
At "Configure Automatic Maintenance SAMPLE tab ->
Click "Offline Maintenance Window" -> see it is default or desired
==> It is default even if "Succeeded" at the end of step #6 above.
==> can not save "Automatic Maintenance"

The above DS411's behavior is an known limitation of current Data Studio and DB2 server.
DS411 does not handle Automatic Maintenance appropriately and returns Succeeded even if it
did not run completely under a specific environment, such as the server is migrated from 
DB2 WSE V10.1 GA to DB2 WSE V10.1 FP5.

This behavior may not be happened if it is following condition.
- If the instance type is ESE
- If install V10.1 FP5 WSE only on a fresh box (not upgrade from V10.1 GA)

Here are known work around:
- Upgrade from the problematic DB2 V10.1 FP5 WSE to V10.5 FP7
- Uninstall the upgraded DB2 V10.1 FP5 WSE once then install V10.1 FP5 WSE again
* please backup configuration variables and database before this.

Note:
This behavior might be changed without notice in the future. We can confirm whether 
this technote is valid or not by following the above steps.
