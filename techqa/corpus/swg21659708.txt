Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Deployment Engine can fail to create a backup file if lock files are present in the DE directories. The de_trace.log file may show below error:
SIBackup backup DHZ00710 IP Exceeded maximum number of attempts to get a DB lock 

SYMPTOM
Can not backup Deployment Engine.


CAUSE
This is generally caused by existing lock files in the DE directories. These files can be left behind from an upgrade/install failure or killing a DE command while its still running.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Go to one of the following directories (<DE-HOME>/logs) listed below, depending on your platform, and then delete the .lock* files if present. After this, try running the de_backup command again.
