APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS REQUIREMENT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ObjectServer names in <SQLFiles> are not renamed. It also
   uses hard coded directories in the export related to the section
   of <SQLFiles>. The ObjectServer install directory should rather
   use $OMNIHOME here too.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid export/import of SQLFile objects when using the -rename
   option.
   Rather recreate the specific files manually on the target
   ObjectServer.
   
   Refer to the Netcool/OMNIbus documentation on nco_confpack on
   the '-list' function on how to recreate an 'export' list that
   only exports a subset of the ObjectServer items.
   
   Consider using the nco_osreport utility to get an export of the
   SQL code for creating the SQLFile items.

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  As a work around you can use the nco_osreport command.
