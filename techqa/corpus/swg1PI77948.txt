Fixes integrated in WebSphere Portal 8.5.0.0 and V9.0 Combined Cumulative Fixes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037786]



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the Textbox.io rich text editor, an existing link to
   
   either an external link or a WCM item cannot be modified (by
   
   selecting or placing the cursor inside the link text within the
   rich text field and then clicking on the Insert Link button).
   
   
   
   When the Insert Link dialog is launched, only the existing link
   text value is preserved on the link form. All the remaining
   
   link properties (such as Link description, Link target and
   selected content) are empty.
   
   
   Further, new or updated values entered into these link property
   fields will not be applied to the existing link.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually edit the link anchor tag using the Code view of the
   rich text editor or alternatively remove the existing link and
   then insert an entirely new link.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   either an external link or a WCM item cannot be modified (by
   selecting or placing the cursor inside the link text within the
   rich text field and then clicking on the Insert Link button).
   
   
   
   When the Insert Link dialog is launched, only the existing link
   text value is preserved on the link form. All the remaining link
   properties (such as Link description, Link target and selected
   content) are empty.
   
   
   Further, new or updated values entered into these link property
   fields will not be applied to the existing link.
