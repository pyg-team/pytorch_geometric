APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The updateinstaller (UPDI) for WebSphere V5.1 is designed to
   apply updates to WebSphere Application Server, Network
   Deployment and WebSphere Business Integration Server Foundation.
   Separate builds of UPDI should not be required to update these
   referenced products. Failure to allow one UPDI to update the
   referenced products was resolved in APAR PQ75656.
   
   Cumulative Fix 5 for WBISF V5.1.1 updates will fail if the UPDI
   is used that is provided with WebSphere V5.1.1 Cumulative Fix 12
   or the UPDI available for download from the Support page with
   the error:
   
   "The fix pack cannot be applied to the currently selected
   product because of missing prerequisites.  Please check your
   support documentation to determine what prerequisites are
   required."
   
   A successful installation of Cumulative Fix 5 for WBISF V5.1.1
   is only achieved by using the UPDI packaged with WBISF CF 5.
   
   The same V5.1 UPDI code should be able to install all WebSphere
   V5.1 udates successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To successfully install the WBISF V5.1.1 CF 5 update, the UPDI
   packaged with WBISF CF 5 should be used. The UPDI packaged with
   WebSphere V5.1.1 CF 12 should be used to apply WebSphere V5.1.1
   updates. Two separate builds of the UPDI are needed in order to
   successfully update to WBISF V5.1.1.5 and WebSphere V5.1.1.12.

   Refer to the technote
   Installation of WebSphere Business Integration Server
   Foundation V5.1.1 Cumulative Fix 5 (5.1.1.5) fails with a
   missing prerequisites error
   located at
   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250808. [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250808.]
   
   To avoid problems, always use updateInstaller provided with
   the version of WBISF you download.  A newer version can manage
   previously downloaded fixes and fix packs.
   
   The instructions listed on the support page
   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=823&uid=swg27007903 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=823&uid=swg27007903]
   
   recommend steps on how to ensure the correct update installer
   is used.
   
   We will also modify future fixpack documentation and support
   page documentation to emphasize that the updateInstaller
   provided with either
   (a) the service pack or
   (b) the WBISF support page
   should be used, rather than any version of base WAS
   updateInstaller.
