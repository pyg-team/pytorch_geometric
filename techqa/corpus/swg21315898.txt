In Lotus® Domino®, you would like the ability to use multiple outbound SMTP ports.


Is it possible to use multiple outbound SMTP ports?


ANSWER
An enhancement request for this new functionality has been submitted to Quality Engineering as SPR# DJOE567FV9. 

Currently, it not possible to use more than one outbound SMTP port. 

A workaround would be to redirect all SMTP traffic for a specific destination to an alternate server with the standard port (using a Foreign SMTP domain document). The alternate server must be configured to route outbound SMTP mail using the specific port as determined by the destination server.
