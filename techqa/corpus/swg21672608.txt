CVE ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

Description: An attacker running a program on the same machine as where the victim is running a program could use CPU timing information to discover key information about certain kinds of binary type Elliptic Curves used in Digital signatures during signing operations. Although GSKit only generates Prime type Elliptic Curves, externally generated keys may be imported in GSKit. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990] 
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The IBM GSKit is used if ClearCase on Windows platforms is configured to integrate with IBM Rational ClearQuest with communication over SSL (https). This applies to Base CC/CQ integrations using Change Management Interface (CMI) and to UCM-enabled CQ integration via OSLC. If your ClearCase deployment is not using these integrations with ClearQuest, or not using SSL with the integrations, then your deployment is not sensitive to this attack. The UCM-enabled CQ integration without using OSLC (SQUID) is not sensitive to this attack. 

The IBM GSKit is also used by CCRC WAN server for ClearCase 8.0.0.x/8.0.1.x (all platforms) when supporting SSL connections with IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher. 

 

CCRC WAN Server 

 

CCRC WAN Server Version (all platforms) Status 8.0.1.x Affected 8.0.0.x Affected if you use IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x, 7.1.2.x Not affected 

CMI and OSLC integrations 

ClearCase Windows Client Version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.3 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 8.0 through 8.0.0.10 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.13 Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x Not affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to upgrade to a fix pack of ClearCase that has a newer GSKit component that corrects these vulnerabilities, and to update the IBM HTTP Server. Please see below for information on the fixes available. 

 

Affected Versions Applying the fix to Windows clients using an integration 8.0.1.x Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 4 (8.0.1.4) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037660] 8.0.0.x Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 11 (8.0.0.11) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037659] 7.1.2.x Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 14 (7.1.2.14) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037658] Server fixes (for CCRC WAN server): Install a fix to IBM HTTP Server if you use SSL on your WAN server and you use IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher. You need the fix for APAR PI19700. Consult IHS security bulletin 1676092 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676092] for the details of the fix.
