QUESTION
 Which rule session do I use to call Rule Execution Server on a Java EE application server? 

ANSWER
Rule sessions, used to execute rules on Rule Execution Server, are created though session factories ( introduced with JRules V7 ) or rule session providers (in V6.X, and for EJB2 sessions in V7.X).
On Java EE application servers, several session factories/providers are available: 


 * in JRules V6.X:  * IlrSimpleRuleSessionProvider 
    * IlrManagedRuleSessionProvider 
    * IlrRemoteRuleSessionProvider
   
   

 * starting in JRules V7.X :  * IlrPOJOSessionFactory 
    * IlrEJB3SessionFactory
   
   


To choose the appropriate provider, consider whether: 
 * the call is local or remote, 
 * transactions are required or not.


For a remote call, always use IlrEJB3SessionFactory (with setRemote(true) in V7.X), or IlrRemoteRuleSessionProvider, which enable calls via RMI-IIOP with EJBs. 

For a local call, the choice is based on the need for transactions: 
 * If you need transactions, use IlrEJB3SessionFactory (withsetRemote(false) in V7.X), or IlrManagedRuleSessionProvider, which create EJB rule sessions. 
 * If you do not need transactions, use IlrPOJOSessionFactor in V7.X, or IlrSimpleRuleSessionProvider, which create POJO rule sessions and avoid the overhead of the EJB layer for better performance.



Notes:  * No transaction at the rule session level does not mean that transactions cannot be used in the customer business objects (for objects mapped to a database, for example). It means only that the rule engine does not use transactions directly. 
 * The JRules V6.X RES API is available in V7.X but is deprecated. In particular, to use EJB2 sessions in V7.X, one must use the deprecated V6.X API (IlrManagedRuleSessionProvider andIlrRemoteRuleSessionProvider).
