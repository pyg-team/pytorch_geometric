QUESTION
 How do you identify the type of report (Native, BIRT or Cognos) in Atlas ? 

CAUSE
When executing a report in Atlas it is difficult to identify what type of report it is.

ANSWER
 

Under Admin --> Reports --> Manage Reports, when you view the configuration of a report you can identify the type based on the Report Type parameter 

 * If the Report Type parameter is Native then the report is a Native Java-based Report. 
 * If the Report Type parameter is BIRT then the report is a BIRT Report (http://www.eclipse.org/birt/ [http://www.eclipse.org/birt/about/]) 
 * If the Report Type parameter is COGNOS then the report is considered as COGNOS Report (http://www.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/]).
