Title: IBM DE 1.4 does not support libstdc++.so.6 or higher on Linux - United States

DE; libstdc++.so.6 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does DE 1.4 support libstdc++so.6 or higher on Linux? 

CAUSE
When you install TIP on Redhat 5 that has C++ standard library as /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 or higher, the installation process failed as CIT commands were failing with return code 1.

ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1. Invocation string: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/wscanhw, -o, /tmp/collector6121817250515411664.tmp, -c,/usr/ibm/common/acsi/dat/config/scanconfig.xml


ANSWER
 The above error is reported because /usr/lib/libstdc+.so.6 or higher is not supported. CIT works only on libstdc+.so.5 and lower

Please follow the following procedure to fix this issue: 

Both 32-bit and 64-bit RHELv6 machines are missing libstdc+.so.5 by default. The fix is to install the compat-libstdc+-33 packages.

On 32-bit and 64-bit systems, run the following command:

$yum install compat-libstdc++-33.i686 

On 64-bit systems also run, run the following command:

$yum install compat-libstdc++-33.x86_64
