Text:
ADMINCOMMTIMEOUT PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The ADMINCOMMTIMEOUT option specifies how long the server waits for an expected administrative client message during an operation that causes a database update. 

CONTENT
If the length of time exceeds this time-out period, the server ends the session with the administrative client. You may want to increase the time-out value to prevent administrative client sessions from timing out.




You can update this server option without stopping and restarting the server by using the SETOPT command. SeeSETOPT (Set a server option for dynamic update) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r2/topic/com.ibm.itsm.srv.ref.doc/r_cmd_setopt.html#r_cmd_setopt].
