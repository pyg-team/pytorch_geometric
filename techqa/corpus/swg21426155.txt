QUESTION
 A Tivoli Storage manager server is removed or its monitoring agent is removed but the server entry still shows up under the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. This document provides information on how to remove the instance. 

CAUSE
This happens when a Tivoli Storage manager is decommissioned or when the 'Monitoring Agent for Tivoli Storage Manager' instance is removed within the 'Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services' on Windows or CandleManage on Unix/Linux Platforms.

ANSWER
The unwanted entry can be removed from the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. The Tivoli Enterprise Portal Client / Browser is started differently depending on whether the OS is Windows or Unix/Linux but once it is started, the procedure is the same for both. 

1: Windows: 

There should be a icon on your desktop with the following name 'Tivoli Enterprise Portal' which starts the following program: 

C:\IBM\itm\InstallTM\Kinconfg.exe -x 

NOTE: The file location will depend on your installation path. 

1: Unix: 

You can start the 'Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser' using the following URL: 

http://<hostname>:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/cnp.html

2: Logon to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal using your 'sysadmin' userid and the password assigned to this userid. Example of a Windows Login:
