Step 1 

If QMGTOOLS is not already installed, obtain and install a copy of QMGTOOLS library from IBM. Follow the links below for instructions. 

If you use iDoctor on your PC:

If you are not using iDoctor use the following link:

Note: If you install QMGTOOLS via a PTF be sure to use menu option 13 to check for updates. If you don't have the latest version of QMGTOOLS you may be missing the ECA menu option. 

 

Step 2 


Once installed, add QMGTOOLS to your library list via ADDLIBLE command. Run command GO MG to bring up the QMGTOOLS main menu. In the example, option 19 is the Hardware data collection menu. Take that option.

Enter the ECA number that was provided by IBM in ECA number field.
Press Enter.

You will then be prompted for OS and Service Tools ID's and passwords:

If there is no matching hardware you will get a message that there were no matching serial numbers:

This step causes a spool file with the results to be generated..

Step 5 

One way to get the file off of IBM i is to use IBM i Access Client Solutions
Go under Printer Output
Find the Spool file QPJOBLOG Drag it to your desktop:

Now you can attach the file to an e-mail.

Another option is if you have a PMH open you can FTP the file to Ecurep.
To send the file to Ecurep use the main QMGTOOLS menu option 23 to FTP the spool file to IBM:

QMGTOOLS Main Menu [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=7]

Fine the Spool file by using *USER and *CURRENT:

QMGTOOLS Work Spoolfiles (WRKSPLFCMD) [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=8]

Select the Spool file to Send to IBM:
Work with Spoolfiles selection screen. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021815&aid=9]

Enter the PMH #:

Step 6

Once it's been verified that the data has transmitted you can clean up the .zip files by going to wrklnk '/tmp' and delete the qspl000x.zip file in this case qspl0010,zip:
