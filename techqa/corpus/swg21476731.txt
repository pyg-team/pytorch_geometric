Title: IBM SPSS/PASW Statistics for Windows q Q yy or MOYR format in crosstabs shows different rows or columns with same values - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running the CROSSTABS procedure in SPSS\PASW Statistics. One of my variables is a date variable (originally mm/dd/yy) that I have formatted into a quarter-year or other format; for example, 1Q 01 or MAR 01. In my output, however, I see multiple rows or columns with the same quarter-year or other date values. Should this be happening? How can I fix this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
While displaying a quarter/year format for the variable, SPSS/PASW Statistics is actually working with the actual date value. In this case the date values of 8/11/2001 and 8/12/2001 have the same MOYR value, but their internal values different. As a result, SPSS will create a separate row or column for these values. 

Here is an example of how we can create a variable (in this instance, from an existing date variable called MONTH) that has a true MOYR format:

COMPUTE mnth=date.moyr (xdate.month(month),xdate.year(month)). 
EXECUTE. 
FORMATS mnth (MOYR6). 

Here we pull the month value and the year value from the existing MONTH variable, and combine them using the DATE.MOYR function. Next we use the FORMATS command to display a true MOYR format. Then, we can run our CROSSTABS procedure using the new MNTH variable and see one row or column for each unique value
