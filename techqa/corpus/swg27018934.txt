Title: IBM Lotus Quickr V8.5 for WebSphere Portal system requirements - AIX - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document outlines the system requirements for the IBM Lotus Quickr V8.5 family.



These are the minimum product levels that need to be installed before opening a problem report with the IBM Lotus Quickr Support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible. 



The supported product can run, but does not need to run, on the same machine or operating system where the IBM Lotus Quickr runs. Check product-specific software requirements to determine whether software runs native or connected to IBM Lotus Quickr.
