Title: IBM Unable to deploy MDM Workbench configuration project due to a SSL error - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You're on the MDM Workbench and wishes to deploy the configuration project. As you try to connect to the Operational Server (Engine) you get a pop-up error: Unknown error deploying to hub: Only SSLv3 was enabled - com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3 to TRUE


CAUSE
The latest fixes to the IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management software in late 2015 addressed multiple security vulnerabilities including the OpenSSL vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an implementation error of the alternative certificate chain logic. 

One of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. This vulnerability could be exploited via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connection. 
The IBM SDK for Java Technology Edition has changed the default to eliminate 
the POODLE vulnerability. There is a new system property 
com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3 that is defaulted to true so that it will not use SSLv3. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These steps are done from the Workbench menu in the section to add a connection to the engine. 

Since you are using SSL, the Use SSL for MPINET check box should remain selected. In order to deploy changes from Workbench, the SSL Version need to be changed from SSLv3 to TLSv1 in the connection setting list 
Continue to associate the connection with the selected project and click Finish.

As part of the change your SSL version across all your MDM components properties such as web applications, brokers and profile must be changed to TLS accordingly that is, from SSLv3 to TLSv1.

We recommend changing and testing it in a test environment first before moving to production.
