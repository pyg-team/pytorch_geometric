This document does not cover every installation scenario. It provides sample commands for doing a full installation (without samples) of the WebSphere Application Server 8.0 Express edition. As you read through these instructions, it may be helpful and necessary to also refer to the Installation instructions found in the Information Center:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.iseries.doc/info/iseries/ae/welcome_installing.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.installation.base.iseries.doc/info/iseries/ae/welcome_installing.html]


Installing the IBM Installation Manager (IM):

All editions of WebSphere Application Server 8.0 use the IBM Installation Manager product to perform the installation; therefore, you must install IBM Installation Manager before you can install WebSphere Application Server 8.0. 

IM is included on the installation media; however, it is recommended that you download IM 1.6.0 or higher from the following Web site:

http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Downloads/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager# [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Downloads/Software/Rational/IBM_Installation_Manager#]

Expand the zip file into a directory in the IFS.

The Installation Manager can be installed using one of the following methods:


HTTP Web Administration Installation:

NOTE: For this method to work properly the HTTP group PTF (V7R1 - SF99368, V6R1- SF99115) needs to be at the most current level. See the following URL for the current levels available:

http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs [http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/sline003.nsf/GroupPTFs?OpenView&view=GroupPTFs]

A) Open a web browser and go to the following URL (replace systemname with your IBM i system name or IP address):

http://systemname:2001/HTTPAdmin

B) Click on the 'Manage' Tab at the top and then click on the 'Installations' tab underneath.

C) You should see a screen that looks similar to the following:

This image shows the manage installations screen and highlights the install button. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=1]

D) Click the 'Install' button.

E) You then should see a screen similar to the following that prompts for the Installation Manager package location:

This image shows the screen where you enter the install location of the IM imstall code. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=2]
F) Type the location where the installation manager zip file was expanded and click Next.

G) You should see a screen similar to the following (NOTE: In the screen below the location where Installation Manager was expanded was '/home/rklarsen/im'


This image shows the icon that is displayed while the install process is running. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1011435&aid=3]

IBM i Command Line installation:

The following sample commands will install IM. In the following sample commands, /was8/IM is the directory where the installation files were expanded:

o STRQSH
o cd /was8/IM
o umask 022
o installc -acceptLicense -log /was8/imlog.log

Now that IBM Installation Manager is installed on your IBM i system, you can proceed with the installation of WebSphere Application Server 8.0 Express. If you have the DVD media, it should look like the diagram shown below:

Installing the WebSphere Application Server v8.0 Product



Important Note:
Check the QALWOBJRST system value and make sure it is set to *ALL. This will ensure that all objects are properly installed. Once the installation completes, you can change the value back. 

If you have the DVD in hand, you can put that in the IBM i optical drive. If you do not have access to the machine, you can create an image catalog and use a virtual optical device. The following commands should help create and load the image catalog: 
 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Use an image catalog 
   CHGOPTA EXTMEDFMT(*YES)
   
   
   
   Important Note: The CHGOPTA command must be issued before the LODIMGCLG shown below. If it is issued after the LODIMGCLG, you will re-load the catalog. 
   CRTIMGCLG IMGCLG(WAS8) DIR('/WAS8/IMAGE') CRTDIR(*YES) 
   
   ADDIMGCLGE IMGCLG(WAS8) FROMFILE('/WAS8/was.dvd.8000.webenab.iso') TOFILE(*fromfile) 
   
   CRTDEVOPT DEVD(OPTVRT11) RSRCNAME(*VRT) Note: this may already exist, that is ok. 
   
   VRYCFG CFGOBJ(OPTVRT11) CFGTYPE(*DEV) STATUS(*ON) 
   
   LODIMGCLG IMGCLG(WAS8) DEV(OPTVRT11) 
   



Enable the handling of mixed case on your IBM i operating system with the following command: 

CHGOPTA EXTMEDFMT(*YES) 

Important Note: The CHGOPTA command must be issued before placing the DVD in the optical drive. If it is issued after placing the DVD in the optical drive, you will need to eject the disk and re-insert. 
Once the media is loaded, there are 2 unique install methods: 

1) Use the IBM Web Administration for i GUI 
For detailed steps of this GUI method, you should refer to the following IBM developerWorks article: 

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibmi/library/i-webSphere_spplication_server_installation/index.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibmi/library/i-webSphere_spplication_server_installation/index.html] 

or 

2) Launch the installation from within Qshell ( STRQSH): 

/QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl install com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v80 
-repositories /QOPT/WASV8_WEBENAB -installationDirectory /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/AppServer/V8/Express 
-properties was.install.os400.profile.location=/QIBM/UserData/Websphere/Appserver/V8/Express -sharedResourcesDirectory /QIBM/UserData/IMShared -acceptLicense -showProgress 

Note: The command above should be a single command (one string) with a single space between parameters and values. 

Inspect the following file to check for a successful installation: 

/QIBM/UserData/InstallationManager/histories/IBM WebSphere Application Server Express V8.0/history.xml 

Create the default profile 

o STRQSH 
o cd /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/AppServer/V8/Express/bin 
o manageprofiles -create -profileName default -serverName server1 -defaultPorts -isDefault
