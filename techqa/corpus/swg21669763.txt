Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Rational ClearCase affected by vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
OpenSSL; CVE-2014-0160; Heartbleed SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. In some cases IBM Rational ClearCase client components using OpenSSL might be affected. The vulnerability could allow a malicious server to expose private memory of the client. ClearCase has no affected server components.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (i.e. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: It is strongly encouraged that you take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions: 

 * 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.13 
 * 8.0 through 8.0.0.10 
 * 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.3


Note: Versions earlier than 7.1.2 are not affected. 

Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: 
 * You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server. The perl interpreter running the integration scripts is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server).
   
   
 * You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server. The client is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server). 
   
   Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
   
   
 * You use the Change Management Integrations for base ClearCase with ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert (RTC), or for UCM with ClearQuest or RTC on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest or RTC server. The client is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server). 
   
   Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
   
   
 * You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections. The perl interpreter is vulnerable to attacks by a malicious network peer.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply an interim fix for your appropriate release of ClearCase. These versions include OpenSSL 1.0.1g. 


 * 7.1.2.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 13 (7.1.2.13) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036979] plus Interim fix 1 (7.1.2.13.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037380]
   
   
 * 8.0.0.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 10 (8.0.0.10) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036981] plus Interim fix 1 (8.0.0.10.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037382]
   
   
 * 8.0.1.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 3 (8.0.1.3) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036983] plus Interim fix 1 for (8.0.1.03.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037384]





After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160. 

 

 1. Replace your SSL Certificates
    
    You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 
    
    
 2. Reset User Credentials
    
    Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.



Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Disable the ClearCase/ClearQuest integration and any customized defined use of ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl with SSL until you apply the fixes listed above.
