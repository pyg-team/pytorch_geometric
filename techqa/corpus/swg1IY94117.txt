APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environemt:
   
   TAM WebSeal 6.0 with FP3
   
   Platform indipendent.
   
   
   Problem description
   
   if in the webseald.conf you enable the local repsonse redirect
   and the the local-response-redirect-uri contains a query-string
   ( as RFC specification definition for URI allows it ) , than
   webseal append at the end of the specified URI its parameter
   TAM_OP adding again the "?" character rather than an "&"
   character  Therefore, when the login application is triggered
   there are
   two question mark symbols in the URL.
   
   Current behaviour:
   http://dev1vh:8080/login/entry.do?method=blah?TAM_OP=login [http://dev1vh:8080/login/entry.do?method=blah?TAM_OP=login]
   
   Desired RFC compliant behaviour:
   http://dev1vh:8080/login/entry.do?method=blah&TAM_OP=login [http://dev1vh:8080/login/entry.do?method=blah&TAM_OP=login]
   
   
   
   recreation scenario:
   
   1) build an application that handles the login redirect
   2) junction thuis application
   3) enable the local-response-redirect in teh webseald.conf
   4) call the application by specify a parameter in the query
   string portion of the uri, e.g: use the following example  in
   the wesbeald.conf
   
   local-response-redirect-uri =
   /login/entry.do?method=localResponseRedirect
   
   
   
   you will see that your handler will be called by webseal in teh
   followinf way ( enable pdweb.debug trace in case you need )
   
    /login/entry.do?method=localResponseRedirect?TAM_OP=login
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none if take thei wrong webseal behaviour in mind a develop the
   handler application to understand the double "?" .
