How to disable this pop-up message ?


ANSWER
The function is related to RFE 82968 which was delivered in Web GUI 8.1 fix pack 5. So we need upgrade Web GUI 8.1 to FP5 first. 


A new property was introduced in $WebGUI HOME/etc/server.init file to control the notification window. To change the behaviour from default, add the property below and configure it accordingly: 

############################################################ 
# 
# Configuration of popup messages in the Event Viewer. 
# 
# eventviewer.messages.popup 
# 
# This setting is used to enable or disable popup messages in 
# Event Viewer. Popup messages are used to show information to 
# the user in various situations, such as after running a tool, 
# updating workspace preferences, and when errors occur. 
# Valid options are: 
# 
# true: Popup messages will be enabled in Event Viewer. 
# false: Popup messages will be disabled in Event Viewer. 
# 
# Default value: true 
# 
############################################################ 
eventviewer.messages.popup: false 

To disable the pop-up message, set eventviewer.messages.popup to false.
