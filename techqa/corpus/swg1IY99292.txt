APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  All environments.
   Any maintenance levels.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
    If the warehouse database server goes down and comes back up
   again, the
    TEPS will not reconnect to the warehouse database
   automatically.
   
   
   
   The following message will show in the TEPS log:
   
   
   RECREATION STEPS:
   
   1. start up the TEPS and ensure that it is connected to the
   warehouse database.  Verify historical queries (for detailed or
   summarized data) work.
   
   2. Stop the warehouse database for any reason:
   
    -- a controlled shutdown such as a "db2stop force" on DB2 or
   "shutdown immediate" on Oracle).
    -- an unplanned failure on the system such as a power failure
   or disk failure
   
   3. Restart the database but do not restart TEPS.  Notice that
   kfwservices will never reconnect to the warehouse database again
   until the TEPS is recycled.
   
   RELATED FILES/OUTPUT:
   
   The TEPS log shows the following error for Oracle warehouse
   databases:
   
   
   ctsqlconnectionodbc.cpp,136,"CTSQLEvaluatorODBC_i::Connection::s
   qlErr
     orCheck")
     [Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-03114: not connected to ORACLE
     ERR: 3114, SQLExecDirect rc=-1: SQL_ERROR
   
   
   When using DB2 for the warehouse, there do not appear to be any
   errors in the TEPS logs, although one may verify that the
   connection is lost by running a "db2 list applications" command
   and noticing that kfwservices has no connection to the warehouse
   database.
