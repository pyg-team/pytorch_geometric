 * Update to hardware bypass to allow for continued operation of the bypass modules if an internal error occurs. 
 * Authentication security improvement 
 * Disabling protection ports prior to port pair for SSL inspection prevents any SSL inspection from occurring 
 * mesa_eventsd did not get restarted after crashing 
 * XGS appliance does not report up to SiteProtector when the firmware level is out of date 
 * Fix a possible LMI lockup when trying to display the Top Ten Events graph. 
 * Update the appliance statistics collection process to prevent a crash when generating a support file. 
 * Update the appliance SiteProtector communication process to properly inform SiteProtector of the health status of the space available on the root partition. 
 * Update the appliance remote syslog event generator to prevent a crash when generating QRadar formatted events that have large name-value pairs. 
 * Fix for enabling promiscuous mode for monitoring and HA mirror protection interfaces after an appliance restart. 
 * IPS events not always properly blocked when the packet triggering the IPS event matches multiple signatures with different responses. A restart is necessary for this fix to apply after installing the fix pack.
