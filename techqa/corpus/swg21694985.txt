PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Case Manager Case History Store unable to find the Isolated Region 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to view the history of a case, you are unable to see the task information. Looking at the database tables for the Case History Store you see that the CH_PEEventState contains Isolated Region Event log information for an old isolated region that no longer exists and it has null values in the columns of the tables. No other regions are listed. There are no errors in any logs.


CAUSE
The Case History Store queries the IBMÂ® Content Platform Engine (CPE) views for the Event log tables. The views for the Event log for the Isolated Region that is no longer configured on the system are still present and are in an error state. The Case History Store will query these views and be unable to query any other to complete the Case History Store configuration.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



 1. Delete the Case History Store. 
 2. Using a database editor, check the entries in the CH_PEEventState table to confirm the Event Log tables that are configured and see if there are null values in the columns. 
 3. If there are null values, proceed to the CPE database and locate the views for the Isolated Region Event log tables. 
 4. Drop the views for the Isolated Region Event log tables that no longer exist. 
 5. Recreate the Case History Store.
