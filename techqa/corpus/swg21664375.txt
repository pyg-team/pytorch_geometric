 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users are displaying in InfoSphere Business Glossary user lists as <No Name>.


SYMPTOM
Example of issue on Manage Stewards page: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664375&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664375&aid=1]


CAUSE
This happens after switching authentication from standalone LDAP to Federated Repositories or vice versa. The cause of this issue is that standalone LDAP returns the users distinguished name (DN) which is used as the user record id for the roles in xmeta. Federated repositories returns the uid (short name) and that is used as the record id for the roles in xmeta. When the authentication method is switched, the way in which the user record is saved in xmeta changes. If the old user records are not removed from xmeta, Business Glossary will pick up the old records and attempt to display them in the user list. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two ways to resolve the issue. 

 * Remove all the users and groups from xmeta and reassign the roles. This method is fast and easy if only a limited number of roles have been assigned.
   
   cd IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/bin
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -delete_users
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -delete_groups
   For Windows, it is DirectoryAdmin.bat
   
   If you are unable to login the the Information Server Web Console as the WebSphere administrative user, add a user in manually to be the admin:
   For Standalone LDAP:
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -admin -user -userid "DN of WAS admin user"
   example:
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -admin -user -userid "CN=wasadmin,CN=Users,DC=MyCompany,DC=com"
   For Federated Repositories:
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -admin -user -userid "WAS admin userid"
   example:
   ./DirectoryAdmin.sh -admin -user -userid "wasadmin"
   
   Once you are in the IS Web Console, you will need to reset the user roles
   
 * If you switched from Standalone to Federated Repositories Only and have assigned roles you don't want to lose, you can configure Federated Repositories to use the distinguished name instead of the uid.
   
   Open the WebSphere Administrative Console.
   Click Security => Global Security
   Make sure Available realm definition is set to Federated Repositories
   Click configure
   Under Additional Properties click "User repository attribute mapping"
   Check "groupSecurityName" and "userSecurityName"
   Click the Edit button
   For both attributes, change "Property for Output" to uniqueName. Do NOT change "Property for Input"
   Click Apply and Save
   Restart WebSphere
