APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  At Oncor the cliet constantly move thousands of meters from one
   operating location to another by using the Move Asset
   functionality. We
   found the it will crash the server if they move somewhere
   between 200 to
   300. After removing the customization code, and turn off the
   publishing
   channel for the interface on this MBO, we get the same result.
   Thus we
   suspect this is an OOTB issue associated with Move Asset
   functionality.
   This is a critical issue for this solution and please help us to
   engage
   the proper development resource to troubleshoot this. Thanks!
   
   Below are the steps to reproduce the mass move Out of Memory
   issue.
   
   1. Create 7000 rotating assets in an operating location
   2. List all these assets within asset application list screen
   3. Select the move/modify action on the list page
   4. Try to move these assets to another operating location. (
   Enter the
   new location value at the bottom of the dialog box and apply the
   new
   location to all assets that are listed within the dialog box and
   click
   ok)
   After about 3-4 mins the available memory drop down to 0%
   percent and
   eventually crashes the server with out of memory exception.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <There were a large number of ASSETSPEC and LOCATIONS objects
   loaded into the memory in the mass move of assets from one
   location to another location.  They should not be loaded
   unnecessarily. Fixed the problem. The client tested the java
   objects sent and said now they can move 7000 rotating assets
   successfully without jvm crashing. It took 80 minutes for them
   to complete the move of 7000. The particular case was that each
   asset has on average 50 attributes(ASSETSPEC) records.>
