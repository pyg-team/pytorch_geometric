APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Process cleanup service errors due to double scheduled cleanup
   .
   Business Flow Manager, process instance cleanup service runs
   twice for same cleanup job.
   .
   
   The following message can be seen twice in the systemOut.log
   within a very short time frame.
   .
   
   CWWBF0116I: The cleanup job <Clean up Job name> started.
   .
   Afterwards exceptions are possible due to a conflict between the
   2 identical clean up jobs e.g.
   .
   
   CWWBA0010E: Unexpected exception during execution.
   .
   CWWBF0111E: The cleanup service encountered an unexpected error
   when attempting to delete the
   _PI:9003013a.ca341738.73ea73f5.f38591c0 process instance
   .
   Reason for the failure: CWWBA0010E: Unexpected exception during
   execution.
   .
   DSRA0302E:  XAException occurred.  Error code is: XAER_NOTA(-4)
   Exception is: [jcc][t4][2041][12326][3.59.81] Error executing
   XAResource.rollback().  Server returned XAER_NOTA.
   ERRORCODE=-4203, SQLSTATE=null
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem caused by user setting the cleanup schedule in the
   Admin console runtime tab (under servers/clusters > name >
   Business Flow Manager > Cleanup Service Settings).
   The product incorrectly allows this resulting in two schedules
   being set: one originating from the config tab and one
   originating from the runtime tab.
   
   This can result in two conflicting cleanup jobs running
   for what is effectively the same cleanup operation.
   The schedule originating in the runtime tab may be no longer
   visible via the runtime tab once the server has been restarted,
   however the schedule may still exist and trigger cleanup.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will be included in product maintenance
   (Fix packs) and newer releases after this issue was discovered.
   It prevents the additional runtime definitions from being set by
   the user. If this issue has already occurred, the simple
   work around documented by this APAR can be used (see
   'circumvention').
   
   Preventative fix is targeted for the following fix packs
    WPS 7.0.0.6
    BPM 7.5.1.2
    BPM 8.0.1.2
   Preventative fix is targeted for BPM 8.5.0.0
