APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Queue manager ends, when the client application connects,
   an unhandled exception is thrown from MQCONNX.
   
   NmqiException thrown from GetQueueManagerInfo is not properly
   handled by ManagedNmqiMQ.MQCONNX.
   
   The .Net client trace shows:
    IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.NmqiException: Exception of type
   'IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.NmqiException' was thrown.
    at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.NmqiTools.GetQueueManagerInfo
   (NmqiEnvironment env, NmqiMQ mq, Hconn hconn) in
    C:\path\to\ NmqiTools.cs:line 1021
    at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.ManagedHconn.UpdateHconn(NmqiMQ mqInstance,

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of .NET applications connecting to the queue manager
   through managed/unmanaged/bindings mode
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   WebSphere MQ .Net client code is not gracefully handling the
   NMQIException thrown to MQCONN(X) call. NMQIException can be
   thrown from NmqiTools.GetQueueManagerInfo if the queue manager
   ends when the client connects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere MQ .Net client code has been modified such that the
   unhandled exception is handled gracefully in MQCONN(X) calls
   while connecting to the queue manager through
   managed/unmanaged/bindings mode. The NMQIException caught by
   MQCONN(X) will be re thrown has MQException to the application.
