APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using keyboard shortcuts with Datacap Navigator Scan or
   Verify, the Tab key can be used to navigate sequentially through
   the components displayed in the browser.  However once the focus
   leaves the batch hierarchy, the Tab key never returns the focus
   to the batch hierarchy.  Given that page navigation uses
   keyboard shortcuts associated with the batch hierarchy, the
   inability to use the Tab key forces the user to switch back to
   the mouse momentarily to put the focus back on the batch
   hierarchy.
