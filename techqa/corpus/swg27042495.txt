 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 In some applications or scenarios, IBM Content Navigator workflows and entry template settings are ignored or only partially recognized. 

CONTENT
Support for IBM Content Navigator entry templates and workflows depends on the application that you are using. 

 
IBM Content Navigator clients
Entry template settings are ignored or partially recognized in the following scenarios: 

 * If you add content to the IBM Content Navigator Sync client on your workstation, the folder entry template associations are ignored. If you want to ensure that the entry template associations are honored, you must add the content to either the web client or to IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office. 
 * If a custom workflow is associated with an entry template, the workflow is not started from IBM Content Navigator for Microsoft Office.


Other IBM ECM clients 
Application Engine, FileNet Workplace XT, and FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office do not support the following IBM Content Navigator items:  * Workflows 
 * Entry templates 
 * Entry template folder associations


In addition, if a document is added directly to Content Engine or Content Platform Engine, the entry template folder associations are not used.
