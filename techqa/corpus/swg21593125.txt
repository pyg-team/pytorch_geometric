Title: IBM Unable to start or stop IHS v8.0 from WAS v8.0 admin console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 My IBM HTTP Server (IHS) v8.0 web server is on an unmanaged node that does NOT have a WebSphere nodeagent. I created a web server definition in the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) v8.0 administrative console. However, I am unable to start or stop the IHS web server from the WAS admin console. It just gives an error saying that it "can not connect ..." 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For previous versions of IBM HTTP Server (IHS), including v7.0 and prior, when you installed IHS it would automatically configure the IHS Admin Server on the same system. 

When you are using IHS on a WebSphere Node (part of a WAS ND Cell), it is not necessary to use the IHS Admin Server, because the WAS nodeagent does the administration of IHS instead.

However, when you are using IHS on a system that does NOT have a WAS nodeagent, then you MUST use the IHS Admin Server for remote administration.

When you install IHS v8.0 it does NOT automatically configure the IHS Admin Server. So, you must do this yourself using one of the following methods of your choice:

1) You can use the new Plug-in Configuration Tool (PCT) which is part of the new WebSphere Customization Toolbox (WCT). For detailed steps please read this page in the WAS v8.0 Information Center:

OR

2) You can use the setupadm and htpasswd commands on the command line:
