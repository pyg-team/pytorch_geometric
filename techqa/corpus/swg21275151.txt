Go to Start -> Programs -> FileNET Panagon Workflo Services -> eProcess Task Manager.
2. Under notification tab, enter the SMTP host information and e-mail logon ID, see attached screenshot: eProcessTaskManager.jpg.
3. Click Apply to save the changes.

1. On a client machine, launch Internet Explorer and go to eProcess web site.
2. Login to eProcess Configuration console as SysAdmin.
3. Select the working region and click on the properties button.
4. In the Isolated Region properties click on the Web Application tab.
5. Under the Web Application tab, enter the url for the "Web Workflow" as http:// yourwebservername/idmws

7. Click on the save button to commit the changes.

C. Enter e-mail address and notification option in Personal Workflow Manager.

2. Login to Manager console as an eProcess user.
