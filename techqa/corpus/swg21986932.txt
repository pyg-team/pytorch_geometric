PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 InfoSphere DataStage ODBC Connector against DB2 iseries AS400 error ODBC function "SQLExecute" reported: SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -7,008 : Msg = [IBM(DataDirect OEM)][ODBC DB2 Wire Protocol driver][UDB DB2 for iSeries and AS/400]XXXX in XXXXX not valid for operation. 3 (CC_OdbcDBStatement::executeUpdate, file CC_OdbcDBStatement.cpp, line 994) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error is due to journaling not enabled for this table. It is recommended that you always have journaling enabled for iseries tables.

One possible workaround if unable to set journaling for the table is to set IsolationLevel=4 in the .odbc.ini DSN entry. You will need to restart Agents to refresh the changes made to .odbc.ini.
