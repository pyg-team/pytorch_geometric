Text:
DSRDoc; DetailedSystemRequirementsDocument PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This techdoc lists the system requirements for IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards, version 7.5. 

CONTENT
The information provided here describes the minimum product levels you need installed before opening a problem report with the WebSphere Adapters support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, it is not possible to test every configuration. In general, you can install and run updates to supported products if those updates are compatible with later versions. This statement does not apply to enterprise information system (EIS) product versions and their dependencies. Specific cases where this statement is not applicable are indicated where relevant. 

Supported JD Edwards versions  * EnterpriseOne Tools 8.97, 8.98 ( JD Edwards Adapter Inbound, Outbound operations) 
 * EnterpriseOne Tools 9.1 ( JD Edwards Adapter from Version 7.5.0.2 onwards) 
 * EnterpriseOne Tools 9.1.4 ( JD Edwards Adapter from Version 7.5.0.5_IF06 onwards)

Note : For v9.1.4,the JDE user login password and security password should be same. Otherwise, there may be a chance of hitting the login issues while using the real time events and XML list query

Note: The adapter is compatible with any version of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne that works with the supported versions of EnterpriseOne Tools.
EnterpriseOne Tools 8.9 SP1, 8.9 SP2, 8.93, 8.94, 8.95, 8.96 are supported only for application design, development, and testing; there is no support for production use. Those versions are deprecated because Oracle does not support them. Supported databases All databases supported by the products listed in the Software requirements section.

NOTES
 *  Note #1:  For tooling purposes, the adapter code can be obtained from the Rational Application Developer product.
   For runtime purposes, a stand-alone adapter PID must be purchased for use on WebSphere Application Server. To obtain a stand-alone adapter PID, go to Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage] and use Product ID (PID) Code 5724-T75.
   
   This adapter is supported only for development and unit testing on the operating systems supported by the tooling products. This adapter is supported only for deployment and production on the operating systems supported by the runtime server products. To ensure compatibility, always consult the system requirements supported by these complementary products.
