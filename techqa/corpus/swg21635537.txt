PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The HACMP automation adapter provided with SA Application Manager doesn't start when used in a PowerHA 7.1 Cluster. The required subsystem IBM.HacmpRgRM provided by PowerHA 7.1 is inoperative and cannot be started. 

SYMPTOM
The command "hacadapter start" returns the following message:

Error: Resource Manager IBM.HacmpRgRm is inoperative on <system>.
Use ' startsrc -s IBM.HacmpRgRm ' to start the resource manager on <system> - then start hacadapter.

The command "hacadapter status" returns the message "Found 'hacadapter_rg' stopped" on all nodes of the cluster after the adapter was started with the "hacadapter start" command.

The IBM.HacmpRgRm subsystem is inoperative when displayed with the "lssrc -s" command:

$ lssrc -s IBM.HacmpRgRm
Subsystem Group PID Status 
IBM.HacmpRgRm rsct_rm inoperative


ENVIRONMENT
Applies to all versions of SA Application Manger HACMP automation adapter.
