PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrade or migration to a new release, or after installation of a patch, the Infosphere Metadata Asset Manager user interface exhibits display problems. 

SYMPTOM
The nature and location of issue may vary, but the issue is usually manifested as a problem with displaying certain elements of the user interface. The user interface may also fail to function as expected or display an unexpected client-side error. 

Possible problems could be: 

 * Bridge or connector parameters fail to display properly in the import wizard when you perform a new import or a reimport. 
 * Error when browsing in the Assets to import parameter in the import wizard: [CDIMR3702E] Missing required parameter: channelSrvrId_ 


CAUSE
Web client code has been cached and is not refreshed properly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Press CTRL+F5 to reload the application. This should resolve the problem in most cases. If that does not work, explicitly clear the browser cache and then reload the application.


To clear the browser cache: 

 * For Firefox: From the History (or Tools) menu, select Clear Recent History. Select Everything for Time range to clear, and select Cache, then click Clear Now. 
 * For Internet Explorer: From the Tools menu and from the Safety sub-menu in later versions, select Delete Browsing History. Select Temporary Internet Files, and click Delete.
