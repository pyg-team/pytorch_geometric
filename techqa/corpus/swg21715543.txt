Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
PSIRT; security; Bar Mitzvah SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects the following IBM Jazz Team Server based Applications: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score

REMEDIATION/FIXES
If your product is deployed on IBM WebSphere® Application Server (WAS), you should apply the WAS remediation/mitigation according to the bulletin published by WAS: 
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503] 

If your product is deployed on Apache Tomcat, apply the workarounds listed in the Workaround and Mitigation section. 

Update your supplied IBM® Java SDK according to 

 Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Java SDK affects multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology (CVE-2015-0488, CVE-2015-0478, CVE-2015-2808, CVE-2015-1916, CVE-2015-0204, CVE-2015-2613, CVE-2015-2601, etc.) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21964625]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If your product is deployed on IBM WebSphere® Application Server (WAS), you should apply the WAS remediation/mitigation according to the bulletin published by WAS. 

 *  Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-2808) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701503] 

If your product is deployed on Apache Tomcat, then you should apply the following mitigation: 

 *  Open the <Jazz Install>\server\tomcat\conf\server.xml file, and search for 'SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5, SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, ' (no quotes), and delete the found text. If your version of server.xml has any other ciphers containing the "RC4", delete that cipher also.
   
   Stop and restart the Apache Tomcat server. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
