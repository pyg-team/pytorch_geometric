APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1) HIGH - Cross-Frame Scripting (11293)
   CWE: 352 Kingdom: Environment
   
   We need to include the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header with the
   SAMEORIGIN value to mitigate this problem.
   
   Remediation Steps (from IBM's AppScan output from RTC367009):
   It is recommended that application pages be configured to
   prevent easy rendering within 3rd party HTML frames. Currently,
   the best solution for addressing this flaw is to use the
   X-FRAME-OPTIONS header. This header allows a site to control
   whether its content can be within a frame. There are two
   settings to this header, DENY blocks the content from being in
   a frame and SAMEORIGIN only allows the content to be framed by
   pages within the same origin. Most modern browsers support
   this feature; however check the Browser Security Handbook for
   the most up-to-date list
   (http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/).
   
   If the web application must support older web browsers, consider
   supplementing X-FRAME-OPTIONS with a JavaScript "Framekiller"
   routine. This JavaScript code checks to ensure the page is not
   included within an HTML frame and should be included by all
   application pages. In the event that the presence of a
   frame is detected, the JavaScript routine will immediately
   break out of the parent frame. The following is an example of a
   generic Framekiller JavaScript routine:
   <script>if(top != self)
   top.location.replace(self.location.href);
   </script>
   
   2) MEDIUM - Script Directory Check (4731)
     CWE: 284,200 Kingdom: Environment
     Page: /cehttp/servlet/MailboxServlet
   
   The Customer's example shows a logon request and a successful
   logon response.  The dialog in the summary says,  "A directory
   was discovered that contains an object referenced in a post
   request or query string, and which has a name that could easily
   be guessed by an attacker."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  STRRTC - 399158
   RJ/RJ
   Circumvention:
   Update to latest maintenance for HTTP Option
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  C:E HTTP can potentially be executed from another frame,
   allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added logic to ensure that the application can only be executed
    within the current source frame.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Added logic to ensure that the application can only be executed
   within the current source frame
