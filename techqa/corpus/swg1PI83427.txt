ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) report using LifeCycle Query Engine
   (LQE) shows duplicate results when execution state has been
   renamed in another IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) project
   area.  This is because of the enumeration resource that RQM
   publishes when an execution state is renamed.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Create 2 RQM project areas project1 and project2.
   2. Rename an execution state, for example, Inconclusive to
   Inconclusive2 in only 1 of the 2 RQM project areas, say
   'project1'
   3. Create a Test Suite in 'project2'. Add a Test Case with a
   Manual Test Script to the Test Suite.
   4. Run the Test Suite and set the Execution result to
   Inconclusive.
   5. Create a JRS report using the LQE data source on QM Suite
   Result scoped to the RQM project area 'project2' with display
   columns Project Area, QM Test Suite Result ID, QM Test Suite
   Result, URL, Verdict.
   6. Run the report.
   
   Expected Result:
   The report has only one row for each Test Suite Result.
   
   Current result:
   The report has duplicate entries for the Test Suite result
   created in step 4. It shows a row with the renamed execution
   state as verdict in project1 and another row with the correct
   verdict in project2.
