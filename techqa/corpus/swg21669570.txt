PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After an upgrade, accessing workflow system related activities as a user in the workflow administrator group will result in an FNRPE0920020008E ; Exception: The user or group could not be found. 

SYMPTOM
After upgrading to IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine to 5.2.0.3 and above, when performing any workflow related activities, the following error will be returned to the user if the user belongs to the workflow system Administrator group. 

[Error] FNRPE0920020008E ; Exception: The user or group could not be found. (!v3p8!7EMkrnG0i/pnlZ647ksnKw==)

The same error will be logged in the pesvr_system.log.

The workflow system related activities could be, but are not limited to, the following: 

 1. Launching a workflow 
 2. Opening Process Configuration Console 
 3. Opening Process Administrator 
 4. Transferring a workflow


Here is a sample screen shot of the error from Workplace XT:

CAUSE
The scenarios where this problem may occur are:


 *  The Content Platform Engine (CPE) upgrade instructions were not followed. Instead of choosing the upgrade option in the Configuration Tool to upgrade the existing CPE EAR file, the user end up creating a new CPE EAR. Creating a new CPE ear file would creates a new Content Engine master bootstrap key. A new Content Engine master bootstrap key would cause the Workflow system Administration and Configuration group names to be encrypted as seen in the screen shot below.

Other less common scenarios where this error could be caused from:  * The CPE ear file is copied or restored from another system. 
 *  The Content Engine master bootstrap key has been changed after the upgrade has been done for troubleshooting other issues.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct the problem, upgrade to the following releases: 

- CPE 5.2.0.4 or later, or 

- CPE 5.2.1.3 or later 

In these releases, an user from the Workflow System Administration group can go into ACCE and reset the values to the Administration and Configuration groups and save. 

 

In the event that the above Fix Packs cannot not be applied, there are 2 manual ways to resolve this depending on the upgrade scenarios: 

I. Upgrading from a pre-CPE 5.2 release (e.g. 5.0) 

II. Upgrading from a 5.2.0.x release to 5.2.0.3 or later release. 

For scenario I: 

 *  Backup the CPE database, specifically for the Object Store that contains the Workflow system in question. Remove the cemp.config record from the PE VWObject table. In FileNet Enterprise Manager, update DNS Name and port info. for the affected PE Region ID. This change can be done in ACCE as well. Re-run the peupgrade for the affected connection point and PE Region ID. Restart CPE software. 

For scenario II: 

 

 *  Backup the CPE database, specifically for the Object Store that contains the Workflow system in question. Remove the cemp.config record from the PE VWObject table. Restart CPE software. Once CPE software is restarted, a user from the Workflow System Administration group can go into ACCE and reset the values to the Administration and Configuration groups and save.
