APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While deploying a WAS Cluster pattern the virtual system deploy
   fails after restoring system from external backup with the
   following error messages may be seen from the PureApplication
   logs:
   
   CWZIP2018E The group deploy operation failed because at least
   one member failed: ...: [pdq][0][2.7.116] CWPZC9021E: <Local
   transaction: ....> failed;  Caused by:
   com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException:
   DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-803, SQLSTATE=23505,
   SQLERRMC=1;DB2IPAS.LOCKS, DRIVER=4.14.113
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A race condition occurred creating contention when two JVM
   threads attempted to create a lock at the same time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A random time delay was added in the lock creation retry code so
   that a JVM thread will be able to succeed and break the
   contention.
