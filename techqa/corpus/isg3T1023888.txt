QUESTION
 Can we use bconf to add or update resources to an existing node? 

ANSWER
We can't use bconf to add or update resources defined in the ResourceMap section:
Begin ResourceMap
RESOURCENAME LOCATION
tmp2 [default]
nio [all]

The resources defined in Host section, we can use "bconf" to add a host for the first time (i.e. bconf add host=host24 "MXJ=21;RESOURCES=bigmem"), we can't update the host to reconfigure the resource for an existing host.

Begin Host
HOSTNAME model type server r1m mem swp RESOURCES #Keywords
