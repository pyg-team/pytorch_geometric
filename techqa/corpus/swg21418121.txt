PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to export an IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) message flow as a .zip file? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A .zip file of workspace objects was commonly referred to as a "Project Interchange" file.
To export your WMB/IIB projects as a .zip file, start in the Toolkit: 

 1. Select File -> Export. (The Export menu opens.) 
 2. Select Other -> Project Interchange, and then click Next. (The Export Project Interchange Information window opens.) 
 3. Select the projects that you want to export, enter a name for your .zip file, and then click Finish.
    Please include all subflows, message sets, and java projects that are dependencies for your project(s).


Your project files will be exported to the .zip file and location that you specified.
