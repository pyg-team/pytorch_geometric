ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem :
   
   Installing ITM on some Windows 2008 R2 64-bit machines fail
   during the configuration phase of the install. This occurs
   after the files have been copied. The message text is contained
   in a popup message box:
   
   Error Number: 0x80040707
   
   Description: DLL function call crashed:
   ISRT.CallDLLFn Setup will now terminate.
   When ok is pressed the install terminates.
   
   Environment:
   Windows 2008 R2 64-bit. Installing pristine NT agent only.
   Does not occur on all Windows 2008 R2 64-bit platforms.
   
   Problem Description:
   Popup occurs as indicated in the Abstract then the install
   terminates.  RC_INFO in either *.log or *.trc indicates no
   error was encountered.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   1. Install NT agent through either Remote Deploy or GUI.
   2. Observe the popup or NT agent does not report to TEMS.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Install on some Windows 2008 R2 64-bit machines fails.
   
   
   On some Windows machines, pristine install and upgrades fail
   with an error that prohibits the creation of GetJavaHome.bat in
   the HOME\InstallITM directory.  This causes the install or
   upgrade to fail. This happens on some but not all Windows 2008
   R2 64-bit machines running 64-bit Windows. Busy files were found
   that caused Remote Deploy and the GUI to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to rename locked files that were preventing
   the install from succeeding.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
