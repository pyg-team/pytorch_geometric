CAUSE
The WAS Application Edition Management entry is missing hence defaulted to empty string which is not properly handled in the deployWSApplication.tcl script.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Install CPE 5.2.1 FP004 which includes fix for APAR PJ43852, or 

2. If installing CPE 5.2.1 FP004 (or newer) is not an option, 

2.1. Make a back-up of the original deployWSApplication.tcl (in the scripts directory). 

2.2. Download the attached deployWSApplication.tcl to the scripts directory, overwriting the current one. 

2.3. Run the deployment task again.
