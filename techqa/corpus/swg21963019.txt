Title: IBM Flashing a Hardware Appliance - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How and when should I flash a hardware appliance?
How can I get the files necessary to flash a hardware appliance? 

CAUSE
A flash may be required when the firmware on the hardware appliance has an issue or if the password needs to be reset to admin/admin.

ANSWER
*Note* Flashing a hardware appliance will reset all data and configuration* 

The .img file of the firmware level required can be obtained from the IBM Support Fix Central site. Mount the .img file onto a USB device using a program such as Win32DiskImage. Some customers have reported other tools do not create the boot image correctly. The contents of the USB device will be similar to:

boot.msg
img1a.cfg
img1a.sys
img2a
img3a
isam_8.0.0.3_20140313-1718.pkg


Connect to the hardware console via the serial port, plug the USB into the hardware appliance, and turn the hardware appliance on. The following page should appear from boot.

Under Installer there are the restore and wipe options.

Select the wipe option and YES to confirm:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=2]

Restore will then restore the firmware with the image that is mounted onto the USB.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=3]

After the install has finished, remove the USB and reboot the appliance.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963019&aid=4]

When the appliance boots, it will be at the new version at factory default settings.
