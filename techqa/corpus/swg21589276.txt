dp tam TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Failed attempts to create TAM configuration files may result in a CLI error log message when using IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance WebGUI. 

SYMPTOM
The user may see a CLI error log message if encountering an error when trying to create TAM configuration files using the WebGUI: 

20120223T055052Z [cli][error] : tid(1445745): === Line 2: create-tam-files <full CLI command>


 

The CLI error may be seen in addition to other TAM log category errors such as:


20120223T055052Z [tam][error] tam: tid(1445745): Failed to create Tivoli Access Manager client configuration file 

20120223T055052Z [tam][error] tam: tid(1445745): Failed to generate Tivoli Access Manager client files


CAUSE
The cause of the log message in the CLI log is that there was an error when trying to "create" the TAM configuration files. 

This may commonly be caused by using invalid or incorrect parameters for the create TAM files operation.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance integration with TAM



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Attempt to "create" TAM configuration files in the DataPower WebGUI, but receive an error. 

Checking the logs, the operation seems to have failed. 

In the CLI log, there appears to have a "CLI" related error: 

20120223T055052Z [cli][error] : tid(1445745): === Line 2: create-tam-files <full CLI command>


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The user should examine the properties used for the TAM configuration files and validate these. 

For example, if the administrative user name is incorrect, please correct.
