APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.4
   Configured for VPN Access.
   
   The Connection Manager for VPN has been configured to enforce 2
   Factor authentication.  Two Party Key Distribution Protocol
   (TPKDP) and also an LDAP-Bind secondary authentication.  In this
   case the configured LDAP Directory Server is Active Directory.
   The Mobility Client has been configured to save both the TPKDP
   and LDAP-Bind passwords and NOT to prompt the end user for these
   credentials after they have been saved.  This allows for end
   user convenience when establishing the VPN connection.
   
   However, at some point the secondary LDAP-Bind password gets
   changed outside of Lotus Mobile Connect processing on the LDAP
   Server.  When the Mobility Client attempts to log in with the
   saved credentials they are correct for the TPKDP password, but
   incorrect for LDAP-Bind.  The login fails correctly, but the end
   user is only given a prompt to change the password for his TPKDP
   login credentials and not his LDAP-Bind credentials.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Uncheck the box in Mobility Client properties to prompt for user
   credentials instead of saving them.  That is a work around for
   this specific configuration until a fix is made available.

   included in all product releases AFTER
   6.1.4.  Until that time a temporary fix
   may be obtained from the IBM Lotus Mobile
   Connect Support Center.  To obtain this

   login to their desktop using their cached credentials and then
   be reprompted by the client to enter their new Active
   Directory password. They can then synchronize their local
   password and AD password.
