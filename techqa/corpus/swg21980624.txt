Title: IBM "If tracking was enabled, details could be found in audit log structures" when trying to open audit log report - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User clicks 'Maintain - System Audit Log - Overview and Data'. User chooses parameters, and then clicks 'Search' icon.

Inside 'Information' there is a message 'If tracking was enabled, details could be found in audit log structures'.

What does this message mean? 

SYMPTOM
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=1] 

 *   *  If tracking was enabled, details could be found in audit log structures 
   
   


CAUSE
This is by design - the message is purely for informational use only. 
It is simply telling the end user that (if tracking was enabled at the time that the change was made) then they can see more details of the change by opening the different/separate menu item 'Maintain - System Audit Log - Structures':
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&amp;aid=2]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is by design - the message is purely for informational use only. 

 

More Information: 

To receive more information when looking at the audit logs, perform the following steps: 

1. Obtain some downtime (no other users in the system) 

2. Click "Maintain - User - Single Mode" 

3. Click "Maintain - System Audit Log - Configuration" 

4. Tick 'Enable Tracking ...' for the boxes that you need to run reports for. 

 

TIP: For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1573278. 

 * For example, if you need to track structure changes, tick this box:
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=3]


TIP: If you tick 'Enable tracking of data change' then the audit log can (quickly) grow very large 

=> Only enable data tracking if you really need to! 

 

5. Exit Controller (the changes will only fully register after exiting Controller) 

 

NOTE: Making any changes to the tracking only affects tracking future changes. 

 * In other words, ticking the boxes (see above) does not capture older changes (retrospectively).


6. Re-launch Controller 

 * If desired, now make a change (that you want to test to see if it has been captured in the audit log)


7. Click 'Maintain - System Audit Log - Structures' 

8. Enter the relevant parameters (for example, the date range) and click 'Open' 

9. Highlight the entry that is most interesting 

10. Click 'Preview'
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980624&aid=4] 

11. Look at the resulting report, to see more details of the changes that were made.
