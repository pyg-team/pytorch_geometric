APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MessageSight V1.0.0.0
   appliance who are attempting to add a description to an existing
   queue artifact using the WebUI. This does not affect queues that
   were created with a description which is then subsequently
   modified.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   There was a state error in the save logic for existing queue
   artifacts in the WebUI that resulted
   in an inability to add a description to a queue that was
   initially created without a
   description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The save logic for the queue artifacts in the WebUI has been
   modified such that
   descriptions can be correctly added for queues that were
   initially created without
   a description.
