OPM wrong DB2 version level db2level TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager (OPM) not show the correct DB2 level for the monitored database after a DB2 migration on the monitored database? 

CAUSE
Sometimes it happens that OPM does not update the correct db2level for the monitored database after a DB2 migration, and it keeps showing the old db2level, for example, if you had DB2 V9.7 FP2 and migrated to DB2 V9.7 FP7 and OPM keeps showing V9.7 FP2: 

Status of [1]: alive (1/1). [Database: Database_name, Host: Host_name, Port: 50000, OS: OS_System, DB2: V9R7FP2] 


ANSWER
First, make sure that DB2 is returning the correct version to OPM. 

To do so, you can run the following SQL command: 

 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


If the command still does not show the latest db2level, you need to update DB2 first. Please see links in section below. 

After the migration, run the SQL command again to see if DB2 has updated the VERSIONNUMBER: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 



Second, to make OPM recognize the correct version, there are two steps: 
 1. Update OPM Repository Server:  1. Stop OPM completely 
     2. Open a command window, and go to the following folder:  * Windows: <OPM_install>\RepositoryServer\bin 
         * Linux/Unix: <OPM_install>/RepositoryServer/bin
        
        
     3. Start OPM Repository Server only by running the following command:  * Windows: pestart.bat 
         * Linux/Unix: ./pestart.sh
        
        
     4. Wait until you see the alive message 
     5. Stop OPM Repository Server by running the following command:  * Windows: pestop.bat 
         * Linux/Unix: ./pestop.sh
        
        
     6. Now start OPM normally
    
    
 2. Update OPM Web Console Server:  1. Edit the database configuration 
     2. Change anything in the database configuration, comments field for example 
     3. Test the connection 
     4. Save the database configuration
