APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An OpenSSL vulnerability disclosed by the OpenSSL Project
   affects GSKit. IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft
   Windows uses GSKit and therefore is also vulnerable. This
   vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.

   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   Sterling Connect:Direct for Windows 4.7.0
   
   Problem Description:
   An OpenSSL vulnerability disclosed by the OpenSSL Project
   affects GSKit. IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for Microsoft
   Windows uses GSKit and therefore is also vulnerable. This
   vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Resolution Summary:
   IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to
   identify areas that enable DES/3DES cipher suites and take
   appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most
   immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling
   DES/3DES cipher suites. You should verify disabling DES/3DES
   cipher suites does not cause any compatibility issues.
   Enable the below GSKit remediation when you cannot take the
   recommended action and disable DES/3DES cipher suites in your
   environment:
   The fix adds the ability to engage a GSKit remediation for this
   vulnerability via a system environment variable named
   CD_GSK_OPTIONS. To enable the remediation, set the value of
   this system environment variable to
   GSK_ENFORCE_TDEA_RESTRICTION. Than cycle (stop and restart)
   Sterling Connect:Direct.
   Caution:  The effect of this remediation is to arbitrarily
   break a session after 32 GB of data have been transmitted.
   Aside from the GSKit remediation, CD Secure+ Admin Tool
   (SPAdmin) and CD Secure+ CLI (SPCli) have been enhanced to
   display warnings when deprecated cipher suites or protocols
   have been configured, which includes all cipher suites using an
   RC4, DES/3DES or no encryption algorithm and the SSLv3
   protocol. Note that deprecated cipher suites and protocols may
   be disabled in a future update.
