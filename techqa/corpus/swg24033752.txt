INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



WebSphere Application Server V8.0 Feature Pack for Web 2.0 and Mobile

WebSphere Application Server Version 8.0 Feature Pack for Web 2.0 and Mobile is the first Web 2.0 and Mobile Feature Pack version installable through IBM Installation Manager. IBM Installation Manager is a single installation program that can use remote or local software flat-file repositories to install, modify, or update new WebSphere Application Server products. It determines and shows available packages—including products, fix packs, interim fixes, and so on—checks prerequisites and interdependencies, and installs the selected packages. You also use Installation Manager to easily uninstall the packages that it installed. For detailed installation instructions you can visit this Infocenter link. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.web20fepmobile.multiplatform.doc%2Finfo%2Fae%2Fae%2Fwelc6topinstalling_main.html] For additional fix pack installation instructions, refer to the Readme file included in the fix central download link.

To install Fix Pack 1.1.0.3 using a local repository, you need to download the ZIP file listed in the Download Package section below and then point Installation Manager to repository.xml file on your local machine. The steps below require that you have already installed a previous version of the Web 2.0 and Mobile Feature Pack.

 2. In the top menu, click File > Preferences.
