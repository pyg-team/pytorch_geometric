Title: IBM Unable to login the server when using UTF-8 characters - United States

Text:
rtc; wrong; userid; password; url; accent; RTC TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The user is unable to log in IBM Rational Team Concert using a browser when the password is using accented characters or characters not in the regular ASCII. 

SYMPTOM
The user receives a wrong userid password message when attempting to connect to the WEB UI. 

The browser shows ?redirectPath= in the URL



CAUSE
Rational Team Concert provides two distinct form login that look the same: 

 * The form login from /jazz/admin or /jazz/web can handle UTF-8 Request 
 * The other form login (from /jazz) cannot handle UTF-8 and relies on the Application Server to so that. 


The second form login is executed when the 'redirect' URL is executed (when we see ?redirectPath=/ in the URL) 

ENVIRONMENT
Rational Team Concert 2.0, 2.0.0.1, 2.0.0.2



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 * User unable to log in on the web when connecting to a URL that redirects 
 * User is able to connect to the jazz server when using /jazz/admin or /jazz/web URL 
 * User is able to connect to jazz server using Rational Team Concert rich client 
 * The userid or password contains non ASCII characters like accented character

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, 

Either connect to /jazz/admin or /jazz/web using the browser instead of the /jazz URL or enable the Application Server to manage non-ASCII characters as follow


 * in TOMCAT, open the file server\tomcat\conf\Catalina\localhost\jazz.xml replace
   <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.FormAuthenticator" securePagesWithPragma="false" />

with 
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.FormAuthenticator" characterEncoding="UTF-8" securePagesWithPragma="false" /> 
 * in WebSphere Application Server setup with following Java Virtual Machine system property: default.client.encoding=UTF-8.
   Search for the topic "Configuring application servers for UCS Transformation Format" in the WebSphere Application Server Infocenter for more information on how to perform this change.
