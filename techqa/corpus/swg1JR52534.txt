ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use the Report Viewer in Brazilian Portuguese,
   sometimes the widget does not load correctly. This issue might
   occur on some nodes in a network deployment environment but not
   others, and the issue might not happen all the time. An error
   message similar to the following message is displayed when the
   Report Viewer widget does not load:
   
   ERROR IWidgetWrapper._handleEventInternal
   N0F7EDC2808E5504622088760C2947E656CAF onLoad Error: Bundle not
   found:
   commonResources in com.ibm.bspace.common.util.widget , locale=pt

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The order of locale handling logic led to intermittent problems
   loading the Report Viewer widget with the locale set to
   Brazilian Portuguese.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be incorporated into a later release to prevent
   intermittent problems loading the Report Viewer widget when the
   locale is set to Brazilian Portuguese.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Not applicable
