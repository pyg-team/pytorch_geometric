ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some fields, such as IP Address and Default Gateway for VLAN

   contrast, they existed in previous versions.
   This is a regression in 8.0.0.4.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ v8.0.0.4 Appliance who
   use the MQ Console (otherwise known as the Web UI) to set the
   VLAN and Link Aggregation properties IP Address and Default
   Gateway.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   After applying the MQ Appliance firmware update 4 (8.0.0.4), the
   MQ Console VLAN and Link Aggregation properties IP Address and
   Default Gateway were no longer displayed.  This was due to a
   defect in the underlying IBM DataPower Appliance firmware on
   which the MQ Appliance Firmware is built.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM DataPower Appliance firmware has been upgraded to a
   later version where the defect that caused the properties to not
   be displayed has been resolved.
