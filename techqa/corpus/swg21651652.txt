Title: IBM Load Balancer Group for Log Target cannot be used with syslog (UDP) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why do I get errors when I configure a syslog log target to write to a load balancer group? 

SYMPTOM
Connection error(6) at 'syslog://<LBGroupName>:514/' 
Could not resolve host for 'syslog://<LBGroupName>:514/' 



CAUSE
UDP / syslog is fire and forget. Since no connection is maintained, there is no such concept as failing over to a different group member. Hence Load Balancer Groups are not supported for syslog log targets. They are supported for syslog-tcp log targets.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you want to use a Load Balancer Group as the Remote Host with a Log Target, use syslog-tcp in the Target Type field. 


If you want to use syslog to fire and forget log events, then use a single Remote Host rather than a Load Balancer Group.
