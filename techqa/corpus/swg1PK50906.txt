APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0.x and 6.1 needs to be updated. The documentation
   does not say that plug-in propagation will fail if
   the remote webserver is not an IBM HTTP Server.
   
   -------------------
   Propagate the plug-in configuration.
   The plug-in configuration file(plugin-cfg.xml) is
   automatically propagated to the Web server
   if the Web server plug-in configuration service
   is enabled, and one of the following is true:
   
   * The Web server is a local Web server. (It is located on
   the same machine as an application server.)
   * The Web server is a remote IBM HTTP Server Version 6.0
   that has a running IBM HTTP Server administration server.
   
   If neither of these conditions is true, the plugin-cfg.xml file
   must be manually copied to the remote Web server's
   installation location.
   -------------------
   
   The documentation does not state that you will get a
   failure message during plug-in propagation.

   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects users who are reading      *
   *                 the documentation for configuring and        *
   *                 propagating the Web server plug-in for       *
   *                 WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0.x   *

   *                      server configuration file to a remote   *
   *                      Web server with the GenPluginCfg        *
   *                      command cannot successfully propagate   *
   *                      the plugin. The problem occurs          *
   *                      because remote propagation is not       *
   *                      supported. The documentation for this   *
   *                      command does not list this restriction. *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The "propagate yes/no" bullet in the "GenPluginCfg command"
   topic does not indicate that plug-in file propagation with the
   GenPluginCfg command is for local Web servers only.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "propagate yes/no bullet in the "GenPluginCfg command"
   topic has been amended to the include the following
   information:
   
   -propagate yes/no
   Applicable only when the webserver.name option is specified
   and the Web server is local. Otherwise, you must manually
   copy the plugin-cfg.xml file from app_server_root/profiles/
   profile_name/config/cells/cell_name/nodes/node_name/servers
   /web_server_name to plugins_root/config/web_server_name in
   the remote Web server plugins directory. The default value
   is no.
   
   Date that the information will be available externally to
   customers:
   
   Periodically, we update the documentation in our information
   centers. Thus, the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line documentation,
   complete the following steps:
   1. Go to the product library page at the following Web site:
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library]
   2. Locate the appropriate version and product.
   3. Under "Documentation - Information center format",
   click the appropriate link. In most cases, the WebSphere
   Application Server documentation is available in both an
   online version and in an IBM Eclipse Help System version.
   
   For more information on the IBM Eclipse Help system, see the
   following Web site: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs [http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/iehs]
   
   If you install the IBM Eclipse Help System, you must also
   install the appropriate help system plug-in for the
   WebSphere Application Server documentation in its
   eclipse/plugins directory. The plug-in is available from
   our product library page.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the
   December 31, 2007 update to the information centers.
