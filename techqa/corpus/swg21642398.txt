QUESTION
 What URL do I use to retrieve the schema referenced in the WSDL returned by the DataPower Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy)? 

ANSWER
To retrieve the referenced schema in the WSDL returned by the DataPower WS-Proxy, replace the string after the last slash '/' (containing the ?wsdl) in the URL with the value of the 'schemaLocation' attribute in the import statement. For example, if you used the following URL to retrieve the WSDL from the DataPower WS-Proxy:
http:// : /l2/v3/test?wsdl 

and the returned WSDL contains the following schema import statement: 
<xsd:schema> 
<xsd:import namespace="http://www.example.org/SimpleSOAP/" schemaLocation="test.xsd1.xsd"/> 
</xsd:schema> 

you will have to replace the string after the last '/' with the value of the 'schemaLocation'. In this case, the string after the last slash is 'test?wsdl' so that will be replaced with 'test.xsd1.xsd' resulting in the URL needed to retrieve the referenced schema. That is: 
http://9.70.152.55:29800/l2/v3/test.xsd1.xsd 

Likewise, if the following was used to retrieve the WSDL: 
http://<dp-hostname-or-ip>:<port>/test?wsdl 

then the URL for the schema will be: 
http://<dp-hostname-or-ip>:<port>/test.xsd1.xsd 

Note: The GET option/method must be enabled on the HTTP/HTTPS Frontside Handler for the ?wsdl request to work.
