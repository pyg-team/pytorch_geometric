WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Workaround : 

System administrators should restrict the permitted maximum size of HTTP request
header values (For example, Apache Httpd provides a
LimitRequestFieldSize directive,
and Apache Tomcat provides a maxHttpHeaderSize attribute in their respective configuration files). A maximum header value size of 2048 bytes would block all dangerous request.

Mitigation: No
