ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CSV Import fails with the following error when attempting to
   import data containing control characters (ie - line feed,
   escape, etc..).  When attempting to import to a module, the
   import seems to fail silently
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   1)  Attempt to import the attached CSV (see work item for
   attachment).  Try the normal path of importing it with the
   defaults, then again with importing in to a module
   
   Expected Results:
   
   The CSV is imported without errors (or perhaps warnings about
   the invalid characters)
   
   Actual Results:
   
   The UI shows the following error, but only in the case you use
   the default import path.  In the case of importing in to a
   module, there is no error and you have to rely on the error in
   the server log.
   
   ID CRRRW7571E  You might not have permission to import an
   artifact type that is in the file, or the file might not meet
   the requirements to be imported. For example, one or more rows
   might contain a type that is not in the type system. Update the
   file, the project type system, your user permissions, or all. To
   learn more about the CSV format and importing CSV files, see the
   product documentation.
   Errors were received while importing the CSV file:
   
   Validation Errors:
   Row Number: 2
   Error Message: CRRRS4212E The server encountered an exception :
   Error serializing model
