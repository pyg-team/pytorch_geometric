APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a cluster, modify a policy from one node of a cluster. With
   LDAP primary cache enabled, the modification to the policy
   immediately marks the cache entry as stale on that node.
   However, due to the delay in cache replication, the other nodes
   of the cluster will come to know about the stale entry only
   after the configured replication time. Meanwhile, if the
   evaluation of the affected persons happens on other nodes, the
   evaluation process reads the old stale entry from cache (policy
   without the changes) and cause incorrect evaluations.
