QUESTION
 What is the maximum recommended limit to the size of edihist and any DISAM file? 

ANSWER


The combined limit of the Current DISAM file is 1.03 Gig absolute. 
Errors can include UNIX return code of 27
NOTE: When files START to approach the maximum it is wise to make a business decision to change the length of time the files are stored when working with the edihist files. If currently saving records for 6 months, a choice may be needed to save them for a shorter period of time.
