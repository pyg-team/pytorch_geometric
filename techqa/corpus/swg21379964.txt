PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the daylight saving time (DST) change, some of your CICS regions come down normally while others hang. In the hanging regions, the CEMT shutdown transaction is in an ICWAIT. There are also non-system transactions active, so the shutdown assist program has been invoked (CESD) and the job output contains message DFHTM1781. 

SYMPTOM
The CICS regions that come down normally do not have non-system tasks active.


CAUSE
The clocks have been set forward or back to adjust for Summer and Winter time, but CEMT PERFORM RESET was not entered and AUTORESETTIME was not set to IMMEDIATE or YES in the system initialization table (SIT). Therefore, the CICS time and the operating system time are out of sync.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Cancel the hung region to bring it down.
