APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In 'Scan Health' UI dashboard, ILMT displays 'Outdated Catalog'
   notification for a number of agents. However, if a user clicks
   on the link to preview details, ILMT displays <no data> instead
   of catalog version for computer(s) in the list.
   
   However, in the IEM console, under:
   Sites > External Sites > ILMT > Analyses
   the 'Software Scan Status' analysis does show that the(se)
   computer(s) do actually contain a version number.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  After clicking on the 'Outdated Catalog' and bringing up the
   report where you are seeing <no data> for the catalog version
   for computer(s) which are showing a catalog version number in
   the IEM console, select to sort on one of the columns in the
   report.  At that point, the catalog version will appear as
   expected for those computer systems having data.
