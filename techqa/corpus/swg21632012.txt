QUESTION
 Why dependency scan is not working in ILMT? 

CAUSE
lsof 4.80 diagnostic tool is not installed on the system

ANSWER
For AIX® and Solaris®, the dependency scan works only if the lsof 4.80 diagnostic tool is installed. The default lsof installation path is /usr/sbin/lsof. If you choose an installation path other than the default, you must issue the wscancfg -s lsof.bin PATH_TO_LSOF_BINARY command. 

For example, for Common Inventory Technology installed in a default location:


/opt/tivoli/cit/bin/wscancfg -s lsof.bin /opt/sbin/lsof
will instruct Common Inventory Technology to use lsof located in /opt/sbin/.

To download lsof 4.80 visit:
AIX:
http://ibm.co/XvDNX8 [http://ibm.co/XvDNX8]

Solaris:
http://ibm.co/15AUMLd [http://ibm.co/15AUMLd]

Tip: 
Dependency scans work if the following commands can be executed with the lsof you installed:
1. lsof -i4 -i6 -P -n (for AIX, Solaris 8 and Solaris 9)
2. lsof -z -i4 -i6 -P -n (for Solaris 10 and Solaris 11)

Solaris 10 requires the following versions of lsof : 

 * Solaris 10 05/08 or higher requires lsof 05/08 4.80 
 * Solaris 10 11/06 with a patch applied to the kernel requires lsof 05/08 4.80 
 * Solaris 10 11/06 or lower requires lsof 11/06 4.80
