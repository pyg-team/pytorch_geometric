Title: IBM Web GUI 8.1 event search tools don't work after upgrade to SCA-LA V1.2.0.3 - United States

Text:
zero; rows; search; NOI 1.2; SCA-LA 1.2.0.3; scala.version; scala.app.keyword; scala.app.static.dashboard TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 SCA-LA 1.2.0.3 is only compatible with Web GUI 8.1 FP1 and OMNIbusInsightPack V1.1.0.2 [or above] 

SYMPTOM
Web GUI 8.1 returns zero rows when there is data to be returned. 

The two symptoms are: 

1)The event search launched into SCA-LA returns 0 result while there are events to be returned. 

2) An error message is raised when "Show event dashboard" tool is launched from Web GUI


CAUSE
The query syntax used in the SCA-LA 1.2 integration is of the form:

AlertGroup:=="Fabric to Switch Association" AND Type:=="Problem" AND Severity:=="Critical" 

For SCA-LA 1.2.0.3 compatibility the new syntax is:

AlertGroup:"Fabric to Switch Association" AND Type:"Problem" AND Severity:"Critical" 

SCA-LA 1.2.0.3 does not use the ":==" syntax making the SCA-LA search bar incompatible with Insight and Web GUI.


ENVIRONMENT
SCA-LA 1.2.0.3 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the query syntax to confirm the issue, and fix pack level for Insight and Web GUI



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to use event searches with SCA-LA V1.2.0.3: 


upgrade Web GUI to V8.1 FP1 and OMNIbusInsightPack to V1.1.0.2

After the upgrade to Web GUI V8.1 FP1, modify the value of three properties in the Web GUI servers server.init file to support SCA-LA V1.2.0.3 and OMNIbusInsightPackV1.1.0.2:

scala.version = 1.2.0.2 => 1.2.0.3
scala.app.keyword = OMNIbus_SetSearchFilter => OMNIbus_Keyworkd_Search
scala.app.static.dashboard = OMNIbus_Event_Distribution => OMNIbus_Static_Dashboard
