Title: IBM Where is the dialog Analyze - Custom Tables – Convert Multiple Category Set (STATS MCSET CONVERT) in IBM SPSS Statistics 24? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have a dataset with 3 variables (Food1, Food2, Food3) that represent a multiple category set.
Each variable is coded with values between 1 to 5 with below lables

1 = Milk
2 = Bread
3 = Fish
4 = Vegetables
5 = Meat

I would like to convert these 3 variables into a multiple dichotomy set so that I get 5 variables with codes 0 and 1 if an answer was given.
Within release IBM SPSS Statistics 23 FP3 I had the menu Analyze - Custom Tables – Convert Multiple Category Set where I could perform this action easily but in Release IBM SPSS Statistics 24 I do not find this dialog, it is not there. Why this? I know this dialog is a Custom dialog for an Extension bundle called STATS MCSET CONVERT but how to find this Extension bundle and how can I install it after the SPSS release was installed? 

CAUSE
Release 23 FP3:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&amp;aid=1] 

Release 24:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=2]



ANSWER
To install an extension bundle in IBM SPSS Statistics 24 that is not installed already please go to 

the Github: IBM SPSS Predictive Analytics Gallery [http://ibmpredictiveanalytics.github.io/?cm_mc_uid=34644301118714659825683&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1466163184] on IBM DeveloperWorks. 

Search for STATS MCSET CONVERT: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=3] 

Select 'Go to Repository'
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&amp;aid=4] 

The direct link to the download page is here [https://github.com/IBMPredictiveAnalytics/STATS_MCSET_CONVERT]

You can either download the files and documentation for this bundle separately, or click on the green button Clone or download and select to download a ZIP file:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=5] 

Download the zip file STATS_MCSET_CONVERT-master.zip and extract it to a folder on the computer where also SPSS 24 is installed.
After extracting the zip file you will get a folder with label STATS_MCSET_CONVERT-master and the below content:
Folders: documentation, src and tests
Files: default.png, info.json, LICENSE, README.md and the actual extension bundle dialog file STATS_MCSET_CONVERT.spe

Next launch IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and click on Extensions – Install Local Extension Bundle. Please note that an alternative method to download and install this bundle is to click on Extensions - Extension Hub and search for uninstalled Extension bundle.
However this article would like to describe the method via IBM SPSS Predictive Analytics Gallery on IBM DeveloperWorks

In SPSS 24 when you click on Extensions – Install Local Extension Bundle browse to folder STATS_MCSET_CONVERT-master and select STATS_MCSET_CONVERT.spe. Click on Open button.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=6] 

If you are prompted to overwrite existing components click Yes

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&amp;aid=7]

You are then informed that the bundle is successfully installed to Analyze – Tables – Convert Multiple Category Set:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&amp;aid=8]

You can access this dialog directly after installation:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=9]

You can then first create your multiple category set for Custom Tables, for example:
MRSETS
/MCGROUP NAME=$Food VARIABLES=Food1 Food2 Food3
/DISPLAY NAME=[$Food].

And then create the new dichotomy set on the Convert Multiple Category Set dialog:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=10]

Pasted syntax:
STATS MCSET CONVERT MCSET=$Food SETNAME=FoodDT VARPREFIX=Food.

After that you see 5 new 0/1 coded dichotomy variables in your file:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=11] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21986535&aid=11]
