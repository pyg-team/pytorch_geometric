APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We understand that currently Lotus Notes/Domino does not support
   
   meetings/appointment entries that lasts longer than 24 hours and
   that
   current functionality is provided by "All Day Events" type of
   entries.
   We have users requesting for this functionality as All Day
   Events do
   not allow for calendars to be blocked out with specific start &
   end
   times while meetings cannot be longer than 24 hours.
   
   The current workaround we are using is to create multiple
   calendar
   entries for the different days we want to block out. For
   example:
   Creating an entry called "Annual Academic Conference" starting
   at 12pm
   (1 June 2009, Mon) to 4pm (3 June 2009, Wed) the user will have
   to
   create 3 different calendar entries:
   
   1. Meeting from 12pm (1 June 2009) to 12am (2 June 2009)
   
   2. Meeting from 12am (2 June 2009) to 12am (3 June 2009)
   
   3. Meeting from 12am (3 June 2009) to 4pm (3 June 2009)
   
   This will create the effect of creating a single meeting entry
   that
   spans multiple days giving the user control over start and
   finish times
   as well. We also observed that Microsoft Outlook 2007 allows for
   such
   functionality without the need of creating 3 multiple entries as
   it
   does not have a 24 hour duration limitation for meetings.
   
   Please view the attached screenshots for better understanding of
   the
   situation:
   
   notes_24_meeting_error.jpg: Error seen when creating a meeting
   longer
   than 24 hours
   
   notes_24hr_meeting_parts.jpg: Screenshot showing workaround to
   create
   meetings longer than 24 hours in parts (3 independent entries)
   
   outlook_24hrs_meeting.jpg: Screenshot showing entry created in
   Outlook
   2007 spanning more than 24 hours without needing to create in
   parts.
   The feature to create meetings longer than 24 hours allow staff
   to
   block out times (e.g. during conferences, equipment booking) on
   their
   calendar generally without the need to create finer grained
   entries of
   sub-events.
   
   We appreciate your consideration to implement this enhancement
   in
   upcoming revisions of Lotus Notes/Domino.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create repeating entries - customer does not want to use the
   workaround.
