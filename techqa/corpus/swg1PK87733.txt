ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Build Forge 7.0.2 iFix 4 GA, and spin 77
   
   Large numbers of variables cause a step to hang
   
   To reproduce:
   1) Import the attached project
   2) Run the project a few times.
   
   In my reproductions one of the runs have hung. There seem to be
   two parts which contribute to the hang:
   
   1) We double environment variables for each level of in-lines. 3
   00 become around 4800 at the lowest level the agent has to handl
   e.
   2) We seem to spend our time sending the environments down to th
   e agent outside of the actual execution of the step.
   In my network traces I have seen just the environment being sent
    down for a unique collection of packets. The code points to thi
   s as being by design it seems for caching purposes. The combinat
   ion of a large beginning environment along with the duplication
   of environments is causing the step to hang. It may eventually F
   innish,but a step which is expected to take a few seconds takes
   over three minutes with the attached project in my tests. The cu
   stomer is seeing more drastic slowdowns - it seems to hang. They
    have left it running for days and still no results from the ste
   p - it is simply running indefinitely. They can reproduce this i
   ntermittently in their environment. I have been able to reproduc
   e only when using remote agents and only a couple of times. This
    is a very difficult issue to reproduce.
   
   The problem is exacerbated with 7.0.2 iFix 1 agents which are th
   e last we have which work on Windows 2000. This version of agent
    takes an incredibly long amount of time when employing only 300
    environment variables - roughly 30 seconds. The customer, howev
   er, has reproduced this hang issue when using 7.0.2 iFix 4 agent
   s as well which handle large environments much better. There are
    more details logged in escalation: RATLC01285816. I have been u
   nable to get hte customer to lower their environment variable co
   unt to work around the issue for now. The change would require a
    significant investment on their part. I am also unable to isola
   te exactly what is causing the issue, however I am confident it
   is the large numbers of environment variables involved.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The environment of the step is sent twice in inline steps.
   With the agent_trace enabled on the console, the log shows
   an additional environment getting sent at the end of the
   inline step.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added an agent BufferReset after the inlining step command
   is finished.  That allows the clean up to be run without an
   environment.
