LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Service Registry and Repository V7.5 and
   V8.0
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When editing Classification Systems in WSRR's WebUI, a user may
   create a new class, and then decide to alter this newly created
   class before saving it to WSRR. In this case, if the user alters
   the Class ID, they will be presented with the following
   exceptions:
   
   An unexpected error has occurred. Please contact your System
   Administrator.
   com.ibm.athene.owl.exception.OntologyProcessingException:
   ATN0602E: Unexpected materialization failure, trying to
   construct
   [http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology#my
   Class,....
   ...myOntology#myClassN] as owl:Class types
   com.ibm.athene.owl.exception.NoSuchModelComponentException:
   ATN0856E:
   [http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology#fo
   obar] are not defined owl:Class elements within this store
   Collapse 	Error An unexpected error has occurred. Please contact
   your System Administrator.
   com.ibm.athene.owl.exception.NoSuchModelComponentException:
   ATN0860E: Class
   http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology#foo [http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology#foo]
   bar is not known within ontology
   http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology [http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/serviceregistry/6/2/myOntology]
   
   The changes to this class are not saved, and to continue using
   the Classification Systems editor, they will need to discard all
   their non saved changes. This behaviour is caused due to an
   issue in the editor, which cannot locate classes updated in
   memory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Classification Systems editor has been updated so it now can
   detect and update class changes in memory. This fix is targeted
   for WSRR 7.5.0.5 and WSRR 8.0.0.3.
