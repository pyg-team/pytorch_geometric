APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you create an AlphaNumeric Case Insensitive reference set and
   attempt to use it in a search filter, the search filter will not
   work as expected. For example, if the reference set is set to
   store usernames as case insensitive it will set them all to
   lower case before storing them. When the search filter is
   applied, it is not correctly setting the username in the event
   to lowercase before testing against the reference set. For this
   reason only events with lowercase values will match the
   reference set.
