APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Trying to use the discovery schedules in 4.1,
   If you use the Calendar widget to choose a date and time for
   the schedule entry, it shows in the dialog correctly but
   ignores it when you save the entry and starts a discovery for
   the current date in  2 minutes time.  In other words, if I
   wanted to create an event for Thursday, March 16th at 15:00 and
   I use the calendar tool to enter it, it will appear correctly
   but it is put into the schedule list with todays date and time.
