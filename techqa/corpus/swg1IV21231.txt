ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: PcProx readers not responding after a couple days
   
   
   Description: As we have been proliferating TAM 8.1 we have
   noticed an
   increasing
   number of readers dropping off line.  This issue appears to be
   on
   single, and dual, reader systems. It appears to appear after 2/4
   days,
   then an intervention is required every 2/4 days.
   
   The problem is elivated by rebooting the computer, stoping and
   restarting TAM, unpluging and repluggint the reader.
   
   It does not appear that the refresh option (30 minutes) is
   resetting
   the units once they drop offline.
   
   I've attached what I beleive to be a log from a faulting system.
   
   SOCIService_20110923130731515:
   at 09/22 11:47 does the last RFIDeas_Prox:RefreshDeviceStatus
   with a
   devices greater than 0, all subsequernt calls untill a reboot
   was
   RFIDeas_Prox:RefreshDeviceStatus, Successful with number of
   devices =
   0.  However the devices are plugged int.
   
   Also, on a two device system why is the Devices != 2?
   
   The reader toggled the LED red/green/red and beeped, but access
   agent
   did not respond.
   
   Steps to Duplicate: After a pcProx reader is installed and
   working on a
   system if the system is not rebooted the reader will stop
   responding in
   2 to 4 days
   
   Desired Behavior: The readre should remain responsive as long as
   the
   system is up.
   
   Environmnet: TAM ESSO 8.1
