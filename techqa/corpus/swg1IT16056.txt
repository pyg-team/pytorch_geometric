ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the IBM MQ V8 JCA Resource Adapter (RA), an attempt
   to establish a secure TLS client connection to an IBM MQ queue
   manager from a classes for JMS application running inside
   WebSphere Liberty fails.  The following exception is reported:
   
   [ERROR   ] J2CA8802E: The message endpoint activation failed for
   resource adapter wmqJms due to exception:

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the:
   
     - IBM MQ V8 JCA Resource Adapter
     - IBM MQ V9 JCA Resource Adapter
   
     who have JMS applications running inside WebSphere Liberty
   application server and are attempting to create secure TLS
   connections to MQ queue managers.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using the IBM MQ JCA Resource Adapter (RA) within WebSphere
   Liberty, the expectation is that secure TLS connections to a
   queue manager established by the IBM MQ RA (via a JMS Connection
   Factory retrieved via the JNDI store or Activation
   Specification) will use the key and trust certificate stores
   defined within the SSL default Liberty server configuration
   (sslDefault element in the Liberty server.xml file).
   
   However, the JKS key and trust stores defined within the
   sslDefault XML configuration element were not used.  The default
   certificate store (the cacerts file from the JRE) was being used
   and if this did not contain the required certificates for the
   secure socket handshaking to succeed, the connection would fail
   with the exception:
   
     java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException:
       PKIXCertPathBuilderImpl could not build a valid CertPath.
   
   The root cause of the issue was because the IBM MQ RA was
   creating its own SSLContext object with a call to
   SSLContext.getInstance(String) and initialising it with the JRE
   default key and trust certificate stores.  An SSLSocketFactory
   was created from this SSLContext object which, in turn, was used
   to created a secure socket to an MQ queue manager.
   
   The IBM MQ RA was not using the the default SSLContext object
   created by the Liberty server from the sslDefult configuration
   element, which is defined by the administrator in the server.xml
   file  and initialised with the user defined key and trust
   certificate store locations.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR updates the IBM MQ JCA Resource Adapter (RA) such that
   when it is used within WebSphere Liberty, the SSLContext object
   created by the Liberty runtime, which is based off the
   sslDefault configuration element within the server.xml file, is
   used by Activation Specifications and JMS Connection Factories
   retrieved from JNDI when an attempt is made to establish a
   secure connection to an MQ queue manager.
