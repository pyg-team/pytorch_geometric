APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While enabling search optimization with business data variables
   that use Microsoft SQL Server as runtime database, you see a
   constraint violation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you use Microsoft SQL Server as the runtime database and
   use the SchemaGenerator tool, SchemaGenerator fails with an
   constraint violation because business data search aliases have
   various spellings, which prevents you to enable the search
   optimization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that handles the various
   spellings of business data search aliases to avoid the
   constraint violation and to save it in one column.
   
    On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
   for JR56224:
   
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
     the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
     level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR56224, and click Continue.
   
    When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
   the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
   additional installation instructions and information about the
   fix.
   
    To apply the fix, complete the following steps:
   
    1. Shut down the IBM BPM server in a controlled and complete
   manner to ensure that all transactions completed.
   
    2. Extract the .zip file to a directory. For example, extract
   the file to C:\temp.
   
    3. Add the fix pack repository location in IBM Installation
   Manager:
       a. Start IBM Installation Manager.
       b. In Installation Manager, select File > Preferences >
   Repositories.
       c. Click Add Repository.
       d. Browse to or enter the file path to the repository.config
   file. The repository.config file is located in the directory
   where you extracted the compressed files, for example, enter
   C:\temp\repository.config. Click OK.
   
    4. On the main page of the Installation Manager, click Update.
   
    5. Restart the IBM BPM server.
   
   
   To remove the fix, complete the following steps:
   
    IMPORTANT NOTE:  Remove fixes in the reverse order than the
   order in which they were applied. Do not remove a fix unless all
   fixes applied after it are removed. You may reapply a removed
   fix.
