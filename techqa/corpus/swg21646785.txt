Title: IBM SiteProtector migrate to repository behavior for policies that are Shared Object policies - United States

Text:
SP policy migration; SP; Shared Object policy TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Because there is only one copy of Shared Object policies in the SiteProtector repository, you must merge the Shared Object policies that are migrated from the Network Protection appliance into the SiteProtector repository when you select the Migrate to Repository option. 

ENVIRONMENT
Note: Each object (such as a network object) in a policy has an internal Universal Unique Identifier (UUID). When you merge Shared Object policies into the SiteProtector repository, the following rules apply: 


 * Unique objects are added. 
   
   Example: If you add a network object, such as a host address object, to a policy in the appliance LMI, and then you register the appliance with SiteProtector and migrate the appliance policies to the SiteProtector repository, that network object is added to the policy in SiteProtector.
   
   
 * An object that uses the same name as an existing object in SiteProtector is added, but the object name is appended with the agent name. 
   
   Example: If you add a network object to a policy in the appliance LMI using the same name as an existing network object in a policy in SiteProtector, and then you register the appliance with SiteProtector and migrate the appliance policies to the SiteProtector repository, that network object is added to the policy in SiteProtector, but the name is changed so that both objects do not use the same name.
   
   
 * Objects with the same UUID as an existing object in SiteProtector are discarded. 
   
   Example: If you modify a pre-seeded network object in the appliance LMI, and then you register the appliance with SiteProtector and migrate the appliance policies to the SiteProtector repository, the same object (as identified by the UUID) exists in the policy in the SiteProtector repository. The policy that contains the modified network object is merged into the SiteProtector repository, which causes a conflict, and the network object in the SiteProtector repository is not modified. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After you register in SiteProtector with the Local Policies Override SiteProtector Group Policies option, you can migrate Network Protection appliance policies into the SiteProtector repository by selecting the Migrate to Repository option. 


The Migrate to Repository option migrates policies that are sent from the appliance to SiteProtector repository. You must merge any Shared Object policies into the SiteProtector repository because the repository has only one copy of Shared Object policies. You can add other policies to the SiteProtector repository; those other policies do not need to be merged.

Review the Shared Object policies that were merged into the SiteProtector repository after the policy migration is complete. If any changes that you made to the policies before the merge were discarded, add those changes to the Shared Objects policies in the SiteProtector repository.
