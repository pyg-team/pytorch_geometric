APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After a firmware upgrade, some of the domains might be missing
   a RAID folder on the local: or logstore: directory.
   
   For example, if ondisk is used for the directory name for the
   hard disk array, each domain has a local://ondisk and a
   logstore://ondisk directory.
   
   After a firmware upgrade, one or more of these directories might
   appear to be missing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable and enable the hard disk array in the WebGUI by going to
    Administration > Storage Devices > Hard Disk Array.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The RAID directories in a domain's logstore: and local:
   directories might not be created when the appliance is
   restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.12, 6.0.0.4 and 6.0.1.1.
