 *  If you do not already have an Installation Manager credentials file containing your IBM software user ID and password, create one that will allow you to access the repository.
   
   Note: These are the credentials that you use to access protected IBM software websites.
   
   For information on creating a keyring file for Installation Manager, read Storing credentials [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r4/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/t_store_credentials.html] in the Installation Manager Information Center.
   
   Tip: When creating a keyring file, append /repository.config at the end of the URL location if the imutilsc command is unable to find the URL that is specified.
   
   Sign on to the IBM i system with a user profile that has *ALLOBJ and *SECADM special authorities. 
   
   On a CL command line, run the STRQSH command to start the Qshell command shell.
   
   Make sure that the umask is set to 022.
   
   To verify the umask setting, issue the following command: umask
   
   To set the umask setting to 022, issue the following command: umask 022
   
   Change to the Installation_Manager_binaries/eclipse/tools directory, where Installation_Manager_binaries is the installation root directory for the Installation Manager. 
   
   On IBM i systems, the root directory for the Installation Manager is /QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager.
