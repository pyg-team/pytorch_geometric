   A  FOLDER FOR ATTACHED DOCUMENTS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is not a bug.  By design, a doc folder can not be deleted
   if it is associated with one or more application.  In this
   case, the doc type is automatically associated with the WoTrack
   application when it is created.  To delete this doc type, you
   need to go to the action menu Associate Folders, and delete all
   the associations with this doctype.  Then go back to Manage
   Folders, and now you can delete the doc folder.
