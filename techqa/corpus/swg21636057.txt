Title: IBM "enabled mode for store 10003 not defined in biConfig.xml" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Coremetrics configuration file placing after migration from V6.0 to V7.0. 

SYMPTOM
In V6.0, biConfig.xml was located in xml/config/coremetrics, but was moved to xml/config/bi in V7.0.

When the file is in the bi folder, the BiConfigRegistry class throws an exception: 

"[4/26/13 21:00:24:850 PDT] 0000003b SystemErr R java.lang.Exception: BIConfigRegistry: enabled mode for store 10003 not defined in biConfig.xml". 

When it is moved to the Coremetrics folder, the exception is resolved.


CAUSE
V7.0 classes will read the biConfig.xml from the new path. After migration, it is likely that the environment still has the V6.0 JAR and the classes in V6.0 JAR are getting loaded, which is the reason why the classes expect the xml to be in the old path. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Our suggestion is to search for the old JAR file coremetrics.jar inside the Stores.war/WEB-INF/lib directory and remove it from there. The new JAR is AnalyticsBusinessIntelligenceLogic JAR.

See this Information Center article Migrating the Stores dynamic web project [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wchelp/v7r0m0/topic/com.ibm.commerce.install.doc/tasks/tmgdevcustproj.htm] on migration. 

The list below the point 'Do not import any of the meta data, or your migration will not work. Meta data includes the following files' shows:

"WebContent/WEB-INF/lib

* wcbase.jar
* coremetrics.jar"
