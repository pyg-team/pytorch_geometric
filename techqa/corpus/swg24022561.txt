Licensing:
The upgrade to Rhapsody 7.4.0.1 is included for all licenses with current maintenance contracts. 
You can now use the License Key Center [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/] [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/support/licensing/l] to get and manage your keys for Telelogic products. This includes Telelogic software purchases made through IBM as well as for legacy orders through Telelogic AB. 

The IBM license agreement entitles users to “borrow” licenses from a floating license server for use offline when disconnected from the server. If you wish to use this capability then you need to obtain a new license file with borrowing enabled.
