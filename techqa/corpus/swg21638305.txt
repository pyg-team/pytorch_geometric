Title: IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) and Oracle Transparent Application Failover (TAF) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does ODM Decision Center or Rule Execution Server support Oracle TAF configuration for the datasource? 

CAUSE
Oracle TAF is a technology that is designed to help applications preserve transactions in the event of a RAC node failure. To realize full benefits of TAF, the application must handle Oracle exceptions and use the Oracle OCI API to restart transactions from point of failure. 

ANSWER
ODM application data access code is database-neutral, and it does not use specific API provided by Oracle TAF. Consequently, ODM applications (Decision Center or Rule Execution Server) can use an Oracle TAF database, however it will not take advantage of this database specific service in the event of node failure. 

In this sense, ODM does not specifically support Oracle TAF.
