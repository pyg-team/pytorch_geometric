APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The value for the session timeout for the Portal app in WLE
   7.1 remains 30 minutes and it is impossible to change it in WAS
   console or via custom modification of web.xml and redeploying.
   
   All places in WAS console were checked and when it says 15
   minutes everywhere the timeout still remains as 30, it works
   this way for the Portal app and for the coaches.
   
   It is possible to get it changed for the coaches, it is possible
   to edit web.xml file in
   WLE_HOME\process-center\applications\teamworks.ear\teamworks.war
   \WEB-INF unpack it, find the following section and change the
   value for the desirable one, then redeploy the app running
   deploy_lombardi.cmd from WLE_HOME\process-center\bin and the
   timeout value for the coaches will be changed, but again, this
   only works for coaches.
   
   At this points it looks like only LTPA token's timout brakes the
   Portal session.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  BPM 7.5.0.1 and 7.5.1 trying to change      *
   *                  coach session timeout from default value.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Users are unable to change coach        *
   *                      session timeout value from the WAS      *
   *                      Admin console.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Session time-out can be set in multiple places. The precedence
   for which the final HTTP session time-out is derived is as
   follows from lowest precedence to highest: Server Level (Admin
   Console), Enterprise Application, Web Application, Application
   Level (web.xml), and Application code. User inability to set
   value from Admin console was because the value set by the user
   was getting overridden by the value that was set in web.xml
   file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Session-timeout configuration was removed from web.xml file in
   teamworks.ear allowing user to set session time-out from Admin
   console.
   
   The fix is available in IFIX JR42727 on fixcentral
   
   http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ and needs to be
   installed as follows:
   
   1. Install JR42727 on Process Center/Server using IM
   2. On Process Center/Server run "bpmprofileUpgrade" only:
   
   For Standalone:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c
   om.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_errors.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_errors.html]
   (step 2 only in above link)
   
   For Clusters, only Step 3 in:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c
   om.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_nd_clusters.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_nd_clusters.html]
   (RUN only step 3 and has to be run on all clusters)
