   PROBLEM: With enListSecChk set to YES the list security defined
   in the TWS Security file is enforced for the Production plan
   Symphony file.  When that Symphony file is archived a user can
   then list all jobs and schedules in that alternate plan.

 *  1. Disable Workload Assurance feature in the
   TWSConfig.properties file:
   
         com.ibm.tws.planner.monitor.time = 0
   
   2. Restart WebSphere
   
   3. Only use JSC for Job and JobStream stautus.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See apar description. With this apar
   we fixed also security error issues that can occurs
   when the user work on alternate plan in the meantime that
   other users work on current plan. Usually "security error
   messages" appears without any problem on security file.
   The error scenario is usually present when browse job log
   is performed even if it can occurs on other actions.
