APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Deployment of a message flow with a SOAPInput node results in a
   BIP3701E if the associated WSDL file does not have a target
   namespace.
   
   The system log will show the following message:
   
   BIP3701E: A Java exception was thrown whilst calling the Java
   JNI method 'Axis2NodeRegistrationUtil_registerInputNode'.
   The Java exception was 'java.lang.NullPointerException'.
   The Java stack trace was 'Frame : 0
   java.lang.NullPointerException: null| @:
   com.ibm.broker.wsdl.WSDLDefinitions.preshred(WSDLDefinitions.jav
   a:1191)| @:
   com.ibm.broker.wsdl.WSDLDefinitions.refreshBinding(WSDLDefinitio
   ns.java:1000)| @:
   com.ibm.broker.wsdl.WSDLDefinitions.getBinding(WSDLDefinitions.j
   ava: 466)
   
   This problem was introduced by APAR IT04690 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT04690].
   
   Error BIP3701E can also happen during the Integration Server
   startup after applying a fixpack which has APAR IT04690 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT04690], if the
   Integration Server contains a deployed flow with a SOAPInput
   node.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product no longer issues a BIP3701E from the SOAPInput Node
   due to a NullPointerException during SOAPInput Node
   registration.
