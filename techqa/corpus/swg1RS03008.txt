APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a XOM is referenced in multiple project it will appear in
   multiple xom-libraries folder.
   In DC it will result in multiple instances of the same resource
   
   After an update of the XOM  when publishing with ant only one
   resource is updated, the other references keep the original
   version.
   
   We can see from the query "Find all resources" that not all xom
   gets updated.
   
   Because the ANT synchronization does not publish all the xom zip
   in xom-libraries the deployment fails or has strange behavior
   with multiple version of xom resources deployed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When updating a XOM referenced in multiple projects using ant
   synchronization task only one XOM will be updated. The other
   references will keep their original version. Because of this
   issue, the deployment of a Rule project may fails or will
   strange behavior with the multiple version of xom resources
   deployed.
