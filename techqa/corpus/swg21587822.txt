QUESTION
 Why am I getting this error: "Unable to locate initiatews.properties file in the classpath" when trying to run web services? 

ANSWER
Previously, the configuration of the web service was done via manipulation of the server-config.wsdd file inside the war archive. The new initiatews.properties file eliminates the need to augment the server-config.wsdd in any way. The values which were configured in the server-config.wsdd have been migrated to the initiatews.properties file. 

The web services SDK locates the Master Data Engine server using the initiatews.properties file which resides outside the initiatews.war file. 

Procedure 
1. Install the IBM InitiateÂ® Web Services SDK according to the installation instructions. 
2. Using a plain text editor, create a file named initiatews.properties. (See below for contents of file) 

3. Add the supported properties, adjust the values as needed and save the file. 

4. Save the initiatews.properties file to the location determined by your web application server: 
- If using Apache Tomcat, save it in the ${TOMCAT_HOME}/shared/classes directory. - If using Oracle Weblogic Server, add it to the weblogic_home/server/lib/weblogic_sp.jar file. If that file does not exist, create an archive file in that location, name it weblogic_sp.jar and place the correctly configured initiatews.properties file into it. 
-If using IBM WebSphere, copy the initiatews.properties to the websphere_home/AppServer/properties directory. 

5. Deploy the initiatews.war file 



The initiatews.properties file will need to be created and populated as shown below (the values should be changed to match your environment). Note that the lines starting with a pound symbol (#) are optional comments. 

Content of the initiatews.properties file: 

# host on which the HUB is running 
InitiateHostName=localhost 
# port on which mpinet is running (your HUB port) 
InitiateHostPort=16000 
# User name to be used for default context creation and dictionary reads
InitiateUsrName=pickauser 
# Password to be used for default context creation and dictionary reads 
InitiateUsrPass=changeme 
# Maximum number of contexts to be used in the Context Pool 
InitiateMaxContext=10 
# Timeout is a value in milliseconds. This is the timeout for the 
# underlying socket communication. 
InitiateTimeOut=30000 
# InitiateDump and InitiateDebug a two flags which control the level 
# of logging. Set these to true during development/testing 
InitiateDump=false 
InitiateDebug=false 
# Number of contexts to be create during initiation. 
InitiateInitContext=3 
# If your HUB has been configured to use SSL set InitiateUseSSL to true 
InitiateUseSSL=false 
# If InitiateUseSSL is set to true the three properties below need to be
# set as well. See the product documentation for details.
