QUESTION
 I created a custom annotator with Watson Explorer Content Analytics Studio (WEX CA Studio) and specified Language Idenfication way at that time.

Afteward, I exported the custom annotator to Watson Explorer Content Analytics server (WEX CA server).
However, the language identification did not seem to work as expected.
Why doesn't it work?


ANSWER
Once the annotator is deployed in WEX CA server, it always follows a document language from WEX CA server's language identification annotator.
