Title: IBM Friendly URLs do not redirect to page after login - United States

Text:
redirect login friendly url mapping TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You successfully install IBM WebSphere Portal 6.1.x. You decide to take advantage of the Friendly URLs feature, and configure a number of Portal pages with Friendly URLs. You attempt to access a Friendly URL, and are asked to provide credentials via the Portal login page. After logging in, you are redirected to the default page, rather than the page via the Friendly URL you entered. This Technote will detail how to diagnose and correct this behavior. 

CAUSE
The default settings that control redirect behavior were modified. As a result, no redirects would occur after a login. This will affect Friendly URLs most visibly, though other features (such as External Security Managers) that rely on login redirect behavior could also be affected.

ENVIRONMENT
Portal 6.1.x

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

To recreate the environment, you perform the following steps: 

1) Login to the Portal server. 

2) Access the Manage Pages portlet. 

3) Navigate to the Home label. 

4) Under the Properties for the Home label, you assign a FriendlyURL of "testHome" 

5) Clicked on the Home label 

6) Created a new page named "testpage" with a FriendlyURL of "testpage" under the Home label. 

7) Logged out of the Portal server. 

To recreate the issue, you perform the following steps: 

8) Attempt to access your FriendlyURL by entering the following link:http://myportalserver.com/wps/myportal/testHome/testpage 

9) Encounter the Portal login page and entered your login credentials 

10) Observe the default page (typically the "Getting Started" page) was displayed instead of the Friendly URL page. 

While troubleshooting, you perform the following steps, which displays the Friendly URL correctly:
