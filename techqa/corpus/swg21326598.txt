RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Update the deployed Authoring Portlet and Local rendering portlet as follows: 



 1. Backup any files which have been copied to the deployed Local rendering portlet WAR (Web Application Archive) directory (such as custom JSPs) 
 2. Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator 
 3. Navigate to: Administration -> Portlet Management -> Web Modules 
 4. Find and select the Local rendering portlet web module 
 5. Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet 
 6. Select the updated portlet WAR file located in:PortalServer]\installableApps 
 7. Click Next and Finish 
 8. Repeat the above steps for the Authoring portlet. 
 9. Log out of Portal for the changes to take effect. 



Alternatively, you can run the configure-wcm-authoring task to redeploy the Authoring portlet. 

Instructions for running the configure-wcm-authoring task are available in the WebSphere Portal Information Center.
