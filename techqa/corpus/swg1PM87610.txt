   in a DFHAP1604 message being put out in addition to a ASJS
   abend. Currently however, when trying to put out this DFHAP1604
   message there is an error saying that they message cannot be
   found
   
   DFHME0108 Message DFHAP1604 cannot be found in module DFHMET1E
   
   And because this message is not output, the ASJS abend is not
   put out either.

   *                      application with System.exit() call is  *

   ****************************************************************
   CICS no longer supports the use of the System.Exit() method.
   When a Java application invokes this method, the JVMServer and
   CICS will shut down. CICS has an exit hook which gets control
   when the JVM is terminating due to System.exit() being used.
   This exit issues DFHAP1604 message, takes an ASJS abend.
   As DFHAP1604 message is not defined in CICS, message DFHME0108
   is issued and a system dump is taken.
