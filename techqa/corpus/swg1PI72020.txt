APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Modeler Client 18.0-FP1 is set to Japanese locale/UI,
   warning message/log from the SPSS Statistics backend is not
   translated correctly. Instead of the standard JP characters
   (Kanji, Hiragana etc), we observe boxes and garbage characters.
   
   This makes troubleshooting Statistics errors impossible as the
   end-user is unaware of what changes need to be made on their
   data set.
   
   Have tried adding the following SET commands as a Statistics
   Syntax as a workaround but it fails to resolve the issue:
   SET LOCALE='Japanese'.
   SET OLANG='Japanese'.
   
   All messages delivered by the Statistics backend engine (via the
   STATISTICS OUTPUT node) should be translated/displayed correctly
   so that the end-user is aware of the meaning of the warning/log.
   
   Any warnings/errors of Statistics Output node is useless for the
   end-user. End-user will end up spending a large amount of time
   to troubleshoot the problem unless they can read English or
   another language that does not garble these messages.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack for SPSs
   Statistics 24 release. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed for customers who need the fix
   prior to the next upcoming Fix Pack.
   
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI72020
   and Technote 1995740 about about Interim Fix 001
   for IBM SPSS Statistics 24 FP1.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
