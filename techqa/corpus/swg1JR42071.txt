ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management for Product Information
   Management Version 6.0 the following problem exists:
   
   using the following date format "dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm" in an input
   spec for a report causes a generic exception window the date
   value should be saved to the input spec, if the language used is
   a multi byte character language e.g kyrillic or chinese
   mandarin and the UI is set to "classic" UI.
   
   The same is working for languages such as frensh or spanish.
   
   The following steps show how to trigger this issue:
   
   - create a simple report using an input spec with a date value
   in the spec.
   
   In my settings specify:
   - Local for user interface display -> Kyrillic
   - Local for item and Category Data display -> Russia(Russia)
   - Datetime Output Format: User Select : dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm
   - Datetime Input Format: User Select: dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm
   - use classic UI
   
   - Go to the Report Console and define the Input Parameter Values
   and select a date from the calendar picker.
   - Now click on the Save botton. This causes the error page on UI
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  using new UI e.g. with "simple edit and rich search simplified."
