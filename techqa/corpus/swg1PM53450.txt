PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Distributed Data Facility (DDF) users.   *
   *                 Specifically where a DB2 10 for z/OS server  *
   *                 is accessed by remote clients using SSL      *
   *                 client (mutual) authentication.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Additional enhancements to              *
   *                      DB2 10 for z/OS digital certificate     *
   *                      authentication support.                 *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   DB2 10 for z/OS APAR/PTF PM37057/UK73180 provided additional
   enhancements to support remote clients accessing DB2 using
   digital certificates. In order for remote clients to utilize
   this kind of digital certificate authentication, the remote
   client system would need to present its user ID (at a minimum)
   in order to access DB2. However, there are some client drivers
   (such as IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI) that do not
   have the capability to support a user ID only security
   mechanism. Therefore, the IBM Data Server Driver clients will
   implement a new DRDA security mechanism that allows the remote
   client system to access DB2 using the SSL mutual authentication
   security protocol without the presence of a user ID and/or
   password. This APAR will provide the necessary support by DB2
   to support this new digital certificate authentication method.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  DB2 10 for z/OS remote connection authentication processing has
   been enhanced to support the DRDA TLS Client Certificate
   Authentication Security (TLSCCASEC) mechanism for those remote
   client drivers that support it.
