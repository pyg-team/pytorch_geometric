APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A client application fails to connect to a queue manager with
   error CSQX777E: Channel was blocked.
   
   CSQX777E: Channel was blocked
   The inbound channel 'A.TO.B' was blocked from address 'abc
   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)' because the active values of the channel
   matched a record configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active
   values of the channel were 'CLNTUSER(xyz) ADDRESS(abc)'.
   
   MQ is not matching the MQCSP user against the USERMAP rule
   above. Instead it is only looking at the ID that the client
   application process is running under.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A client application fails to connect   *
   *                      to a queue manager with error CSQX777E: *
   *                      CHANNEL WAS BLOCKED.                    *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When ADOPTCTX(YES) is specified IBM MQ fails to honor a USERMAP
   rule.
   For example, with the following channel authentication record
   definition:
   .
   SET CHLAUTH('MY.CHLAUTH') TYPE(USERMAP) DESCR('Allow user bob
   and force CONNAUTH') CLNTUSER('bob') CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED)
   USERSRC(CHANNEL)
   .
   When logged in as 'fred', it might be expected that the
   following command would authenticate as 'bob':
   .
   runmqsc -c -u bob QMGR
   .
   In fact, the queue manager uses the logged in user identifier of
   'fred'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The new behavior introduced in this APAR is set OFF by default.
   For details of how to enable this behavior contact IBM MQ
   Support.
   .
   When the new behavior is set ON channel authentication rules
   are evaluated after connection authentication validation of
   credentials. This change in ordering allows channel
   authentication blocking and mapping rules to consider any
   changes in the client security context from a successful user ID
   and password validation.
