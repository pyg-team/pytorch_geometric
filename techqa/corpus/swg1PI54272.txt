APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 FP2 Server installed on
   Windows 2008 Server R2 64 bit and Statistics 23 FP2 Client
   installed as 32 bit app on Win 7 Enterprise SP1, 32 bit using an
   Active Directory Domain.
   You like to enable Single Sign-on with Kerberos for Statistics
   23 Server. When you run kinit.exe whit &#150;R parameter, you are
   able to generate a "RENEWABLE" ticket.
   But this, apparently, has no effect. As the ticket only last 10
   hours. You expect the ticket to renew automatically.
   For the ticket created for Statistics server no renew date is
   displayed. And when it expires, you have to run kinit again in
   order to authenticate.
   By configuring single sign-on you thought it would not be
   necessary to type the active directory password every day.
   
   You followed the SPSS instructions on
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLVMB_23.0.0/spss [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLVMB_23.0.0/spss]

   SPSS Statistics 23.0.0 > SPSS Statistics Server>Server
   Administrator's Guide > Supporting End Users>Authentication
   > Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) > Configuring the Server for
   Single Sign-On
   
   You ensured that the Windows server machine is a member of the
   Active Directory (AD) domain. In the IBM SPSS Statistics Server
   installation location, you locate the folder called config. In
   the config folder, you create a subfolder called sso.
   In the sso folder, you create a krb5.conf file. Instructions for
   how to create the krb5.conf file can be found at
   http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-current/doc/admin/conf_files/kr [http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-current/doc/admin/conf_files/kr]
   b5_conf.html.
   
   After that the single sign on works fine for the default
   duration of the ticket, which is 10 hours. After this, the
   Kerberos ticket doesn't renew automatically, even if they run
   kinit -R parameter.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS development.
   This issue has multiple pieces.
   1) When the kinit command is submitted, it must request a
   renewable ticket.
   2) The Kerberos server must be configured to allow renewable
   tickets and have an appropriate renewable ticket time out
   defined.  Typically 1 to 4 weeks.
   3) Statistics software must detect that a ticket has expired and
   request that it be renewed by the Kerberos server.
   As long as it is within the renewable ticket time out, it should
   get renewed.
   
   The problem is that Stats currently does not have the code for
   3) to automatically renew the ticket.
   That code would have to be written and delivered in a future
   release.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue will be addressed in a future release of IBM SPSS
   Statistics Server.
