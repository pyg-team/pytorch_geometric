ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ASD :  RE USE PATTERN - INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES
   NOT KEPT
   .
   Scenario:
   Here at PWC we customized the instances ID and
   attributes and when we add qty for a specific
   instances, we want to keep and increment
   (.1, .2, .3, etc) the instances ID and also keep their
   attributes.
   1- Build a PRC like attached parts.
   2- Add some attributes to the PLM Documents
   attributes
   3- Create a reuse pattern of the instance .7400.1
   and save it back to the database
   4- Reopen and check the PLM Documents attributes
   Result:
   1.Create a reuse pattern = No Instance attributes
   are kept (not even the Instance ID)
   2.Copy or Cut instances from a level to another =
   Instance ID kept but all other attributes not kept
   3.Copy or Cut a second time the same instances
   from a level to  another = No Instance attributes
   are kept (not even the Instance ID)
   4.CATIA doesnt increment the customized Instance
   ID and doesn?t copy any of the instance attributes
   5.CATIA increments the Default Instance ID but
   doesnt copy any of the instance attributes
   .

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON Virtual Design  VERSION V5R19
   GA level.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED ON V5R18 SP5.
   Additional Closure Information:
   THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 19 GA LEVEL.
   NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL ALSO BE FIXED
   ON V5R18SP05
   Additional Closure Information:
