QUESTION
 How do I set up the X-win server on my remote Windows client to connect to the DC? 

ANSWER
If you find yourself needing to use a remote Windows server to configure the J2EE or WAS agent/server in graphical mode, please follow these steps. 

1. On your remote Window client, make sure you can connect to the server where your ITCAM agent is running. Use Remote Desktop Connection and verify connectivity. 

2. You will need some sort of a X-server like cygwin [https://www.cygwin.com/] or Xming [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/] installed. We don't necessarily endorse one over the other, am just using cygwin [https://www.cygwin.com/] here in this example. 

3. After you install cygwin or Xming, start the X-Server on your Windows server. You should see an X icon in your Taskbar if you use cygwin and a window that looks like this. Provide authority for the server to connect to your client, do a "xhost +" which will all clients to connect or limit the authority to just that client.

4. Find your IP address on your Windows client by doing ipconfig | findstr IPv4. It'll look something like this: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=2] 

5. Now go to your server and set the DISPLAY variable there as follows. Here is an example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=3]

6. Start your itmcmd manage on the server and you will see the window show up on your Windows client, and you should be able configure the server now.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21962383&aid=5]

(Note: If you don't want to use the above method, you can also consider using some free web-based tools like NoMachine [https://www.nomachine.com/] or VNC [https://www.realvnc.com/].)
