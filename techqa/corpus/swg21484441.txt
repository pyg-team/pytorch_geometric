Title: IBM Can't connect to Statistics Server - receive error message that it's an invalid userid / password / domain - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to connect the client from one linux to the Statistics Server selecting the option to "switch to server." I enter the ID and password, but it refuses to connect. I am getting the error message that it's an invalid userid / password / domain. 

The user can connect to the server via SSH. This connection works fine with ROOT and local poweruser but not with LDAP. What authentication or configuration do I need to solve this error? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to use 'pam' (Pluggable Authentication Module) with PASW Stats Server you need to configure PAM on the server. If his PAM and LDAP are already configured and working fine, then switching PASW Stats over to use 'pam' is documented in the PASW Statistics Server Administrator's Guide, Chapter 5. Be sure to edit Statisticsd.conf from the bin directory for userauth element and change the value parameter from unix to pam
