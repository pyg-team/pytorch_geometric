APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Although Websphere supports exclamation points in user
   passwords, the JazzSM installer does not.  The JazzSM installer
   might fail while verifying the admin user credentials or while
   executing the WAS serverStatus command.  "Insufficient or empty
   credentials..."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use an exclamation point in the admin password during a
   JazzSM installation.  After the installation the admin password
   can be changed to include an exclamation point if desired.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Issue will be addressed with next JazzSM version documentation
   which will be available when its published after the release
