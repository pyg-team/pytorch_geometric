Title: IBM Combining Authorized User and Floating Licenses for IBM® Rational® Asset Analyzer - United States

Text:
RN6.0; RAA; license TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote describes how to import both Authorized User and Floating licenses for IBM Rational Asset Analyzer on the Windows platform and how to ensure that they are combined in an optimal order for authorizing access for both frequent and occasional users. 

CAUSE
Rational Asset Analyzer users typically fall into two categories: frequent users and occasional users. To handle these two categories of users, Rational Asset Analyzer on the Windows platform is offered with two types of licenses: Authorized User and Floating: 

 * Frequent users require access to the product for a major part of their day. These users access Rational Asset Analyzer as an integral part of their working tool set and need access to it without notice and for time-critical activities that make it unfeasible for them to wait for another user to release a license. These users need Authorized User access, which is in their name and always available to them. 
 * Occasional users require access to the product only sporadically or for a limited amount of time. Because these users access Rational Asset Analyzer only intermittently, they might need only Floating access, which is intended to be shared by a number of users.


Rational Asset Analyzer is unaware of which license types are available at any given time. For its part, the Rational License Server is unable to serve a specific type of license. It simply returns the next available license for the requesting product. The type of license returned to a requestor depends strictly on the sequence of the entitlements found in the import file. When there are combinations of Authorized User and Floating entitlements, the Rational Key Center creates the import file with Floating first and Authorized User second. Because of this sequence, it is important to reorder the entitlements so that Authorized User licenses are listed first in the import file and therefore served first and Floating licenses listed and served second. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The example in this technote assumes that five Authorized User and five Floating licenses are to be imported and used on one license server. 

To import both Authorized User and Floating licenses for Rational Asset Analyzer and ensure that they are ordered correctly in the import file, do these steps:

1. Go to the License Key Center and generate a license key for 5 user-based licenses of Rational Asset Analyzer:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=1]

2. Go the License Key Center and generate a license key for 5 Floating licenses of Rational Asset Analyzer:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=2]
Because the Floating licenses were generated for the same license server, the license file includes both the Authorized User licenses and the Floating licenses in separate INCREMENT lines. Notice the following aspects of these licenses:


 * Both the Authorized User and Floating licenses are identified as "Floating" licenses. 
 * In the license file the INCREMENT for the Floating licenses appears before the INCREMENT for the Authorized User licenses regardless of the order in which you ask the Key Center for the entitlements. The order licenses are served is from the top down. With this file, a named user is served a floating license if it is available. 


3. To change the order of the INCREMENT lines so that Authorized User licenses are served first, cut and paste the lines in a text editor so that the Authorized User INCREMENT line comes before the Floating INCREMENT line: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=3] 

4. Import the license file into the license server. Notice you can change the column width to see the Authorized User and Floating licenses with a quantity of 5 for each. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=4] 

5. When you click Import you are offered an opportunity to edit the options file for named users: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&amp;aid=5] 

6. After you edit and save the options file, the License Key Administrator shows the following status: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=6] 

7. To see the licenses on the server select Settings > Client/Server Configuration and click Show Licenses: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509004&aid=7] 

The licenses are displayed. Both are "Floating" type, and there are 5 Authorized User and 5 Single Install Floating licenses:
