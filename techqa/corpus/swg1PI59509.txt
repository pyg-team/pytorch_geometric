ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SSLC0008E SSLHandshake exception after turning off TLSv1
   protocol
   
   Configured SSL_TLSv2 in all SSL configuration and updated the
   java.security file to turn off TLSv1 protocol using property
   "jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=TLSv1"  After that we are seeing
   the SSLHandshake exception.
   
   This is problem happens only with when you are using JDK1.7
   
   SSLHandshakeE E   SSLC0008E: Unable to initialize SSL
   connection.  Unauthorized access was denied or
   security settings have expired.  Exception is
   javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert:
   handshake_failure

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM WebSphere Application Server Version    *
   *                  8.5.5 users of the SSL Channel              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The SSL Channel might reset the         *
   *                      SSLEngine to TLSv1.0 even if that       *
   *                      protocol is disabled.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If the SSL Channel resets the SSLEngine to its default value,
   the TLS protocol that will be set is TLSv1.0. An SSL Handshake
   Exception might occur if TLSv1.0 was set to be disabled. The
   following is an example of the exception:
   SSLHandshakeE E  SSLC0008E: Unable to initialize SSL
   connection. Unauthorized access was denied or security
   settings have expired. Exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLException:
   Received fatal alert: handshake_failure

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SSL Channel was modified to correctly set the enabled
   protocol.
