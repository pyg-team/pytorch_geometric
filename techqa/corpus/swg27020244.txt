Title: IBM Case Manager known issue: During single-server installation, you must close the Tivoli Directory Server administration window to prevent time-out errors - United States

 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 On the AIX platform without a Common Desktop Environment (CDE), if you use VNC to connect to the X desktop to launch the IBM Case Manager Platform Installation Tool (CMPIT) installer in interactive or silent mode, you may experience an installation error. 

CONTENT
The Installation Complete window of the installation tool displays this message: 

Errors occurred during the installation. See the installation log for more information.

The IBM/cmpit/cmpit_install_log_5.0.0.txt log displays a message similar to the following message:

***IllegalThreadStateException - Timeout Error in monitorProcess: (6/28) installMashup.sh. java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException: process hasn't exited
ERROR in InvokeScripts-function - Terminate the remaining scripts.
***Aborting InvokeScripts-Install function.

Causes

During the automatic installation and configuration of the IBM Case Manager platform on AIX, the IBM TivoliÂ® Directory Server Instance Administration Tool launches a grid-like window. You must click this window to access the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool interface. In the interface, you must close this window by using the Close button, and confirming the exit dialog. If you do not close this window during the installation, the process times out, and the installation is unsuccessful.

Resolving the problem

To recover from an unsuccessful installation caused by a time out issue:

If you have created a backup of the server where you planned to run the installation, including all the downloaded software packages, you can restore the backup image and restart the installation. During the installation process, click the grid window to activate the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool window, and close the administration tool window by using the Close button.
You can also prevent the issue by changing to one of the following approaches:


 *  Installing Common Desktop Environment (CDE) before you run the installation 
 *  Using a utility other than VNC to connect to the AIX server 
 *  Using telnet to run the installation in silent mode


If you do not have a backup of the server, you can undo the installation to the point of the timeout issue, and rerun the installation: 
 1.  Uninstall IBM Mashup Center by running /opt/IBM/MashupCenter/3.0/Uninstall/uninstall.sh. 
 2.  Make sure all the WebSphere/LM related process are terminated. You can use the ps -ef command to list all the processes including paths. Terminate all processes with a path that contains /opt/IBM/MashupCenter/.
     If LotusMashup/WAS did not uninstall properly then follow this technote to clean-up the WAS registry. http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21198862#cleanup [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21198862#cleanup] 
 3.  Ensure that the /opt/IBM/MashupCenter directory is deleted. 
 4.  Open the /opt/IBM/cmpit/install-scripts/cmpit.properties file for editing. 
 5.  Change all instances of .tar.gz file extensions to .tar. 
 6.  Set all values for the parameters PROCESSED_1 through PROCESSED_5 to YES. 
 7.  Set all values for the parameters PROCESSED_6 through PROCESSED_28 to NO. 
 8.  Save your changes to the /opt/IBM/cmpit/install-scripts/cmpit.properties file. 
 9.  Make a backup copy of the CDRoot/cmpit.properties file. 
 10. Copy the edited /opt/IBM/cmpit/install-scripts/cmpit.properties file to the CDRoot directory, overwriting the cmpit.properties file in that location. 
 11. Set the permission of the /opt/IBM/cmpit/install-scripts directory to 777. 
 12. Restart the installation program. 
 13. When a grid-like screen displays, click the screen to activate the IBM Tivoli Directory Server Instance Administration Tool. 
 14. Close the tool by using the Close button, then clicking Yes on the exit confirmation window.
