PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM WebSphere DataPower Type 7199 and Type 7198 appliances might incorrectly report hardware failures, such as for the fan modules, in the log. These messages do not indicate an actual problem. 

SYMPTOM
Immediately after a reboot, all hardware sensors might show incorrect values, and you might see errors in the log similar to the following messages: 

June 29 08:24:08 [system][critic] trans(991): Internal cooling fan has stopped.
June 29 08:24:13 [system][critic] trans(991): Chassis cooling fan 'Tray 1 Fan 1' operating too slowly
June 29 08:24:13 [system][critic] trans(991): Chassis cooling fan 'Tray 2 Fan 1' operating too slowly
June 29 08:24:13 [system][critic] trans(991): Internal cooling fan has stopped.
June 29 08:24:13 [system][critic] trans(991): Internal cooling fan has stopped.

ENVIRONMENT
This issue might occur on machine Type 7198 and Type 7199 appliances.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You enter the test hardware command and the hardware sensors show failures for all hardware components. This is a known issue. The problem does not affect the operation of the appliance.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was reported as APAR IC89622: MT 7198/7199: SENSORS MIGHT BE INCORRECT AFTER RESTART. The fix is available in firmware versions 5.0.0.9 and 6.0.0.0. 


To temporarily resolve this issue, power off the appliance and power it back on.
