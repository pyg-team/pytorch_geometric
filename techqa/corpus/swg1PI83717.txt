APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It has been observed that the Modeler Client 18.x Concurrent
   Admin installation document lists COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE parameter as
   a valid silent install option. This can be found in page 9 of
   the document where a table shows all properties available.
   
   All other documentation of Modeler Client does not list
   COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE parameter as valid option.
   
   Tests show that this property is not honoured by the silent
   installer and the default value of "30" is entered into the
   <ModCli_Install>\bin\spssprod.inf file.
   
   Attached silent install log file shows the installation being
   successful and no errors occurring regarding the
   COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE parameter.
   
   ##############################
   MSI (s) (04:7C) [21:50:01:019]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Modifying
   COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE property. Its current value is '30'. Its new
   value: '14'.
   ##############################
   
   
   Expected behaviour is one of the following two options:
   a) The Modeler Client Concurrent Admin documentation incorrect
   and that the COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE parameter should be removed; or
   b) The MSI Silent Installer option of Modeler Client 18.x is not
   functioning as expected because any value used for
   COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE will end up as "30" within the spssprod.inf
   file.
   
   
   To reproduce this issue:
   * Open the Modeler Client Concurrent Admin Doc and confirm the
   presence of the COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE parameter;
   * Run the following Silent Install command on a Windows machine:
   
   msiexec.exe /i "ModelerClient64.msi" /qn /l*v
   C:\Temp\modcliSilent.log LICENSETYPE="Network"
   LSHOST="<myLicenseServer>" COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE="14"
   
    >> Take note of the last parameter's value of "14"
   
   * Wait for the installer to finish and when completed, open the
   <ModCli_Install>\bin\spssprod.inf file in a Text Editor;
   * Verify the value of "30" is found for the CommuteMaxLife
   parameter.
   
   
   Upon further investigation, it has been observed that the
   following Silent Install parameters do not work in Modeler
   Client 18.x:
   "DISABLE_COMMUTE", "COMMUTE_MAX_LIFE" and "COMPANYNAME"
   
   The SPSS Modeler install documents will be updated to remove
   these parameters from future releases of our product.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For a single installation, after the installation is complete,
   manually change the CommuteMaxLife parameter within the
   spssprod.inf file to the value you wish to have.
   
   If this needs to be deployed to a number of users, please
   provide an updated copy of the spssprod.inf (containing the
   correct value for CommuteMaxLife) on a shared directory within
   your network and ask your users to copy and replace their local
   copy.
