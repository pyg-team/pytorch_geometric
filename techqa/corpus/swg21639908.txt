QUESTION
 Why is the Trace Parameters menu item missing from a Content Manager OnDemand server in the V9.5 and V9.0 administrative clients? 

CAUSE
When a V9.5 or V9.0 Content Manager OnDemand Administrative client is logged on to a V8.5 OnDemand server, the list of menu options that appear when right-clicking on the server does not contain the Trace Parameters option.

ANSWER
Trace parameters are specified differently with the V9.5 and V9.0 CMOD Administrative client. Instead of selecting components from a list and selecting trace levels by checking boxes, the trace parameters are specified as a string of options in an editable field. Because the interface is different between the two releases, trace parameters can only be specified if the server is at V9.0 or higher. 

If trace parameters need to be specified for a V8.5 server, tracing can be turned on without using the administrative client. Enable and configure server trace in the trace settings file referenced by the ARS_TRACE_SETTINGS parameter in the ars.cfg file.
