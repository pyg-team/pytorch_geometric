   PRODUCT LINE: ENOVIA_V5 V5 R14 SP4 Hotfix 23
   OPERATING SYSTEM: Win 2000 OS LEVEL: XP
   JDK LEVEL: Win NT/95/98 1.1.8_n118p

   ABSTRACT: Configuration Handler definition shows
   specification connected to Wrong Category if
   specification has same SPEC ID but belongs to
   different Category.
   .
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   If we have 2 Specifications from different Category
   with Same Spec ID and Different Specification Alias
   used in Configuration Filter. Enovia could not
   resolve the correct specifications and Category
   combination.
   .
   Step by step scenario:
   1. Create PC1 and PRC1 product Class Editor
   2. Create Category CAT 1 and CAT 2 in Category
   Editor
   3. Create Specification as follows below Category
   CAT1
   Spec Id : SPEC1  , Specification Alis: SPEC-HIGH
   4. Create Specification as follows below Category
   CAT2
   Spec Id : SPEC1  , Specification Alis: SPEC-H
   .
   Note: Both Specification has same ID BUT different
   Alias name.
   .
   5. Connect PRC1 to CAT1 and CAT2 and make
   both Categories Mandatory.
   6. Create Action DSG1 for PRC1 with Date
   Effectivity as common Condition
   7. Open PRC1 in Product Editor and connect Action
   DSG1
   8. Create Some Part Instances below PRC 1 and
   apply Specification CAT1:SPEC-HIGH and
   CAT2:SPEC-H
   9. Save
   10. Apply Configuration Filter on PRC with Default
   and 150%. Select Current Date in Date Condition.
   Select Both CAT1: SPEC1 and CAT2: SPEC1 in
   Specification Condition.
   11. Save Config Handler ( CH ERROR 1 )
   12: Apply configuration hanlder on PRC.
   13. Close Product Editor and Open PRC , apply
   Configuration Filter.
   14. Load setteings From previously saved
   COnfiguration Filter (CH ERROR1).
   15. Click on Specifications in Specification
   Conditions
   16. Check Selected Specifications, now both SPEC-
   HIGH and SPEC-H are shown below CAT1.
   17. Also Filter outupt also differes -
   1. If Context is created then you always get right
   output.
   2. If CH is open from PC Editor gives correct
   filter output.
   3. BUT if Saved CH is selected in Configuration
   Filter Window and
   all Settings are loaded from Saved CH Out put is
   Wrong. Enovia only gives instances with
   CAT1:SPEC-HIGH.
   18. Also updation of Configuration Hanlder is quite
   tricky since Enovia Always displays SPEC-H below
   CAT1. Need to remove all specs below such
   categories and perform new search to get correct
   data.
