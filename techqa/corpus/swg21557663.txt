Title: IBM Parameters in InstallNoappsWindowsService.cmd are not correct for enabling verbose gc - United States

Text:
STERLINGNFX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Parameters in InstallNoappsWindowsService.cmd are not correct for enabling verbose gc 

SYMPTOM


InstallNoappsWindowsService.cmd contains lines that will be added to Windows Registry to enable verbose garbage collection output. By default, these lines are only comments. When the 'rem' is removed the lines become active.

In the original release of 4.3, if these lines were activated, GIS would not start.

-Xverbose is not supported by Sun JDK for windows, correct usage is -verbose:XXX

The output path for the verbose gc log was also formatted incorrectly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Apply Gentran Integration Suite patch 4306 or greater.

Run setupfiles.cmd

Run InstallWindowsService.cmd
