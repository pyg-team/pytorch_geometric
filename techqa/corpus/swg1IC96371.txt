APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The update of statistics of SYSSTAT.COLDIST.COLVALUE generated
   via db2look -m (mimic mode) may fail with SQL0104N error.
   
   The same output looks as follows:
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST
   SET COLVALUE=''<value>  '',
         VALCOUNT=<value>
   WHERE COLNAME = '<value>' AND TABNAME =
   '<value>' AND TABSCHEMA = '<SCHEMA>    ' AND TYPE      =
   '<value>' AND SEQNO     =  <value>
   DB21034E  The command was processed as an SQL statement because
   it was not a valid Command Line Processor command.  During SQL
   processing it
   returned:
   SQL0104N  An unexpected token "<value>" was found following
   "DIST SET
   COLVALUE=''".  Expected tokens may include:  "CONCAT".
   SQLSTATE=42601
   
   This occurs because of character wrapping for COLVALUE: db2look
   -m adds
   two single quotes instead of one single quote.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a temporary workaround:
   
   
   Remove one single quote for the COLVALUE literal in
   the update statement, then run the statement again:
   
   UPDATE SYSSTAT.COLDIST SET COLVALUE='<value>  ',
   VALCOUNT=<value> WHERE COLNAME = '<value>' AND TABNAME =
