QUESTION
 Are Report Studio and Cognos Workspace Advanced (and user interface profile) still part of the product? 

ANSWER
Report Studio has been renamed authoring. It uses the same XML based report specification, report server and so on a Cognos 10.x but has a new, improved user experience. 

Cognos Workspace, which is Report Studio with a special user interface profile, no longer exists in the same way. The user interface profiles still exist but the authoring interface does not utilize them. We are working to determine if profiles should be move forward.
