PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We had to make a change in our code to add a function.   Which
   does the usual thing if no editable dependencies are present
   (that is, just find the nodes with the specified ids).  Then if
   there are no dependencies the code goes through the new function
   to get the set of nodes it would have gotten already; and if
   there are dependencies it will check for the "_edit" nodes first
   and return those if found.
