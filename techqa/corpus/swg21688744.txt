QUESTION
 How to instrument a custom Java application with ITCAM for J2EE? 

ANSWER
If you are using a Custom java app that doesn't use one of the standard supported J2EE servers like WebSphere, WebLogic, Tomcat, JBoss, etc.. and you want to monitor this custom java application/server, then follow these steps to monitor it. 

1. First find the main class being used in your application. In this example, am using the ThreadExample.jar. If I do jar -xvf ThreadExample.jar, this will extract out the directory and the MANIFEST.MF file. See screenshots here.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=1]
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=2]

2. Now look at the MANIFEST.mf file under the META-INF directory. You will see the Main Class being used here:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=3]

3. Now run the ITCAM configuration GUI and you will use the main class specified in the GUI. You will also specify the startup script being used to start the application/server. (Note: If you do not use a startup script, then you will have to modify the original startup script to use the JAVA_OPTS variable as shown in the example here..)

Here's the original startup script before the ITCAM modifications.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=4] 

Here's how the startup script gets modified with the ITCAM arguments in it.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688744&aid=5]

4. So when the script starts up now, it will use the JAVA_OPTS environment variable and use the instrumented ITCAM arguments when starting the custom java application.
