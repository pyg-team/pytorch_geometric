   AMQ8250: The 32-bit GSKit component is not installed.
   
   AMQ8250: The 64-bit GSKit component is not installed.
   
   GSKit is also not installed when selecting the client only
   option #4, and when installing the client only image.
   
   Users can work around this issue but explicitly selecting the
   GSKit component for installation.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When running pkgadd select options/packages 1 and 6.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users that have selected only the server or the client component
   with the expectation that this will install the GSKit component
   implicitly.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Solaris (SPARC),Solaris (x86-64)
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The Global Security Kit (GSKit) component of WebSphere MQ is not
   installed when only selecting the WebSphere MQ Server or
   WebSphere MQ Client libraries component during the Solaris
   interactive installation process.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The checking in the installation options script for solaris has
   been updated to ensure that all of the components that should be
   installed, are actually installed.
