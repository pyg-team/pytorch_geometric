ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Headline:
   
   Merged values not updated for state attributes, during graphical
   merge.
   
   
   Abstract:
   
   Attempts to perform a graphical merge for a statechart, results
   in the merged values for the state attributes not being
   displayed, in the comparison matrix.
   
   
   Description:
   
   When we try to perform a graphical merge using DiffMerge, it is
   observed that the merged values for a states attributes in a
   statechart are not updated in the in the comparison matrix
   opened by double clicking on any state.
   
   Ideally we would expect the merged values to also be displayed
   in the specific column. This behavior does not change even after
   making a selection from left or right. The graphical statechart
   window, however, shows the correctly updated merged values
   (specifically action on entry in this case.
   
   Workaround:
   
   No known workaround at this time.
