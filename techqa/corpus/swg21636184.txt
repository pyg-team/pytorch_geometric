Title: IBM WTX Node missing from Toolkit after upgrade from 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender integration with IBM WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit is broken by the 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2 upgrade. 

SYMPTOM
The WTX Node is no longer available in the palette. Existing flows display a place-holder for any WTX Nodes already on the canvas.


CAUSE
Key scripts and links are overwritten during the upgrade.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The .log file for the workspace may indicate a failure to load the necessary WTX files to properly init and display the WTX Nodes.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issue is resolved by re-running the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers installation.
