Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to use the 64-bit TM1 OLEDB provider to connect to a TM1 Server gives the following errors :

Test connection failed because of an error in initializing provider.
Authentication failed.
<TM1 server name> : The named server was not found
Login failed. Catalog information cannot be retrieved 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Verify that the following 64-bit modules have been installed from the TM1 Server x64 installation package (run a custom installation to see them in the list) : 

"/ Developer's Environment / TM1 API"
"/ Clients / TM1 Client / TM1 OLEDB Provider"

2) Verify that TM1api.dll, TM1dasrv.dll and TM1Ulibdll.dll are all present under C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1\bin (if default installation path is used)

3) From Windows Start/run menu, execute the following command :
regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1\bin\TM1dasrv.dll"

4) Look for the file "tm1p.ini" under
C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\Application Data\Applix\TM1\ (for Windows 2003)
or
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Applix\TM1\ (for Windows 2008) 
Open it in a text editor and look for "AdminSvrSSLCertAuthority"
This parameter indicates the path to the file "applixca.pem" which allows SSL connection with the TM1 Admin Server.
Its value should be :
AdminSvrSSLCertAuthority = C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1\bin\ssl\applixca.pem
If TM1 32-bit client tools has been installed too, then you may see :
AdminSvrSSLCertAuthority = C:\Program Files (x86)\Cognos\TM1\bin\ssl\applixca.pem
Whatever the path you set, make sure that applixca.pem is accessible in that path.
