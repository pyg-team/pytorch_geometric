APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When migrating to Portal 8.0.0.1, the file
   CacheManagerService.properties in the profile directory gets
   updated. A consequence of this is that with the next call of
   the config engine task "update-properties" resource
   environment provider (REP) entries for each of these new
   settings are created.
   
   This is not intended because REP entries should only be created
   for settings that deviate from the default. Adding REP entries
   with default values during migration would make administration
   more difficult for the customer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually delete these REP entries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
