APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Unlike events read by event readers, events processed by a
   policy launched by a policy activator are not processed by the
   event processor.  The implication of that is that in a
   normally-functioning cluster, events processed via an activated
   policy will only ever be processed on the current primary
   server.
   
   The Impact documentation should state this in order to avoid
   confusion.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Question re policy activator: Q: Why doesn't the policy      *
   * activator run on the secondary cluster                       *
   * member? Can I do anything about it?                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * It's expected behaviour that policy activators run only on   *
   * the primary.                                                 *
   *                                                              *
   * The only service normally active on a secondary server in    *
   * the cluster is the event processor.  The event processor     *
   * does not handle                                              *
   * events from policies activated by a policy activator, only   *
   * events read from event reader queues.  Therefore an event    *
   * processed via a policy activator will only ever be processed *
   * on the Impact server where the policy activator service is   *
   * running.                                                     *
   *                                                              *
   * There is no way of configuring this to behave differently in *
   * Impact itself currently.  However, it is possible to         *
   * activate a policy to run on the secondary by using a cron    *
   * job to run nci_trigger at intervals.  But the risk with this *
   * approach is that it will have no failover                    *
   * capability.  Another idea is to put the policies inside an   *
   * event reader of their own and set that event reader to have  *
   * a very                                                       *
   * long polling interval - the same frequency as your policy    *
   * activator.                                                   *
