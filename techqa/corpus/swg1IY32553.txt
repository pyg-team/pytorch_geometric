APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  if a POP that force a user to authenticate with user id andpswd
   is attached to a resource and this resource has or inherits an A
   CL that force for authentication than the defult login page is s
   howed instead of the step-up login page.
   The simplest scenario to reproduce the problem
   is to create a POP called step-1 that looks like
   pdadmin> pop show step-1
   Protected object policy:  step-1
   Description:
   Warning:  no
   Audit level:  none
   Quality of protection:  none
   Time of day access:  sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat
   :anytime:local
   IP Endpoint Authentication Method Policy
   Any Other Network 1
   .
   than attach to index.html page
   pdadmin> pop attach /WebSEAL/webs1/index.html step-1
   .
   Now if you try to connect to Webseal "webs1" then
   Webseal show the pagelogin.html while it should show the page
   stepuplogin.html.
   .
   If you try to replicate the same test on WebSEAL 3.8 than at thi
   s point the stepuplogin.html is correctly showed !
   .
   In order to make WebSEAL 3.9 to correctly shows the stepuplogin.
   html  you need to have an ACL ( directly attached or simply inhe
   rited ) that allow to Unauthenticatedread to that resource.
   In our scenario it is enough to modify the inherithed
   Default-WebSEAL with Trx to Unauthenticated as follows
   .
   pdadmin> acl show default-webseal
       ACL Name: default-webseal
       Description: Default WebSEAL ACL
       Entries:
           Group iv-admin Tcmdbsvarxl
           Group webseal-servers Tgmdbsrxl
           User sec_master TcmdbsvaBrxl
           Any-other Trx
           Unauthenticated Trx
   .
   Obviously this cannot be considered a workaround because in the
   POP itself there is no way to specify a restricted group or user
   s that can access to that resource..
   I mean to restrict the access to anly a group of users and to fo
   rce that group of users to step-up to user id and password it is
    necessary to have a combination of ACL and POP attached ( or in
   herited ) to that resource.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   In AM 3.9 we no longer check step-up if the ACL
    check fails.  We check the ACL first to implement the overrideb
   its for POP and rule policy...In PD 3.8 it was unintended that t
   he step-up status wasleft in the attribute list after an ACL fai
   lure.  If theACL check failed then it would override the step-up
    statusin which case the attribute was _meant_ to be ignored. In
   3.8 we also treated a step-up failure as a policy failure.Step-u
   p is supposed to be used to indicate to the clientthat the user
   has access to an object if their authen-tication level is approp
   riately stepped up.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   The product is working as designed.   Step-u
   p was not intended to be used as a switch-user funcationality.
