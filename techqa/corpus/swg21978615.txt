Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You may experience a slow response time when publishing a large project to Process Center. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To reduce response times when publishing, ensure that large projects are not being shared between IBM Integration Designer (IID) and Process Center. However, if you are publishing a larger project, do not set the flag for Open Synchronize Dialog when publishing to Always (Preferences->Business Integration->Process Center->Open Synchronize Dialog when publishing->Always).
