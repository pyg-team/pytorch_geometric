IBM Datacap 9.0.1 Fix Pack 2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FDatacap+Taskmaster+Capture&fixids=9.0.1.2-Datacap-WIN-FP002&source=SAR]


APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The PDFDocumentToImage action intermittently fails with an Out
   of Memory error, aborting the batch and causing all subsequent
   batches to fail until Rulerunner is restarted.  In testing, I
   found that this could be replicated in Datacap Studio and
   appears to be a conflict with the ConvertGrayToBW action.  When
   both commands exist in the task and the task is run repeatedly
   against multiple batches, the PDFDocumentToImage action will
   eventually start failing.  Monitoring CPU memory shows that
   there is no increase in actual memory usage.
