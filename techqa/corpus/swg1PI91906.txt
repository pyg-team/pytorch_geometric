APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abend0C1 at HLVSQLBN+X'000075FC' in the HLV Loader Server when
   invalid Virtual Table maps are found.
   When creating a Virtual Table from a Cobol Copybook, the mapping
   facility does some validation of the Cobol Copybook, but cannot
   catch all errors and occasionally a "bad" map is created. Only
   Cobol Copybooks that compile correctly in Cobol should be used.
