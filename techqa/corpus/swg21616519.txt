PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The SystemOut.log file might contain database errors and warnings when the first user logs on after the IBM Business Process Manager server has started for the first time. 

SYMPTOM
The log files might contain errors and warnings similar to the following examples: 

Errors: 

 * 
 * com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Error for batch element #1: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-803, SQLSTATE=23505, SQLERRMC=1;IBMBUSSP.NAVNODE, DRIVER=4.11.69
 * com.ibm.mm.server.persistence.rdbms.dao.ibatis.BaseDao insertPage BMWSD0429E: An SQLException was encountered while communicating with the database. Error code: -4,229, SQL State: null, Message: [jcc][t4][102][10040][4.11.69] Batch failure. The batch was submitted, but at least one exception occurred on an individual member of the batch.
   


Warnings:  * 
 * com.ibm.mm.server.model.persist.NLFModelPersistenceHandlerImpl loadRoot IGNORING EXCEPTION (BMWSD0104E: Error inserting page. user id: anonymous portal user page id: USER_NAVTREE_ROOT_OID000000000000000), RETURNING NULL
 * com.ibm.mm.framework.persistence.exceptions.DataBackendException: BMWSD0104E: Error inserting page. user id: anonymous portal user page id: USER_NAVTREE_ROOT_OID000000000000000 at com.ibm.mm.server.persistence.rdbms.dao.ibatis.NavigationDaoSqlMap.insertPage(NavigationDaoSqlMap.java:72)


ENVIRONMENT
These errors and warnings can occur in all environments in which IBM Business Process Manager or IBM Business Monitor is deployed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can safely ignore these particular errors and warnings, as they are harmless and do not affect the functionality of the server. Other errors and warnings in the log might indicate problems that need investigation.
