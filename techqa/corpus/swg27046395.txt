Ask the Experts session 
13 October 2015 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:02 General introduction 01:05 Panel introduction 02:15 Technical introduction 02:43 What is 'Web Server Administration'? 03:51 What are the components of the web server admin? 07:54 What is the difference between DMGR console and standalone WAS console? 08:48 How does the WCT affect the configuration of the web server admin? 13:58 What are the common problems? 18:58 Why does the plugin-cfg.xml contain both AppServer and WebServer ports definitions? 19:52 How can we ensure usage of Java 7 with the HTTP Server is compatibility with the settings of Java 6? 20:30 How best do we utilize virtual hosts definitions? Should it be One per AppServer or One per application or One per cell? 20:56 How do we define VirtualHostsGroups as they appear in the plugin-cfg.xml? They are different than virtual hosts in what way(s)? 21:44 What is the currently recommended, most secure, production cipher and server variables/setup configuration? Harold 22:44 When is it best to leave web server admin separate from AppServer admin? Are all setup and configuration functions accessible through either front end? 23:23 What is the 'best' way to protect the configuration? What is the 'best' way to backup and restore the configuration? 23:59 PCT Tools can only be installed using Root user. Is there any alternative to this restriction? See "Setting permission for the admin server" in Related Information for referenced URLs. 26:57 Server A host IHS instance and Server B and C host application server instance. One of the application server has DMGR. Is that possible? How do we manage this scenario? 29:09 Can you secure the IHS admin services over an SSL connection. If so, where can I found the instruction? See "Setting permission for the admin server" in Related Information for referenced URLs. 29:51 We are running WebSphere Application Server V7, IHS V7 and TLS V1.0. What do I have to do to upgrade to TLS V1.1 & 1.2? 33:08 Our application deploys to a cluster of 5+ members. If the application fails to come up or if it is experiencing a problem on cluster #1, how do we stop the requests going to appserver when the application is having issues on WAS server? 36:35 When I update the context root of an application I should generate and propagate the plugin using the admin console? 35:59 We've set in the Read/Write timeout (under the Web server plug-in properties) a negative value in case of maintenance of a node to force "down status" in a stopped node. Can we keep this configuration always on? 38:59 If we move IHS to another platform (ie. Linux), does this create an issue from a licensing standpoint 40:28 What is the recommended port for the IHS admin if the server is located on the DMZ? 41:21 Will PCT or WCT run in gooey mode WAS 8.5.5 in a Solaris environment? 43:44 Summary 44:15 Closing remarks 44:37 End of Call
