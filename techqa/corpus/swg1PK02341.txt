APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using a Work Statement List ( WSL) built by Object Comparison
   Tool, the new WSL EDIT displays contents inside a quoted string
   differently than SHOW EDIT.
   .
   DDL used for the source input to Compare contains statements
   for COMMENT on column of table which have many blanks at the
   end.  When this comment is placed in a WSL by Object Compare
   and then directly EDITed in the WSL, 0d15 / x'0d15' / CR NL
   characters are embedded inside the quoted comment string.
   They are displayed using hex on and were not part of the
   original comment.
