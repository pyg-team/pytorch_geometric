 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have installed Modeler Server 16 on Red Hat Linux 5 or Suse 10. My OS is up-to-date and has the latest libstdc++ library. Yet when I start Modeler Server I get the error:
Load of <native library> failed: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.9' not found 


CAUSE
The libstdc++ version required by Modeler Server is not in the standard RHEL repository, so Modeler Server does not find it.

ANSWER
Download and install the libstdc++ library manually and locally. This will not affect the system - it will only be used by Modeler Server. Here is how to proceed:


Building and adding libstdc++.so.6 for SPSS Modeler 16 on RedHat 5 and Suse 10

Modeler Server on Linux requires the GNU C++ runtime library libstdc++.so.6.0.10. The runtime is available to install on RedHat 6 and Suse 11 but it needs to be built from source on RedHat 5 and Suse 10. 

To build the runtime from source code:
 Download GCC 4.3.4 from: http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html [http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html]

 Unpack it to a working directory. For illustration purposes this note assumes this is /home/myusername/gcc

 Unpack the GCC 4.3.4 archive to this folder. This is the top-level GCC 4.3.4 source directory: /home/myusername/gcc/gcc-4.3.4

 After unpacking the archive, the instructions for configuring, building and installing GCC 4.3.4 can be displayed in a web browser. They are found here: file:///home/myusername/gcc/gcc-4.3.4/INSTALL/index.html [file:///home/myusername/gcc/gcc-4.3.4/INSTALL/index.html]

 Using the Package Manager or yum, install the prerequisites listed in the installation instructions. You will need root or sudo privileges to do this. Also install: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Download MPFR 2.4.2. It is available here: http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.4.2/ [http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-2.4.2/]  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Create a directory for build output. It should be separate from the top-level GCC source directory. Do not configure or build GCC 4.3.4 from the top-level source directory:  * 
 * 
 * 

 Create a directory for the GCC 4.3.4 installation. Do not install GCC 4.3.4 to its default location in /usr/local. Doing so might corrupt your system and it would be difficult to remove since it is not installed by a RPM package. The installation directory is required for the --prefix option of the configure command:  * 
 * 
 * 

 Export the CC environment variable. Either do this in the shell where the configuration and build processes will run or add it to your shell initialization script:  * 
 * 
 * 

 Configure, build and install the build of GCC 4.3.4, starting in the output directory:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Copy the C++ runtime library to the library folder of your SPSS Modeler installation. For this example I am using SPSS Modeler Server 16 installed at its default location. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Create a symbolic link for the C++ runtime library. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Copy the C++ runtime library to your SPSS Modeler Server /ext/bin/spss.xd/xdexe/lib directory. For this example I am using SPSS Modeler Server 16 installed at its default location. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Create a symbolic link for the C++ runtime library. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 If using IBM SPSS Modeler Text Analytics copy the C++ runtime library to your SPSS Modeler Server ext/bin/spss.TMWBServer/bin directory. For this example I am using SPSS Modeler Server 16 installed at its default location. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Create a symbolic link for the C++ runtime library. You may need to use the sudo command to do this:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

 Start Modeler Server
