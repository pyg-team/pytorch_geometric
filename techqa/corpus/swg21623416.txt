 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are messages not being inserted into the Report Distribution logs for the Deliveries and Bundles folders? Also, there are error messages output to the console or nohup.out file like "ARS6020E The database field 'rep_seq' was not found in the application group or it was not mapped to a folder field".


CAUSE
Report Distribution Facility (RDF) uses ARSDOC ADD to add logging messages into the Report Distribution logs. Content Manager OnDemand V9.0.0.1, the command ARSDOC ADD has a new requirement where you must have the folder fields mapped to application group fields. The RDF Folder definitions must be updated.

ANSWER
If you use RDF that update to Content Manager OnDemand V.9 fix pack 1 (9.0.0.1) must update the definition of the RDF folders: System Report Distribution - Deliveries and System Report Distribution - Bundles. Both Folders have a field named rep_seq which maps to the application group field. This field, by default, is not displayable or queryable. 

To update the Deliveries and Bundles folder definitions to create and map the rep_seq field, re-run the command: arssyscr -I <instance> -r
