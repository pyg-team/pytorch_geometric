APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem here is the XC034071 (spurious semaphore post). This
   occurs while the queue manager is waiting for a response from
   the logger and the task receiving the response exits relatively
   abruptly.
   This problem might also manifest itself as an XC034070, or an
   XC307050 FDC.
   
   Once the spurious semaphore post has occurred then the task
   receiving the exception is likely to terminate abruptly and it
   is possible that this will cause the queue manager to terminate
   abruptly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem is most likely to occur in an environment where
   there is high contention for the MQ recovery log, and very slow
   I/O times. Thus this problem could be exacerbated by slow I/O
   times for the MQ recovery log.
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When we wait for access to the logger I/O task then we
   establish a timer so that we can health check the system if the
   IO does not complete in a timely manner. This timeout is set to
   10 seconds. On a system where the timeout coincides with the
   semaphore being made ready by the previous owner of this lock
   then the semaphore can be multiply posted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The FIFO mutex code (only exploited by mqlpgild) has been
   updated to expect this multiple post to occur.
