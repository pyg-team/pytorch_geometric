APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the connection from Server Dashboards in Dashboard
   Application Services Hub (DASH) is set up to use the credentials
   of the user, and single sign on is in use, the user is unable to
   launch from the Server Dashboards pages to the TEP without
   re-authenticating to the TEP.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After installing ITM 6.3 and configuring for single-signon
   (SSO), launching to the portal from another application hosted
   by the Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) results in the
   portal logon panel being displayed. Since ITM has been
   configured for single-signon, this behavior is incorrect.
   WebSphere v8.x (WAS and eWAS), packaged with ITM 6.3 and JazzSM
   1.1, introduced a security feature to help prevent cross-site
   scripting vulnerabilities that involve access to domain cookies
   that encode user and session authentication credentials. This
   feature adds the HttpOnly attribute to domain cookies generated
   by WAS. A modern browser will prevent cookies tagged in this
   manner to be accessed by client-side script (e.g., javascript).
   When ITM is configured for single-signon (SSO), the portal, when
    deployed as a browser applet, relies on access to these cookies
    in order to successfully authenticate with the portal server
   without challenging the end-user with a logon panel. However,
   the cookie security enhancement introduced with WebSphere v8.x
   prevents the portal from gaining access to these authentication
   cookies, which results in the portal logon dialog being
   displayed whenever the portal is the target of a
   launch-in-context scenario (e.g., when launching to the portal
   using a DASH-hosted application).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To address this problem, the portal was modified to no longer
   use client-side javascript to access the authentication domain
   cookies. Instead, a request is now made to a servlet hosted by
   the portal server to access the authentication token generated
   by WAS.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The default use of the HttpOnly attribute can be deactivated
   from the WAS server via the WebSphere administration console.
   The property named
   com.ibm.ws.security.addHttpOnlyAttributeToCookies can be
   disabled from the Security &gt; Global security &gt; Custom
   properties panel by setting the property value to false.  All
   WAS servers defined in the same security domain that are hosting
    applications that launch to the TEP need to have this
   configuration change applied in order to enable the desired
   single-signon behavior.
