QUESTION
 Is it possible to customise the sidebar image/background in Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) component of Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM) application? 

CAUSE
Customer would like to change the sidebar navigation image in DASH to watermark it with the name 
of the environment, for example: DEV, TEST, PROD.

ANSWER
It is not possible to change the existing display of the Navigation bar in the current version of DASH. 

However to be hinted about the environment and know if the particular DASH is DEV/TEST/PROD, it is possible to achieve this by customising main DASH login page. Here it is possible to change login title and company logo etc
