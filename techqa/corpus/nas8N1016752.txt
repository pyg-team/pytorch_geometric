 When the Uninterruptible power supply delay time (QUPSDLYTIM) system value expires, does the iSeries system do a graceful shutdown? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the Uninterruptible power supply delay time (QUPSDLYTIM) system value expires, does the iSeries system do a graceful shutdown? 

It is similar to pressing the power button on the front panel of the iSeries system. It is good from a hardware standpoint; however, it is not good from a software standpoint. A power handling program is desirable.
