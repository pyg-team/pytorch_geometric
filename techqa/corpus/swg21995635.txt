RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The map visualization depends on WebGL being enabled in the browser. Also make sure to have the latest video drivers for your machine (for example, Firefox blocks old drivers [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Blocklisting/Blocked_Graphics_Drivers]) 

 

The following 3rd-party website can be used to verify if WebGL is enabled: https://browserleaks.com/webgl [https://browserleaks.com/webgl] 

The first two entries need to be marked as successful

Steps for Internet Explorer: 

Internet Explorer 11 has WebGL enabled by default, and it cannot be disabled. 

 

Steps for Mozilla Firefox: 

 1. Type about:config in the browser bar 
 2. Read and submit the "IÂ´ll be careful, I promise" message 
 3. In the search field enter webgl.disabled 
 4. Change the value to false

Steps for Chrome: By default WebGL is enabled in Chrome. If the test is not successful in Chrome, verify that Chrome is not started with the additional command line option --disable-webgl.
