APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a map using the PUT() to Wire function runs inside a BP
   with a small file that places records on the wire, it takes a
   few seconds to complete. When adding files of a larger value,
   the execution time increases from seconds to minutes or does
   not complete.

 *  WTXCQ - WTX0047839
   CH / CH
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   WebSphere Transformation Extender customers who integrate with
   Sterling Integrator
   
   Problem Description:
   Sterling adapter was used in the map that runs in cycles and map
   performance progressively decreased on data that takes more than
   a few seconds to process.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The reason for progressive performance degradation on map with
   Sterling adapter is that adapter connection was not reused.
   Fixed MAdapterImpl.compareConnection so that it is reused.  It
   is safe to return MConstants.MPI_CMP_EQUAL since adapter
   connection doesn't have specific state, like user credentials or
    protocol information.
   
   Applies to:
   8.4.0.5, 8.4.1.3, 9.0.0.0
   
   Fixed in the next service packs and releases.
