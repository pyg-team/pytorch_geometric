QUESTION
 Can you create an exact duplicate of an existing Maximo table using oracle syntax 

ANSWER
To create an exact duplicate of an existing Maximo table (oracle syntax)
1. create the table without the rowstamp column

CREATE TABLE newtable AS SELECT list of all columns except rowstamp FROM existingtable WHERE ROWNUM < 1;

(rownum < 1 causes select to fill new table with no data when created)

2. Import in configure. Configure will add ROWSTAMP and it's trigger. Configure this. 

3. Go back over the attribute definitions in Configure and correct the MAXTYPE and SAMEAS information and maybe remove text searching.

MAXTYPE should match source table definition for each attribute. All the VARCHAR2 types will be ALN, but some will be UPPER in source table and need to be changed to match. All numeric columns will be DECIMAL and some will need to be changed to AMOUNT to match. All date columns will be DATETIME and some may need to be changed to DATE or TIME to match. Configure this change before doing the SAMEAS changes below.

SAMEAS should match source table data . For all the attributes which have null sameas data in the source object definition, point the new object's sameas back to the source table. Every attribute of the new object should either point to the source object if source has no sameas value, or to the same value as source object has. Only the tablenameID column will have null sameas data.

SEARCHTYPE can be changed from TEXT to WILDCARD, EXACT, or NONE in order to remove the text index automatically created for any character column of length 25+. No need for text index if you do not plan to query on this table or on a specific character column.

Configure again to put the SAMEAS and SEARCHTYPE changes into effect.
