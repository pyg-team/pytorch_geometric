ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The jdbcora11.dll shipped with MQ  is not compatible with

   coordinator.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM MQ 7.5 and 8.0 who would like to configure MQ to
   coordinate transactions with an Oracle 12c database using JDBC
   on Windows.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Previously MQ did not ship a library to support JDBC connections
   to an Oracle 12c database on Windows.  This meant that is was
   not possible for MQ to coordinate JDBC transactions with an
   Oracle 12c database.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new file "jdbcora12.dll" is supplied with the IBM MQ 7.5 and
   8.0 Windows server installation image to support JDBC
   connections to an Oracle 12c database.
