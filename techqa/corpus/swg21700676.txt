Title: IBM Security Bulletin:  Vulnerability in IBM Java runtime affects IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability may affect some configurations of WebSphere Application Server used by WebSphere Service Registry and Repository. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138] 
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers.

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5 and 2.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Please note that the default configuration of WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Service Registry and Repository uses a "STRONG" or "HIGH" secure cipher list, which does not use RSA Export ciphers, so you would not be affected if you have not changed your ciphers. 

 

For advice on mitigating FREAK on servers which deviate from this default configuration, please apply the mitigations indicated in the WebSphere Application Server bulletin at [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613]http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613]. You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues.
