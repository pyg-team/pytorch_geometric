 HOW TO

SUMMARY

OBJECTIVE
The objective is to install the .NET Client on a Windows server or client machine.

STEPS


THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES THE STEPS REQUIRED TO INSTALL THE .NET CLIENT FOR CONTENT PLATFORM ENGINE (CPE) 5.5.0 OR 5.5.1:
 1.  Ensure that the .NET Framework 3.5.1 is either installed (Windows Servers) or enabled (Windows clients).
    
    Note that while the installation process requires .NET Framework 3.5.1, any .NET client applications must use .NET Framework 4.5.2 or above.
    
    
 2.  If upgrading to CPE 5.5.0 or to 5.5.1, if the .NET client is already installed, uninstall the IBM FileNet Content Engine .NET API program using the Windows control panel.
    
    
 3.  For a P8 5.5.0 installation, install the .NET client by launching Setup.msi instead of the 5.5.0-P8CPE-WIN.EXE program.
    
    The Setup.msi file is in the same folder as the 5.5.0-P8CPE-WIN.EXE program on the installation media.
    
    
 4.  For a P8 5.5.1 installation, install the .NET client by launching the 5.5.1-P8CPE-WIN.EXE program and select the .NET client option.
