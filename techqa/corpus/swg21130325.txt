PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides a brief overview of why syncs files may exist within a temporary directory after performing a syncreplica with IBM® Rational® ClearCase® MultiSite®. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

What are these syncs files? 

These files are created as a result of a syncreplica operation. These files are used as temporary place holders while ClearCase writes the cleartext and checks the data before importing. They are created in the form of syncs<pid> where the <pid> is the process id number of the pending import operation related to that packet. 


Where are these files typically found? 

ClearCase creates syncs<pid> files in a temporary directory. 

On UNIX® and Linux® operating systems this directory is typically /var/tmp 

On Microsoft® Windows® platforms, this directory is the directory specified by TEMP or TMP environment variable (default is "%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\TEMP") . 

 

Why are these files not removed? 

ClearCase normally deletes these files after the syncreplica operation is finished. 

If the syncreplica operation fails or is interrupted then the files remain. 

 

Can I remove these files? 

These files can be removed manually without causing any problem. Use the appropriate OS command, such as rm or delete.
