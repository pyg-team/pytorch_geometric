Title: IBM Can I use the Modify installation option to install Python when not done on first installation of IBM SPSS Statistics - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I installed IBM SPSS Statistics (for example release 23) on a Windows computer. I did not install Python and the embedded Python Essentials with this installtion.
Later, I decide to use Python with release 23 and thought I can just run the installer file again and use the 'Modify' option to install Python over the existing installation.
However, this does not seem to work, Python is not installed with this Modify option. 

ANSWER
This is functioning as designed. If you do not install Python on first time when you install IBM SPSS Statistics you need to uninstall the existing installation from Control Panel and then re-install the software with embedded Python this time.
An Enhancement Request was submitted (ID: ECM00212383) to eventually enable the modify option in this regards. Please note however, modify option is in general only available for Windows operating system. On other operating systems (Unix, Linux, Macintosh) there is no modify option and you must re-install the software in any case when you have not installed embedded Python on first installation.
