APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An SDA Agent connected to either a HUB TEMS or a Remote TEMS
   (i.e. IP
   xx.xx.xx.03) that is a higher version than the
   agent currently SDA installing (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.00) at either
   the HUB
   or this local Remote TEMS, can be mistakenly rejected
   as not being needed for SDA install.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Self Describing Agent (SDA) installation rejected.
   
   
   If a Self Describing Agent (SDA) connected to a monitoring
   server is a higher version (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.03) than another
   Self Describing Agent (i.e. IP xx.xx.xx.00) currently being
   installed on the monitoring server, then Self Describing Agent
   currently being installed can be mistakenly rejected as not
   being needed because it is backlevel. Multiple versions of a
   Self Describing Agent are allowed to be installed on the same
   system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been changed to properly install all unique
   versions.
