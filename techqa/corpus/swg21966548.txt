Title: IBM Users from multiple projects accessing the same network - United States

QUESTION
 Can you create a "public" network for users from multiple projects to access the same network in IBM Cloud Orchestrator using the --disassociate-project command? 

CAUSE
The version on Openstack in use with IBM Cloud Orchestrator 2.4.0.1 requires that every network must belong to exactly one tenant. 
If a network is not associated with any tenant, then the next tenant to deploy a VM using this network will be given ownership of the network.


ANSWER
It is not possible to make a "public" network using the --disassociate-project command. 


This command should only be used as a prerequisite step before deleting an unwanted network.
