APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  CSQX541E  Invalid CCSIDs for data conversion, 278 and 1208 for
   channel
   The cause of the CSQX541E error isrriConvertSPI tries to
   convert the 'SPQO' eyecatcher into ASCII when it is already
   in ASCII.

   ****************************************************************
   A client channel issues spiQuery to the server. The server
   creates a SPQO structure, and detecting that the channel is
   running from a client running in CCSID 1208 sets the eyecatcher
   in this CCSID.
   Prior to sending the response containing this structure,
   rriConvertSPI is called. This similarly detects the remote
   ccsid and converts any necessary fields to that ccsid. However
   it wrongly treats the SPQO eyecatcher as still being in the
   native ccsid, and attempts to convert it even though it is
   already in the correct ccsid. The conversion attempt fails
   and so CSQX541E is issued and the channel is terminated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  rriConvertSPI is changed to prevent it converting the SPQO
   eyecatcher which is already in the correct ccsid.
