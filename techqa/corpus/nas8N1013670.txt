Title: IBM NetServer Mapped Drives Time Out Causing User to be Re-Prompted - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes how to prevent NetServer mapped drives from timing out. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The i5/OS NetServer supports a time-out value. Default configuration settings are to allow inactive sessions to time out after a period of 6000 seconds. To change the time-out setting, do the following: 

1. Go to System i Navigator and expand My connections > connection name > Network > Servers. 2. Select TCPIP. 3. Locate i5/OS NetServer on the resulting list of TCPIP servers. 4. Right click on the NetServer and select Properties. 5. Go to the Advanced tab. Click the [Next Start] button. 6. Remove the check mark from 'Allow inactive sessions to time-out'. 7. Save the change. 
This change will take effect the next time the iSeries NetServer is restarted. 

Alternatively, the time-out value can be set to a higher number then the default 6000 seconds. 

Additional Note - added for searchability : 

The name i5/OS NetServer may be used interchangeably with IBM i NetServer, iSeries NetServer, OS/400 NetServer, or (older) AS/400 NetServer or AS400 NetServer.
