PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error messages are displayed from console view and from native_stderr.log when you start to profile the WebSphere® Application Server version 6.x with Rational® Application Developer (RAD) version 7.0.0.1. 

SYMPTOM
Error message from console view:

ADMU3200I: Server launched. Waiting for initialization status.
ADMU3011E: Server launched but failed initialization. startServer.log,
SystemOut.log(or job log in zOS) and other log files under
C:\Program
Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v61\profiles\AppSrv01\logs\server1
should contain failure information

AND

Error message from native_stderr.log in <Application_Server_HOME>\profiles\<profile name>\logs\server1\ :


The java class is not found: Files/IBM/SDP70Shared/plugins/org/eclipse/hyades/execution/win32/x86_4/2/0/v200606131519/

CAUSE
The profiling startup command for WebSphere Application Server does not recognize white space between "Program Files" correctly. This is a known issue, tracked as WebSphere Application Server defect 419160, and is being considered for fix in a future release.
