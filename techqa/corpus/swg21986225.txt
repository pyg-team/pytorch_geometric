Title: IBM Slow launch of Notes client on Citrix environment. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
How do you improve start up times of the Notes client on a Citrix farm?

CAUSE
When Notes is installed, a parameter called rcp.install.id, which is based on each instance of the unique client installation, is written to ...\Notes\framework\rcp\rcplauncher.properties. 

This value is different for every client that is installed on each Citrix server. 

Also, when the provisioning is complete an automated ID number is generated for the provisioning.manifest.version written to ...\Notes\framework\rcp\rcplauncher.properties. 

Example from the rcplauncher.properties 


rcp.install.id=1457451201430
provisioning.manifest.version=1457451175840 

 

 As numerous Clients are installed in a Citrix farm these values will differ across each individual Notes client. When load balancing is involved across the Citrix farms a user can be moved to another instance of the Notes client with a new rcp.install.id and provisioning.manifest.version. 

When notes is launched it will then begin to re-provision the client which will delay the launch .


ANSWER
Have the parameters "rcp.install.id" and "provisioning.manifest.version" from ...\Notes\framework\rcp\rcplauncher.properties manually set equal across all servers.
