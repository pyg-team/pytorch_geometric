PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your batch job receives error message IEC161I 002 (00000014 0000EE01 00000000 00000000) or an application receives a VSAM return code of 08 and an error code of 135 (X'87'). You are using CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR). 

CAUSE
Message IEC161I with return code 002 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.ieam700/idg31220.htm](RC02) and CICS VR return code 00000014 and reason code 0000EE01 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQJMU_5.1.0/dwwmd/noncvr.html] (RC14 RSNEE01), or a message from an application with a VSAM return code of 08 (RC08) and an error code of 135 (X'87'), can be received for one of the following reasons: 

 * If you have CICS VR 3.1 or higher installed, then the VSAM OPEN could not connect to the CICS VR sever address space. 
   
   
 * The FRLOG parameter in the catalog entry for one or more VSAM spheres updated by the batch job is set to FRLOG(REDO), but you do not have CICS VR V3.1 (or higher) installed. Setting the FRLOG parameter to REDO indicates that CICS VR VSAM batch logging should record updates made to the VSAM sphere on an MVS system logger log stream. If CICS VR V3.1 or higher is not installed, CICS VR VSAM batch logging is not available. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Verify that the CICS VR server address space is active. You can enter the following command from the console to determine the status of the CICS VR server address space:

DISPLAY SMS,CICSVR

If the CICS VR server address space is inactive, it can be activated by issuing the following command from the console:

VARY SMS,CICSVR,ACTIVE

Alternatively, you can redefine the data set without the FRLOG parameter, specify FRLOG(NONE), or use IDCAMS ALTER NULLIFY FRLOG to remove the FRLOG parameter. You might need to check your SMS Data Classes to be sure that they are setting the correct FRLOG value.
