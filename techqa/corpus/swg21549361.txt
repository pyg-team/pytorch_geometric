PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the purpose of UPSHA.exe (Yantra agent)? 

SYMPTOM
PART: Manifest 6.2 SP2 DCS

What is the purpose of UPSHA.exe (Yantra agent)? General information on UPS PLD file generation and process.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This process explains the steps involved in creating and uploading PLD files to UPS Server and the purpose of UPSHA agent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------

1) whbu030 : This reads data from DCS inserts into YCS tables : YCS_MANIFEST_UPS_HDR,YCS_MANIFEST_UPS_DTL
This changes the manifest status in shipment_manifest table from 02 (closed) to 03 (uploaded).

2) runPLDUpload: This creates 2 PLD files and ftps into the DestDir configured in ycs.properties file .

////////////////////////////////////////ycs.properties///////////////// /////////
# Ftp parameters. for UPS Host access
ycs.ups.upload.servername=10.56.0.241
ycs.ups.upload.port=21
ycs .ups.upload.UserID=upsupload
ycs.ups.upload.Passwd=Yantra4U
ycs.ups.upload .DestDir=/YantraPLD

3) UPSHA.exe :This is wrapper program around UPS host access and is used to send the PLD files from an NT/WIN2000 machine to the UPS server. This program uses UPS supplied PLD software API and therefore must be installed in the same directory on the NT/WIN2000 machine where UPS Host access software is installed. Users would then schedule the UPSHA.exe in their scheduler on the NT/WIN2000 machine to run everyday to process the day's UPS PLD files.

If you make any changes to the UPS Host Access configuration, these files should be copied over again into <YANTRA_UPSHA> directory.
Hafcnfg.cfg, Hafemsg.txt, Hafprxy.txt, Servers.ini, Webserv.ini

UPSHA agent automates the process of uploading PLD files into UPS servers .
