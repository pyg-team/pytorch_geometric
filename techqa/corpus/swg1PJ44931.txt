APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a user opens a case that contains a manually launched task
   in the ready state the "Start" and "Disable" buttons are enabled
   even when the user does not have permission to start or disable
   the task.  If the user does not have permission to start or
   disable the task, then Start and Disable should be disabled.
   When the user clicks the Start to launch the task will result in
   the following error:
   
   The following error occurred while processing a request on the
   application server: The requester has insufficient access rights
   to perform the requested operation.
   --------------------------------------------------
   An error occurred on the application server.
   Additional information about the error is in the application
   server log files.
   FNRPA0628
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create solution with a manually launched task
   2. Save and deploy solution
   3. Add 2 users to solution role, e.g. User1 and User2
   4. Change User2 to remove access permission to case folder for
   solution
   5. Login to case client as User1, create a case, save and logout
   6. Login to case client as User2, open case with task in Ready
   state
   
   Expected results:
   The Start and Disable are both disabled, since User2 does not
   have permission to start or disable the Ready task
   
   Actual results:
   Start and Disable are both enable.  User encounters an error
   attempting to start the Ready task

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Missing checks of current user permission and disabling the
   start and disable where appropriate.  Added code to only enable
   start and disable when the current user has appropriate
   permission.  This fix is included in 5.2.1.7-ICM-FP007 and later
   releases.
