TWSz SMF SMFPRM00 record type 90 DST Standard Time TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does the GMT automatically change? 

ANSWER
The answer is yes when the following SMF record '90' is detected as per the following documentation: 

-
Managing the Workload
- 
SC32-1263-06 
- 
pg. 301 
Time zones 
To avoid shutting down and restarting the Tivoli Workload Scheduler 
for z/OS systems for daylight savings time, set record 90 in member 
SMFPRMxx of the SYS1.PARMLIB. At daylight savings time, the time is 
updated automatically. See Updating SMF Parameters in the Planning 
and Installation for more information

Customizing GMT clock 
If you change the local time on a tracker, Tivoli Workload Scheduler 
for z/OS updates the GMT clock automatically as follows: 
1. 
It creates a new clock record and sends a Tivoli Workload Scheduler 
event to the affected tracker. 
2. 
The event triggers a refresh of the GMT clock. 
3. 
The event is also forwarded to the controller for synchronization. 
Note: 
The auto-detect function works regardless of whether the local time 
is changed using the set date or set clock command or using the sysplex
timer. The SMF type 90 record that is required to auto-detect the 
local time change is created regardless of how the local time is 
changed.

The information is applicable to DST and Standard Time.
