RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
How do I view detailed job information ?

 VIEWING DETAILED JOB INFORMATION (BJOBS -L) 
 The -l option of bjobs displays detailed information about job status and parameters, such as the job's current working directory, parameters specified when the job was submitted, and the time when the job started running. For more details on bjobs options, see the bjobs command in the Platform LSF Reference. 

 bjobs -l with a job ID displays all the information about a job, including: 

 *  Submission parameters 
 *  Execution environment 
 *  Resource usage 

 For example: 

% bjobs -l 7678  Job Id <7678>, User
