   The "Specifications and API documentation" topic contains
   tables that list, by product version, the specifications that
   apply to any type of application and specifications that apply
   to Enterprise bean (EJB) applications. These tables need to be
   updated to indicate that Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)
   1.2, and Enterprise bean (EJB) 1.1 specifications are
   supported in WebSphere Application Server Version 5.1, 6.0,
   and 6.1, but are not supported in Version 7.0.

   The following changes will be made to the "Specifications
   and API documentation" topic, which is contained in the
   WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0
   Information Centers:
   
   - The table of specifications and APIs that apply for all
   applications will be updated to indicate that the
   specification for Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) 1.2 can
   be used for applications that are running on WebSphere
   Application Server Versions 5.1,6.0, and 6.1 but not for
   Version 7.0.
   
   - The table of specifications and APIs that apply for
   Enterprise bean (EJB) applications will be updated to indicate
