Title: IBM Modeler 64 bit client does not work with Statistics 32 bit. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
After installing Modeler 14.1 64-bit client and Statistics 32-bit client on a 64-bit operating system, Modeler cannot find the Statistics install. Nor will any of the Statistics function within Modeler. 

The user will receive the error "Please run the Statistics License Utility"


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Having a 64-bit install of Modeler and a 32-bit installation of Statistics is not a supported configuration by IBM SPSS. In order to use the SPSS Statistics nodes from within Modeler, you will need to install the 64-bit version of Statistics. 

This is because the 32-bit API's of SPSS Statistics cannot be loaded by the 64-bit installation of SPSS Modeler. 

 

This limitation is expected to be documented in future releases of IBM SPSS Modeler.
