Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX when using the AS2 or WebDAV protocols. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX 2.5.0.0 - 2.5.0.3 iFix 7
Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX 2.4.4.0 - 2.4.4.0 Build 199

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
To ensure that the Diffie-Hellman export ciphers are not used in the AS2 or WebDAV protocols in Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX, do the following:

1. Bring up the Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX Administration Tool. 

2. Navigate to the Manage System / Define Configuration panel and edit each Protocol Definition name which uses HTTP or WebDAV and is secure (i.e. has a Cipher Strength other than “None”).

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3. You must restart Sterling Connect:Enterprise for UNIX to pick up the changes. 
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the Diffie-Hellman export ciphers will expose you to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
