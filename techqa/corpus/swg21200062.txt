PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using CA Top Secret with CICS and have an application that does a SIGNON and specifies the GMTRAN. You enter the USERID and PASSWORD on the SIGNON screen and the sign on process stops. 

SYMPTOM
CICS SIGNON processing stops with CA Top Secret.


CAUSE
The SIGNON program has a name of TSSPGM01 or TSSPGM02.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The application is written in command level and issues the EXEC CICS SIGNON command. It works fine as long as you have first done a CESN using DFHSNP as the program. If you specify the application as the gmtran, the sign on process stops on the SIGNON screen after entering a USERID and PASSWORD. If you escape the user transaction and do a CESN, the transaction then works on all terminals.

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21200062&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies Top Secret [http://www.ca.com] support said that Top Secret Security (TSS) will call user exit programs by the name, for example TSSPGM01 or TSSPGM02. In this case, after you issued the EXEC CICS SIGNON, TSS tried to issue the TSS messages, Top Secret checks to see if program TSSPGM01 was available, and it was, so links to it. If you change the name of your signon program to TSSSIGN or anything other than TSSPGM01 or TSSPGM02, the problem will be resolved.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the name of your SIGNON program to something other than TSSPGM01 or TSSPGM02.
