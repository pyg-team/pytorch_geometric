PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Cap 4.0 - File import get message : Could not find any files matching '?:\XXXXX 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Cap 4.0 - File import get message : Could not find any files matching '?:\XXXXX\*.XXX'. The system cannot find the file specified, then 'The component did not complete succesfully.' This seems to be a normal behaviour, but this is a big problem when you are using this in Capture Path that are automaticaly stated by Capture (using Polling Filter) as then it will stop waiting for someone to answer the message.

If in my file selection I put '*.*' then no error is reported (file import just finished with no file imported).

But if the file selection is '*.tif', then I get the 2 messages described in the subject.

Doing more test, I also found an interesting workaround :

My import directory is 'C:\fnsw\temp'.
If in this directory, I create another directory for example called 'damien.tif', then the file import do not report any error anymore when importing '*.tif'

I suppose than the reason behind this is that the system first check for anything corresponding to the file specification. If this return nothing, then we get an error. If it does return something, then the File Import component will be able to remove anything which is not a file.

It explain why the file specification '*.*' never return an error as from a command prompt, if you type 'dir *.*', it will return something (at least directories '.' and '..').
It also explain why creating a directory called 'something.tif' allow us to avoid the error.

My Customer is happy with the workaround.

I also created a product Suggestion so we can configure File Import to not generate an error message when there is no file to import.
