Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to collect and submit diagnostic data for DB2 problems on Smart Analytics or Balanced Warehouse systems 

CAUSE
Diagnostic data required to analyze DB2 problems on a Smart Analytics or Balanced Warehouse System

ANSWER
Support will require the following files which should be collected as soon as possible after a failure or error message has been detected: 

路 Details of command used leading to problem. 

路 Date/time of command execution if known. 

路 Identify if problem is related to a single data node or database partition 

路 Output from the db2support command. 

Generate the db2support.zip on the administration node and on the physical node where the trapped database partition resides using the command: 

 db2support <output dir> -s -d <database name> -c 

If you are facing problems on more than one node collect db2support.zip on all affected nodes. 

 

More details about the db2support command can be found in the Information Center for DB2:
