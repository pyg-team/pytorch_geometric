Title: IBM Portal v8 Installation fails with 'No locks available' message - United States

Text:
CRIMC1020E; No locks; NFS; unix; CRIMC1017E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
When attempting to install WebSphere Portal v8, the installation may fail when it is retrieving/reading the repository files. 

SYMPTOM
In the IIM output, you may see various errors like:

=================
CRIMC1086E: Failed to read artifact table of contents at
'/portal/repository/Setup'.

Cannot read the table of contents file from the repository. You
might have an issue with your network connection. A table of contents
file located under the atoc directory in the source repository might be
corrupted. If you retrieve the file from a machine or a network in your
environment, the file system might be mounted incorrectly.

Verify your network connection. If the source repository files
were transfered from a different location before the installation,
verify that the files were not altered during the transfer operation.
Copy the source files to a different file system and install from that
file system.

java.io.IOException: No locks available
=================


You may also see additional messages like this for various files:

===============
CRIMC1017E: Failed to locate plug-in
com.ibm.cic.check.agent13.update_8.0.0.201301231755.
CRIMC1020E: plug-in com.ibm.wps.offerings.check_8.0.0.201301231755 not
found
===============


CAUSE
The root cause of the problem is final exception in the first error listed above:

java.io.IOException: No locks available

This error is related to how the NFS drive that contains the repository files was mounted on the system.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem re-mount the NFS drive that contains the repository files, and include the "nolock" option in the mount command. 

IBM Installation Manager should then be able to retrieve the files.
