APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For a new rule project that is added to an existing decision
   service with dependancies, it has to stay connected to Decision
   Center while synchronizing the decision service.
   Disconnecting the rule project after publish it to Decision
   Center (keep connection entries) will introduce various errors
   afterwards in Decision Center while extracting project state,
   and pulling the projects from Decision Center into a new
   workspace.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make sure the rule project is connected to Decision Center
   during the synchronization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  We have a NullPointerException during synchronization with
   newly added dependent projects
   because if the sync branch is null this causes an NPE later on
   in ProjectBranch
   This can happen if the project was disconnected from Decision
   Center in RuleDesigner
   We need to retrieve the sync from the server project infos
   based on the main project.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
