PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Tivoli NetView for z/OS V5R2 users of    *
   *                 the Universal Agent.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The NetView 5.2 Univeral Agent is       *
   *                      connecting to the 6.1 Fixpack 2         *
   *                      version of the ITM framework. In        *
   *                      this environment, several workspaces    *
   *                      that should contain data do not show    *
   *                      any.                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The NetView V5R2 Universal Agent was packaged with ITM fixpack
   2. As a result, the NetView V5R2 UA will not function correctly
   with an ITM environment at fixpack 5 or above.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Instead of repackaging the NetView V5R2 Universal Agent with
   the ITM 6.1 fixpack 5 libraries, the fix for this problem is
   to ship the NetView V5R3 version of the Universal Agent, which
   has already been packaged with ITM 6.1 fixpack 5. The Universal
   Agent function has not changed between NetView V5R2 and NetView
   V5R3; as a result, they are functional equivalents.
   Note: Some splash screens and messages will indicate that the
   Univeral Agent is a NetView V5R3 agent -- as a result of this
   maintenance, this is supported under NetView V5R2.
   The fixes are included in the packages that are available for
   download from the URL that is documented in the PSP upgrade
   for the NetView for z/OS product release.
   On that web page, click on 'Download' and then "View all
   Download items" for a list of available downloads.
   The maintenance will be available on or before June 13th, 2008.
