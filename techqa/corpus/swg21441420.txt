QUESTION
 How do I provide JVM arguments for Rule Project launch configurations in Eclipse? 

ANSWER
Often we need to use certain VM arguments on the JVM that launches the Rule Project. For example, to increase the VM heap size for the Rule Project launch configurations in Eclipse. To do so, the following 2 steps are needed: 

 * Define a new installed JRE with default JVM arguments:
   -- Go to the Eclipse Window > preferences, in "Java > Installed JREs".
   -- Copy the current default JRE with a new name, for example myJRE.
   -- Select the new JRE and click on the "Edit" button.
   -- In the "Edit JRE" dialog, add your JVM arguments in the "Default VM Arguments" field.


 * Configure the Rule Project launch configuration to use the new installed JRE:
   -- Go to the Run Dialog > your Rule Project > JRE tab.
   -- Select "Alternate JRE" and choose "myJRE" in the drop down.


This will allow you to use a JVM that has a specific argument settings to launch your Rule Project.
