ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error message:
   ORB Timout CORBA.COMM_FAILURE vmcid 0x41540000 minor code 7
   completed: Maybe
   Once this error is experienced, all sorts of ORB error
   messages, transient failed etc. may also occur.
   A restart of the PE software will need to be done to get out of
   the situation and stop the ORB errors.
   The problem has been reproduced by creating a workflow that
   does a split followed by a collector step, and then a
   TerminateProcess.
   If a General step to a queue or a participant is placed before
   the termination of the workflow and after the collector step
   then the error does not occur. It appeared to go in a loop,
   trying to update the vwlog table and move the work item. This
   seems to be the cause of the ORBTimeOut.
   The common symptom is that the work item takes a long time to
   close when we click on the complete button in the form and the
   vwtrace grows with the same messages going in a loop.
   Actual Results:
   ORB Timout: CORBA.COMM_FAILURE vmcid: 0x41540000 minor code: 7
   completed: Maybe
   message is received. The vwtrace shows a looping of messages to
   update the vwlog and do a return and a terminate. The PE needs
   to be restarted to correct the problem as other ORB messages
   appear if you try to perform other activity.
