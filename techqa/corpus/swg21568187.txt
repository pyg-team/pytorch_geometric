PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Report tempates are added to the templates.xml and resources.xml but do not show up in Cognos Workspace Advanced. 

SYMPTOM
No user defined report template in Cognos Workspace Advanced.


CAUSE
The report template has to be enabled /referenced first to be available for Cognos Workspace Advanced. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The new report template in available for Report Studio but unavailable in Cognos Workspace Advanced.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Like for Report Studio in the resources.xml, the new user defined report template has to be referenced as well for Cognos Workspace Advanced.




This can be done by editing the "profile_bua_standalone.xml" file locates in the folder [C10_Installation_Folder]\webcontent\pat\profiles\ . 

Prerequisite: the new template must be already added to the templates.xml 

 

Steps: 

* Open the profile_bua_standalone.xml using a text editor 

* Search for the listView section in the file

* Add the reference to your new template: 

<listView id="New" action="show">
<listItem templateName="Blank"/>
<listItem templateName="List"/>
<listItem templateName="NewTemplate"/>
<listItem templateName="Crosstab"/>
<listItem templateName="Financial"/>
<listItem templateName="Chart"/>
<listItem isBrowse="true"/>
</listView>

* You may need to restart the Cognos service to make those changes take effect.
