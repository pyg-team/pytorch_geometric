PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error message on the impactserver-error.log " java.lang.ClassNotFoundException." 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The solution was that the package name in the policy was different from the jar file in the $IMPACT_HOME/wslib directory. Changing the package name in the policy to match the jar file name solves this issue.
