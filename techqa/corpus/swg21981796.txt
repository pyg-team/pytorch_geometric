Title: IBM Link to file does not open documents (fetch not working) in Watson Explorer Analytical Components (WEX AC) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After upgrading from Watson Content Analytics (WCA) 3.5 and exploring search results in the search application, the links to existing files do not open its respective documents in WEX 11 AC. This operation was working in WCA 3.5. 

Why is this happening and how can this be fixed? 

CAUSE
It is probable that "fetch" for documents under a specific crawl space is not working because its crawl space is not listed in $ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/vault.xml. All crawl spaces must be listed in vault.xml for a crawler to fetch documents but somehow it is missing after the upgrade.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Identify the crawler that is supposed to crawl the directory containing the needed documents
2. Remove the crawl space in the crawler for the specific directory
3. Add the directory to the crawler again
4. Make sure that vault.xml under $ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/ has the crawlspace element which is corresponding to the directory in question

If you can't find the crawlspace element in vault.xml even after you re-create the crawlspace, please create another crawler specifically for crawling the desired directory, then see if it appears in vault.xml.
