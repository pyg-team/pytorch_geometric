QUESTION
 How can I change the number of decimals shown in all tables when running means? I only want one decimal and it now shows three decimals. The default seems to be that it shows two more decimals than the number of decimals set in variable view so since I have one decimal set in variable view the table shows three decimals. 

ANSWER
Download the Python Essentials which includes Python as well as the Python Plug-in for your version of Statistics at IBM Developer Works [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/We70df3195ec8_4f95_9773_42e448fa9029/page/Downloads%20for%20IBM%C2%AE%20SPSS%C2%AE%20Statistics].

On this webpage, please use the appropriate link for your version of SPSS Statistics, 18 or 19. Download and save the Python Essentials file and install it.

When you install Python Essentials for Statistics 19.0 or 19.0.0.1 you will automatically get the Modify Tables Extension called SPSSINC MODIFY TABLES. 

For Python Essentials for Statistics 18 only, you will need to download the SPSSINC_MODIFY_TABLES.zip file and install it. Click on the Extension Commands link on the Developer Works site and go to page 2 to find this file. Download and save the file. It is a .zip file, so extract the files contained in the .zip file to the Extensions folder in your Statistics 18 install directory. From a Data Editor Window in Statistics, select Utilities -> Custom Dialogs -> 
Install Custom Dialogs. Select the SPSSINC_Modify_Tables.spd from the Extensions Folder and then Open. If successfully installed, you will receive a message stating that the dialog will appear the next time you start SPSS. 

Close Statistics and restart. 

Here is an example of how to change the number of decimals for specified columns in a Frequencies table. You can open the delivered sample Employee Data.sav file and run the following syntax if you want to test this out. So do File > New > Syntax and copy this syntax in. This syntax is changing to 3 decimal places on a Frequencies table for the Percent, Valid Percent and Cumulative Percent columns.

FREQ gender.
SPSSINC MODIFY TABLES subtype="Frequencies"
SELECT="Percent" "Valid Percent" "Cumulative Percent" 
PROCESS=ALL
/STYLES APPLYTO=DATACELLS 
CUSTOMFUNCTION="customstylefunctions.SetNumericFormatAndDecimals(decimals=3)".

You will need different parameters for the following: Subtype is the OMS table subtype that can be found from the Utilities > OMS Identifiers on the menu. SELECT is a list of one or more data columns or rows to modify. Decimals is how many decimals you want to display in the columns or rows.
