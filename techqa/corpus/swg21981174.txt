ENVIRONMENT
WAS 8.5, ICN 2.0.3, WorkPlaceXT 1.1.2.5 FP002 ,eForm 4.0.2 FP 15


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure Workplace XT is installed. 

 

Even though end users open eForms documents via IBM Content Navigator (ICN), ICN uses WorkplaceXT behind the scenes to access eForms templates and documents. So WorkplaceXT is required.
