PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides instruction on how to configure the IBM® Rational® Web Platform (RWP) so that it will coexist with Microsoft® Internet Information Server (IIS). 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To allow RWP and IIS to coexist on the same system, you need to use the IIS redirection facility to redirect specific URLs to RWP. 

As an example for this technote, we will use port 85 and IBM® Rational® Requisite® Web. 

 1. Configure RWP to listen on a port other than 80.
    For instructions on how to change the RWP default port please, see Technote 1143025 located in the related information section of this technote. 
 2. After changing the port, you will then be able to access RequisiteWeb which is hosted through RWP on port 85 using the following URL:
    http://hostname:85/ReqWeb 
 3. Start IIS. 
 4. Create an IIS virtual directory named ReqWeb and point it to a temp directory. 
 5. Update the properties of the ReqWeb virtual directory and configure it as "A redirection to a URL" and enter 'http://hostname:85/ReqWeb' as the URL 
 6. You will then be able to launch ReqWeb using the URL ' http://hostname/ReqWeb '. IIS will redirect to port 85. The address in the address bar does show port 85, but users can access ReqWeb (or ProjectConsole, ccweb.. etc.) without entering a port number.
