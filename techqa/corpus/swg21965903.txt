 Upgrading the VMware VI agent from earlier versions to 7.2.0.3 on Linux fails and shows that the error is a fix pack CD. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
During upgrade of the VMware VI agent from earlier versions to 7.2.0.3 on a Linux system, the following error is received:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please follow below steps to apply the attached install.sh: 

1. Navigate to the extracted installer.
2. In the agent directory of the installer (not the app_support directory), search for the install.sh and take a backup of it.
3. Replace it with the attached image.sh in the agent directory. Make sure install.sh has executable permission and try the upgrade.
4. Run the install.sh again to upgrade the VMware VI agent.
