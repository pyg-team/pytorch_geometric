Title: IBM Required permissions for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
minimum required permissions authentication TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are the required permissions for Datacap Taskmaster? 

CAUSE
Permissions are documented for each version of the Taskmaster software in its installation and configuration guide. A version of this is typically included on the software media and installed into \Datacap\Docs\Installation Guide. The install guides thoroughly document requirements for the Taskmaster software and should be used. This Technote is created as an unofficial and supplementary quick guide, and is preempted by the installation and configuration guide.

ANSWER
Taskmaster Server 

The account running the Datacap Taskmaster Server Service is configured through the Services control panel on that server. 

 * Full control to batches folder - Taskmaster Server will create new batches and if using Taskmaster Web, access batch files on behalf of the website. 
 * Full control to process or dco_<app> folder if Taskmaster Web or Microsoft Access databases are being used. Otherwise, no permissions are required. Taskmaster Server will access certain files on behalf of the website when using Taskmaster Web and the server needs to write to the databases and create their lock files. 
 * Read to lookup database (list population), if populating a list field from database, Taskmaster Server will access it on behalf of the website. Similarly, access may be required to the fingerprint database depending on validation rules or if using Taskmaster 7.6 and earlier. 
 * Read and execute to local \Datacap install folder.


Taskmaster Client and Taskmaster Client Service 

By default Taskmaster Client uses the user logged into Windows to access resources, this can be changed using the Datacap Executive Service or the Run As command to run Taskmaster Client. The account running the Datacap Taskmaster Client Service is configurable in the Services control panel on each Rulerunner. 

 * Full control to batches folder - Clients will read and write batch files. 
 * Full control on \<app>\process or \app\dco_<app> folder: Task related files like BPPs, INIs, etc., are read. Verify uses DCF files, typically stored in sub-folder verify. When using Access databases, the lookup or fingerprint database may be required. 
 * Read and execute to local \Datacap install folder. 
 * Read on \BPilot network folder unless all DCF file loads are local only. Generally this only applies for background processing. 
 * Taskmaster 7.6 and earlier (RRS) - read to \RRS\RRX and \RRS\libs\<app> network folders. The \RRS\RRX and \RRS\Libs\<app> folders on the Taskmaster Server or file server must be accessible by all clients. 
 * Taskmaster 8.0.0 and later - read to local RRS and server's \<app>\dco_<app>\rules folders. The \RRS\RRX files may be read locally unless configured otherwise through system registry or Datacap Studio. Clients access the rules sub-folder on the Taskmaster Server for rules processing. 
 * Taskmaster 8.0.0 and later - read to datacap.xml and .APP file on Taskmaster Server. Clients must be able to read the datacap.xml and \<app>\<app>.app files on the Taskmaster Server.


Quattro Rulerunner Service 

The account running the Datacap Rulerunner Quattro Service is configured through the Services control panel on each Rulerunner. 

 * Permission requirements are nearly identical to the section for Taskmaster Client and Taskmaster Client Service, except Quattro does not require access to Batch Pilot Project (BPP) and DCF files.


Taskmaster Web 

The account running Taskmaster Web is configurable through Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager in IIS 6 and later when using application pools. In IIS 5 isolation mode, the worker process identity is configured through machine.config. 

 * None to batches folder - Taskmaster Server will intercede on behalf of the website. 
 * Full Control on \<app>\process or <app>\dco_<app> folder: Resources such as BPP files are accessed by the Taskmaster Server. Any Access lookup databases, INI files, or similar resources will require access for the web site. 
 * Full control to TaskRun - Taskmaster Web must be able to read and write to the local \Datacap\TaskRun folder. This is where batch and process or dco_<app> files will be cached. 
 * Read and execute to local \Datacap install folder. 
 * Taskmaster 7.6 and earlier (RRS) - read to \RRS\RRX and \RRS\libs\<app> network folders. The \RRS\RRX and \RRS\Libs\<app> folders on the Taskmaster Server or file server must be readable by all clients. 
 * Taskmaster 8.0.0 and later - read to local RRS and server's \<app>\dco_<app>\rules folders. The \RRS\RRX files may be read locally unless configured otherwise through system registry or Datacap Studio. Clients access the rules sub-folder on the Taskmaster Server for rules processing. 
 * Taskmaster 8.0.0 and later - read to datacap.xml and .APP file on Taskmaster Server. Clients must be able to read the datacap.xml and \<app>\<app>.app files on the Taskmaster Server.
