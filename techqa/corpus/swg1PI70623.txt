APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running CICS 5.2 and have a CICS IPIC connection
   stuck in Freeing state. It never goes into Released state, and
   the region must be recycled to clear.
   A dump at the time the connection was in freeing state, shows
   a Tran number associated with an IPIC session, but this task is
   no longer in the system.  It issued the following message:
   DFHIS1025 APPLID Failed to attach mirror transaction xxxx on
            IPCONN IPIC. Error code is X'0619'
   This task tried to send an error response back to the client,
   but
   fails due to the connection being closed.
   There is a problem in this scenario, where we do not
   free up the session control block- ISSB. This leaves it on the
   active chain, preventing the IPCONN from ever getting to
   RELEASED
   state.

   ****************************************************************
   CICS region A and region B are connected via IPIC. The IPCONN is
   in ACQUIRE status. Region A send a DPL request to region B.
   The mirror transaction in region B is disabled. Transaction CSAC
   get attached instead of the mirror transaction. DFHACP attempt
   to send an IS7 with sense code 084C0000 with message DFHIS1025
   to region A. The send failed because the IPIC socket has been
   closed. The CSAC transaction terminates without FREEing the
   receive ISSB that was allocated to the task.
   .
   The SOCKET closed causes transaction CIST to be attached to
   release the IPCONN. During the IPCONN termination the orphan
   ISSB is found causing the IPCONN to remain in FREEing state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHISZA and DFHISIS have been changed to ensure that the receive
   ISSB used to send an IS7 response to the client region is FREE
   when socket domain returned an exception.
