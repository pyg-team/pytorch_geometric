Title: IBM Good morning transaction CESN in CICS/VSE 2.3 not showing GMTEXT message - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using CICS/VSE V2.3 and the good morning transaction CESN does not show the good morning text (GMTEXT) message like it does in CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA (CICS TS) V1.1.1. CSGM shows the message, but you have to enter CESN to get the signon screen. 

CAUSE
In VSE/ESA V2.3 and earlier CICS releases on VSE, transaction IEGM was used to LOGON. The screen included USERID and PASSWORD verification and could be easily modified. It was used to identify the currently used CICS (for example, TESTCICS, PRODCICS) to the end user using this screen. 

Since CICS TS was implemented, ICCF (IUI) can no longer be used under CICS/VSE V2.3. The only way to confirm the USERID and PASSWORD verification is to use CESN. However, if you use CESN there is no way to tailor the LOGON screen to identify the CICS region being used. When using CSGM, the end user must type in the CESN transaction id to get to the LOGON-screen.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
CESN is working as designed. However, APAR PQ93266 (which closed with a status of CAN or cancel) provides the code shown below. The patch is being supplied as a workaround with no warranty implied. It will display the GMTEXT in the message area of the CESN signon screen. For example, if the GMTEXT was "VSE ESA CICSOLD" then and CESN will result in following screen layout: 

 
CICS Signon
VSE ESA CICSOLD
