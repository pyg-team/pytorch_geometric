PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When upgrading Jazz for Service Management to Version 1.1.3.0 using Installation Manager, the installation fails with the following error:

Cannot run program "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin/wrapper.sh" (in directory "/space/IBM/JazzSM/ui/bin"): error=13, Permission denied [/space/IBM/JazzSM/install/tip/tipWrapp
erInstall.xml:215] 

CAUSE
During the upgrade process the non-root user does not have the correct permissions to run the shell script. This is due to the following:
1. Jazz for Service Management is installed as a non-root user
2. Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. 


The script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.

Usage: ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "IM_Install_Location" 
"JazzSM_Install_Location [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/ref/psc_r_pathnames.html]""[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]"

For example (showing default installation paths): ./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh "/home/root/IBM/InstallManager/" "/opt/IBM/JazzSM/" "/opt/Download/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml"


For IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. 
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.

For IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.
This argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.
