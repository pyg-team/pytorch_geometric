PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to execute a build from IBM Rational Team Concert integrated with IBM Rational Build Forge results in the Builf Forge agent error JVMSHRC017E Error code:-197210. 

SYMPTOM
In the build log, the following error will be seen:
JVMSHRC020E Error code:-197210, An error has occurred while opening semaphore


CAUSE
The JVM allows for classes to be cached and shared with multiple JVMs. If a JVM fails to connect to an existing cache file during startup, you will see errors similar to the one above. This should not cause errors or exceptions in the JVM itself; however, it could impact overall performance of the JVM.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct the inconsistencies in the cache, you must complete the following:



 1. Delete all files and sub-directories in/tmp/javasharedresources/directory.
    
    
 2. Re-start the JVM.
