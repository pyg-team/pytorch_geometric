APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In certain cases when the WebSphere for z/OS server has a
   non-daemon thread active during shutdown processing of the
   server an A03 abend is seen. The solution to the problem should
   be to ensure that all threads are daemon threads.
   .
   However, WebSphere for z/OS will provide a workaround to the
   A03 abend by giving the option of enabling a variable to
   suppress this abend. By default this variable will be off.
   .
   This apar will address this.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V7.0 for z/OS                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After issuing a STOP command for a      *
   *                      WebSphere Application Server for z/OS   *
   *                      server, one of the address spaces       *
   *                      terminates with an ABENDA03/ABENDSA03.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An ABENDA03/ABENDSA03 indicates that an address space is trying
   to terminate but a child task (thread) is still running.
   Occasionally it is possible for a WebSphere thread to hang as
   the server is stopping, which results in this abend.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An ABENDA03/ABENDSA03 is not issued by or handled by WebSphere
   and so cannot be directly suppressed by WebSphere.  Instead,
   code was added to detect hung threads during STOP processing.
   When a hung thread is detected that would result in an
   ABENDA03/ABENDSA03, WebSphere now abends the address space much
   earlier with an ABENDDC3/ABENDSDC3 and a new reason code of
   000C000B.  This avoids the long delay that would occur before
   the ABENDA03/ABENDSA03 is issued.  In addition,
   ABENDDC3/ABENDSDC3 is handled by WebSphere and so it is
   possible for WebSphere to suppress the dump.
   
   A new property, suppress_hung_thread_dump, was introduced.
   Setting this property to 1 causes dumps to be suppressed for
   ABENDDC3/ABENDSDC3 with reason code 000C000B.
   
   APAR PK78812 requires changes to documentation.
   
   NOTE: Periodically, we refresh the documentation on our
   Web site, so the changes might have been made before you
   read this text. To access the latest on-line

   The following changes to the WebSphere Application
   Server Version 7.0 Information Center will be made available
   in June, 2009.
   
   The topic "Application server custom properties for z/OS"
   will be updated to include the following description of the
   new suppress_hung_thread_dump custom property:
   
   suppress_hung_thread_dump
   
   Controls whether a dump is taken when an ABENDDC3 or an
   ABENDSDC3 occurs because a hung thread did not terminate in
   response to a STOP command.
   
   When a STOP command is issued for a server, a hung thread
   might fail to terminate, which causes an ABENDDC3 or an
   ABENDSDC3 to occur with reason code 000C000B. Setting this
   property to 1 prevents a dump from being taken if this abend
   occurs.
   
   Data Type          Boolean
   Default          0
   Used by Daemon          No
   
   The table in the topic "Changing the values of variables
   referenced in BBOM0001I messages" will be updated to include
   the suppress_hung_thread_dump custom property.
   
   The following information about the new 000C000B reason code
   for a DC3 ABEND will be added to the topic "Abend reason
   codes:"
   
   Explanation: A hung thread in supervisor state was detected
   during exit processing. Normally, this would result in a
   long delay as the address space shuts down before
   finally resulting in an ABENDA03/ABENDSA03.  The address
   space is being abended earlier in order to avoid this
   delay.
   Suggested Action:  For support, look up problem determination
   information on WebSphere Application Server eSupport page

   The following descripton of the a new C9C20040 error minor
   code will be added to the topic "Error minor codes:"
   
   Explanation: A hung thread was detected during exit processing.
