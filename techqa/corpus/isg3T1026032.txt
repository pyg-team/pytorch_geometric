Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenvSwitch affect PowerKVM - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 PowerKVM is affected by vulnerabilities in OpenvSwitch. IBM has now addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-9265 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9265]
DESCRIPTION: Open vSwitch is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the ofputil_pull_ofp15_group_mod function in lib/ofp-util.c. By sending a specially-crafted OpenFlow message, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127189 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127189] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-9263 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9263]
DESCRIPTION: Open vSwitch is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a flaw in the ofp_print_role_status_message function in lib/ofp-print.c. By sending a specially-crafted role status message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127187 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127187] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-9214 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9214]
DESCRIPTION: Open vSwitch is vulnerable to a buffer over-read, caused by an unsigned integer underflow in the ofputil_pull_queue_get_config_reply10 function in lib/ofp-util.c. By sending a specially crafted OFP message, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126418 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/126418] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-9264 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9264]
DESCRIPTION: Open vSwitch is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the extract_l3_ipv6, extract_l4_tcp and extract_l4_udp functions in lib/conntrack.c. By sending specially-crafted packets, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127188 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/127188] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
