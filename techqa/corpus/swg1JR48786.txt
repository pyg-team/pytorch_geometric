PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.1.1 and   *
   *                  IBM Integration Developer V7.5.1.1          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If you test the web service import of   *
   *                      your SCA module in Integration          *
   *                      Designer and the WSDL used the          *
   *                      xsd:attribute item, you receive an      *
   *                      error that the operation could not be   *
   *                      found in Integration Designer. Also,    *
   *                      in the server ¢â‚¬â„¢s FFDC log directory
   *                      there is a ClassCastException. The      *
   *                      error in Integration Designer and the   *
   *                      ClassCastException are caused by the    *
   *                      xsd:attribute not being fully           *
   *                      supported by the runtime environment.   *
   *                      The implementation class of             *
   *                      xsd:attribute item is                   *
   *                      BOAttributeProperty instead of          *
   *                      BOElementProperty. The implementation   *
   *                      class was not processed correctly       *
   *                      during run time, which created the      *
   *                      WSDL operation and caused the           *
   *                      operation to fail.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If you use the integration test client to test a web service
   import of your module application, and the web service import
   uses xsd:attribute item in its interface WSDL, you receive an
   error that the operation could not be found in Integration
   Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available to support xsd:attribute item during run
   time by creating the operation for the interface WSDL of the
   web service import.
