   CATPRODUCT
   .
   1)Open CATIAV5
   2)Open the provided process.
   3)Double-pick on the Part Operation to open it
   4)Attempt to swap the existing Product in the PO
   edit panel with another one (it happens to be the
   same name, but the Product may have already
   been updated)

   the File Selection panel that is presented.
   5)RESULT:  CATIA hangs.  This is the Error.
   EXPECTED RESULT:  CATIA should swap the

   .
   Note:  The original user left his workstation running
   in this state overnight.  When he came back the
   next morning, CATIA was still running, ie, it was
   hung.  On the laptop that was used to write this
   scenario, we killed CATIA after about 30 minutes.
   We took a snapshot of Windows system activity
   using the Windows Task Manager shortly before
   killing CATIA:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN
   CATIA
   .
   Incident Diagnosis
   This problem is due to the selection of
   the Optimized detection of design changes in the
   Machining-General-Design Changes tab of the
   Options dialog. This causes a comparison of the
   entire geometry of the old and the new products
   thus taking a very long time for the product
   replacement command to execute.
   .
   Restriction Explanation
   The Optimized detection of design changes option
   was provided mainly to allow replacement with a
   part coming from CATIAV4, or with a product that
   is New From the old one and not Save as.
   .
   By-Pass
   Execute the product replacement command by
   deselecting the Optimized detection of design
   changes option.
