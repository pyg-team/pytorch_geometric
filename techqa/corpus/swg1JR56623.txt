LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue occurs because an orphaned application remained in
   the deployment manager (DMgr) configuration folder.
   Orphaned applications are applications with artifacts remaining
   after an unclean uninstallation, meaning that the application
   has been uninstalled but the application's ear folder remains
   in the applications folder.
   
   The orphaned application prevents the new application from being
   installed, but there is no easy way to identify the orphaned
   application because the log does not clearly point to the
   culprit application nor the cause. The error says that the
   application installation failed, but it does not suggest the
   cause, making it very difficult for the system administrator to
   troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is targeted for inclusion into IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative
   fix 2016.12 that changes the application deployment logic to
   handle the existence of remains from previously failed
   installations and to complete the current deployment operation
   successfully.
