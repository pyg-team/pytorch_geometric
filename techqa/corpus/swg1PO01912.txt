ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Curam Child Welfare, during a Screening Assessment, the
   Javascript logic automatically reverts back to the previously
   checked answer but disables all answer options so the user is
   stuck without doing a reset. Also if the user subsequently
   attempts to change the answer by unchecking the previously
   saved checked answer the logic does not revert back to the
   original answer.

   CFSS-5946 - Unable to change answers formatted using check
   boxes in SDM assessments
   Previously, in a screening assessment if a user answered a
   question by selecting a check box and saved the assessment, on
   resuming the assessment the user was then unable to deselect
   the previously selected answer. This issue has been fixed and a
   user is now able to deselect the previously selected answer.
