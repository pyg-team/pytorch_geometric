ABSTRACT
 This WebSphere Support Technical Exchange Open Mic session explores customer questions on how to design, configure and maintain a WebSphere MQ clustering environment. This session also gives you the opportunity to interact with our panel of WebSphere MQ experts on the topic of clustering in WebSphere MQ. 

CONTENT
Open Mic sessions are conducted in a question and answer format. The table below provides a time index (minutes:seconds) to the recording and describes the questions or topics discussed. You can fast forward to any question using the time index, a table containing the panel of experts is also included.

Open Mic session 
10 December 2009 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EST 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:00 General introduction 03:56 Technical introduction 04:41 What are the best practices when setting up a cluster environment? 06:24 How many full repositories do I need? Is 3 better than 2? 07:00 Can my full repositories queue managers be used for running applications too? 10:15 In what order should I migrate my cluster queue managers? 13:52 How can the three types of aliases be used in a cluster? 17:30 How should I plan for maintenance? 20:36 Are there any risks or issues in having one queue manager as a partial repository in 10-20 different clusters? 22:15 What would be a good way to monitor the health of the cluster? Would you suggest channel status on the cluster sender channels or depth on the system.cluster.transmit.queue? 24:35 What is the current best practice when you need to change a cluster channel attribute (i.e. the connection name)? 27:00 Are there any benefits to building additional channel or manual sender/receiver channel within the WebSphere MQ cluster environment? 29:36 What are the best practices when using multi-instance HA queue managers and clusters? 30:21 Do you recommend the use of multi-instance queue managers and clusters for high availability? 32:03 I was just wondering if you were talking about the partial repository when you mentioned about changing the hostname? I also didn't hear the answer for a full repository. Additionally, would you not want to remove that queue manager from the cluster for making that change? 32:56 Is there a way for workload management to stop/decrease load when sending messages to one of the clustered queues where messages are not being consumed? 34:21 From a perspective of system reliability and a reduction of maintenance issues, would it be better to move the application queues to be hosted by partial repositories and switch the connection setups for the applications so that they connect to a full repository? That way messages will migrate to the cluster queues on the partial repositories and be consumed by application from there? 39:03 What are the main considerations for designing an MQ clustering environment? 43:09 If I am using queue aliases, do I only cluster the queue alias, and leave the queue local non-clustered? 46:50 If I have more than one full repository in a cluster, do I have to define cluster sender channels from partial repositories to each full repository? 47:55 Does each user that is used by application needs to be authorized to access the cluster transmission queue in order to write messages to the remote cluster queue? 49:21 Closing remarks 51:37 End of Call
