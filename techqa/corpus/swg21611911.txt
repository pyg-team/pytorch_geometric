Title: IBM SAP 7.1 Agent fails to start - United States

Text:
5724B97SOTR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Agent is deployed and configured, but fails to start due to missing SAP RFC libraries. 

CAUSE
SAP RFC Library file is required to start the SAP 7.1 monitoring agent. Steps to download RFC libraries from SAP Market Place web site are described in the User Guide. If these steps are not followed, the agent is unable to start.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check agent log and look for errors indicating failure to load RFC library.


For example:
Could not load program /opt/IBM/ITM/aix526/sa/bin/ksaagent: 
Dependent module librfccm.o could not be loaded. 
Could not load module librfccm.o. 
System error: No such file or directory 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two options to resolve this issue.
Option 1. Redeploy the agent as per instructions to incorporate the RFC libraries.
See detailed instructions in Related urls for SAP 7.1 Agent deployment with SAP RFC library.

Option 2. Download the SAP RFC library for the agent platform and then manually copy it to the agent host in the path of the agent. 
On Unix based platforms, copy SDK Library file to $CANDLE_HOME/{Interp}/sa/lib
For example, on aix526 platform the path to place RFC library is %CANDLEHOME%/aix526/sa/lib. 
On Windows platform copy the library to %CANDLE_HOME%/TMAITM6 for 32-bit architecture, or to %CANDLE_HOME%/TMAITM6_x64 for 64-bit architecture.
