APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type: Field
   Approver: JM for XS
   Severity: 2
   Reported Release: 623 FP2
   Compid:  5608A41CI Distributed Installer
   Abstract: Remote Deploy of KQ7 agent from 6.2.3 MS Apps CD will
             deploy and configure at ITM release 6.2.3 FP1, but
             fails at 6.2.3 FP2.
   Environment:
     Windows only. Appears to be a regression from 6.2.3 FP1 to
     6.2.3 FP2.
   Problem Description:
     See abstract. This error also occurs when either silent
     install or Remote Deploy is used to install and automatically
     configure the agent with default settings.
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Install ITM 6.2.3 FP2 on the endpoint.
     2. Addbundles for the MS Apps CD release 6.2.3 IIS Agent code
        KQ7 to an existing TEMS that the endpoint in 1 connects to.
     3. Deploy the KQ7 agent to the endpoint.
     4. The deploy should configure the instance and allow the
        agent to connect to the TEMS but it doesn't.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure the KQ7 agent at the endpoint via Manage Tivoli
     Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS-kinconfg.exe).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Remote deployment of ITCAM for IIS 6.23 agent (KQ7) fails to
   configure at IBM Tivoli Monitoring release 6.23 FP2.
   
   
   When remote deploying the IBM Tivoli Composite Application
   Manager for Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Agent
   version 6.23, if the endpoint is a Windows system and the IBM
   Tivoli Monitoring OS agent on the endpoint is version 6.23 FP2,
   the ITCAM IIS agent is incorrectly configured and the agent is
   not started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to correctly configure the agent.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
   
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0004
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Reconfigure the ITCAM for IIS Agent (KQ7) agent on the endpoint.
