 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client could expose sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2861 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2861]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale uses weaker than expected security to encrypt data which could allow an attacker that is able to capture network traffic to decrypt sensitive information. This vulnerability only applies to the WebSphere eXtreme Scale client, and only when WebSphere eXtreme Scale is used as the provider for the WebSphere Dynamic Cache. 
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112657 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112657] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 
CVEID: CVE-2016-0400 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0400]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input when processing malicious requests. This vulnerability only applies to the WebSphere eXtreme Scale client, and only when WebSphere eXtreme Scale is used as the HTTP Session Cache provider. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers containing unicode characters and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112655 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112655]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
