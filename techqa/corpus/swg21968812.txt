QUESTION
 How do I gather the amm service data from the N100x, N200x, N300x appliance 

ANSWER
To gather the amm service data, use the following command:
/nz/kit/bin/adm/ibm_amm --loc=spa1.mm --service_data=spa1-sdc.tgz

The above example will gather the service data from spa1 and write the spa1-sdc.tgz in your current directory.
You can change the location spa and output file name if needed if collecting from other than spa 1 and multiple service data's.
