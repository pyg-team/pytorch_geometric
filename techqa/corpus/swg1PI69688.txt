APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the Launcher is triggering from an Oracle database in a
   multi-threaded environment, it may be observed that sometimes
   the connections get crossed in certain threads, and incorrect
   information is retrieved from the database.
   
   Sending this information to child maps via the RUN() function,
   then highlights the issue as they fail with a 'one or more
   inputs was invalid' error message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TXRTC - 59212
   PB / PB
   Circumvention: None
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender customs who use Oracle adapter
   triggering and the burst mode
   
   Problem Description:
   If the input map triggers using Oracle database adapter and it
   uses burst mode and there are other cards or RUN maps using the
   same database, a connection sharing maybe invalid resulting with
   unexpected data to be returned from the database.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Correct connection sharing logic in the Oracle adapter is fixed.
    The connection will not be shared if it is used for bursting on
    the input side.
