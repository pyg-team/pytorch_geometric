APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Approver:PB
   
   Environment: ITM Linux OS Agent 6.30
   
   Problem Description: For each property in the DLA template a
   list of invalid values is provided. They are filtered out from
   the produced iDML book thus avoiding incorrect machines
   reconciliation. In the case of Linux running on KVM hypervisor,
   the dmidecode command used to retrieve the SerialNumber may
   return a value, "Not Specified", which is not in this list.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The tmsdla template for the ITM OS agent for Linux, called
   klz_tmsdla.xml,  is filtering out the UNKNOWN serial number with
   the lines:
   
             <tmsdla:filter name="SERIAL" exclude="UNKNOWN" />
   
   If needed, the file can be customized, and you can add a line to
   filter also the NOTSPECIFIED serial numbers as follows:
   
             <tmsdla:filter name="SERIAL" exclude="UNKNOWN" />
             <tmsdla:filter name="SERIAL" exclude="NOTSPECIFIED" />
   
   Please change the file klz_tmsdla.xml accordingly and verify the
   results.
   Note that there are two places in the  klz_tmsdla.xml file where
   the filter is occurring. Please change both places.
   
   IMPORTANT: if you want to save the unmodified  klz_tmsdla.xml,
   please save it in a different directory, becayse the tmsdla
   command processes all the .xml files which are found in its
   directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem Description: Reconciliation issues due to invalid Serial
    Number from KVM Linux servers
   
   Problem/Problem Summary:
   For each property in the DLA template a list of invalid values
   is provided. They are filtered out from the produced iDML
   book thus avoiding incorrect machines reconciliation.
   In the case of Linux running on KVM hypervisor, the dmidecode
   command used to retrieve the SerialNumber may return a value,
   "Not Specified", which is not in this list.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added filtering instruction in the ComputerSystem CDM object
   definition to exclude the new invalid value:
   <tmsdla:filter name="SERIAL" exclude="NOTSPECIFIED" />
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance package:
   
   | FixPack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0002
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually add the above instruction next to <tmsdla:filter
   name="SERIAL" exclude="UNKNOWN" /> in the klz_tmsdla.xml file
   located under the "tmsdla" subdir of your Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal Server installation.  Then run the tmsdla command again.
