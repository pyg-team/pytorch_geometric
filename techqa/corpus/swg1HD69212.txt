COMMENTS
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 17.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 19 GA level AND ON
   V5R18SP03
   .
   Scenario reproduced on reported R17SP03 level.
   Scenario not reproduced on above mentioned
   levels.
   .
   Incident diagnosis:
   Reported scenario can be classified in three sub
   scenario:
   1. The cause of warning message while update
   mode is Automatic
   2. Why warning message not displayed in Manual
   Update mode?
   3. Warning message displayed in English while
   working with Jap OS with Jap CATIA.
   .
   Correction Explanation:
   1. There is slight gap between input elements of
   Intersection. This gap can be checked with connect
   checker. The warning message is displayed as
   Intersection also gets updated. This message can
   be displayed while its creation
   2. During 'Manual Update' when point parameter is
   changed, only point feature update is called. So
   warning message of Intersect is not thrown. Later if
   we call update on Intersect feature manually then
   the feature is correctly updated without any error;
   only warnings are not thrown. This is because no
   command is active at this point. (Normally, warning
   message throws if any command is active while
   update. In automatic update, Point function is
   active while updating hence warning message
   displayed)
   3. We have provided correction with this APAR to
   translate the warning message in Japanese
   language when OS and CTAIA are in Japanese.
   Correction is available on above mentioned level.
