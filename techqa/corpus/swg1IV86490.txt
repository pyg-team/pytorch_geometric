ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  regarding this piece of documentation -
   
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHRK_4.2.0/itnm/
   ip/wip/visualize/task/nmip_vis_searchfordevices.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSHRK_4.2.0/itnm/ip/wip/visualize/task/nmip_vis_searchfordevices.html]
   
   The first part regarding memory requirements for client-side
   JRE is no longer relevant since applets were removed for ITNM
   4.2 UI components. The second part regarding a warning on
   numbers of devices needs to be expanded to be clear that "You
   can change this value or, alternatively, turn the warning off."
   using the setting topoviz.hopview.tooManyDevicesWarningLimit in
   the topoviz.properties file. Changing the value from the
   default of 500 changes the threshold at which the warning is
   raised; setting the value to 0 switches the warning off.

   This typo should change from $NMGUI_HOME to $NC_HOME as this is
   the "live" directory.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  description about JRE for client-side can be ignored.
   
   In the path:
   $NMGUI_HOME/precision/platform/java/lib/ncp_topoviz/etc/tnm/tnm.
   properties, $NMGUI_HOME should be replaced with $NC_HOME

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Doc will be updated in FP1.
   Note: Specifying a greater number of hops can dramatically
   increase the number of devices to display in the Network Hop
   View GUI, especially in LTE networks. Network hop views
   containing large numbers of devices can take a long time to
   draw. In order to avoid excessively long times for network hop
   view layout, the system first determines the number of devices
   that will be returned by a Network Hop View GUI search and
   provides a warning with an option to exit if the view will
   return more than a default value of 500 devices. You can change
   this value or, alternatively, turn the warning off. For more
   information on changing or turning off the device limit, see
   Configuring the warning about number of devices in the Network
   Hop View.
