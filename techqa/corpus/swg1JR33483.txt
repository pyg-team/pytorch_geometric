   Eclipse ant creates a different classloader to run the ant
   scripts. The problem is that with WID, the JRE contains xerces,
   during builds the plugins use the xerces plugin to load the
   xmls. The problem occurs when the is run on the main thread, the
   classloader does not pick up the xerces plugin rather uses the
   xerces that comes with the JRE, causing a class case exception
   that's wrapped in the CoreException.
   
   The solution is the create our own classloader that uses the
   plugin classloading first before loading the classes from the
   JRE.
   
   The code changes are in com.ibm.wbit.comptest.ant.
   There are 2 new classes RunAntWidPreferences.java and
   WidAntClassloader.java
   The RunAntWid.java class was updated to use those classes.
