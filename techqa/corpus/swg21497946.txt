Title: IBM User accounts locked out after entering one wrong password, logging into Workplace - United States

Text:
com.ibm.websphere.security.ldap.retryBind; Account locked out; Workplace; entering wrong password once TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 LDAP User accounts get locked out when you enter the wrong password while logging into FileNet Content Manager through Workplace 

SYMPTOM
User accounts get locked out after one wrong password is entered even though the LDAP password security policy is setup for four incorrect password attempts


CAUSE
In the case where: 

 * Multiple LDAP servers configured or 
 * A system is setup as a failover environment or 
 * LDAP failover is configured by associating a single hostname to multiple IP addresses through the use of a load balancer 


then, entering an invalid password can cause multiple LDAP bind retries. 

With the default settings in WebSphere, the number of LDAP bind retries is equal to one more than the number of associated IP addresses, so a single invalid login attempt can cause the LDAP account to get locked. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A custom property can be set in WebSphere so that LDAP bind calls are not retried. 


To configure the property: 

 1. Login to the WebSphere Admin Console 
 2. Go to Global Security 
 3. Select Standalone LDAP registry and click Configure. 
 4. Change the password for bind DN on one LDAP server 
 5. Update the new bind DN password to WebSphere Application security runtime by calling resetLdapBindInfo with the bind DN and by using its new password as a parameter. 
 6. Add the following custom property: com.ibm.websphere.security.ldap.retryBind property to false
    

When this property is set to false, WebSphere does not retry LDAP 
bind calls. RELATED INFORMATION
