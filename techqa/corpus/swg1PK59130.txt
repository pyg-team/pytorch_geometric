PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Server Users of        *
   *                 version 6.1.X.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The connection Factories are not        *
   *                      available during application            *
   *                      deployment in the step "Bind message    *
   *                      destination references to administered  *
   *                      objects "                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the user declares a connection factory for a Messaging
   Resource the Connection factory is not available during the
   deployment of the application in the step " Bind message
   destination references to administered objects " even if the
   connection factory is defined at an appropriate scope.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been modified to include the Connection Factories
   also while displaying and validating the appropriate resources
   in the scope at which the application is being deployed for
   the step " Bind message destination references to administered
   objects ".
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   cumulative fix pack 6.1.0.17.
