ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem title
   
   Lotus Notes Client Freezes when used with Citrix XenApp5 Windows
   2003
   
   Problem description
   
   In various situations a Citrix Server Desktop session stalls and
   the Citrix Desktop session not reconnect-able.
   
   
   In the following scenario, this happens frequently:
   
   
   A> Lotus Notes Client 8.5 Basic in a Citrix Published Desktop
   
   Steps to induce the problem:
   
   1) Citrix Desktop open on single screen resolution 1366-768 with
   Lotus Notes maximized
   
   2) Session gets disconnected because of a network disconnection
   
   3) Client computer is connected to a docking station with an
   external screen at resolution 1920*1200
   
   4) Client computer regains connectivity to the network, Citrix
   client reconnects the disconnected session
   
   5) The reconnected session appears with the previous resolution
   1366*768
   
   6) The Citrix Desktop session is resized either by using the
   options available from the Citrix Client or just by maximizing
   the window
   
   7) The window frame is resized but the Desktop session becomes
   unavailable.
   
   Additionally only the former active part of the window still
   shows data, the regained areas in the windows appear in black
   and or white.  Resizing the session again to its original size
   doesn't help
   
   The desktop is unavailable to work in, no updates are shown, no
   manipulations can be done anymore
   
   In a few situations it helps to KILL all notes sessions, then
   the user is able to reconnect
   
   In those situations where it doesn't help, reconnecting from a
   different computer might work.
   
   In any other situations, the session is actually lost and can't
   even be
   logged off anymore by the Citrix Administrator.
   
   Preventive steps
   
   * If a user minimizes his Notes windows clients, he will not
   have this problem unless he works in the 8.5 Standard version.
   In the latter we have been able to reproduce that very same
   problem.
   
   
   B) Lotus Notes Client 8.5 Standard Citrix Desktop session.
   
   The behavior is different when using Lotus Notes 8.5 in a
   standard configuration - with some users it seems more stable
   with others less ...  very odd behave.
   
   Basically it comes down to the same as in A) but differs in the
   following:
   
   - In the preventive actions we said that minimizing would solve
   99% of the unrecoverable issues.  This is not true when using
   the Standard Notes Client.
   
   
   
   Technical details:
   
   * Windows 7 and Windows XP as client operating systems
   
   * Windows 2003 32bit SP4 Standard operating system
   
   * Citrix XenApp 5.0
   
   * Citrix client 12.1.0.30
      ->  Configured to allow Audio and Video configured in
          32bit/16bit
   
   * Lotus Notes Client 8.5.2 Basic and Standard installation
