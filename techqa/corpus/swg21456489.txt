 FIX README

ABSTRACT
 Fix pack installers for IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server 7.1.1 are incremental for the Java version and full installers for the .NET version. 

CONTENT
The first fix pack for IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server 7.1.1 has been released.
Customers who use IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server on Microsoft Windows with Active Directory and SQL Server will find the update as a full product installer on Passport Advantage [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm], and on the physical media.

Existing customers who use IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server on a J2EE application server can download an incremental installer for the fix pack from Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].

New customers who either download the product from Passport Advantage or purchase the DVD, and who wish to use IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server on a J2EE application server will find a full product installer (version 7.1.1, one for UNIX and one for Windows) and a corresponding incremental installer to upgrade to the fix pack (version 7.1.1.1, one for UNIX and one for Windows). Customers must upgrade to the fix pack before using the application server bundles supplied in the eAssembly and on the Product DVD. The application server bundles supplied in the eAssembly and on the Product DVD should not be used with the base product 7.1.1.

Customers using IBM WebSphere Rule Team Server 7.1.1.1 must also upgrade their complementary products (IBM WebSphere JRules, IBM WebSphere Rules for .NET) to the same fix pack level.

See the download documents for information on obtaining the installers.
