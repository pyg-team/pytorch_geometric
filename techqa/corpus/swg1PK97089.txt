   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users who are using the report viewer portlet in 3rd party   *
   * portals.                                                     *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Viewing reports in 3rd party portals does not benefit from   *
   * the browser cache when the report viewer portlet is visited  *
   * again in the same browser session. This affects the          *
   * perfromance of the viewer portlet because the browser will   *
   * always request all the required resources even if they're    *
   * cached.                                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When running reports in 3rd party portals, the viewer portlet
   uses the "meta" tag to redirect the request to the viewer.
   This seems to causes IE to always issue a request to
   validate/retrieve resources when those are loaded by the Viewer.
   Changing the way we do the redirect to use a javascript function
   instead gets around this issue and IE will not request the
   cached resources.
