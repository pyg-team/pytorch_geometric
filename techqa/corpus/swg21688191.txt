_BESClient_UsageManager_EnableAppUsageSummaryApps parameter: 
-: 
3. In the navigation bar of the Endpoint Manager console, click

Important: You can click the Action Script tab to view or modify the script. The Common Inventory Technology scanner has several configurations that define its operation. The default configuration specifies, for example, which files and directories are examined during software scans. 

To be able to gather software data from the endpoints, import the Common Inventory Technology catalog. 
Procedure 
1. Import the software catalog. 
2. In the top navigation bar, click Management > Catalog Updates. 
3. To download the fixlet file to your computer, click CIT Catalog Download Fixlet. Choose the location where you want to save the catalog_download.bes file and click Save.

5. Enable Application Usage Analysis: 

10 Application Usage Statistics Site: IBM Software Inventory 



In the SUA UI make sure that Application Usage is configured :

verify the SUA > Management Application Usage Properties is set correctly 
Registry Properties is set correctly 

1) Verify the Windows Application Usage setting: 
From SUA 2.1 Management > Application Usage Properties 
Click on the "Application Usage Properties" 
Click on the "Windows Application Usage" under Name in the upper right 

Look in the bottom right pane: 

"Edit Application Usage Property” section 

In the Name* Field, should be "Windows Application Usage" 

The "Datasource Property*" should show the following highlighted 

Application Usage 
IBMSoftwareInventory 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688191&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688191&aid=8]

2) Check the Windows Installed Packages 
From SUA 2.1 UI > Management > Registry Properties 
Click on the Registry Properties 
Click on the "Windows Installed Packages" in the upper Right pane. 

Check the "Name*" field , should default to "Windows Installed Packages" in the bottom right pane 

The Datasource Property* should show the following highlighted 

Installed Windows Applications List 
IBMSoftwareInventory 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688191&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688191&aid=9]

Verify that the clients are collecting Application Usage data. 

From one of your clients, check to see what is in the following directory, this is the default path to the BES Client folder. 

C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\__BESData\__Global\UsageData 

Do you see any .stat files? there should be one for each running process on the client if this is set correctly. 
If you do not see any files or just a couple, check the following Registry: 

using Regedit 

Check: 
HKEY_SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\BigFix\EnterpriseClient\Settings\_BESClient_Usagemanager_EnableAppUsageSummary 

Value = 1 


Check: 
HKEY_SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\BigFix\EnterpriseClient\Settings\_BESClient_Usagemanager_EnableAppUsageSummaryApps 

Value = -: (there can be several configurations for this, the "-:" specifies to collect Application Usage Data for all processes on the client) 


The BES Client will check the computers process list every 5 seconds and update the .stat file for each process.


After the upload scan data for both the CIT and ITSIT scanners make sure the LMT/CIT/<compID>_citlog.xml file is uploaded to the server. In this example this is the data from a client whose computer ID is 10494614:


C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\UploadManagerData\BufferDir\sha1\14\10494614
