Text:
refresh cache taskrun TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error occurs after completing a task in Taskmaster Web:

Unable to refresh from cache data file \Datacap\TaskRun\[folder]\[file]

Ex: Unable to refresh from cache data file C:\Datacap\TaskRun\mqqbh0akqrasms55whrhjmfy\tm000001.xml 

SYMPTOM
Data changes during Taskmaster Web verification / indexing are not preserved.


CAUSE
Updates to batches are performed by Taskmaster Server on behalf of Taskmaster Web, and the account running the Datacap Taskmaster Server Service has insufficient permissions to the batches directory.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this, the account running the Datacap Taskmaster Server Service must be granted read and modify permissions to the batches directory for sharing and security.
