Title: IBM Error in Java Shared Class Cache - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes an error you will see if the class cache becomes corrupt or cannot be accessed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The IBM Technology for Javaâ„¢ JVM allows for classes to be cached and shared with multiple JVMs. If a JVM fails to connect to an existing cache file during startup, you will see errors similar to the following in the joblog: 

...
JVMSHRC020E An error has occured while opening semaphore
JVMSHRC017E Error code: -302
JVMSHRC028E Permission Denied
...

This should not cause errors or exceptions in the JVM itself; however, it could impact overall performance of the JVM. To fix the cache, you can do the following:



1. Delete all files and sub-directories in /tmp/javasharedresources/ directory. 2. Re-start the JVM.
