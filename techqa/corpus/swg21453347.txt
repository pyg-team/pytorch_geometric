Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 At runtime, receiving a warning message 'Variable "variable name" is over 10MB and is too large to log' in WMC under job information.



SYMPTOM
The logging level for the orchestration is set to 'All' and the variable has more than 10 MB of data


CAUSE
This is just a warning message stating that the size of the variable is more than 10 MB and it will not log it in the appliance as this will occupy disk space.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This message can be safely ignored as long as the orchestration runs fine and is it recommended to keep the logging level for the orchestration to 'Error values' for the orchestration to avoid disk space issues.
