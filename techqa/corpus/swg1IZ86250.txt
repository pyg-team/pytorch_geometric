LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When adding support for shared work items as described in the
   WPS InfoCenter at
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/c
   om.ibm.websphere.bpc.doc/doc/bpc/t2mig_shared_work_items.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/topic/com.ibm.websphere.bpc.doc/doc/bpc/t2mig_shared_work_items.html]
   the migrateWI.py script will fail with an error like the
   following if Business Process Choregorapher
   was configured with an Oracle "thin-style service name" URL:
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@//<host>:<port>/<service_name>.
   
   Set serverName=//mydbserver from
   URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//mydbserver:1521/BPEDB.
   Set databaseName=1521/BPEDB from
   URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//mydbserver:1521/BPEDB.
   :
   Exception received:
   java.sql.SQLException: The Network Adapter could not establish
   the connection
   Caused by oracle.net.ns.NetException: The Network Adapter could
   not establish the connection
   Caused by java.net.UnknownHostException: //mydbserver
   migrateWI.py finished with an error.
   
   The data migration script, migrateDB.py will experience a
   similar failure.
   
   After applying this interim fix, the script will be able to
   parse the "thin-style service name" URL correctly.
