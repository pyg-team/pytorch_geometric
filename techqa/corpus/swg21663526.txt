Title: IBM Guardium STAP message "Not FIPS 140-2 compliant" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the STAP event log in the GUI you see an entry like LOG_ERR: Not FIPS 140-2 compliant - use_tls=0 failover_tls=1. 

CAUSE
FIPS 140-2 is a US government security standard for cryptographic modules. If you see this message it indicates that the STAP is configured in a way that does not meet the standard. 

Note - This message does not indicate any error with the STAP

If you wish to enable FIPS compliance, the guard_tap.ini file must have:


 * use_tls=1
 * 
 * failover_tls=0


Any other combination will turn off FIPS mode and result in the message as above. 
ENVIRONMENT
You will only see a FIPS message if FIPS mode is implemented on your STAP type. As of April 2013 and subject to future changes: 

 

 * 
 *  
   - all Solaris 
   - all AIX 
   - all Linux, except for PowerPC (RHEL 5 ppc64 and SUSE 10 ppc64) 
 * 
 * 
 * not 
 * 
 *  
   - Linux - Red Hat 5 PowerPC and SUSE 10 PowerPC 
   - HPUX 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can change the configuration by one of the methods below: 


A - In the GUI->Administration Console->STAP Control page. 

 * 
 * 
 * 


B - Edit the guard_tap.ini file on the DB server directly and restart the STAP. 


NOTE : If you do not want to use TLS in your environment it is safe to ignore the message.
