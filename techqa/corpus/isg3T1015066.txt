PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What does the error message about scheduling module in mbschd.log mean? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


We are currently seeing the error below in mbschd.log . What seems to be the problem?

“Dec 12 07:39:40 2007 7890 3 6.2 Do not have plug-in license for scheduling module (/_TOOLS_/.distS/platform-lsf-6.2/all/6.2/sparc-sol7-64/lib/schmod_mc.so), will not load it.”

This message means that MultiCluster plug-in could not be loaded due to lack of license. Plug-in MultiCluster is needed when you have multicluster setup. 

If this is not the case, try commenting out "schmod_mc" in lsf.modules under "LSF Top dir/conf/lsbatch/ /configdir " and reconfig your cluster using "badmin reconfig”.
