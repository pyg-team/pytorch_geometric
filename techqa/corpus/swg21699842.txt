QUESTION
 Are ITCAM for AD v7.1 (YN and HT) agents supported with ITM 6.3 at any maintenance level? 

ANSWER
Combinations of YN/HT 7.1.0.x.y agents and ITM 6.3.0.w.z infrastructure components (TEMS, TEPS, TEP) are supported.

ITCAM for AD 7.1 was packaged with ITM 6.2.2. As a general rule, ITCAM for AD 7.1 (any maintenance level) supports any ITM levels starting from the one packaged with the product, so ITM 6.2.2, 6.2.3 and 6.3 at any maintenance level in this case.

It is anyway a best practice to use latest maintenance levels of ITCAM for AD 7.1 agents with latest maintenance levels of ITM.
