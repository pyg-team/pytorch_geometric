Title: IBM Not seeing Cognos Import nodes in C&DS 6.0 job. - United States

Text:
WebLogic extensions Cognos BI source node collaboration job cluster script TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer has a stream that has a Cognos BI source node. When they save the stream to the repository and place the stream in a C&DS 6.0 job, they do not see the source node under the Import tab of the job. 

SYMPTOM
Customer has a stream that has a Cognos BI source node. When they save the stream to the repository and place the stream in a C&DS 6.0 job, they do not see the source node under the Import tab of the job. Performed the same action using a XML source node, we do not see the XML source node in the C&DS job either. 


CAUSE
The customer was using a custom startWebLogic.sh to start his C&DS 6.0 WebLogic cluster. The custom script did not have the setCDSEnv.sh in it which we documented in the C&DS Administrators guide. See details below. In this case the Modeler Adapters get called using the setCDS.Env so the modeler extension libraries were not being loaded.

ENVIRONMENT
Linux

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
WebLogic
For single WebLogic server configurations, use the following scripts provided with the repository server
installation:
<repository installation directory>/bin/startserver.bat
Â© Copyright IBM Corp. 2000, 2013 9
<repository installation directory>/bin/startserver.sh
The WebLogic application server can also be started using your preferred mechanism, but you must
ensure the correct environment variables and Java properties are set. To assist with this process, the
configuration process creates the following scripts in the toDeploy/current directory:
v setCDSEnv.cmd or setCDSEnv.sh
v startCDSWebLogic.cmd or startCDSWebLogic.sh
v startManagedCDSWebLogic.cmd or startManagedCDSWebLogic.sh
If you selected automatic deployment during the configuration, the files are also copied to the domain
and <domain>/bin directory. Inspect these files to determine which environment and Java properties must
be set. The specific properties will vary depending on installed IBM SPSS adapters. If you are starting
your server using a startup script, you can call setCDSEnv.cmd/ from that script. If you are
using node manager or some other mechanism to start the server, make sure to define the equivalent
settings.setCDSEnv.sh


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
WebLogic Administrator needed to add the setCDSEnv.sh to his startWebLogic.sh start up script.
