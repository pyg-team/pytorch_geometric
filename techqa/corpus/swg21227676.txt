PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) to electronically download Rational® Application Developer for WebSphere® Software from the Web, there are many electronic images available for download, but you might not need to download all the images for your needs. This technote describes what each image contains in more detail to help you understand which files you need to download. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Rational Application Developer is available for both the Windows® and Linux® Operating Systems. See the product's installation guide for supported versions of these operating systems. There are 13 parts available to download but only the first two are required, the rest are optional. 

Required parts:

Part 1 - Core installation files 
Windows - C81CIML
Linux - C81CXML
This extractor utility reads the image files and creates the installation files and directories.

Part 2 - Core installation files 
Windows - C81CJML
Linux - C81CYML
This is the core of Rational Application Developer and is required. This package includes most of the typical product functionality:


 * Java™ application development 
 * Eclipse plug-in development 
 * Source code management adaptors  * CVS 
    * ClearCase®
   
   
 * J2EE™ application development  * JSP™ & Servlets 
    * JSF 
    * Portal toolkit 
    * Struts 
    * EJB 
    * Web Services 
    * Java Connector projects (CICS®, other legacy systems) 
    * XML 
    * J2EE server support  * WebSphere Application Server versions 5.x, 6.x 
       * Apache Tomcat versions 3.2, 4.x, 5.0
         Note: This provides connectivity to these servers; however, the servers must be installed separately and are not included in this part.
      
      
   
   


Optional parts: 

Part 3 - WebSphere Application Server version 6 Test Environment 
Windows - C81CKML 
Linux - C81CZML 
This part contains the WebSphere Application Server version 6 Test Environment (WTE). Most users want this part as it provides the server to test J2EE applications created using Rational Application Developer. This is the base edition of WebSphere Application Server version 6.0 and has all the same functionality of a stand-alone base edition WebSphere Application Server version 6.0 installation. 

Part 4 - EGL tools 
Windows - C81CLML 
Linux - C81D0ML 
This part contains Enterprise Generation Language (EGL) tools and is needed only if you plan on utilizing EGL. 

Part 5 - Language Pack 
Windows - C81CMML 
Linux - C81D1ML 
This part contains the language pack for Rational Application Developer and is necessary only if you will be running RAD in a language other than English. 

Supported languages:  * French 
 * Brazilian Portuguese 
 * German 
 * Simplified Chinese 
 * Italian 
 * Spanish 
 * Japanese 
 * Traditional Chinese 
 * Korean


Part 6 - WebSphere Portal v5.0 Test Environment 
Windows - C81CNML 
This contains the WebSphere Portal version 5.0 test environment. This will be needed to test Portal applications. However, if you plan to use the WebSphere Portal version 5.1, there is a WebSphere Portal version 5.1 test environment which is a separate installation and requires a separate license. 

Part 7 - Agent Controller 
Windows - C81CPML 
Linux - C81D2ML 
This part contains the Remote Agent Controller (RAC). This is needed if you plan to be testing from RAD on a remote WebSphere Application Server (WAS) version 5.x. 

The RAC is also necessary for profiling on WAS versions 5.x and 6.x. 

The RAC is not necessary for local testing on WAS versions 5.x or 6.x and is also not necessary for remote testing on WAS version 6.x. 

Part 8 - Legacy Test Environments 
Windows - C81CQML 
Linux - C81D3ML 
This part contains older WebSphere Test Environment versions such as 5.0 and 5.1. These are needed only if you are planning to deploy to these versions of the server. 

Part 9 - Embedded MQ 
Windows - C81CRML 
Linux - C81D4ML 
This part contains the Embedded MQ client and server. This is necessary only if a full version MQ is not available and the MQ simulator will not suffice. If a full MQ is installed, then do not install this part. 

Part 10 - Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Professional Edition - English 
Windows - C81CSML 
Linux - C81D5ML 
This part contains Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Professional Edition. Crystal Reports provides a framework for displaying reports of data using JSP or JSF web applications. The professional edition provides its own server. 

Part 11 - Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Professional Edition - Japanese 
Windows - C81CTML 
Linux - C81D6ML 
This is the Japanese version of Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Professional Edition. 

Part 12 - Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Embedded Edition - English 
Windows - C81CUML 
The embedded version of Crystal Reports generates the reports on the J2EE application server rather than running its own server. 

Part 13 - Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Embedded Edition - Japanese 
Windows - C81CVML 
This is the Japanese version of Crystal Reports Enterprise v10 Embedded Edition.
