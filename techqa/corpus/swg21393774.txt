Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the possible cause for the error message "Too many open files" on the resource manager? 

SYMPTOM
Documents are not storing on the resource manager and a set of error messages similar to the following are found in the resource manager log file. 

ICMRM:ERROR 2008-09-11 16:52:56.122000 context: [WebContainer : 310] - java.io.FileNotFoundException: /lbosf01/lbosdata/00001/42/L1.A1001001A08I11A95134B84725.V1 (Too many open files) - getInputStream(FileSystem.java:311)
java.io.FileNotFoundException: /lbosf01/lbosdata/00001/42/L1.A1001001A08I11A95134B84725.V1 (Too many open files)

ICMRM:ERROR 2008-09-11 16:52:56.117000 context: [WebContainer : 295] - java.io.IOException: The process file table is full. - getOutputStream(FileSystem.java:166)
java.io.IOException: The process file table is full.
at java.io.File.createNewFile(File.java:876)


CAUSE
They key to determining if this document applies to your situation is the third error that contains the text "The process file table is full."

This error indicates that the WebSphere Application Server that the resource manager application is deployed on does not have a large enough thread pool defined for the WebContainer to support the number of concurrent users storing and retrieving from the resource manager.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Increase the WebContainer thread pool maximum size to a number large enough to accommodate your workload. 

For example, on WebSphere Application Server 6.1: 

1. Log on to the WebSphere Application Server administration console at the following path: 

 * 
 * http://rmhostname:9060/ibm/console


2. Navigate to Servers > Application Servers > server1 > Thread Pools > WebContainer and increase the Maximum Size = xxxxx threads.
