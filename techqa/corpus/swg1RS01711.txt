APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When trying to generate a RuleApp from a migrated repository
   (to 8.5 and later versions), the following error is seen:
   "Cannot generate RuleApp".
   This is because the Ruleset table in the Decision Center
   database is not correctly updated after migration from previous
   releases. Starting with the 8.5 release, the main branch is
   stored in the database using value '%current_key'.
   The migration script should update columns that contain the
   main branch name to use this new value.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run the following SQL query in migrated database to update
   baseline name in ruleset table :
   update Ruleset set baseline = '%current_key' where baseline =
   'current' ;
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The issue is due to an incomplete migration to 8.5. the main
   branch used by default was named current and is now named
   %current_key and it needs to be updated in the database
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The migration code is updated. Apply the script in workaround
   for repository already migrated.
