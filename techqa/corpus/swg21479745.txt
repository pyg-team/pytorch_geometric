Title: IBM Omitting within-subjects by between-subjects interactions in repeated measures in SPSS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is there a way to omit the interaction of within-subjects factors and between-subjects factors when running a repeated measures ANOVA in GLM within SPSS? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
GLM will always include the within-subjects by between-subjects interactions in a repeated measures model.

There is a way to fit models without such interactions in SPSS. You can restructure your data and use the mixed linear modeling procedure (MIXED) to run a model that doesn't include the interaction. All of this can be done through the menus. In this solution, we'll show you command syntax that will do the trick using the data file Anxiety 2.sav, which comes with SPSS.

First, here is the command syntax for the original GLM model. Recall that this syntax will estimate a model that includes the trial-by-anxiety interaction.
_________________

GLM
trial1 trial2 trial3 trial4 BY anxiety
/WSFACTOR = trial 4 Polynomial
/WSDESIGN = trial
/DESIGN = anxiety .
_________________

Now, here's command syntax that will restructure the data for analysis using MIXED. 
_________________

VARSTOCASES /ID = subject
/MAKE y FROM trial1, trial2, trial3, trial4
/INDEX = trial(4)
/KEEP = anxiety .
VARIABLE LABELS y ''.

Finally, here's the command syntax for using MIXED to estimate the repeated measures model without the trial*anxiety interaction.

MIXED
y BY anxiety trial
/FIXED = anxiety trial
/REPEATED = trial | SUBJECT(subject) COVTYPE(CS).
