 When you configure the database and LDAP for the virtual appliance with SSL, you receive SSL handshake failure messages. 

SYMPTOM
Messages similar to

The signer may need to be added to local trust store "<path>/cacerts" located in SSL configuration alias "DefaultSystemProperties" loaded from SSL configuration file "System Properties". The extended error message from the SSL handshake exception is: "PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target" 

are displayed in the Application Server System Out log.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can ignore these messages.
If you want to get rid of these messages: 

 1. Download the certificate from the host and port that was specified, such as isim.in.ibm.com:8878. For example, openssl s_client -showcerts -connect isim.in.ibm.com:8878 </dev/null | openssl x509 -outform DER > <path>/isim-8878.cert 
 2. Add it in the application truststore. Click Configure > SSL Certificate Management. 


If these messages are displayed on a member node:  1. Download the certificate and upload it on the primary node. 
 2. Synchronize the changes on the member node.
