ANSWER
This error occurs when installing the JViews component in IBM Decision Optimization Center 3.9 on Windows 10. 

There are two ways to get around this: 

 

1. Install IBM Decision Optimization Center 3.9 without checking the JViews component, the installation will go through. 

Then install JViews manually:
- launch <DocInstallPath>\Developer\redist\JViews\jviewsenterprise-8.8.exe,
- then install JViews fixpack:
in <DocInstallPath>\Developer\redist\JViews run the following 3 commands (run as admin):
set PATH=%PATH%;"<DocInstallPath>\Developer\sdk\bin"
cd /D <DocInstallPath>\Developer\redist\JViews
"<DocInstallPath>\Developer\sdk\bin\java.exe" -jar "<DocInstallPath>\Developer\redist\JViews\jviewsenterprise-8.8_11.jar". 

2. Install IBM Decision Optimization Center 3.9 by launching the executable file "odme_developer.exe" in Windows 7 compatible mode:
- in DOC_Developer_V3.9_Win_x86-64\Disk1\InstData\VM\ right click on odme_developer.exe and go to "Properties",
- in "Compatibility" tab, check "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows 7" (cannot change compatibility mode if .bat),
- then launch odme_developer.exe (check JViews install check box).
