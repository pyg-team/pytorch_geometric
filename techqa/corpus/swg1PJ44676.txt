APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The user is unable to sort on any column on the result set after
   executing an existing search via Case Client during the process
   of adding a document from local repository.  When the same
   existing search is performed via Navigator the user can sort by
   any column.
   
   This issue is produced under the following scenario:
   A. The user is using an existing saved search.
   B. Only solution defined properties are displayed in the result
   set.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Via Case Builder, create solution with at least 1 solution
   property and 1 document type
   2. Add the solution property to the document type
   3. Create a case type
   4. Save and deploy solution
   5. Via Content Navigator,
   5a. Create several documents using previously created document
   type
   5b. Create New Search for same document type using relevant
   criteria for previously created documents
   5c. Click on Results Display button, remove all system fields;
   add only the solution properties previously created
   5d. Save search
   6. Via Content Navigator, run the newly created search
   7. Note the result set can be sorted by any column
   8. Run solution, create new case
   9. Open the case, from the Case Information Widget click on the
   Documents tab
   10. Add document to case from repository: select Add > Add
   Document from Repository
   11. Use same existing search, click on Search
   
   Expected results:
   User can sort result set by any column; the sorting behavior is
   expected to be consistent between Case Client and Navigator
   
   Actual results:
   User is not able to sort result set by any column from Case
   Client but can sort by any column via Navigator
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Adding 1 or more system properties to the result display set
   will allow the user to sort by any column in the result set

   * Update to 5.2.1.7-ICM-FP007 or later release to address this *
   * issue.                                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SelectObjectDialog is used by Case Manager to display the
   search page.  The SelectObjectDialog grid did not get set with
   SingleSort enabled resulting in the user not being able to sort
   the results.  This has been corrected in 5.2.1.7-ICM-FP007 and
   later release.  The user should be able to sort by any column
   from the search results.
