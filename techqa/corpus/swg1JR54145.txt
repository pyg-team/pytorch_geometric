PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When you use the BPMConfig script to export data source from
   source environment, you might experience the following issues
   depending on your source environment configuration:
   " You might see the log message "CWMCB0033E: The requested
   attributes could not be obtained" when the data source
   authentication alias is set to empty ("").
   " The Business Process Choreographer data source schema might be
   exported incorrectly when the Business Process Choreographer
   data source is configured in a cell scope. For example, the
   schema value is exported as database logon user name instead of
   the real schema value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0
   that corrects this issue so that the BPMConfig script runs
   successfully.
