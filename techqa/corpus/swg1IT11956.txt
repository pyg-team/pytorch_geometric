APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A query in question had > 10,000 host variable values for a
   column IN filter and was doing a sequential scan on a large
   table.  So when looking at rows to try and qualify for the
   result set, much of the data in the table did not satisfy the IN
   condition, and evaluating the expressions to determine the row
   that didn't qualify was taking a lot of cpu time and so the
   thread was not yielding frequently enough, which can negatively
   impact the server.
