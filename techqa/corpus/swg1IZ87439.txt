   Go to item master app
   
   Create an Item called NEW and add it to
   the CENTRAL Storeroom (under actions menu), current balance = 10
   change status  to ACTIVE, tick Roll New Status to Organizations
   and Inventory in the status change dialog box
   
   tick condition enabled checkbox
   
   go to actions menu, add item to storeroom
   storeroom = CENTRAL
   standard cost = 0
   issue unit and order unit are both EACH
   click OK
   
   
   go to app designer, bring up inventor application, add the
   following GL  fields to the main inventory tab:
   Inventory.ControlAcc
   InvCost.ControlAcc
   Inventory.GLACCOUNT
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup
   
   go to the condition code section
   add a new text box, use the lookup besides attribute
   object is invcost
   attribute is CONTROLACC
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup
   
   add another text box
   add a new text box, use the lookup besides attribute
   object is invcost
   attribute is GLACCOUNT
   add GLNAVIGATOR to the lookup
   
   go to the chart of accounts app, go to actions menu, validation
   options
   UNTICK Validate GL Component Combinations?
   TICK Require Valid GL Account for All Transactions
   Go to actions menu, GL components option, go to the elements
   component (i.e. the 4th component)
   add "INVENTORY"
   
   
   Go to the GL accounts for EAGLENA section:
   add GL account 6600-800-800-INVENTORY
   add GL account 6600-800-800-INVCOST
   Go to actions menu, update database, Overwrite All Accounts
   Go to the inventory app, bring up Item called NEW,
   use GLNavigator to set
   
   
   then set the inventory and invcost GLAccount to
   "???-????-???-INVENTORY" and "???-????-???-INVCOST"
   respectively.
   
   
   bring up item NEW in inventory app
   GL Control Account = 6220-300-300-inventory
   INVENTORY GL = 6210-300-300-inventory
   INVCOST GL = 6000-100-000-invcost
   
   
   go to actions, issue current item
   
   
   if you clear the Storeroom field, tab out, and
   then re-enter the Storeroom, you will see the GL Debit and
   Credit accounts
   updated with the corresponding GLAccount and ControlAcc values
   from the
   Inventory record instead of the InvCost record (THIS IS PROBLEM
   2).  CLIENT expects the GL to be updated with InvCost.GLAccount
   and InvCost.ControlAcc
