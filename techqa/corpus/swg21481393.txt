Title: IBM Argument '-server' is not licensed/supported OR Unrecognized aurguement when running Clemb - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 1) I am executing a stream using Clementine Batch 11.1 and keep getting an error "Argument '-server' is not licensed or not supported ". I have a Clementine Server install fully licensed on this same hardware. I can run the stream from the client in distributed mode. Why is this not executing in batch mode?

Clem 12 error: Batch execution is not a licensed feature
_____________________________________________
2) I am executing a stream using Clementine Batch 11.1 and keep getting an error "unrecognized aurguement.". I have a Clementine Server install fully licensed. NOTE: if running Clemb directly on the Clementine Server you will see the error message in #1. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
******INTERNAL********
As of version 11.1, Clementine has been modularized. In order for a standalone Clementine Batch installation to connect to a Clementine Server and run a stream, option 1 for server enablement must be licensed as part of the 8800 Clementine Batch authorization code. Please contact SPSS Customer Service for an updated authorization code with this option enabled.

Please note: Even if you are executing clemb from the client (not server), you still need to have option 1 marked on the Clementine Client license key. Also verify that all other modules(add ons) that the customer is entitled to is enabled as well
