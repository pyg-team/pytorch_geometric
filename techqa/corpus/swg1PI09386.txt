ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APARs PM98431 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM98431] and (PM95262 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM95262] or PM93383 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM93383]) are required, however,
   if a customer is using managed pages and virtual portals
   they will require the fix for this APAR.
   
   The issue is the code responsible to clear the cache on the farm
   nodes is not VP aware and therefore tries to clear all item
   caches as if they were in the base portal.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the servers or drop WCM caches (strategy) cache for
   content updates.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  APARs PM98431 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM98431] and (PM95262 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM95262] or PM93383 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM93383]) are required, however, if
   a customer is using managed pages and virtual portals they will
   require the fix for this APAR.
   
   The issue is the code responsible to clear the cache on the farm
   nodes is not VP aware and therefore tries to clear all item
   caches as if they were in the base portal.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been updated to be virtual portal aware.
   Therefore when an item in a VP is syndicated, the cache will be
   cleared for item in the containing virtual portal when managed
   pages is enabled.
