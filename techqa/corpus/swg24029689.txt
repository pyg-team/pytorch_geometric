ABSTRACT
 This Interim Fix addresses an important product correction for SPSS Statistics 19.0 FP1 (19.0.0.1). 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This Interim Fix provides an important product correction for SPSS Statistics 19.0.0.1. 


Issues corrected: Fix List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021407]

NOTE: This "Interim Fix " is analogous to the earlier "HotFixes" made available via the legacy IBM SPSS Support website.

You may notice that in the transition from SPSS to IBM versioning nomenclature, an additional number was added. For example, the original Statistics 19 release would have been "19.0.0" -- it is now "19.0.0.0". Thus, under the new numbering scheme, the Statistics "19.0.0.1 FixPack" or "19.0 FixPack 1" is what would have been known before the transition as the Statistics "19.0.1 Patch". 

If you open Statistics and select Help->About, the version number you see listed only includes the main FixPack version -- 19.0.0.1. It will not be updated after installing an Interim Fix such as this one. Provided that you follow the installation instructions and the new file(s) are in place, the Interim Fix will have been successfully installed.

PREREQUISITES
This Interim Fix is language independent but can only be installed over existing client installations of IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0.1.
