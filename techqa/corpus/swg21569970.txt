Title: IBM Collecting Data for IBM Case Manager 5.1 and IBM Business Process Manager integration - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What information should be collected when I experience a problem with the IBM® Case Manager and BPM integration? These guidelines should be used only when you are creating or invoking the solution that reuses IBM Business Process Manager. If you experience an issue while using the Case Manager Administration Client, Case Manager Builder, or Case Manager Client follow the directions in their respective must gather documentation. 

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Application Server Version 7 on all supported operating systems

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). Gathering this data before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

Collecting must gather data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if: 
· Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery).
· There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved.
· There is a defect that identifies a work around to reduce severity.

Locating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix if necessary.

Gathering General Information
For IBM® Case Manager, gather version of software, the operating system versions and settings for the pertinent server(s) and/or client machines.

Then, gather the information specific to BPM integration problem or issue.

This additional information is needed:
· How often does this problem occur?
· Can the problem be reproduced? 
· How many users are affected by this problem? 
· What is the business impact of this problem? 
Is there a work around?

Gathering IBM BPM Version Information

For issues related to creating solutions 

For issues related to creating solutions which integrate with IBM Business Process Manager, gather the following log file(s) for the REST service from Case Manager WebSphere server:

· Log
The Case Manager REST service logs all messages to the WebSphere SystemOut.log file located in the application server profile's logs directory (unless a local administrator has changed the location), for example, /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/<profile name>/logs/<server name>.

If for any reason IBM Support had requested that tracing be enabled and additional information gathered, also provide the trace.log file located in the same directory.


For issues related to launch IBM Business Process Manager tasks:

For issues related to launching a Case manager task that reuses IBM Business Process Manager process, gather the following log files from Content Engine WebSphere server:

· WebSphere Log
The Case Manager web service logs all messages to the WebSphere SystemOut.log file located in the application server profile's logs directory (unless a local administrator has changed the location), for example, /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/<profile name>/logs/<server name>.

If for any reason IBM Support had requested that tracing be enabled and additional information gathered, also provide the trace.log file located in the same directory.

· Content Engine Log
The Content Engine logs error messages to p8_server_error.log file located in the application server profile's logs directory (unless a local administrator has changed the location), for example, /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/<profile name>/FileNet/<server name>.

If for any reason IBM Support had requested that tracing be enabled and additional information gathered, also provide the trace.log file located in the same directory.
