APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In WebSphere Application Server Version 7, if you sets the
   WorkLoad Management (WLM) custom property
   IBM_CLUSTER_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT to a value of 0,
   this will cause the WLM selection logic on a nodeagent to wait
   until it is called back before that thread will exit.
   
   If you run into a scenario in which all of the cluster members
   are currently shut down, but the nodeagent is running and an
   EJB request is sent to the cluster, it will end up at the
   nodeagent.  Because no cluster members are running, the thread
   will continue to wait.  Given enough requests and enough
   threads created on the nodeagent the cluster members may have
   problems communicating with the nodeagent upon startup, which
   in turn can prevent the cluster members from starting up again.
   
   
   The Nodeagent systemout.log shows ORB threads being hung:
   
   ThreadMonitor W   WSVR0605W: Thread "ORB.thread.pool : 94"
   (000048f2) has been active for 678522 milliseconds and may be
   hung.  There is/are 20 thread(s) in total in the server that may
   be hung.

   com.ibm.ws.cluster.router.selection.WLMLSDRouter.select(WLMLSDRo
   uter.java:268)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, the callback timeout (
   IBM_CLUSTER_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT cell level property) can either be
   set to a positive value, or it can be removed, in which
   case the default value of 30 seconds will be used.

   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  Version 7 who have configured the WorkLoad  *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WLM Callback Timeout Infinite Wait      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If you are using WebSphere Application Server Version 7 and
   configure the WLM Custom Property
   IBM_CLUSTER_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT, which was introduced
   with APAR PK20304 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK20304], to a value of zero, the intended effect is
   that the WLM callback logic will be skipped entirely.  Due to
   a code bug, this instead will cause the WLM callback logic to
   run and with an infinite wait.  Although the client process
   which sent these requests will eventually time out and move
   onto other work, the callback threads on the server side will
   continue to wait forever, which can lead to CPU, memory, and
   other resource issues depending on how many callback objects
   were created.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code bug was fixed to ensure that when the value of zero
   is specified for the IBM_CLUSTER_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT property,
   that the effect will be the callback logic being skipped.
   
   This APAR is applicable to Version 7 only and does not exist
   in the v6.0.2 or v6.1 releases.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 7.0.0.13.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
   page for delivery information:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Restarting the affected nodeagent(s) will clear out all of the
   callback objects stuck in an infinite loop and free up all
   threads affected.
