APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After applying CF01:
   Importing pages into virtual portal via XMLAccess results in
   pages being created in the base portal instead.
   
   In CF01, a Servlet Filter was introduced that handles the
   virtual portal processing for XmlAccess. Due to a bug in the
   configuration script, the VP Servlet Filter is not installed
   correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure the missing servlet filter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fixed ConfigEngine task
   "action-update-wp-xml-add-new-servlet-filter".
