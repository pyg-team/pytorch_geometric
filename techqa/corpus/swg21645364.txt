Title: IBM Using the asynchronousRulesetParsing property with hosted transparent decision services - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why do hosted transparent decision services (HTDS) use only the latest ruleset version as if the <code>asynchronousRulesetParsing</code> property had been set to <code>false</code> although I have set the property to <code>true</code> for the execution unit (XU)? 

ANSWER
By design, HTDS always use the latest ruleset, irrespective of the <code>asynchronousRulesetParsing</code> property that is configured at the level of the XU.
