abstract text
We're working an issue where we ran out of ESQA/ECSA. We think we know where the issue is, using some archived RMFIII STORCR reports to track down those who 'left behind' pieces and parts. I'm wondering if allocations in CSA/ECSA are in 4k Pages, so that if someone leaves behind 38 bytes, they're really left behind a 4k page that has 38 bytes used? Would make a big difference in amount of space left for use.
