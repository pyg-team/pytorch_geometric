PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You install preventative maintenance to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS). Now when you install a JVMServer you receive DFHSJ0214 and DFHSJ0914 error messages. 

SYMPTOM
DFHSJ0215 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/DFHSJ/DFHSJ0215.html] The JVM Server jvmserver failed to initialize the OSGi framework. The JVM will be terminated. 

DFHSJ0914 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/DFHSJ/DFHSJ0914E.html] JVMSERVER jvmserver is DISABLED because the Language Environment Enclave was not created.


CAUSE
zFS files not propagated to target environment(s)


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When you applied the maintenance, the zFS files were updated. However, due to a procedural error, these updated files were not rolled out to the target environments. Now that you are running JVM Servers, this has more of an impact.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the updated zFS files are propagated to the target environments when maintenance is applied to CICS.
