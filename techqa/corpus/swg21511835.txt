Text:
Migration; gray; grey; password TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to change/reset the P8 Connection password that was set in ICC Configuration Manager. 
The CE Admin has reset the password on the CE and now it must be set to the new password in ICC Configuration Manager. 

SYMPTOM
When I try to access the P8 Connector, I get and error indicating failure to connect. Then, if I click through that, I see that the User name and Password are grayed out, preventing me from setting the new password. How can I change it?


CAUSE
Configuration Manager Migration Mode allows you to update connection details for connections that are already referenced in task routes.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can put the Configuration Manager into 'Migration mode', which will allow you to make the password change. Here is how to do that:


1. Locate the ApplicationSettings.xml file in the C:\Program Files\IBM\ContentCollector\ctms folder (assuming default install location), make a backup copy, and then open the file in a text editor. 

2. Locate the Migration Mode element: <MigrationMode>false</MigrationMode> 

3. Set the value to true: <MigrationMode>true</MigrationMode> 

4. Save the file. 

5. Run Configuration Manager and go the P8 Connection. Just click through any access errors. 

6. Change the password. 

7. SAVE and exit. 

8. Put the original ApplicationSettings.xml file back so that Migration Mode is no longer enabled. 

9. Run Configuration Manager, and go to the P8 Connection. You will not get an error.
