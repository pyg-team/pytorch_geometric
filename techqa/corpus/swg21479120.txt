 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using SPSS for Windows to create control charts, and I want the control chart graph to show all 3 sigma levels. I know I can choose one at a time, but I want to display all three on the same chart at once. Is there a way to do this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Not at this time. An enhancement request has been filed with SPSS Development for the addition of this functionality in a future release. We apologize for any inconvenience
