PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  APAR PK56638 provides support for running IBM WebSphere
   Application Server V6.1 Feature Pack for EJB 3.0 on z/OS.
   
   With Feature Pack for EJB 3.0, WebSphere Application Server for
   z/OS Version 6.1 on z/OS gains support for  several new
   technologies, including EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence API (JPA),
   which are key technologies of Java Platform Enterprise Edition 5
   (Java EE 5).
   
   Key technology in the Feature Pack for EJB 3.0 includes:
   
   * EJB 3.0:  This specification is designed to simplify
     development and allow developers to program EJB components as
     ordinary Java objects with ordinary Java business interfaces
   
   * JPA:  This API provides simplified persistence technology
     within   a WebSphere Application Server environment based on
     the Apache Open JPA open source project.
   
   The IBM WebSphere Application Server version 6.1 Feature Pack
   for EJB 3.0 includes an implementation of the EJB 3.0
   specification. This specification simplifies the development of
   business logic for enterprise applications.
   
   EJB 3.0 focuses on the basic principle that a simple JavaBean
   can suffice for distributed components and additional complexity
   should only be used as necessary.
   
   Annotations now provide component metadata, so it is no longer
   necessary to create XML deployment descriptors. It is also now
   possible to easily test outside the container using typical
   JUnit test patterns. This greatly increases the rapid
   development productivity by reducing the
   edit-compile-deploy-debug cycles currently associated with
   Java EE applications.
   
   Associated with the EJB 3.0 specification is the JPA
   specification. The Feature Pack for EJB 3.0 includes a
   implementation of this as well. JPA provides a new persistence
   framework based on successful industry patterns. JPA uses a
   simple, yet robust, object relational mapping layer over the top
   of typical JDBC resource usage patterns. This architecture uses
   simple JavaBean classes (POJO) to represent relational database
   content, which makes it suitable for most Java developers.
   Developers use basic resource access patterns to fetch and store
   state in the database, but using POJO classes instead of Java
   Database Connectivity (JDBC) persistence APIs.
   
   This not only simplifies the life of a developer when writing
   the code, but also simplifies the testing effort. There are no
   requirements to test in the container. It is now possible to
   test outside of a container environment either without the
   database (just exercising the use of the POJO classes that
   represent state) or with the database (for example, allowing
   testing of queries, relationships, and inheritance).
