QUESTION
 Is Maximo 7.6 supported with an Oracle 12c Rel 2 database. 

ANSWER
Yes, development have confirmed support for 12c Rel 2, both Standard and Enterprise server versions with a provision that the driver used must be changed. The support Matrix will be updated to reflect this. 

The 11.2.0.3 driver must be download from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/apps-tech/jdbc-112010-090769.html [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/apps-tech/jdbc-112010-090769.html] and
used to replace the current driver.

you will need to replace oraclethin.jar in the MAXIMO folder.
First download the correct version of JDBC driver from Oracle website
and then rename it to oraclethin.jar and then copy it to
maximo\applications\maximo\lib

You will then need to rebuild and redeploy the maximo ear file.
