Title: IBM Tmperr.txt error on Upload with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
tmperr tmperr.txt upload TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When performing an Upload with Taskmaster Web, it intermittently errors out with the message:


Read c:\tmperr.txt for error.

false 

SYMPTOM
This may also occur with any other Taskmaster Web activities that take a long time without user intervention.


CAUSE
Something is causing the connection to be lost. Possible causes include IIS session or cookie timeouts, or load balancers not properly preserving connections to the same web server.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If using a load balancer, temporarily route the clients directly to the web server, bypassing the load balancer. If the error goes away, the load balancer configuration will need to be corrected. If the error continues, apply the resolution here.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve, increase both the IIS session and cookie time-out values to a value greater than the longest time an upload might take (60 minutes, for example). The same value should be used for both of the following:




IIS Session Time-out 

 1. Run IIS Manager. 
 2. In the left pane, expand the tree and highlight Application Pools. 
 3. Highlight tmweb.net AppPool and select Advanced Settings. 
 4. In the Process Model section, set Idle Time-out to the desired value and click OK.


Cookie Time-out  1. Run IIS Manager. 
 2. In the left pane, expand the tree through Sites, Default Web Site, and highlight tmweb.net. 
 3. In the center pane, select Session State. 
 4. In the Cookie Settings section, set Time-out to the desired value.


IIS will need to be restarted to pick up these changes.
