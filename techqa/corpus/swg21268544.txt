PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The EJB container "Transaction timeout" setting for WebSphere® v5.1 Test Environment can be configured by double-clicking on the WTE5.1 instance from the Servers view, selecting the EJB tab, and modifying the value inside "Transaction timeout" field.
However, for the default WebSphere Application Server v6.1 that is installed by IBM® Rational® Application Developer version 7.0 (RAD), this "Transaction timeout" configuration setting is not available under the WebSphere Application Server v6.1 Server Overview. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to configure the transaction timeout settings for WAS6.1, you can perform these steps: 

 1. Start WebSphere Application Server v6.1 from the Servers view in RAD v7.x 
 2. Right-click on the WebSphere Application Server v6.1 instance, and select "Run administrative console" 
 3. From the WebSphere Application Server v6.1 Admin Console, select Application servers -> server1 
 4. From the Configuration tab, expand Container Services under the Container Settings session, and select Transaction Service 
 5. Modify the value for Total transaction lifetime timeout and Maximum transaction timeout to the desired level.
