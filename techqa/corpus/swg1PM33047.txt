APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus or WebSphere Process
   Server runtime has processed a message in a Mediation Flow
   Component and subsequent messages  do not immediately occur
   on the same thread, some of the associated memory for the
   previous request is not freed up until the next message
   arrives. This can mean in some situations that a higher than
   expected memory foot print is seen during quiet periods.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.2 who see    *
   *                 higher than expected memory usage from a     *
   *                 flow containing a mediation module that is   *
   *                 not under load.                              *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus or   *
   *                      WebSpshere Process Server mediation     *
   *                      module will retain in memory a copy     *
   *                      of the message passing through each     *
   *                      primitive in the mediation module.      *
   *                      Under low load this can lead to a       *
   *                      higher than expected memory foot        *
   *                      print for the flow.                     *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   As a message passes through a mediation module a copy of the
   message is stored in memory as it leaves each primitive. This
   is not released for garbage collection by the JVM until the
   next message has entered the module.
   Under periods of low load this may not happen immediately
   resulting in the messages being stored for a longer period and
   a higher than expected memory foot print being seen.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the stored messages are
   released for garbage collection earlier.
