APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During termination DFSRTM00 does a freemain of all previously
   loaded modules. This includes the XCF event exit. Since DFSMRCL0
   is the first resource mgr in IEAVTRML, this happens very early
   in the MVS cleanup process for the region. The XCF structures
   remain connected, and may attempt to send an event notification.
   If there is no event exit to receive it, XCF gets system abend
   S026 ( abendS0026 S0026 ) with REASON = 0E0D0101.

   ****************************************************************
   During job termination DFSRTM00 causes all modules previously
   loaded for the application to be deleted.
   This includes the XES event exit, module DFSDXES0.
   The XCF structures still remain connected and XES may attempt
   to send an event notification to the exit.
   If the event exit does not complete properly XES will
   terminate the connector task with an ABEND S0026 reason code
   0E0D0101. DFSRTM00 should disconnect from the XCF structure
   before deleting the event exit module.

   Module DFSRTM00 has been modified to disconnect from the XCF
   structures before deleting the event exit module DFSDXES0.
