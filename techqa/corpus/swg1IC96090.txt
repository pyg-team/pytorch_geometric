APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When logged into Process Admin Console using IE8 or less and
   working for example on the "Bulk User Attribute Assignments"
   panel, it does not load properly and the following error is
   displayed on the page: "Internet Explorer cannot display
   webpage".
   
   The reason for the problem is the limited number of 2048
   characters allowed in an URL for IE8. Requests to the server
   with URLs longer then the limit are not transferred by the
   browser and the page can not be displayed with the proper data.
   Thus when there are a lot of User Attributes defined the URL
   includes all these data and reaches the limit.
   
   The problem can also occur on other panels of the Process Admin
   Console if the URL send to the server is longer then 2048
   Characters.
   
   The problem can be avoided by sending the necessary data not in
   the URL with a GET request but in the request header as a POST.
   The limit only counts for the URL not the request header.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IE8 a page in Process Admin Console cannot be displayed
   properly when data request URL is too long.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   When logged into Process Admin Console using IE8 (or lower)
   and working for example on the "Bulk User Attribute Assignments"
   panel, it does not load properly and the following error is
   displayed on the page: "Internet Explorer cannot display
   webpage".
   
   The reason for the problem is the limited number of 2048
   characters allowed in an URL for IE8. Requests to the server
   with URLs longer than the limit are not transferred by the
   browser and the page cannot be displayed with the proper data.
   When there are a lot of User Attributes defined, the URL
   includes all these data and reaches the limit.
   
   The problem can also occur on other panels of the Process Admin
   Console if the URL sent to the server is longer than 2048
   Characters.
   
   The problem can be avoided by sending the necessary data not in
   the URL with a GET request but in the request header as a POST.
   The limit only counts for the URL not the request heade
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Do not make a POST to a GET when the URL is longer than 2047
   and IE8/IE7 is used.
