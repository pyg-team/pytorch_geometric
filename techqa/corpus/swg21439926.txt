Title: IBM Debug project for CPLEX on Visual Studio .NET - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The examples provided with CPLEX on Windows are delivered in release format. While this might be the best when thinking about performance issue, I would like to have a debug project for my development activity. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 In your project setting, make sure you have: 
* in the C/C++ -> General tab, set Program Database (/Zi) for the Debug Information Format 

* in the C/C++ -> Optimization tab, you need to remove the Optimization, since it is not compatible with debug settings, so select Disabled (/Od) for optimization 

* in the C/C++ -> Preprocessor tab, -> Preprocessor Definitions: WIN32 and NDEBUG; 

* in the Linker / Debugging tab, you need to make sure the linker do include debug information, so add /DEBUG in the "Generate Debug Info" tab.
