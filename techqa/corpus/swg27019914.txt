IBM Installation Manager and the Feature Pack
The Feature Pack for Modern Batch download packages on the Passport Advantage Online Web site include the IBM Installation Manager within the package. You must use the Installation Manager Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the command line to install the Feature Pack for Modern Batch.

You can use IBM Installation Manager for WebSphere to import existing WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 installations into Installation Manager and then to install, update, and uninstall the IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 Feature Pack for Modern Batch.

Notes: 

 * The feature-pack version of Installation Manager is preconfigured to use both the local repositories (if they are set up) and the remote repositories.
   
   
 * Whenever possible, you should use the remote Web-based repositories so that you are accessing the most up-to-date WebSphere Application Server base-product import and feature-pack installation files.
   
   
 * If you use local repositories, you can leave in the preconfigured remote repositories as well because they will provide post-shipment service updates when you are connected to the Web. 


Space requirements  * 20 MB of free space available in your target installation directory. This estimate is in addition to the existing application server product. 
   
   
 * 10 MB of free space available in your temporary directory.
