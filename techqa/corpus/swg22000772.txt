Title: IBM Opening images in an iFrame via ICN bookmarks works for some, while some get blank viewer - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using IBM Content Navigator (ICN) bookmarks to open Daeja ViewONE Virtual in an iFrame for a custom ASP.NET application leaves some users with a blank viewer. 

SYMPTOM
No errors in Daeja virtual.log. Web browser trace shows the transaction is complete (HTTP200) but the image never displays in the viewer.


CAUSE
Users with the issue are running their browser (Microsoft Edge) in Internet Explorer 7 compatibility mode. IE 7 is not compatible with ICN 3.0 or Daeja Virtual 5.0

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Compare the browser configuration between the Edge users that are able to view images with the users that get a blank viewer.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If IE 7 compatibility mode is not needed for another application simply disable compatibility mode to leave the browser in a supported mode.

If IE7 compatibility mode is needed for another application: 


For the page with the iframe you can try adding a meta tag to the header, telling the browser to use Edge compatibility rather than IE7 mode.
