PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After scanning multiple batches in a high volume scan environment, the Scan button becomes disabled preventing scanning of any more batches. This occurs when running the Datacap Navigator Scan task in Internet Explorer and using the Daeja Virtual Viewer. 

SYMPTOM
The point where this error occurs depends on the total overall volume being scanned but will typically occur when the memory usage reaches 1.4 to 2GB.


CAUSE
Internet Explorer does not fully release memory after completing the Scan task. This causes memory creep which will eventually lead to there being insufficient memory to scan a batch. This memory leak is not caused by coding issues, but is a behavior of Internet Explorer itself.

ENVIRONMENT
Datacap Navigator with Internet Explorer 10 or 11 and any version of the Daeja Virtual Viewer.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When this issue occurs, users can press F5 which will refresh the browser and release the memory.
