APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product
   Information Management Version 9.1.0, the Info Center provides
   installation information in this link,
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pim/v9r1m0/topic/com.ib
   m.pim.mig.doc/pim_tsk_runningimporthierarchy.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pim/v9r1m0/topic/com.ibm.pim.mig.doc/pim_tsk_runningimporthierarchy.html]
   which causes the users the situation where they had to login
   several times as Admin nearly each time they had selected a new
   job and scheduled it to run immediately. This is described in
   the steps, "Importing to InfoSphere MDM Server for PIM V9.1.x"
   where users are told to import jobs for hierarchy content. The
   link instructs the user to set their max_inactive_interval
   parameter in common.properties to 180000000 so that they will
   not get timeout during the procedure. However, changing the
   value as instructed is causing exactly that.  This is incorrect
   and need to be changed to -1 as instructed in another part of
   the Info Center where the parameter max_inactive_interval is
   explained.
   
   Suggestion:
   
   Procedure
   1. Delete the $TOP/logs directory.
   2. In order to avoid timeout, please modify the
   parameter in common.properties max_inactive_interval
   to -1. This file is in the $TOP/etc/default directory.
   
   ?.
   
   
   Comments from Patrick See:
   There are 2 things in my mind there we need to look at.
   1. The use of the wording "Make sure...". The current text used
   is too definitive and as evident in this PMR, the value of
   180000000 caused problem for certain use case for this customer.
   2. -1 is mentioned elsewhere. Engineering need to research under
   what situation -1 should be used and what may be other cases
   that a different value should be set for max_inactive_interval
   parameter.
