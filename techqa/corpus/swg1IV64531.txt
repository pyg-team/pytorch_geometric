APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TEP is not displaying all the "System Details" workspaces
   where computational and non-computational attributes should be
   displayed.  This occurs with a 6.2.3 FP05 Unix OS Agent and TEPS
   at 6.30 FP02.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You will need to create a custom workspace/custom view based on
   the "AIX System Virtual Memory" query that can be found under
   "Unix Memory" in the Query Editor.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Missing Tivoli Enterprise Portal client workspaces for older
   versions of UNIX OS agents.
   
   Missing Tivoli Enterprise Portal client workspaces for older
   versions of UNIX OS agents. In a 6.30 FP2 portal client some
   workspaces do not show up in the lists under the navigation
   leaves of a UNIX OS agent at version older than 6.30 FP2:
   "System Details" and "AIX LPAR Information" workspaces under
   the "System Information" navigation leaf, "Disk Usage Details"
   and "AIX Storage" workspaces under the "Disk Usage" navigation
   leaf, and "Network" workspace under the "Network" navigation
   leaf.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Workspace versioning corrected in UNIX OS agent SQL seeding
   file.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   | FixPack    | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0005
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Create custom workspaces using the queries supported by the
   specific agent version.
