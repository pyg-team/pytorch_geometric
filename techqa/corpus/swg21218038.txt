Title: IBM Configuring a scheduled agent to read a directory in the IFS of another server - United States

PROBLEM
 

You want a scheduled agent on a Lotus Domino server for i5/OS to be able to read, write, and delete files in a directory on a remote iSeries or System i machine.

You create a share on the destination system, setting DIR$ to \\system\share or /QNTC/system/share. But an agent using that share returns a "path/file access error." You verify that *PUBLIC has *RWX and *ALL object authorities on the destination folder and objects. How can you configure access to this remote directory?


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

To access the directory, you need to use the Network File System (NFS) functionality that is part of i5/OS. The i5/OS operating system does not contain a way to map a network drive in the same manner as Microsoft Windows. 


The following commands show you how to use the MOUNT *NFS command to create a link to the desired IFS directory on the second System i.

On source system: 


 * 

 * 
 * 
 * 



On target system: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


You should now see the contents of the SourceDir directory on the local system under abc dir in this example. 

NOTE: Read-Write authority is given or restricted to the target system on the EXPORTFS command.
