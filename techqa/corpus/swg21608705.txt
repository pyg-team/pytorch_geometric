Title: IBM CWSIT0019E and CWSIT0103E errors: No suitable messaging engine is available errors returned to application even though Messaging Engine is running - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 CWSIA0241E, CWSIT0019E and CWSIT0103E errors are returned to client . These errors are seen in the SystemOut.log even though WebSphere Application Server Messaging Engine (ME) is running in one of the messaging cluster servers. 

SYMPTOM
javax.jms.JMSException: CWSIA0241E: An exception was
received during the call to the method
JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection:
com.ibm.websphere.sib.exception.SIResourceException: CWSIT0019E: Nosuitable messaging engine is available on bus
<BUS_NAME> that matched the specified connection
properties {multicastInterface=none, connectionProximity=Bus,
targetSignificance=Preferred, subscriptionProtocol=Unicast,
targetType=BusMember, busName=<BUS_NAME>}. Reason for
failure: CWSIT0103E: No messaging engine was found that matched the following parameters: bus=<BUS_NAME>, targetGroup=null,targetType=BusMember, targetSignificance=Preferred,
transportChain=InboundSecureMessaging, proximity=Bus..


CAUSE
In case of WebSphere Application Server cluster(s) it is the responsibility of the Work Load Management component (WLM) and HA manager to find the JVM where the requested ME is running. The default value of sib.trm.linger property is 3 seconds. If the ME is up and running and WLM still throws the CWSIT0019E and CWSIT0103E errors after a 3 second delay, this indicates the ME lingered for 3 seconds waiting for WLM to search for data about the messaging engine that was running. If WLM is not able to find the running ME it throws these errors. In some cases these errors may occur if the environment is heavily loaded or if the network response time is slow. In these instances it might be necessary to increase the sib.trm.linger delay, to account for it taking longer than 3 seconds for the WLM data to propagate.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Tune the sib.trm.linger property value in the sib.properties file to set the messaging engine lookup delay so that the WLM waits for a longer period of time before returning an error. Please refer to information below on how to set this property in the sib.properties. 

1)<WAS_HOME>/properties : The properties declared under this location would be applicable to all the profiles in that installation.

2)<PROFILE_ROOT>/properties : The properties declared here are applicable for all the servers on this profile

If a property is defined at both <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties and <WAS_HOME>/properties, then the property defined at <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties would take precedence.

After resetting the property you must restart the server.
