   No, if he wishes to do so, we can support him. Configuring the
   autologin
   is supported, and which user he chooses is his business.
   
   However, he _must_ be concious, that configuring autologin for
   root is a
   big, big security issue!
   Any application started then, has full read, execute and write
   permission
   to every single bit on this machine. Any error or
   misconfiguration in an
   application can ruin his image, installation, it's even possible
   to
   damage the hardware or run DOS attacks on other machines in the
   network.
   
   There are good reasons, why it is not recommended to login as
   root.
   An unattended autologin as root is even worse, as any person
   working on
   this machine has full access rights and e.g. could easily
   install a
   rootkit. If the customer is willing to take this risk, he can do
   so, but
   I strongly recommend (as you already did) to do the autologin as
   non-root user.

   I know, that you are aware of this David, the above is meant to
   be the
   statement.
