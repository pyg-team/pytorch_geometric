APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The field SSLCERTI in the runmqsc command
   dis chs (channelname)
   should contain the e full Distinguished Name of the issuer of
   the remote certificate for SSL channels.  In OpenVMS this field
   is improperly blank.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users of WMQ-V6.0 on OpenVMS have the SSL certificate setup
   between systems and channels are enabled to use SSL protocol.
   The display of channel status against  a running channel will
   show blank values for the status attributes SSLPEER & SSLCERTI.
   .
   After validation of the SSL peer certificates, the
   corresponding values of SSLPEER & SSLCERTI are not copied from
   the certificate to the channel status table in memory. This
   causes the status attributes to display blank values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will ensure that the values extracted
   from the peer certificate after the verifications of the
   certificates are copied over to channel status table in memory.
   .
   The fix for this APAR will be included in the next Fixpack
   releases for Websphere MQ V6.0 on Alpha and Itanium.
