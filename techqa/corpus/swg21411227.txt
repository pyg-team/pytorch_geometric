 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The report output is different across report output types. What is the expected behaviour of the (Don't Print) classes when applied to reports? 

ANSWER
Following is description of the intended behaviour of "class:don't print" in each output format.

1. HTML format
If you run a report in HTML format with a browser, the output is the "screen" media type, so items will be shown. If you print out the content of the report from the browser, then it becomes a "print" media type and the items will be hidden in the print out.

2. PDF format
We define PDF output as a print media type. If you run the report in PDF format, the items will be hidden.

3. Excel 2002
For historical reasons, Excel 2002 (or Excel 2000 single sheet) is defined as a screen media type, so it should behave as same as the HTML format when you run the report. However it's different from the HTML format in the team that the items are not hidden when you print out the worksheet. So the "class:don't print" is not fully supported in Excel 2002 format (or Excel 2000 single sheet).

4. CSV
There is no support for "class:don't print" in CSV format. The style specification will be ignored.

5. Excel 2007
When we introduced the Excel 2007 format in 8.3, we defined it as a print media type as same as PDF because we know Excel doesn't support hiding items in printing out a worksheet. By this definition, an inconsistency between Excel 2007 and Excel 2002 was introduced.

In summary, "class:don't print" will behave differently in different output formats according to their media type definition. 

NB: If a customer want to hide items consistently in every output formats, please use "box type:none" instead of "class:don't print".
