   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In the chapter "Managing Storage Pools  *
   *                      and Volumes," the title of the          *
   *                      section "Lowering the Migration         *
   *                      Threshold" should be "Lowering the      *

   *                      The first paragraph also has mistakenly *
   *                      used "migration threshold" instead of   *
   *                      "reclamation threshold."  These errors  *
   *                      cause confusion for readers.            *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In the chapter "Managing Storage Pools and Volumes," the title
   of the section "Lowering the Migration Threshold" should be
   "Lowering the Reclamation Threshold."
   
   The first paragraph also has mistakenly used "migration
   threshold" instead of "reclamation threshold."  These errors
   cause confusion for readers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In a future edition of the Administrator's Guides, in
   the chapter "Managing Storage Pools and Volumes," the title
   of the section labeled "Lowering the Migration Threshold" will
   be changed to "Lowering the Reclamation Threshold." The first
   paragraph in the section will also be corrected.  The modified
   text is as follows:
   
   
   Lowering the Reclamation Threshold
   ----------------------------------
   If you have been running with a high reclamation threshold
   and decide you now need to reclaim volumes, you may want to
   lower the threshold in several steps. Lowering the threshold
   in steps ensures that volumes with the most reclaimable space
   are reclaimed first. For example, if you had set the
   reclamation threshold to 100%, first lower the threshold to
   98%. Volumes that have reclaimable space of 98% or greater are
   reclaimed by the server. Lower the threshold again to reclaim
   more volumes.
