APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  events not arriving on the server due to
   being malformed - class names and attribute names must be
   alphanumeric, but not solely numeric.
   
   ------customer comment-----
   From my perspective if numeric names are unsupported, then
   we just would need a reference to this fact in the
   documentation/Release notes for the EIF-Probe Version 13+
   now that the EIF library enforces this.
   ------end
   
   For test case 2 - numeric class name and attribute names are not
   supported by EIF, so these are malformed alarms.  Changes to the
   EIF library made for PMR 09194,122,000 discard the event in EIF,
   so the probe doesn't have a chance to handle the malformed
   alarm.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None, extra doc description required.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * A customer has requested that we include in the guide        *
   * reference to the fact that all events must have class names  *
   * and attribute names that are alphanumeric, and that the      *
   * probe treats as malformed any events that have class names   *
   * and attribute names that are solely numeric.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * The guide will be uploaded to the Netcool/OMNIbus Knowledge  *
   * Center during the next Asynchronous Release.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following note will be added to the Data Acquisition section
   of the Probe for Tivoli EIF v13 Reference Guide.
   
   ==========
   Note:
   The events that the probe receives must have alphanumeric class
   names and attribute names. The probe considers events that
   contain class names or attribute names that are solely numeric
   as malformed and discards them, unless you set the
   HandleMalformedAlarms property to true.
