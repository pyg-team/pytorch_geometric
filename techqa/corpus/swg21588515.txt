CAUSE
A typical installation using LaunchPad completes the following tasks:. 

 *  Installs the product 
 *  Installs the recommended interim fixes from the external product repository. 
 *  Creates a profile 


After completing the product installation, Lauchpad invokes Installation Manager to download the recommended interim fixes from the external product repository. In some Windows environments, the Installation Manger never gets invoked and the Launchpad keeps waiting for the Installation Manager to complete the operation. 

This issue has been identified as a product defect under APAR JR42324


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, see the following sections: 

Resolving the problem if you see it hang 

Avoiding the problem in a new Windows environment 

 

Resolving the problem if you see it hang 

To resolve the problem you stop the Launchpad, complete the interim fix installation, and create a profile manually using the following steps. 

 1. Check the version information using the <BPMinstall>/bin/versioninfo command and make sure the product installation has been completed. You should see that the following packages are installed based on the versioninfo output:  * WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0 Fix Pack 19 
     * WebSphere Application Server Feature Pack for XML 
     * WebSphere Application Server Feature Pack for SCA (for IBM Business Process Manager Advanced only) 
     * IBM Business Process Manager Version 7.5.1 product pack 
       
       
    
    
 2. Click Cancel on the Launchpad panel. If the Launchpad does not respond after few minutes, kill the process using Windows Task Manager.
    
    
 3. Start the Installation Manger and install all the recommended interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023411].
    
    
 4. Use the Profile Management tool (PMT) or the manageprofiles command to create the desired profile [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.sbpm.doc/topics/ccnfg_profiles_create_aug.html] 


Avoiding the problem in new Windows environment 

 

This problem is seen only for certain windows environments with external access to the Internet. You can use a custom installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.sbpm.doc/topics/tins_custom_standard.html] where the product is installed using the Installation Manger interface and you will not encounter this problem. 

 

You can avoid the problem by installing the patch for the launchpad defect JR42324. Use the instructions documented for the defect JR42324: Launchpad hangs at 41%. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032300]
