APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: Java VM shuts down slowly.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   Attach API log shows:
   <OSB>Attach API initializer<CSB>: locking file \<temp
   directory\>/.com_ibm_tools_attach/_master
   ...
   AttachHandler tryObtainMasterLock failed
   ...
   Attach API not terminated
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete the attach API common directory \<temp
   directory\>/.com_ibm_tools_attach
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If another process locks _master, the attach API initialization
   thread
   cannot lock it and stalls.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   7.0.0 SR6
   6.0.1 SR7
   6.0.0 SR15
   .
   The Attach API has a timeout which cancels the lock attempt.
