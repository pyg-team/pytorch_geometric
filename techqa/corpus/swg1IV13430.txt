ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   When using i5OS Inactive Job table for situations,
   there are ENUM attributes with imbedded blanks causing the
   situation to fail to work.
   
   Problem: Blanks are not allowed for ENUM values.  There are
   several ENUM values in the i5OS Inactive Job table (as well as
   other tables) that should use an underscore '_' rather than
   blanks as separators.
   
   Recreation steps:
   1) Create situation on Tivoli Enterprise Portal using the
     formula with EndReason attribute from i5OS Inactive Job
     attribute group. For example
     (#'KA4INACJOB.ENDREASON' == 'Abnormal)
   2) Start the situation
   3) Critical event with red icon will be displayed for the
      situation. Blue X indicating Problem status will be displayed
      in the event.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The i5OS situation status is shown as "Problem" in the Situation
   Event Console and Message Log.  A blue X icon is also displayed
   indicating a problem with the situation.  This occurs when
   certain attribute values are selected from the formula editor
   pull down list.  Values in the pull down list are defined in an
   internal table.  Some of these defined values contain characters
   which cannot be processed in the situation formula.  The result
   is that the situation fails to start and is not distributed.
   
   The i5OS tables and attributes affected by this problem are:
   
   Table, Attribute
   ----------------
   i5OS Inactive Job, End Reason
   
   i5OS History Log, Type (message type)
   
   i5OS Job Log, Type (message type)
   
   i5OS Management Central, Monitor Type
   i5OS Management Central, Metric
   i5OS Management Central, Event Type
   i5OS Management Central, Message Type
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The internal table has been modified to remove characters in
   defined attribute values that cannot be processed in the
   situation formula.  The text seen by the user in the pull down
   list for the affected attributes remains the same.
