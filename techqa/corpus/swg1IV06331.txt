APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   The User Enters the correct SAP Server, the Access Agent submits
   the
   credentials
   You see SAP gives an error message (Password logon no longer
   possible)
   And Access Agent will try to re-logon like it is looping
   
   The SAP Application is configured in AccessAgent to
   Automatically logon
   
   Changes the Default automatic sign-on password entry option to
   Always
   helps for new SAP credentials.
   Most users change the password entry option in their wallet to
   "Automatic logon" because of it's easier and faster to use...
   
   So this is not an solution we can use because we want the
   Automatic
   logon functionality.
   
   The profile just needs to check if a failed logon happen and ask
   if the
   user want to relogon or retry to logon again.
   
   An endless loop is not an acceptable situation!
   
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   
   Business Justification:
   
   Desired Behavior: For this to be integrated  into the profile so
   that Customer does not get the loop
   
   Environment:
   Windows Server 2008 R2
   TAMESSO 8.1 FP3
   Websphere 7.0.0.5
   
   Windows XP SP3
   Access Agent 8.1.0.0.130
   
   SAP 7200.2.5.1057
   
   
   
   RTC 25862
   
   This is an issue related to another component in TAMESSO.
   Therefore, that component has to be fixed before the profile can
   'Prompt for relogin'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The SAP profile will enter a loop if the provided password is
   incorrect and the password entry option is 'Automatic Logon'.
   This is due to an AccessAgent defect (handled in a separate
   APAR), hence the problem can not be addressed in the profile
   itself. This temporary limitation has not been documented in the
   profile release notes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The reported SAP AccessProfile limitation will be documented in
   a tech note.
