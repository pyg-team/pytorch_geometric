PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Managing Server install fails because the AIX Registry cannot be updated. 

SYMPTOM
 

The MS will abort during the installation phase and you will see these errors in the $MS_HOME/MS/log.txt file: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=1]


CAUSE
This is caused due to the environment variables not being processed correctly during the installation and usually happens when using the Bourne shell (bash). The "\u" string in the Bourne shell refers to the user name. In Java, the sequence "\uxxxx" is used to specify a Unicode constant. Do a 'env' command and search for any "\u" strings in any environment variable. Issue the 'env' command and search
for any "\u" strings. This is most common in the prompt environment variable PS1. For example, PS1=\u@\h:\w\$


ENVIRONMENT
AIX 6.1, 5.3 using Bourne shells with bash.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Do a 'env' command and search for any "\u" strings in any environment variable. Issue the 'env' command and search for any "\u" strings. This is most common in the prompt string, PS1. 

For example:
PS1=\u@\h:\w\$



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, reset your PS1 (or any other environment variable using the "\u" string) to something like this: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=2] 

Then continue your MS install from this shell window. Once you have installed the MS, you can switch back to your original PS1 environment value like this:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21516157&aid=3]
