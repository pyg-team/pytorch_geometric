APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During All item syndication, draft items are failing to
   syndicate correctly (changes to draft not reflected on
   subscriber, draft not being removed on subscriber after
   publish on syndicator, ect.)
   ..
   Affected USERS: All
   ..
   The WCM code has been updated to check the last modified date of
   the draft if no draft exists it will then use the published
   content's date.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Syndication does not syndicate draft updates if there is a
   published version of the content.
   ..
   AFFECTED USERS:  ALL
   .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Updates to draft content that have a published version do not
   get syndicated even when 'all items' syndication is used.
   Create and Delete of the draft get syndicated but updates to the
   same draft content do not get syndicated.
   .
   The code is using the published contents last modified date
   rather than the draft contents last modified date.  When package
   generator builds the package it first checks for a create date
   on a non-draft then a draft.  It should check the draft first
   because if a draft exists an update would have to be performed
   on the draft and not the live content.
