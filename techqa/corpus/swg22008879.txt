Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of Logon Event Scanner (LES) 7 fails due to an XML issue. 

SYMPTOM
The installation of LES fails and the following error is displayed:


08/04/2017 18:38:28, 0100b6, Info, Common : run "-NormalizeXML"
08/04/2017 18:38:28, 0100c0, Unexpected, Common : got exception ex=System.InvalidOperationException: This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.


CAUSE
This issue occurs when installing LES on servers where FIPS compliant encryption is enabled.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be resolved installing LES on a system that does not have FIPS compliance enabled.


The alternative to this is to disable FIPS compliance on the current system and then install LES. However, users should be warned that FIPS compliance might be required by your organizational or governmental policies.

If you choose to disable FIPS compliance, you can do so with the following steps:


 1.  Log on to Windows as a Windows System Administrator.
     
 2.  Click Start.
     
 3.  Click Control Panel.
     
 4.  Click Administrative Tools. (You may have to switch to large Icons for the next step.)
     
 5.  Click Local Security Policy. The Local Security Settings window appears.
     
 6.  In the navigation pane, click Local Policies, and then click Security Options.
     
 7.  In the pane on the right, double-click System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing.
     
 8.  In the dialog box that appears, clear the Enabled option and then click Apply.
     
 9.  Click OK.
     
 10. Close the Local Security Settings window.
