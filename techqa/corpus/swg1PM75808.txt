   ****************************************************************
   In V710, additional attributes are parsed from an SSL
   distinguished name and stored in the internal cache to be
   matched against an SSLPEER channel attribute.
   
   Where the length of the data in an SSL certificate was already
   close to the 256 byte limit, these additional attributes may
   mean that it is no longer possible to match attributes that are
   close to the end of the parsed certificate string and a channel
   will fail to start, issuing the following message:
   
   "CSQX636E ++++ CSQXRCTL Distinguished name does not match peer
   name"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Internal processing has been amended to increase the size of the
   internal SSL attribute cache for an SSL certificate. The SSLPEER
   channel attribute itself is still restricted to 256 bytes.
