Title: IBM Form throws an error message - Unable to load the platform "xfdl". - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to view a form in FileNet results in Form throwing an error message - Unable to load the platform "xfdl" when using IBM Forms. 

SYMPTOM
The user sees the following error message when selecting a form from within FileNet to view, "Unable to load the platform "xfdl'".


CAUSE
The IBM Forms API and IBM Forms Servlet Framework are not configured to work with WorkplaceXT correctly

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this particular case, the client had upgraded from 4.0.0.1 to 4.0.0.2 but did not redeploy the new ear that is repackaged at the end of the installation.


We have 2 sets of jars which get updated on installation. 

 1. Our IBM Forms API (libraries and jars) 
 2. Our IBM Forms Servlet Framework (jars).


The typical installation and application deployment method is as follows: 

 * XT/P8 is installed 
 * IBM Forms Server, API, P8 Integrator is install to the WAS with XT/P8 
 * A new war is created with our Framework in the WEB-INF/libs folder 
 * The installer also configures WAS server where XT/P8 is running to use our IBM Forms API. This places the libraries and jars on the system and then proceeds to setup the WAS Server classpath, shared libraries, etc.


Now if any of these steps are missing or done in the wrong way, the application will not be able to process the form. 

 

Note: 

 * You can manually repackage the war with our Framework jars [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lfwiki.nsf/dx/Setting_Up_Your_System_to_Use_the_IBMWorkplaceFormsServerServlet_Class_WFS_4]. 
 * You can also manually configure WAS to use our API [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/lfwiki.nsf/dx/Configuring_WebSphere_Application_Server_to_use_IBM_Forms_API_API_4_DG]
