QUESTION
 Why are there gaps in the response-time data on playback of RPT (Rational Performance Tester) scripts? 

CAUSE
This issue is a product defect under APAR IV03587 primarily on Windows 7 and Windows 2008 platforms. The issue can also occur on other platforms.

ANSWER
 

This is a known issue that occurs on Windows 7 and Windows 2008 systems in ITCAM for Transactions 7.3. However, the issue can also occur on other platforms.

The solution is to apply ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 FP01 IF26 (7.3.0.1-TIV-CAMRT-IF0026 ) or later. This fix is available in for download from IBM Fix Central.

Other Scenarios

One common scenario is that the robotic playback interval is longer than the aggregation interval. The aggregation interval is set in the T6 agent's configuration, and the playback interval is set in the robotic script profile. If, for example, the playback interval is longer than the aggregation interval, you may see gaps in the response time data because some playbacks do not happen to fall in the current aggregation interval.

Another scenario occurs when you request retries in the script profile. The response time data is only reported on the last playback -- regardless whether the playback is successful. The number of retries, times the playback time for each retry, can result in a playback interval that occurs after the end of the current aggregation interval. As a result, you observe intervals where no response time data is reported for the playbacks.

If you observe that the response-time gaps appear to be regular, refer to the Recurrent gaps technote in Related URLs.
