QUESTION
 Which configuration combinations are supported to use the Coach portlets or other business process integration portlets from IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Versions 7.5.x, 8.0.x, or 8.5.x with WebSphere Portal? What are the required prerequisites? 

CAUSE
WebSphere Portal can be installed on IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5.x.

ANSWER
The following matrix covers which configurations are supported in a two-cell configuration. 

 

Because of version dependencies on WebSphere Application Server, do not install IBM Business Process Manager and WebSphere Portal in a single cell.

For IBM Business Process Manager task completion, connect with IBM Business Process Manager using the WebSphere Portal Unified Task List and REST APIs.

For IBM Business Process Manager dashboards, connect with IBM Business Process Manager using JSR-286 portlets for human services that were generated in IBM Business Process Manager and are exposed as dashboards using IBM Web Services Remote Portlets (WSRP) 2.0.
