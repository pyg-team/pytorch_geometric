APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Column analysis if year has '00' in DD-MM-YY format, IA
   identifies the format incorrectly as 99-99-99 .
   Date 29-02-00 is recognized as format 99-99-99, because it's
   translated to 29-FEB-1900 and 1900 is not a leap year. It should
   be 29-FEB-2000 and recognized as DD-MM-YY, because 2000 is a
   leap year.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Fix provided in rollup_RU1_IA_ALL_9120
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Column analysis  interprets  6 digit  data values  with  '00'
   as   1900    and  there is no  option  to mention  year  as
   2000 .
   Hence 290200  is considered  as invalid  date  as  00 is
   considered as 1900  and  its not  a  leap  year  and format  is
   displayed  as    '99999'  rather  'ddmmyy'
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  fix   is  done   to  resolve  above  issue  hence  290200    is
    considered  as  valid  date  and  format  is     'ddmmyy'
   rather  '99999'
   This  fix  would  be  available on 91rp1
   
   For  87  Customers  ,  this  would be available  on 87rp7
   (which  needs  to be applied  on 87fp2)
