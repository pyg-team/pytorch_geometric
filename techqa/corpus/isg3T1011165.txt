Text:
ioeagfmt mount ioez00075E BPXF135E EF096058 EF17626B rsnEF096058 rsnEF17626B msgioez00075E msgBPXF135E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a zFS aggregate is defined with a size that is less than the minimum allowable, the customer can see a variety of failures reported during IOEAGFMT processing and/or MOUNT processing.
These failures include, but may not be limited to the following

Mount failure:
BPXF135E RETURN CODE 00000079, REASON CODE EF096058. THE MOUNT FAILED FOR FILE MOUNT FILESYSTEM Z1A.OMVS.SIGYROOT. 

IOEAGFMT failure:
IOEZ00075E Error 121 reason EF17626B received while creating HFS-compatibility 

SYMPTOM
Reason codes EF096058 or EF17626B in messages IOEZ00075E or BPXF135E


CAUSE
The zFS aggregate was defined with a size that is smaller than the minimum allowed. A zFS aggregate has a minimum allowable size of 6 3390 tracks (36 8K blocks). 

ENVIRONMENT
zOS

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use IDCAMS LISTCAT ENT output to verify size of the VSAM LDS, which is the zFS aggregate. 


Confirm that a LISTCAT ENT('the.zfs.aggr.name') ALL shows in the ALLOCATION section that there are at least 6 primary tracks.

Example:




ALLOCATION 
SPACE-TYPE---------TRACK HI-A-RBA----------294912 
SPACE-PRI--------------6 HI-U-RBA----------294912 
SPACE-SEC--------------1 

NOTE: This value of 6 TRACKS is the MINIMUM allowable for the zfs aggregate to be properly defined, formatted and mounted successfully. It is NOT sufficient for actual usage. 

Confirm that during IOEAGFMT processing that a minimum of 36 8K blocks are defined/formatted. This can be done by reviewing the IOEAGFMT output and looking for message: 
IOEZ00004I Formatting to 8K block number 36 for primary extent of SYWSYS.SYSS.TEST.ZFS 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete and recreate the zFS aggregate with a larger allocation.
