APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The multitool lsshipconfig command stops retrieving storage bay
   data if run sufficiently frequently (6 times per minute) over a
   sufficient period of time (2 days).
   Steps to repro:
   The problem only occurs on Windows systems; the problem does not
   appear to occur on Unix systems.
   1. Set-up two additional storage classes in addition to the
   default storage class. In the script below, the additional two
   classes are called print and customclass
   2. Run the perl script below using ccperl.
   3. After the script runs for 5-6 hours, it will no longer return
   shipping bay information . There are no errors but shipping bay
   information is not displayed. You'll have to stop and re-start
   Clearcase for the multitool lsshipconfig command to work again
   properly
   Note: If you change the sleep delays from 1 second each to 10
   seconds, the script must run for about 2 days before the problem
   occurs
   Copy of script:
   use strict;
   my $count = 0;
   for (my $x = 0; $x < 5000000; $x++) {
   open MYOUTPUT, ">>C:/lsshipconfig_output.txt";
   print  MYOUTPUT ++$count . "\t" . localtime() . "\t" .
   runIt("-default") . "\n";
   sleep(1);
   print  MYOUTPUT ++$count . "\t" . localtime() . "\t" .
   runIt("print") . "\n";
   sleep(1);
   print  MYOUTPUT ++$count . "\t" . localtime() . "\t" .
   runIt("customclass") . "\n";
   sleep(1);
   close MYOUTPUT;
   print  "Still running...\n";
   }
   exit(0);
   sub runIt {
   my $sclass = shift;
   my $MULTITOOL_ERROR = "multitool: Error:";
   my $errorFound=0;
   my $storagePath="";
   my $result="";
   my $slash;
   my $cmd = "";
   my $multitool = "multitool";
   $cmd = "$multitool lsshipconfig -sclass $sclass -stgpath 2>&1
   |";
   unless (open OUTPUT, $cmd)
   {
   return "ERROR $_";
   }
   while (<OUTPUT>) {
   chomp();
   if ((/^$MULTITOOL_ERROR/) || $errorFound==1) {
   $result .= "ERROR: $'";
   $errorFound=1;
   }
   elsif (/Storage Bay Path 1:/) {
   $storagePath = $';
   $result = $storagePath;
   }
   elsif (!$storagePath) {
   $result = "ERROR: The storage class \"$sclass\""
   . " was not found on this host.";
   }
   }
   return $result;
   }
   Workaround:
   Scripts should hard code the incoming and outgoing storage bays.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
