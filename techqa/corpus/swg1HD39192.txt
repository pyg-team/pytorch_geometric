ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  LDAP authentication DOES NOT WORK
   Client OS and level: Windows XP
   Server OS and level: Windows 2003 server
   Database and level: Oracle 9i
   Scenario:
   1. Please find below HotLine call: USA (HL) -
   0015073
   2. Once we have imported the users, we can not
   authenticate them using LDAP authentication. (We
   were able to import one by one - not a good
   solution for the long term, but in order to see
   that it did not authenticate we imported one at
   a time.)
   Following is our user dump from LDAP:
   Unable to authenticate using LDAP using this
   test account:
   dn:
   motguid=SMARTM,ou=people,ou=intranet,dc=motor
   ola,
   dc=com
   motGUID: SMARTM
   motCoreID: SMARTM

   objectClass: inetOrgPerson
   objectClass: motIntranetPerson
   objectClass: motapplications
   objectClass: motaccount
   telephoneNumber: 8475235219
   motDirectoryStatus: A
   motSupervisorID: 10133452
   motEmploymentActivity: A
   motCommerceID: 12017853
   motCommonNames: Admin Smarteam-SMARTM
   cn: Admin Smarteam
   cn: Admin Smarteam-SMARTM
   sn: Smarteam
   motDisplayFirstName: Admin
   motDisplayLastName: Smarteam
   givenName: Admin
   motDirAccountType: A
   uid: SMARTM
   Using the default attribute mapping the username
   in Smarteam appears as "Admin Smarteam, Admin
   Smarteam-SMARTM" if I recall, and trying to
   login as "SMARTM" with LDAP Authentication using
   search attribute of cn or motguid does not
   work. We have tried multiple combinations.
   Scenario for LDAP issue 33967:
   1. Have SUN LDAP in the enterprise
   2. Import users from LDAP to ST via the ST LDAP
   Import Utility
   3. Change Authentication of ST to authenticate
   through LDAP
   4. Try to log in as you do using all other customer
   applications with your UID
   5. Get an error message: Can not authenticate
   user can not be found in DB.
