Title: IBM Compatibility of Controller NYKOMO, OLKOMO with MSAS 2000 / MSAS 2005 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer publishes data from Controller into a Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 (MSAS 2000) OLAP Data Mart. However, they would like to upgrade their MSAS repository from 2000 to MSAS 2005 (SQL 2005). What are the compatability issues? 

CAUSE
By design, some features of Controller are not available if using the 'old' consolidation model ("Olkomo"). Instead, customers are actively encouraged to discuss with their consultant how to migrate to the 'new' consolidation model ('Nykomo'). 

 
Olkomo: 

 * This is also known as the 'old' consolidation model 
 * It is the only consolidation method that was used/available for Controller 2.x  * However, it is still available to be used (although there are some restrictions) for Controller 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 & 8.4.
   
   
 * In this model, the companies are consolidated from bottom to the top level


Nykomo:  * This is also known as the 'new' consolidation model 
 * This has been designed to be the default consolidation method for Controller 8.1 onwards 
 * In this model, the companies are consolidated up to their group, then the values are stored in the group adjustments or in the group, and these values will be shown as base value in the next consolidation level.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Technical (I.T.) Considerations 

The actively-supported software environments are stated on the 'Cognos 8 Controller Software Environments' web page. These show that (from an I.T. perspective) MSAS 2005 was actively supported (for Controller) from Controller 8.3 onwards.

Functional (Application-based) Considerations
If the OLKOMO legacy method of Consolidation is used is used, it will not be possible to upgrade to MSAS 2005.
