PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The .csv file was created through WorkplaceXT and it only can be opened as the text file instead of the Excel file 

SYMPTOM
The .csv file can be opened as the Excel from ACCE and outside of WorkplaceXT but not from inside of the WorkplaceXT


CAUSE
Mime Type was not set correctly when creating the .csv documents via WorkplaceXT

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When creating a .csv document through ACCE, the mime Type is "application/vnd.ms-excel" shown under the Properties tab and Content Element tab. 

 * When adding a .csv document through WorkplaceXT, the mime Type shows "text/csv" from the Properties tab and Content Element tab in ACCE. 
 * Verify if the .csv document with the mime Type "application/vnd.ms-excel" is opened as Excel file in WorkplaceXT

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add a section to Web.xml mapping the extension to the mime type: 

 * 
 * <mime-mapping>
   <extension>csv</extension>
   <mime-type>application/vnd.ms-excel</mime-type>
   </mime-mapping>
