PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Replacement Self-Describing Agent support is provided with
   a certificate that will not expire until November 1, 2018.
   
   The Self-Describing Agent deliverables included
   in this APAR are equivalent to the application
   support files shipped in the associated Fix Pack:
   
   5.1.0-TIV-KGW-FP0004.tar.gz
   5.1.0-TIV-KGW-FP0004.zip
   
   After installing this PTF, you must reload the RTE
   where an OMEGAMON XE for CICS on z/OS agent is running
   and then restart the agent.
   
   If you are NOT using the Self-Defining Agent (SDA) feature,
   this PTF must be installed in conjunction with fix pack
   5.1.0-TIV-KGW-FP0004 which must be applied to the TEPS
   environment and, if the hub TEMS is running on a non-z/OS
   platform it must be applied to the hub TEMS.
   However, if you are using SDA, this is not necessary.
   
   The SDA feature does not update the application support used
   by the TEP Desktop Client. To update the TEP Desktop Client's
   application support to the level delivered by this
   PTF, you must also install fix pack 5.1.0-TIV-KGW-FP0004.
   
   If you are using IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.3.0 and if you have
   not done so already, you should also install IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring V6.3.0 Fixpack 6 or higher on your TEPS, which also
   includes the matching Java certificate.
   If you are not using IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.3.0 refer to
   Technote #1972841 for the procedure to update TEP support
   files when expired certificates are encountered:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21972841 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21972841]
   
   If you have previously installed a language pack image,
   you must install the corresponding language pack deliverable
   with the matching certificate:
   
   5.1.0-TIV-KGW-LP0003.tar.gz
   5.1.0-TIV-KGW-LP0003.zip
   
   Refer to technote #1269613 to locate the current
   language pack deliverable:
