APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the refresh button on the Web Service Proxy WebGUI will
   not pick up the changes done on a service WSDL.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1) Add/remove the WSDL from the WSP Gateway each time you change
   the WSDL.
   2) Add one char to the user summary and then backspace it. The
   apply button will be enabled now.
   3) Add a WSDL Cache Policy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The refresh button for the Web Service Proxy exhibited a bug
   such that the "Apply" button would become enabled when "Refresh"
   was pressed. The would allow a customer to apply changes to the
   Web Service Proxy, even if no actual changes were made. This bug
   was fixed, but the customer had grown accustomed to the
   behavior.  This FIN APAR will address this behavior change such
   h that it will be more convenient to address the refresh/reload
   concern.
