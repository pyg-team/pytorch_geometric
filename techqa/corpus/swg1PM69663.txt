ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Headline:
   Using Response File in Wizard Mode, IM ignores x64 bit selection
   (RAD8.5)
   
   APAR Error Description:
   Abstract: Attempting to use response file in order to install
   x64 bit verion of Rational Application Developer for WebSphere
   Software V8.5 using Installation Manager 1.5.2 in Wizard Mode,
   results in 32 bit installation regardless of the x64 bit
   selection
   Problem:
   1.First you create a response file (either directly or by using
   Installation Manager 1.5.2 to capture your choices)
   2.In your response file, you select x64 bit architecture for
   Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software v8.5
   3.Using the created response file, you try to install the
   software in Wizard Mode.
   4.Installation Manager ignores the x64 bit architecture
   selection and attempts to install RAD 8.5 x32 bit.
   
   Local fix:
   There is no known workaround at this time

   This problem only effects the execution of the IBM
   Installation Manager when invoked in "wizard mode" when the
   Installation Manager is invoked using the -mode wizard
   command line argument along with the -input responseFile
   This problem does not effect the execution of the
   Installation Manager in non-GUI (silent) mode using the same
   response file. This problem does not effect console mode.
   
   If the ?profile? element contains a nested ?data
   key='cic.selector.arch' value='XYZ'/? it will be ignored and
   potentially the wrong profile will be chosen and it will not
   be possible to change this value in the gui.
   
   For example:
   ?profile id='IBM Software Delivery Platform_1'
   installLocation='C:\Program Files\RAD 8.5'?
     ?data key='cic.selector.arch' value='x86_64'/?
   ?/profile?
   
   Work around:
   1. Install silently using the response file
   2. Do not start the Installation Manager with the parameters
   -mode wizard -input responseFile
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This problem has been fixed in the IBM Installation Manager
   version 1.6.
