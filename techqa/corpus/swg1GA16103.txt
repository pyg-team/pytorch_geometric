PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *                     his is a valid parser error.
   
   'CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE' was introduced in SQL Server 2016
   SP1 and not yet
   supported in MSSQL 2005.  You should also see an GDM_EXCEPTION
   record for this
   statement showing the SQL_ERROR that was returned by the DB.

   ver-2016-sp1/
   
   We are happy to announce that SQL Server 2016 SP1 and SQL Server
   v.Next have
   new T-SQL language statement â?? CREATE [OR ALTER]. This
   statement combines
   CREATE and ALTER statements and creates object if it does not
   exist, or alter
   it if it is already there. CREATE OR ALTER can be applied on the
   following
   object:
   
       STORED PROCEDURES
       FUNCTIONS
       TRIGGERS
       VIEWS
