ABSTRACT
 IBM Cúram Social Program Management WebSphere 8.5.5 and Java Version Support 

CONTENT
IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.9 introduced support for Java 8.0 (see here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27005002#WebSphere%208.5.5%20Java%208.0]). This version of Java is available for that WebSphere fix pack as an optional download.

This combination of WebSphere fix pack version and Java version is not supported by the IBM Cúram product pre version 7.0.0.0. IBM Cúram introduced support for Java 8 in Cúram Social Program Management V7.0.0.0.

Customers on a pre V7.0.0.0 Cúram version which supports using WebSphere 8.5.5 are advised not to use the combination of WebSphere fix pack and Java version 8. Customers should instead use the default Java version (6.0) or Java 7.0 (optional download) with that WebSphere fix pack.
