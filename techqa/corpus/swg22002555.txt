SUMMARY
 There are vulnerabilities in IBM SDK Javaâ„¢ Technology Edition that is used by IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2016 and January 2017. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
