QUESTION
Does IBM Mobile Connect offer user account lockout protections or password lockouts? Yes.

ANSWER
For complete instructions on how to install and perform an initial configuration on IBM Mobile Connect see technote 7043160 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043160]. For specific details on creating and configuring the resources discussed in this article see pages 6 - 9 of that same document. 

The first resource to be aware of is called the Wireless Password Policy. Why Wireless? It's a legacy thing, but really has nothing to do with something which is wireless. 

 * Wireless Password Policy - Within the Gatekeeper under the Default Resources container you will find the Wireless Password Policies. There are 3 which are shipped with IMC, but as with any resource new ones could be created, or existing ones modified. This resource container was primarily used when the requirement was to have IMC local user accounts which required passwords. This resource allowed to specify the rules for passwords used to authenticate using local IMC system accounts. However, it is not common to use local IMC based system accounts, but rather to leverage existing user directories within LDAP or RADIUS servers. 
   The Wireless Password Policy still does offer a function which can be useful on a couple of fronts.  * User Account Lockouts and where they take place.
      
      [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985055&amp;aid=1] 
    * The field "Number of failed connection attempts before lock" allows the IMC Administrator to specify how many failures to connect occur before IMC locks that account. 
    * It is important to understand how IMC counts failed connection attempts. In the above screen shot we have 5 failed connection attempts before lock. Traditionally that would lead one to believe that after 5 consecutive failed connections where the password was incorrect IMC would lock the account. That is not how this works. IBM Mobile Connect will ONLY count a connection attempt as FAILED if a unique password arrives on the request. That means that in order for IMC to lock an account locally the same user account would have to submit 5 requests which all had a different password. 
    * The reason that IMC operates this way is to implement another user account lockout feature and that is User Account Lockout at the Authentication Server level. It is desirable in most cases to prevent unnecessary calls from users into call centers to get their accounts unlocked in the company LDAP / RADIUS servers. To assist with this problem IMC will not resend a new request to an LDAP / RADIUS server for authentication on an account which IMC has received a return code indicating a bad password. If a new request has a different password after a failed attempt then it would go to the authentication server for validation.  * The use case here would be an IBM Verse or Connections Mobile app which has the log-in credentials stored in the app. The account password needs to be changed and is changed by the user on the company authentication server. However, on the mobile app the password has not been changed. The mobile device attempts to connect to Traveler or Connections, etc. using a password which is no longer valid. IMC has no awareness of this. A request is sent to IMC and forwarded to the Authentication Server. The Authentication Server responds back with a bad password response. IMC sends this response to the device and notes this failure. ONLY with the Wireless Password Policy in use with an Authentication Profile will IMC accept the incoming requests from the device, but if the requests contain the same known bad password IMC will NOT connect to the Authentication Server again, but does create a Message Log (wg.log) entry indicating that this account has tried X times with the same bad password. The login fails and device is notified of the failure. This helps to prevent an account from being locked out at the Authentication Server. 
      
      
   
   Authentication Profiles 
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21985055&amp;aid=2] 
   
   Authentication Profiles are the mechanism by which IMC validates user requests for access to configured applications. Authentication Profiles are associated with HTTP Access Services or Mobile Access Services. For HTTP Access an Authentication Profile is configured on the Mode Tab. For flexibility among many possible HTTP Access Service resources there exists the ability to "Automatically unlock accounts after (min). 
   
    * If user accounts do become locked at the IMC level, in order to assist in preventing unwanted calls from users to unlock their accounts at this level the Authentication Profile may specify the number of minutes before IMC will automatically unlock a user account. This feature has no bearing on accounts locked for other reasons than the number of failed connection attempts with a bad password, nor does this feature have any affect on locked accounts at an LDAP or RADIUS server level.

 * A feature added with APAR IV82920 will allow a timer specified in minutes which will reset the Password Retry timeout. The default time is 1440 or 24 hours. So, the default behavior (and following the values in this technote) would be if 5 CONSECUTIVE requests were received from a user account which had different bad passwords then the account would get locked. Otherwise, when using the same bad password IMC gets the failure from LDAP, and does not return to that server if it receives new requests with the same known bad password. 
 * While the Lockout Protection is normally viewed as a positive thing, sometimes more control over the situation is desired. One use case would be where the End User successfully changes their password, but it may take X amount of time to become effective at the LDAP server. If that End User attempts to use the updated password immediately, IMC will get a failed login attempt return code from LDAP, and upon subsequent attempts which also use the same flagged incorrect password IMC will not return to LDAP. The End User is unaware of this, and if there were a configuration option allowing the same bad password counter to expire after a certain amount of time then end users might be educated that sometimes updated passwords may take some time to become effective, and IMC could still offer protection while allowing End User's with known good passwords to ultimately log in to their application via IBM Mobile Connect.
   In that case an administrator could use the Password Retry timeout (min) feature to lower the amount of time which made sense for their environment.
