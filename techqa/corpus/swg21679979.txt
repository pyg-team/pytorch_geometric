Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 You cannot restrict file uploads by MIME type in a document list coach view. As a result, potentially malicious files, such as HTML that contains embedded JavaScript can be uploaded and run in the browser. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-3075 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-3075]
DESCRIPTION: 
IBM BPM document management feature might allow a remote attacker to include arbitrary files. A remote attacker might upload a file from a remote system, which might be viewed in an iframe by other end users.

CVSS Base Score: 4.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93817 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93817] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

 * IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092]


If you are using earlier unsupported versions, IBM strongly recommends that you upgrade to a supported version. 

The fix introduces additional functionality to the product with two server-side configuration options. One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. 
 * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. 
 * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.


The following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: 

<server> 
<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> 
<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> 
<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> 
<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> 
<allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type> 
<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> 
<mime-type>text/plain</mime-type> 
<mime-type>img/png</mime-type> 
</document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> 

<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> 
<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> 
<!-- document list or document attachment --> 
<document-attachment-download-mime-types> 
<!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type --> 
<mime-type-map> 
<from>text/html</from> 
<to>text/plain</to> 
</mime-type-map> 
<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content/octet-stream --> 
<mime-type-map> 
<from>application/pdf</from> 
</mime-type-map> 
</document-attachment-download-mime-types> 
</server> 

Note: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text/html MIME type and maps it to the text/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
