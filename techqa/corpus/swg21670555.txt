Title: IBM SDK Enhancement to Workspace Advanced for a API to retrieve the Reporting Content. - United States

Text:
Workspace Advanced SDK API TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there an SDK API that can retrieve the Workspace or Workspace Advanced reporting Content ? 

CAUSE
Using Cognos Workspace Advanced and would like the internal API's exposed in a public SDK. 

ANSWER
Currently there is not a Cognos SDK code API available that retrieves the complete Workspace or Workspace Advanced Report or Page from the Workspace product. 

Request for Enhancement (RFE) SDK or Workspace Advanced expose an API for a Cognos Workspace report or page retrieval. 

An alternative solution is to use CMS API. 

If interested in Reporting Content only, for example Text, List or Table Data and the Graphic Charts of the report, this can be done via the Cognos Mashup Services. 

The CMS technology does usually require further applied and managed Formatting and Page Layout designs in a custom Web environment. 

This means that it needs to be further processed by the end user application to be similar in formatting as what is seen in Workspace / Workspace Advanced. 

Other issue can be that any dynamic technology that is present in Workspace / Workspace Advanced can not be retrieved in this manner.
