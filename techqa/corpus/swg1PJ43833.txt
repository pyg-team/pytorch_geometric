APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In working with work items where the work details page contains
   a
   properties view containing 400+ properties, the memory footprint
   of Microsoft Internet Explorer V11 browser will increase.  The
   memory footprint does not decrease much even after the work item
   has been closed.  The situation gets worst when multiple work
   items are open at the same time.
   
   This is also an issue with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome,
   but the memory growth is much less, and the memory footprint
   after the work items are closed is less severe.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Design a properties view for a work details page with much less
   properties shown to a user at one time.
   Use an alternative browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google
   Chrome that has better memory management.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.4-ICM-FP004.  With this fix, IBM Case Manager
   reduces the amount of memory usage that is used when displaying
   a page with a lot (400+) of properties.  Users might still see
   an increase of memory usage of a browser after the page with a
   lot of properties have been closed, but this is significantly
   reduced.  The amount of additional memory that is still consumed
   varies with different browsers as some of this is related to the
   different styles of memory management each browsers have.
