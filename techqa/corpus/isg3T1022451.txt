 WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY MACHINE HAS BEEN REGISTERED? 
 Visit the website: https://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home [https://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home]. This website is designed to allow the user to perform the following actions:

A. Sign a Customer Agreement Contract (each company must have at least one of these contracts signed, either manually on paper, or by using this site to sign an electronic agreement)
B. Sign a Supplement Contract for one or more Machine Type serials. (This can be done via paper agreement or using this site to sign the supplement electronically).
C. In the event that electronic signature is not appropriate for your company. This site will point users to paper agreements that you can download, print, sign and return to your IBM Sales representative or Business Partner.
D. Request a new activation code.
E. View agreements you have signed. (Both Customer Agreements Contract, or Supplement Contracts can be viewed). 

On this website please enter the Machine Type and Serial number(s) for one or more machines. You may sign the electronic agreements one time for multiple agreements, but for requesting an activation code, you must do that action once per machine. 

This website will also show you status of each MT/Serial you have entered. It will allow you to see if the machine has been registered by the IBM Sales Representative/Business Partner, if you have signed the Customer Agreement Contract, and if a Supplement Contract exists. If all three of those exist, then you will be able to request a new activation code.

As long as the machine passes the "Sales Rep Registration" check, then the webpage will check if you have a "Customer Agreement Contract" and a "Supplement Contract".
