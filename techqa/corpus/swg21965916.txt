PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer had published duplicate items from the Model which were confusing Report Authors using Cognos Studios or Cognos Workspace Advanced because of conflicting data types and duplicate names. 

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos BI Server, Framework Manager (all versions)

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Duplicate/unrequired data items and measured will be seen in Cognos Studios and Workspace Advanced.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Duplicate/unrequired data items need to be hidden from view in the Package and republished.


More information can be found in the Framework Manager documentation: 

1) Open the model in Framework Manager. 

2) Right click the existing package. 

3) Select 'Edit definitions'. 

4) Click on the 'Dimensions/Hierarchy' and click on the 'selection icon' until it displays a half green triangle. This will 'hide' the 'Hierarchy/Dimension' from the user. 

5) Publish the Model, and allow it to over write the existing Model.
