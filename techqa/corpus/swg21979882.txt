Text:
promotion resource definition resource for bundle for java TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to run promoted jobs using IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services result in the error: 



java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.

util.PropertyResourceBundle, key 0ada88bcea18dac4000001528330c8a303bd

SYMPTOM
The same job will execute in the source environment, but fail in the target (promoted) environment


CAUSE
The resource definitions for the job were created in the target environment and also promoted with the job causing a conflict in the key.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the job to see where it is failing and the error
In this example, the job step that was failing has a credential that was trying to make a connection.
On the Target System, navigate to Resource Definitions > Credential > Right Click on the credential
Review the properties and look at the Object URI
Compare this to the one from the Source System.

In this example, the error message indicated it was looking for the object id of the credential from the source system.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
One way to resolve this problem is to edit the job step, point it to the credential and resave the job.
However, if there are many resource definitions for the job, you may choose to delete the ones you added on the target server and re-promote your job.
