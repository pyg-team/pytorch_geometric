APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This APAR addresses several issues relating to the usage of the
   MQ V7 JMS classes in WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere
   Message Broker.
   124631 - Transactional MQ work performed using the JMS classes
   is not correctly co-ordinated with WAS or WMB's RRS transaction.
   Symptoms include uncommitted messages on queues, JMS work
   failing with reason code 2024 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_LIMIT_REACHED),
   and gets or puts being committed or backed out independently of
   the transaction that they should have been included in.
   121444 - FFST when running in WAS with a 64bit JVM, reporting a
   structure size mismatch. The stacktrace shows the FFST as being
   issued by com.ibm.mq.jmqi.local.LocalMQ.checkSize().
   122887 - Exception in WMB when attempting to construct an
   MQRRSConnectionFactory, MQRRSQueueConnectionFactory or
   MQRRSTopicConnectionFactory. The excpetion occurs because the
   required constructor method is not available.
