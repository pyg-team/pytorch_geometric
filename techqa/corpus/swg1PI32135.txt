ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When I try and read data from Cognos 10.2.1 - the demo GO Sales
   data query - and this fails. Reading other GO Sales data works;
   only the query fails.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue occurs because Modeler does not respect Cognos BI's
   advanced encoding settings for CSV file. Previously we use the
   default encoding (which is utf-16le) to read characters from CSV
   file generated by Cognos BI. So if Cognos BI use utf-8 to encode
   its CSV file, we'll get incorrect values by using utf-16le to
   parse the CSV file. So if users try to connect to a Cognos BI
   server which has non-default CSV encoding defined, then Cognos
   import node will fail to import data from that Cognos BI server.
   
   For valid values of Cognos advanced settings related to CSV
   file, please see following lists. Please note, currently we only
   support RSVP.CSV.ENCODING, RSVP.CSV.DELIMITER,
   RSVP.CSV.TERMINATOR.
   
   Parameter Description
   RSVP.CSV.ENCODING The encoding used for CSV output.
    Enter a supported encoding value Supported Encoding Values.
   LOCALE Encoding is derived from the content locale.
    The default value is utf-16le.
   RSVP.CSV.DELIMITER The field delimiter character used for CSV
   output.
    Enter one of the following:
    a single character
    If you enter more than one character, only the first character
   is used.
    TAB (tab)
    This is the default value.
   RSVP.CSV.QUALIFIER The string qualifier used for CSV output.
   This property is only used in the report output if there are one
   or more special characters in the queried data. The property is
   used to specify an escape character to handle the special
   character(s).
    The default value is " (quotation mark).
    Enter a single character. If you enter more than one character,
   only the first character is used.
    If the qualifier appears as part of your data, it is
   duplicated. For example, if the qualifier is a quotation mark
   and your data is ab"cd, the CSVoutput is "ab""cd".
   RSVP.CSV.TERMINATOR The line terminator used for CSV output.
    Enter one of the following values:
    CR (carriage return)
    LF (line feed)
    This is the default value.
    CRLF (carriage return/line feed)
    LFCR (line feed/carriage return)
    If you enter more than one value, only the first value is used.
   RSVP.CSV.MIMETYPE The MIME type attributed to the CSV output.
    The default value is:
    application/vnd.ms-excel/
   RSVP.CSV.REPEAT_XTAB_LABELS Specifies whether to repeat the edge
   labels in a nested crosstab report. For example, a crosstab has
   years in the rows and order method nested within years. You can
   show the year label in each order method row or only in the top
   row for each year.
    The values are:
    True
    The crosstab edge labels are repeated.
    False (default)
    The crosstab edge labels are not repeated.
