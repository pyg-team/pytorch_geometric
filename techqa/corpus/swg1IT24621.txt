   Error description
   Several fixes for API Connect integration were added:

   transitions to  up, its API Connect Gateway Service and Gateway
   Peering objects do not correctly transition to up.
     (2) After DataPower processes the configuration defined in
   API Connect,  the SSL Client Profile on DataPower is not
   equivalent to the TLS Client Profile defined for the gateway.
     (3) Address problems with the connection for and processing of
     configuration data between API Manager and DataPower Gateway
