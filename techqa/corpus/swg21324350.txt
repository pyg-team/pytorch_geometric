QUESTION
 How do you configure IBM Rational DOORS server to restrict connections to a minimum client version and a maximum client version? 

CAUSE
Sometimes it may be necessary to allow only certain versions of the DOORS client to connect to the server. 

For example, to make the Requirements Interchange Format (RIF) functionality fully available the server must be configured to use a minimum client version 9.2.0.1


ANSWER
You need to change the database login policy to set the minimum/maximum client version. 

To change the login policy of your database: 

 1. Log on to Rational DOORS as a Database Manager or a Custom user who has the power to manage the database.
    
    
 2. In the Database Explorer, make sure the Database view is selected (if necessary, click View > Database View).
    
    
 3. In the left pane, click Database icon, and then right-click Properties.
    
    
 4. Click the Login Policy tab.
    
    
 5. In the section labeled Client Versions 


Type the minimum client version that you want to be able to connect to the Rational DOORS Database Server, in the format n.n.n.n. For example, type 9.2.0.1 in Minimum client version and 9.3.0.2 in Maximum client version.

Note: DOORS will not allow you to specify a value that prevents your current client from connecting to the database.
