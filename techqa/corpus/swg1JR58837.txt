APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) is configured with the
   custom context root, the client browser might fail with a 401
   error to one of the following files:
   
   
   /mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/processPort
   alTheme/img/openhand.cur
   
   or
   
   /mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/processPort
   alTheme/img/closedhand.cur
   
   As a result, users can't access Heritage Process Portal and must
   to log in again.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the CSS rules containing the full-path references from
   the
   /mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/processPort
   alTheme/theme.css file, which is located in WebDav.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue occurs because the full-path references to
   openhand.cur and closedhand.cur are defined without the context
   root prefix in the
   /mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/processPort
   alTheme/theme.css file, which is located in WebDav:
   
   ============
   
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer li.hover
   .dashboardItem-text,
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer .organizerInnerLi:hover,
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer .keyboardSelected
   .organizerInnerLi,
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer .dojoDndItemOver,
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer .dojoDndItemOver {
    cursor:
   url(/mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/process
   PortalTheme/img/openhand.cur), move;
   }
   
   .dj_ie .dojoDndMove .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer li.hover
   .dashboardItem-text,
   .dj_ie .dojoDndMove .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer
   .organizerInnerLi:hover,
   .dj_ie .dojoDndMove  .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer
   .dojoDndItemOver,
   .dj_ie .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer-avatar,
   .dj_ie .dojoDndMove .bpm-social-dashboardOrganizer {
    cursor:
   url(/mum/mycontenthandler/mm/dav/filestore/public/themes/process
   PortalTheme/img/closedhand.cur), move;
   }
   ==================
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that removes full-path references to openhand.cur and
   closedhand.cur will be available in a future release of IBM BPM.
