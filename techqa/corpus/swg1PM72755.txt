PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the DB2 Object Comparison Tool      *
   *                 for z/OS who compare DB2 triggers and use    *
   *                 the 'Run SQLID' option on panel GOC5         *
   *                 'Generate Compare Jobs'.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A CREATE TRIGGER statement can be       *
   *                      preceded with a SET CURRENT SCHEMA =    *
   *                      CURRENT_SQLID rather than a SET         *
   *                      CURRENT SCHEMA = CURRENT_SCHEMA.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A CREATE TRIGGER statement preceded with a SET CURRENT SCHEMA =
   CURRENT_SQLID  will result in a SQLCODEN204 / SQLCODE=-204 if
   there are any unqualified objects in the trigger body:
   
   DNT408I SQLCODE = -204, ERROR:
   >object_name< IS AN UNDEFINED NAME
   DSNT418I SQLSTATE   = 42704
   SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
