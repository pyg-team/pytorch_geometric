PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, "This operation is permitted only when the entity is in an editable state", that can occur when using IBM Rational ClearQuest Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). 

SYMPTOM
This problem occurs with an ALM schema. When using the Copy Project button on the Related Projects tab, you get this error:

ERROR! The entity's Named Hook "ALM_CopyProject" failed, the error message is 'This operation is permitted only when the entity is in an editable state (that is, when an AdActionDef of the appropriate type is being applied) at C:/Program Files/Rational/ClearQuest/Common/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/CQPerlExt.pm'

CAUSE
An ALMSecurityPolicy record named "Everyone" does not exist.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Creating a Security Policy record named "Everyone" will resolve this problem. 


Here is an excerpt from the Copying an existing project topic [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cqhelp/v7r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearquest.alm.doc/topics/cloning.htm] of the ClearQuest Information Center [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg27010159]:

If a new category is specified for the new cloned project, all ALMRole record SecurityPolicies are set to the Everyone SecurityPolicy. You may need to update the value for each ALMRole record SecurityPolicy on the cloned records as required by your policy.

It should state that you need to create an ALMSecurityPolicy record named "Everyone" prior to running Copy Project. This is a documentation defect that will be addressed in a future update of the ClearQuest Information Center.
