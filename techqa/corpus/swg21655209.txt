Title: IBM Cognos ICM - Import from Excel fails due to heterogeneous data in column - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When importing from an Excel file, the import fails due to certain records. If imported separately, the same failing records are imported successfully. 

SYMPTOM
In Excel, the column containing PayeeID has no Null values, but an error as below is thrown: 

1 error(s) detected.

Error Type:
==============
Varicent.Core.Exceptions.ImportFailedException

Details:
==============
1 error.

Record 109, Values , Ivan Gonzales, , , igonzales@company.com, , , , , GBP, , , , , , , , 16i, Nuestra Compania, Sucursal en Es, , 62550, : Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'PayeeID', table 'ENV_DEV.dbo.TEMP11002296087'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.

The statement has been terminated.

The cells format on the column containing PayeeID is 'General', and data has 2 different formats: some IDs are strictly numerical (e.g. 12345), while others are not (e.g. A1234).
In the ICM model, the corresponding PayeeID field is defined as Text.

CAUSE
The problem resides in the way that the import engine interprets different types of data. 

If the first value imported is numerical (e.g. 12345), the engine will consider that all the values in the column are of numeric type, based on the the first value checked, and an import error will be displayed when reaching a non-numeric value (such as A1234).


ENVIRONMENT
Admin Client



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If, in Excel, the column is formatted as 'Text', the import will run successfully, as all the data will be interpreted as strings. In order to achieve this, select the cells to be imported (or the entire column), right-click and select Format Cells. From the 'Number' tab, select 'Text'.
