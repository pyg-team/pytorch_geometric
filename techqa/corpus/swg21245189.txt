Steps to help resolve EJB problems 
Before beginning the troubleshooting process, it might be helpful to review the educational material, tutorials, and demonstrations concerning EJBs and other WebSphere Application Server functionality that is available in the IBM Education Assistant [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/education/assistant/index.html]. 

A good starting point for troubleshooting is the documents available provided by looking up troubleshooting EJBs: starting point for troubleshooting EJBs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/search/Troubleshooting%20EJB]. In the previous link, go down through the listing and pick the area that best suits your needs. 

JNDI Problems 
Are you experiencing a problem doing a JNDI lookup of an EJB?  * Yes, review this TroubleShooting [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21224080] document for JNDI Naming problems.  * 
    * 
   
   
 * No, continue to the next question.
   

Does a NameNotFoundException occur when the JNDI lookup of the EJB is done?  * Yes, review this [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21168795]technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21233726].
   
   
 * No, continue to the next question.
   
   

CORBA Problems 
Does a CORBA error occur when your EJB client application tries to access the EJB?  * Yes, review this [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21178788] TroubleShooting [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21237101] document for Object Request Broker (ORB) problems. 
 * Special note! If you are receiving a CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT No Cluster Data Available, with WLMLSDRouter.select() on the stack. This type of error is most likely a WLM issue. Check for a Work Load Management (WLM) issue by doing the following

Transaction Problems 
Is the problem related to transactions?  * Yes, review the TroubleShooting documents for Transaction problems and continue to the next question. Transaction TroubleShooting documents. [https://www.ibm.com/support/home/site-search/C578916B44100K52/websphere/websphere_application_server?q=troubleshoot%20transactions]
   
 * No, continue to question 1 under Database Connection and Connection Pooling Problems.
   
   

Is the problem related to a transaction timeout (WTRN0006W warnings appear in the SystemOut.log file)?  * Yes, consider changing the Total transaction lifetime timeout setting either [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/udat_contranserv.html] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21198425] globally or for a particular EJB. 
   
   
 * No, continue to the next question.
   
   

Database Connection and Connection Pooling Problems 
Is the problem related to database connectivity or connection pooling?  * Yes, review the TroubleShooting document for Connection Pooling problems. TroubleShooting data access problems. [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/container_data_troubleshooting.html] 
 * No, continue to next question.
   
   

Web Services Problems 
Does a java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out occur when trying to invoke a Web service from an EJB?  * Yes, Refer to Transaction Service Settings in the WebSphere Application Server Information Center for details on the transaction settings and how to increase the Application Server transaction time-out to allow the web service to respond.
   
   
 * No, continue to the next question.
   
   

Review the WebSphere Application Server v7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/welcome_nd.html], v8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/welcome_nd.html], v8.5.5 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/welcome_nd.html], or v9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/as_ditamaps/was900_welcome_ndmp.html] Product Documentation, or the WebSphere Application Server support site [https://www.ibm.com/support/home/product/C578916B44100K52/WebSphere_Application_Server] for additional information that might help you to resolve the problem.
