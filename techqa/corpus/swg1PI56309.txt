APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running CICS TS 4.2, you experience the following errors at
   startup:
   DFHMQ0386 I STARTCKTI initiated from TERMID=MQ12
             TRANID=CKSQ USERID=PRDFPC00 and is accepted.
   DFHMQ0386 I STARTCKTI initiated from TERMID=MQ02
             TRANID=CKSQ USERID=SYSSDS00 and is accepted.
   .
   DFHAP0707 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred in
             task related user exit program DFHMQTRU.
   DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at
             offset X'0000CC0A' in module DFHMQTRU.
   DFHAC2236 Transaction CKTI abend ASRA in program DFHMQTRU
   The region eventually came down.
   .
   This abend0C4 is occuring in procedure PROCESS_MAILBAG, within
   the SEARCH_GMAIL routine-offset x'2Be' in DFHMQTRQ.
   This appears to involve a serialization problem, similar but
   not the same as APAR PM84649 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM84649].

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A CICS region connected to WebSphere MQ *
   *                      abends S0C4 in module DHMQTRU when the  *
   *                      CICS-WebSphere MQ adapter is being      *
   *                      started.                                *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A CICS region is connected to WebSphere MQ and several CKTI
   trigger monitor tasks are being started. When the CICS-WebSphere
   MQ adapter is starting an abend S0C4 occurs at offset x'CC0A' in
   DFHMQTRU.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The processing in DFHMQTRU to unchain CKTI tasks when the
   CICS-WebSphere MQ adapter is being started has been altered so
   that it now runs serially for each task.
