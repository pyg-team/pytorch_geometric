APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  - Same as Issue 11-13250 / APAR IZ98606 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ98606].
   - This problem impacts Core and other Industry Solutions PM
   processes as well.
   
   Steps to replicate the issue in Maxdemo database,
   Maximo Base Services 7.1.1.7
   Nuclear 7.1.1.0 with NUC7110_hfixes.20110518-1230.zip Hotfix
   
   - Log into Maximo as wilson
   - Go to Assets > Assets(Nuc)
   - Click on New Asset button, accept the default values and enter
   this info:
   Asset = ASSET100
   - Save Asset and change the Status to OPERATING
   - Go to Preventive Maintenance > Preventive Maintenance(Nuc)
   - Click on New PM button, accept the default values and enter
   this info:
   PM = PM100
   Asset = ASSET100
   - Click on Frequency tab, accept the default values and enter
   this info in the Time Based Frequency subtab:
   Regulatory Frequency = 20
   Frequency = 15
   Frequency Units = DAYS
   - Save PM and change the Status to ACTIVE
   - Select Action > Generate Work Orders
   - In Generate Work Orders dialog box, uncheck "Use Frequency
   Criteria?" and click on OK (just to generate the first WO)
   - Select Action > Generate Work Orders again
   - In Generate Work Orders dialog box enter this info:
   . Generate WOs Due Today Plus This Number of Days = 150
   . Keep the "Use Frequency Criteria?" selected
   . Click on OK (to generate more 10 Work Orders)
   - Take note of the numbers of the generated Work Orders. In my
   case, the generated Work Orders have been:
   Work Order 1174
   Work Order 1175
   Work Order 1176
   Work Order 1177
   Work Order 1178
   Work Order 1179
   Work Order 1180
   Work Order 1181
   Work Order 1182
   Work Order 1183
   - Go to Work Orders > Work Order Tracking and do the following:
   - Remove the Target Finish date from 3 random Work Order that
   were generated by the PM.
   In my case, I done it in Work Orders 1175, 1177 and 1179.
   - Change the Status to COMP on most of the 10 Work Orders,
   including the 03 Work Orders without the Target Finish dates.
   In my case, I done it in Work Orders from 1174 to 1181.
   - In the 03 Work Orders without the Target Finish dates, change
   both Actual Start and Actual Finish dates to different dates (IE
   yesterday, today, and day before yesterday).
   In my case, I done the following:
   Work Order 1175: Actual Start and Actual Finish dates =
   yesterday
   Work Order 1177: Actual Start and Actual Finish dates = today
   Work Order 1179: Actual Start and Actual Finish dates = day
   before yesterday
   - Go to Preventive Maintenance > Preventive Maintenance(Nuc)
   - Bring up the PM100
   - Select Action > Generate Work Orders
   - In Generate Work Orders dialog box enter this info:
   . Generate WOs Due Today Plus This Number of Days = 230
   . Keep the "Use Frequency Criteria?" selected
   . Click on OK (to generate more 10 Work Orders)
   
   The issue is:
   At this point, system presents the error messages:
   BMXAA3210E - Failure while generating work orders.
   BMXAA4129E - Record already exists for Site=BEDFORD, PM=PM100,
   Regulatory Date=mm/dd/yy hh:mm.

 *  No workaround has been found.
