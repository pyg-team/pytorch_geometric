QUESTION
 How to Configure Sterling Connect:Direct Server Adapter with TLS1.1 as Security Protocol in SB2Bi 5.2.5.0_x? 

ANSWER
It is not possible to configure Sterling Connect:Direct Server Adapter with TLS1.1 option in SB2Bi 5.2.5.0_x. It offers SSL, TLS1.0 & TLS.12 as options.

However, SB2Bi 5.2.6.0 offers TLS1.1 option in Sterling Connect:Direct Server Adapter as well as Sterling Connect:Direct Node. Precisely, Protocol options in 5.2.6.0 fixpack release are TLS1.0, TLS1.1 & TLS1.2. Note SSL no longer exists.
