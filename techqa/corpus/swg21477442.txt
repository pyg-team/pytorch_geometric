Title: IBM "A default table space could not be found with a pagesize of at least 4096" error trying to use in-database caching in DB2 from Modeler - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to use the in-database caching functionality in Modeler\Clementine to create a cache in my stream that reads from DB2. However, when I do this, as soon as I execute the stream to fill the cache I get the following error:

"S1000-4294967010 [DataDirect][ODBC DB2 Wire Protocol driver][UDB DB2 for Windows, UNIX, and Linux] A default table space could not be found with a pagesize of at least 4096 that authorization ID TEST is authorized to use."

why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To configure DB2 to enable in-database caching to work properly in Modeler\Clementine, please ask your DBA to create a "user temporary" tablespace and grant access to this tablespace to relevant DB2 account(s) - (these being the ones that you are using to login to DB2 from Modeler\Clementine). 

It is recommended to use a pagesize of 32768 in the new tablespace as this will increase the limit on the number of fields that can be successfully cached.

Once you have done this you should be able to successfully create in-database caches in DB2 from Modeler\Clementine.
