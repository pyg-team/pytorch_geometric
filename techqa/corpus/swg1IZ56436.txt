ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In ITIM v4.6 FP68 when using SSUI, if you try to set a February
   date in a date field in a person form and your system date is
   one of the latest days of any month, the February date is set to
   a month after.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Place 2 attributes of date type on a person form
   
   2. Set the host operating system date to 01.30.2009
   
   
   
   3. Set the the first date attribute on person form to
   01/30/2009, and the second to 2/4/2009 (4th of february), and
   press submit in the SSUI.
   
   
   4. You will see that the second attributes is set to 3/4/2009
   (it is postponed of 1 month).
   
   I reproduced the problem in my environment and I found out that:
   
   - on the 29th, 30th, and 31st of any month (system date), if you
   set in the  SSUI the date attribute to any February date, that
   date is postponed of one month.
   
   It does not depend by the first or second attribute. It always
   happens with February dates.
   
   I could reproduce the problem by setting the system date to Jan
   30th, 31st, March 29th, 30th, 31st, April 30st (I didn't do
   other test)
   The problem did not occur when I set system date to Jan 28th,
   Feb 28th, March 28th.
   
   ----
   
   In customer environment the problem occurred also
   today,
   March 31th by setting date to April 3rd in the SSUI, it became
   May 3rd.
