PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the supported Oracle 11g Release (R1 or R2) in MCSF 8.5 and 9.0? 

SYMPTOM


Sterling MCSF 8.5 and 9.0 related Oracle (certified) stacks details.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


 * 
 * 8.5 and 9.0 are certified for both Oracle 10g; and Oracle 11g, Release 1, specifically 11.1.0.7. With either version, the configuration can be a single node, or a 2-node RAC.
 * 
 * 8.5 and 9.0- are not currently certified for Oracle 11g Release 2, and is not certified for a 3-node RAC.

Note: The installation of MCSF 8.5 and 9.0 are known to have difficulty when an Oracle 2-node RAC configuration is provided for the database connectivity details up front. The recommended work-around is to provide only a single node connector during installation, and then reconfigure to a 2-node after installation is completed.
