PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IBM Websphere Application Server version 6   *
   *                 (appservers, nodeagents, dmgrs) users using  *
   *                 JNIReaders                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: JNIReader threads hang when read        *
   *                      fails due to network problems           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Since a JNIReader thread handles up to 1024 different
   connections, when the read for a particular connection becomes
   hung (due to a network issue or abrupt non-programmtic
   disconnect from the client) the whole JNIReader becomes hung
   for all the other connections it was servicing
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added 2 new properties which allow the setting of a read
   timeout and also to allow keepalive setting on the server
   socket to clean up connections which become orphaned under
   these conditions.
   
   
   
   The following 2 new ORB properties have been added, the
   default settings of which will ensure original behavior:
   
   com.ibm.CORBA.JNIReadTimeout (set in milliseconds, default is 0)
   
   
   com.ibm.CORBA.EnableServerKeepAlive (true or false, default
   false)
   
   When the JNIReadTimeout is set to a positive number, the
   JNIReader thread for each connection will set to a read timeout
   to that value, causing a timeout to occur should there be a
   break in the connection during the read and all data is not
   read before the timeout period.
   
   When EnableServerKeepAlive is set to "true", and a client
   disconnects from the server by powering off or when network
   issues arise such that the server is unable to detect that the
   client connetion has been broken, the server will be able to
   clean up the "orphaned" connections via the tcp keepalive OS
   setting, and thus connections will not build up continually on
   the server between recycles.
   
   
   
   This apar is targeted for fixpacks 6.0.2.19 and 6.1.0.9.
