LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  During upgrade to WPS 7.0.0.3, BPMProfileUpgrade.ant fails in
   bpeupgrade.jacl when the Oracle URL was specified using
   Net connection descriptor syntax, for example:
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST
   = localhost)(PORT = 41521)) (CONNECT_DATA =(SERVICE_NAME =
   BPEDB)))
   
   The exception looks similar to this:
   
   Writing database design file using '-databaseType Oracle -noexec
   true -delayConfig true -scenario WorkItemMigration -databaseName
   {(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST =
   localhost)(PORT = 41521)) (CONNECT_DATA =(SERVICE_NAME =
   BPEDB)))} -databaseSchema WPRBE00'...
   Process Choreographer upgrade aborted due to:
   com.ibm.ws.scripting.ScriptingException:
   com.ibm.bpm.db.config.exceptions.MetadataException:
   com.ibm.bpm.db.config.exceptions.MetadataException: failed to
   create the specified output directory
   /WebSphere/ProcServer/profiles/Dmgr01/dbscripts/ProcessChoreogra
   pher/Oracle/(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST =
   localhost)(PORT = 41521)) (CONNECT_DATA =(SERVICE_NAME =
   BPEDB)))/WPRBE00.
   
   After applying this interim fix as described below, re-run
   BPMProfileUpgrade.ant as described in the WPS 7.0.0.3
