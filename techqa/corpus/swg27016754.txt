ABSTRACT
 This techdoc lists the software requirements for IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, version 7.0. 

CONTENT
The information provided here describes the minimum product levels you need installed before opening a problem report with the WebSphere Adapters support team. Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, it is not possible to test every configuration. In general, you can install and run updates to supported products if those updates are compatible with later versions. This statement does not apply to enterprise information system (EIS) product versions and their dependencies. Specific cases where this statement is not applicable are indicated where relevant.
