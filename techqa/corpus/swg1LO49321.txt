APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is not possible to have Smartupgrade distinguish between a
   Notes client in a
   Citrix environment and one in a normal windows environment.
   The  Smartupgrade process is principly a Policy. Everything is
   administred on
   the server.
   When the Notes user authenticates with the Domino server, the
   server checks if
   there is a Smartupgrade policy for that user.
   There is no way to see if that user is logging on from a normal
   Notes  client
   or a thin client on a Citrix server.
   As a result, if a user is working in Citrix,  he would still be
   annoyed with
   the upgrade request, every time he authenticates.
   But Smartupgrade does not work in Citrix, since a  Multi user
   client needs to
   be re-installed, not upgraded.
   
   This is mainly a problem in companies where users both have
   laptops ( that
   should be upgraded ) and Notes clients in Citrix ( that should
   not be upgraded
   )
   The customer asked for an enhancement where Smartupgrade would
   not ask the
   upgrade questions for multi user installation
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround 1 : The Notes ini parameters
   SM_DontPromptUpgrade=Release 6.X.X
   and  UPDATE_TIMER=03/01/2004 09:00:00 AM, work both on normal
   and Citrix
   clients.  If a user is working both on a laptop and in a Citrix
   thin client,
   then he has 2 notes.ini's.
   to solve the problem, the administrator should put the notes.ini
   parameters in
   the notes.ini of the Notes client in the Citrix environment.
   the other notes.ini should not have that parameter. As a result
   only the other
   notes client would get the request to be upgraded.
   
   Workaround 2 :
   Make 2 different Organizational Units  for the 2 types of
   machines : 1 for the
   laptops and 1 for the Citrix clients.
   Put the  users that both have a laptop and are on Citrix   in
   both  OU's. They
   would be know in your company with  2 different hierarchical
   names .
   The users that only have Citrix Notes clients, should only be in
   the Citrix OU.
   The ones that are never on Citrix should only be in the other
   OU.
   
   In the Citrix OU, you do not create the Smartupgrade Policy.
   This way, these
   users will never be asked to upgrade.
   In the other OU, you keep the Smartupgrade Policy as an
   Organizational policy
   for the users of that OU.
   
   This way a user called  John Doe would never be asked to
   upgrade, by
   Smartupgrade when he is working in Citrix. Since on that machine
   he would log
   on as John Doe\Citrix\companyname.
   When he goes to the laptop, he has to log on as John
   Doe\Laptop\compose
   
   
   and he would have the Smartupgrade.
