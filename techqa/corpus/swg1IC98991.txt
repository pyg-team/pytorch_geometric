APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Review changes" compare view opened from the WebGUI link
   (displayed only in case of non-persisted changes of the running
   configuration) does not allow to exclude generated and external
   data. Having an option to set this dynamically in this compare
   view would be helpful, e.g.  to exclude the external predefined
   patterns and deployment-policies delivered with the firmware
   which are visible in the default domain.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  From the WebGUI left navigation panel, use "Administration >
   Configuration > Compare Configuration", and enable the checkbox
   "Exclude generated and external data" as needed while comparing
   the persisted against the running configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower WebGUI customers who select on Review Changes link
   might see many changes due to external configuration changes
   being included.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.5 and 6.0.1.0.
