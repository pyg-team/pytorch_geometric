ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  18 features were incorrectly constructed in RAD 601x.  Feature p
   atches were created for feature patches, which is not correct.
   Feature patches should be patching a feature (not a previous fea
   ture patch). Wrong plugin versions are being loaded as a result
   (not using the latest version) after a customer uses Update Mana
   ger to install/update anything.
   WID has had several customer issues which have turned out to hav
   e this same underlying cause.  RAD would be experiencing the pro
   blem as well, though the symptoms are not always obvious.  For W
   ID, we depend on the higher levels of these plugins, so our cust
   omers see that our BI perspective will not load after using upda
   te manager to install a 3rd party plugin (or WebSphere Modeler,
   which uses Update Manager to install).   For other products, it
   might be less obvious - e.g., the latest ifixes are not working
   after using UM.  So basically, any customer who has ever run Upd
   ate Manager is using a different set of plugins than the rest of
    the customer base.  Support obviously will have trouble reprodu
   cing their defects and it will also result in opening of PMRs th
   at might have already been fixed in a fixpack.
