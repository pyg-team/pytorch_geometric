PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to connect to DB2® Universal Database (UDB) 8.1 or 8.2 on an AIX 64 bit server you see the message, "IWAS0126E Problems encountered while trying to establish connection Con2. Reason: 'unknown.'"
This technote provides a workaround for connecting from IBM® Rational® Software Architect (RSA) to IBM DB2 64-bit installation on an AIX 64-bit server. 

CAUSE
The error occurs if the remote DB2 system is a 64-bit version on an AIX machine. This is currently a defect in RSA and is being tracked as APAR JR20181.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these workaround steps. 

 1. Open the Data Perspective (Windows > Open Perspective > Data) 
 2. In the Database Explorer, right-click and select New Connection... 
 3. From the New connection dialog box in the Select a database manager: section, expand DB2 UDB and select v8.2 or v8.1 
 4. Enter the Connection URL details and click Test Connection  1. Select the Other for the JDBC Driver instead of DB2 Universal Driver 
     2. Enter the Database 
     3. Enter the Host 
     4. Enter the port number; by default DB2 V8.2 uses 5000 
     5. The JDBC driver class should be specified according to the desired driver version; the latest DB2 drivers should be used. 
     6. Enter the class location 
     7. You do not need to enter anything in the Connection URL because this gets prepopulated with information from the database, host, and port 
     8. Enter your user ID and password
    
    
 5. Click Finish
