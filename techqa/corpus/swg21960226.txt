Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects WebSphere Dashboard Framework (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects WebSphere Dashboard Framework. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Dashboard Framework 7.0.1.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Obtain the JRE appropriate for your product from Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]. Note however that these updated JREs are only appropriate for customers that have installed the copy of Eclipse, WASCE, or Liberty bundled with WebSphere Dashboard Framework.
LO85389 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FWebSphere+Dashboard+Framework&fixids=LO85389_WDF701&source=SAR] - WebSphere Dashboard Framework 7.0.1 on Windows.
LO85392 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FWebSphere+Dashboard+Framework&fixids=LO85392_WDF701&source=SAR] - WebSphere Dashboard Framework 7.0.1 on Linux

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

For WebSphere Dashboard Framework versions earlier than 7.0.1, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
