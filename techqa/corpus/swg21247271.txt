Title: IBM How to use the DB2 Recovery Expert path browser dialog - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The DB2Â® Recovery Expert GUI provides you with the ability to select a file or file path. This is performed using a general purpose standard Java Path Browser. For non-Windows platforms, the Path Browser is presented differently, depending upon which version of Java is being used. The Path Browser presented from Java 1.3.1 can be confusing. This document provides insight for using both the Java 1.3 and Java 1.4 Path Browsers 

ANSWER
DB2 Recovery Expert uses general purpose standard Java Path Browser dialogs that allow you to select file and folder (directory) locations. The dialog title text and component format is not specialized for each case, so you must be aware of the context to know why the dialog is displayed and what kind of object to select. 

Some cases where the Java Path Browser dialog is displayed include: 

 * From the GUI application main panel, after clicking the Add button next to the "Log file directories or tapes" box. 
 * From the Log Analysis Log File Options panel, after choosing the Add button next to the "Additional log file directories" box. 
 * From the Recovery Options panel, during a table or table space recovery, after selecting the Add button next to the Backup location box. 
 * From the Recovery Options panel, during a table recovery, after choosing the "..." button next to the option "Run backup to get out of backup pending", and then choosing the Add button next to the "Media type and location" box. 
 * From the Recovery Options panel, during a dropped database recovery, after choosing the Add button next to the box for "Backup location and file name". 
 * From the "Recovery Options" panel, after choosing the "..." button next to the "Redirect table space containers" option to allow providing new container definitions. 



In most cases, DB2 Recovery Expert uses the dialog to obtain a folder location. However, for a dropped database recovery, the backup image file name must be selected. When defining table space containers, the pathname can identify a folder (for SMS table spaces) or a file (for DMS table spaces). A selected folder pathname must already exist. Folders selected for SMS table space containers must be empty prior to a recovery, or else DB2 RESTORE will fail with an error message. When specifying a DMS container pathname, the containing folder must exist, but the DMS container files do not need to exist; they will be creating during the recovery. 

JAVA 1.4.2 
The Java 1.4 Path Browser dialog is straightforward and shows these components: 

- A folder selection box at the top . 
- A window containing subfolders and, if appropriate, file names . 
- A text box with the prompt "File Name:" 
- A "Filter" box that is pre-set to "All Files" (this cannot be changed). 
- Selectable buttons for OK and Cancel.

You must select a folder or file as appropriate to the context. You can navigate to a different folder location and create new folders if needed by using the available dialog components. A file name in the current folder can be typed into the text box. 

JAVA 1.3.1 
The Java 1.3.1 Path Browser dialog on non-Windows platforms is more complicated. It shows these components: 

- A text box with the prompt "Enter path or folder name:" at the top, with the current folder pathname filled in. 
- A Filter option that is pre-set to match all files and cannot be changed by the user. 
- A Folders list of subfolders (subdirectories). 
- A Files box that is always displayed, but which will be empty when the dialog is called to select a folder. 
- An "Enter file name:" text box (initially empty, but may be filled in automatically by the dialog when an object is selected). 
- Selectable buttons for OK, Update, Cancel, and Help.

The easiest way to use this dialog is by using only the mouse or keystrokes to navigate and selecting the desired folder or file. The folder or file can be selected by using the mouse to single-click the name. Click OK to exit the dialog. 

You can also perform the following tasks: 

- Type a folder name in the "Enter path or folder name" text box at the top of the dialog, then click the Update button to change to that folder and display its contents in the Folders and Files boxes. You must click Update after typing text in the box to cause the new folder name to take effect. 
- Use the mouse to double-click entries in the Folders box to navigate to different folders. 
- Type the simple name of a folder or file in the "Enter file name" text box at the bottom of the dialog. The file or folder must be located in the current folder name that is displayed in the "Enter path or folder name" text box. If you typed a folder pathname in the "Enter path or folder name" text box at the top of the dialog, you must click the Update button before typing a folder or file name in the lower "Enter file name:" text box. 
- Type a full folder or file pathname in the "Enter file name" text box at the bottom, then click OK to select that specific folder and exit the dialog. In this case, a name can be entered without navigating to that directory via the mouse or the Update button. 
- Select a folder or file displayed in the list boxes by using the mouse or keystrokes and click OK to exit the dialog. 

If the dialog is displayed for choosing a folder, only the Folders box will contain entries. The Files box will be empty and will not be updated even if the current folder contains files, since files 
cannot be chosen in this context. 

To exit the dialog using the OK button, the selected target folder name must exist and must match the required type (folder or file). If the dialog won't allow exiting using the OK button, verify that the 
target folder pathname exists and is correct. If necessary, click Cance l and then re-enter the dialog and try again. Using the mouse to select an entry in the Folders or Files box ensures that you are selecting a file or folder entry that already exists. 

In some cases, if the folder is located immediately under the root directory, the selected folder name may be displayed with two leading slash characters (for example, "//db2logs") . This anomaly can be ignored and should not cause any problems. 

If the behavior of the Java 1.3.1 Path Browser dialog is confusing or causes problems, a supported version of 1.4.2 or later Java Runtime Environment (JRE) can be installed, and DB2 Recovery Expert can be reinstalled to make use of the newer JRE.
