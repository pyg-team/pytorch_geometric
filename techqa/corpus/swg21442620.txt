QUESTION
 What methods are there for changing font size in IBM Rational ClearQuest clients? 

ANSWER
 

 1. Use ClearQuest Web 7.1: This permits web browser based font size adjustments for accessibility. Use your browser to adjust larger or smaller the font sizes.
    
    
 2. ClearQuest client for Windows only: Change the font and font properties for all forms in a schema.  1. Start the Classic Designer (cqdesign.exe). 
     2. In the Workspace, right-click the form. Click Fonts. 
     3. In the Font window, select the font and font properties. 
     4. Be sure to pick a compatible font for all clients that will be used. 
     5. Close the form and then reopen it to see the new font.
        
        
    
    
 3. ClearQuest client for Windows only: Change the font size for all records on a single client workstation for a single Windows user profile.  1. Open a record. 
     2. Right-click the form itself. 
     3. Choose Fonts. 
     4. Change the font to meet your requirements, as long as it fits into the drawn field boxes from your schema.
        
        
    
    
 4. ClearQuest client for Windows only: Change the font size only for the result set. Use these keyboard shortcuts:  * CTRL-Z to increase size. 
     * CTRL-SHIFT-Z to decrease size.
       
       
    
    
 5. ClearQuest client for Eclipse only: It might be possible to change certain aspects of font size in the ClearQuest client.  1. Access the menu option Windows > Preferences. 
     2. Expand the Preferences screens General > Appearance. 
     3. Adjust the Colors and fonts options as needed, though support is limited.
        
        
    
    
 6. ClearQuest client for Eclipse only: To change font and size of form.  1. View a record. 
     2. Right-click on the white or grey space of the form (not on a form control item).
