QUESTION
 What are check points and diagnostic information should be gathered for Data Studio Debug Session Manager issues ? 

ANSWER
1. Check Preferences window under "Run/Debug -> Routine Debugger -> IBM" and make sure the Routine Debug Session Manager Location is set correctly and known by the user. 

2. Ensure that the Session Manager is running when running Routine Debugger. 

3. Ensure to verify the specified port for Routine Debugger is in listening state from where Session Manager is running. 

4. From Data Source Explorer, try to run SYSPROC.DBG_PINGSESSIONMANAGER stored procedure, and verify the parameters tab for XMLREPLY column. If the column contains no values, it means the ping to the host IP where Session Manager is running failed. 

If the problem still persists with Debugger tool in Data Studio, please contact IBM Support for assistance.
