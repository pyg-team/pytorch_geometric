Title: IBM Updating earlier versions of IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) to support Transport Layer Security (TLS) V1.2 protocol - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you are using a version of IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) earlier than V8.5.6.0, you will need to update and reconfigure your IBM BPM factory settings to allow communication using the TLS V1.2 protocol. 

CAUSE
The factory configuration settings in versions of IBM BPM prior to V8.5.6.0 only allow TLS V1.0 and V1.1. Products that require TLS V1.2 cannot communicate with IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 by default.
Note: The earlier versions of TLS (V1.0 and V1.1) currently work when using IBM Blueworks Live, however, effective 07/01/2017, TLS V1.2 will be required.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To update the default configurations to support TLS V1.2, run the attached setSSLProtocol.py script as follows: 


1. Stop the servers of your BPM environment.

2. Run the script using this command:
On Windows
wsadmin -conntype none -profileName <profileName> -f sslProtocol.py 
On UNIX/Linux
wsadmin.sh -conntype none -profileName <profileName> -f sslProtocol.py 
where <profileName> is either the stand-alone profile for BPM Express, or the deployment manager profile for BPM Standard and BPM Advanced.

3. Restart the servers of your BPM environment
