ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After migration from CICS TS 42, without the support of the
   Enhanced Password Algorithm (RACF APAR OA43999 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1OA43999]) to CICS TS V52,
   the passticket decoding is not working properly and result in
   the message:
   DFHXS1201 THE PASSWORD SUPPLIED IN THE VERIFICATION REQUEST FOR
   USERID aaaaaa WAS INVALID. THIS OCCURRED IN TRANSACTION tttt
   WHEN USERID user WAS SIGNED ON AT NETNAME nnnn
   .
   Customer is using GROUPID as part of the passticket decoding and
   the VERIFYX call introduced by the support of the Enhanced
   Password Algorithm is not containing the GROUPID.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: EXEC CICS SIGNON may fail when using    *
   *                      passtickets.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: .                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   When an application creates a passticket using userid, applid
   and groupid an EXEC CICS SIGNON USERID(u) PASSWORD(passticket)
   GROUPID(g) is issued. CICS verifies the password without passing
   the GROUPID parameter to the ESM and so the validate of the
   passticket fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHXSSB, DFHXSPW and DFHUSAD have been changed to allow
   passtickets to be verified using groupid.
