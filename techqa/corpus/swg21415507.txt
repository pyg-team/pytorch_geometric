Title: IBM On the Controller server C:\Windows\Temp is filling up with files - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer noticing that the 'TEMP' folder (on the Controller application server) is filling up with random files.

Specifically, when the users perform data imports (via "Transfer - External Data - Import", such as importing a flat file via an import specification) the Controller system is creating some temporary files. 

Unfortunately these files are not being deleted (cleaned up) after the import has completed. 

SYMPTOM
On the Controller application server, inside the Windows temp folder (C:\Windows\temp) there are many files with the following extensions: 

 *  .trz .tr1 .iml .lg1 .lg2 .lg3 .lg4 rad*****.tmp 


CAUSE
Defect (reference APAR PM55971) in Controller.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open the folder C:\Windows\TEMP on the Controller application server.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Upgrade to Controller 10.1.1 (10.1.1305) or later. 

 

Workaround: 

Create a script to delete existing temporary files, and run it (via Windows Task Scheduler) to run periodically. 

 * TIP: Contact IBM Support for more details.
