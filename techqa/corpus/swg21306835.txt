Title: IBM Do we need to have passwords that match the usernames - United States

Text:
SRM TSRM ITSRM TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 SRM Installation Guide page 98 says the default password for the maxadmin (or with MS Active Directory maxadminusr), maxreg & mxintadm acounts must be the same as the username itself. Do I need to have the password to be the same as the username? 

ANSWER
When you create these accounts manually you need to set these passwords to the same value as the account username. That is the password for account "maxadmin" must be "maxadmin". Note that our installer expects the password set this way and will cause problems if it is not.
