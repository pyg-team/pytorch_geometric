 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of a Tivoli Integrated Portal fix pack fails due to issues with the Windows TIP service. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The IA log may have the following errors:
Tool information is being logged in file
E:\IBM\tivoli\tipv2\profiles\TIPProfile\logs\server1\startServer.log 
ADMU7701I: Because server1 is registered to run as a Windows Service, 
the request to start this server will be completed by starting the associated Windows Service. 

ADMU7704E: Failed while trying to start the Windows Service associated with server: server1; probable error executing WASService.exe: Starting Service: V2.1_TIPProfile_Port_16310
Failed to start service: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or 
because it has no enabled devices associated with it.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Try to stop and start TIP/Webgui from Windows Service Manager Panel. 

2. If above fails then disable the service from the Windows Service Manager Panel and then try to stop and start TIP from command line as follows. 
cd <TIPHOME>/bin
(example; cd C:\IBM\tivoli\tipv2\profiles\TIPProfile\bin)
stopServer.bat server1 -username <tipadmin> -password <password> 

startServer.bat server1 

Note: Change the user Id and password based on your environment. 

3. If you can stop and start the server from the command line, then leave the Windows service disabled and try the installation again. 

If it fails again then please open a PMR with IBM support and provide logs as described in the following technote:
