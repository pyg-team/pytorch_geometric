Title: IBM Application deployment for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) fails because a composition unit with the same application name already exists - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing an application, the process fails with an error: "A composition unit with name <Application_Name> already exists. Select a different application name." 

SYMPTOM
The installation of an SCA application fails even though the application does not exist as an installed application on the server. The following error messages are returned: 

A composition unit with name <Application_Name>already exists. Select a different application name.
ADMA5011I: The cleanup of the temp directory for application <Application_Name>is complete.
ADMA5014E: The installation of application <Application_Name>failed.


CAUSE
Residue application artifacts remain in the profile from previous uninstall processes of the application.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Log into the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console and make sure that the application does not already exist in the following locations:  * Click Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications 
     * Click Applications > Application Types > Business-level applications 
     * Click Applications > SCA Modules
       
       If you are not able to uninstall the SCA module, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 3.
       
       
    
    
 2. Before attempting to apply this step, thoroughly investigate why the previous uninstallation failed. Check the server log files for failed uninstallation clues. If an SCA module contains BPC processes, follow the procedure in the topic below to clean up BPC process artifacts, if needed:

To manually clean up the SCA module, complete the following steps:  *  Go to profile_root/config/cells/cell_name directory and look for the cell-core.xml file. Make a backup copy of that file in case you need to restore it if anything goes wrong during the process.
   
   The profile_root variable is the deployment manager profile root in a network deployment environment.
   
   Open the file and remove the SCA Module entry for the particular module you were not able to install due to a name conflict.
   
   Restart your server again. In a network deployment environment, do a full synchronization of the nodes.
   
   Check the SCA Module in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console again to make sure that you do not see the SCA module anymore.
   
   

3. If the application is not shown as installed, look for any residue artifacts in the following locations:  *  profile_root/config/cells/cell_name/applications/application_name profile_root/config/cells/cell_name/blas/application_name profile_root/config/cells/cell_name/cus/application_name
   
   
   The profile_root variable is the deployment manager profile root in a network deployment environment.
   
   

4. Delete everything from the profile_root/wstemp directory.
