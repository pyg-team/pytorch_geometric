PROBLEM
Gathering this information before calling IBM support will reduce the time that it takes to understand and resolve your problem.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Mobile Device data collection:
There is an email address where you can send the device logs to Connections Mobile support:
heyibm@us.ibm.com

Manual Server data collection:
Collecting the following data before contacting support will help expedite problem determination and resolution of the problem: 

1. Provide a precise description of the issue, screen shots, error messages, and steps to reproduce. 

2. Please provide Connection environment details:
* IBM Connections version and fix level.
* LDAP type, version, fix level.
* Amount of RAM on each of the server nodes.
* Is this a pilot or production installation?
* Is this a new installation or an upgrade from an earlier version?
* How many nodes in the cluster and are components installed to a single or multiple JVMs?
* Is the problem reproducible on all nodes?
* What browser types and versions are in use?
* Is there a SSO solution in front of IBM Connections (Siteminder, TAM, SPNEGO)?
* Please outline any customization that you may have.
* What changes occurred in the environment prior to the issue.

3. Tracing can be very verbose. If tracing is requested by support, follow these steps. 

a. Log in to the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) administration console using an administrator ID.

b. Go to Troubleshooting → Logs and Trace → Logging and Tracing → Server 1 (or server Mobile is installed on) → Diagnostic Trace Server → Change Log Detail Levels → please add the following *string and click Apply → OK

Component Trace: com.ibm.lotus.connections.mobile.*=all

c. Restart the WAS server after moving existing logs to another directory (or deleting).

d. Reproduce the problem.

*Note: If the issue can be reproduced on a single node, shut down all other nodes prior to reproducing the problem.

e. Provide support a compressed copy of the logs directory %WAS_HOME%/profiles/AppSrv01/logs (trace.log, Systemout.log, Systemerr.log and FFDC logs) from the node, along with LotusConnections-config.xml located in directory %WAS_HOME%\profiles\(your profile)\config\cells\(your cell)\LotusConnections-config.
