QUESTION
 What are the requirements for upgrading Netcool Web GUI from 7.3.1 to 7.4 

ANSWER
Before upgrading Web GUI from 7.3.1 to 74 you need to determine the version of Tivoli Integrated Portal (TIP) deployed with Web GUI. It can be done by using listIU command of the Deployment Engine. The location of this command varies depending on platform and the installer as mentioned below:

 * 
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
   For root install :
   
 * 
 * 
 * Non-root install :
 * 
 * 


Run above command and then look for highest version of TIPCore and Webtop in the output to find the latest version of TIP and WebGUI. Following shows an example of output:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  
   

If TIPCore is 2.2.x then you can follow the instructions in the installation guide to upgrade to Web GUI to 7.4. You skip the following section.  

But if TIP is on 2.1.x version then before upgrading to Web GUI 7.4 you first need to install TIP feature pack to upgrade TIP from 2.1 version to 2.2. After installing the feature pack Web GUI can be upgraded to 7.4.
