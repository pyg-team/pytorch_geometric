PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 8       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The ability to disable TLS v1.0 needs   *
   *                      to be available.                        *
   ****************************************************************
   The ability to disable TLS v1.0 needs to be available as it may
   not comply with current security requirements.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ability to disable TLS v1.0 has been added through the use
   of the DD card 'TLS10OFF'. Additionally the DD card 'TLS10ON'
   has been added to explicitly enable TLS v1.0. TLS v1.0 remains
   on by default.

   The following is added to document the new messages that are
   produced:
   
   CSQX694I
   
       csect-name Cipher specifications based on the TLS v1.0
       protocol are disabled.
   Severity
       4
   Explanation
   
       Cipher specifications based on the TLS v1.0 protocol are not
       enabled, and channels configured to use those cipher
       specifications fail when started.
   System action
   
       Processing continues.
   System programmer response
   
       If you do not need to use cipher specifications based on the
       TLS v1.0 protocol, then you can disable them by adding a
       dummy Data Definition (DD) statement named 'TLS10OFF' to the
       channel initiator JCL. For example:
   
       //TLSV0OFF DD DUMMY
   
       There are alternative mechanisms that can be used to
       forcibly disable cipher specifications based on the TLS v1.0
       protocol,if the Data Definition change is unsuitable.
       Contact IBM Service for further information.
   
   CSQX695I
   
       csect-name Cipher specifications based on the TLS v1.0
       protocol are enabled.
   Severity
       4
   Explanation
   
       Cipher specifications based on the TLS v1.0 protocol are
       enabled, and channels can be configured to use those cipher
       specifications.
   System action
   
       Processing continues.
   System programmer response
   
       If you need to use cipher specifications based on the
       TLS v1.0 protocol, then no action is required.
   
       If you do not need to use cipher specifications based on the
       TLS v1.0 protocol, see message CSQX694I for information on
       how to disable TLS v1.0.
