APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Limit growth of the Data Collector file-i/o queue
   
   Memory usage is growing because it seems that the system is
   processing messages faster than the data collector can write
   them to disk.
   Traces may indicate several tens of thousands of messages queued
   up in memory, waiting to be written to the disk so kd4agent.exe
   can pick them up.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ITCAM for SOA Data Collector memory consumption is higher
   than expected under heavy transactions rate.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix to control and limit the staging processing queue for the
   data collector has been implemented in order to reduce the
   memory use of the Data Collector, and will be available on the
   next ITCAM for SOA 711 FixPack (ITCAM for SOA FP0001)
