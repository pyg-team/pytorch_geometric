ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAM ESSO v8.0-Sharedpiont is not seen MS PPT 2010
   
   
   
   Description:
   TAM ESSO AccessAgent is able to manage the initial login (a
   form-based
   login) since it is exposed from IE (ieexpolorer.exe).  Via the
   IE TAM
   ESSO BHO, the user gets an automated login to the GM Sharepoint
   applications since we have an AccessProfile created for the
   login
   screen being presented by IE.
   However, when the user accesses an office doc within Sharepoint,
   the MS
   office application gets launched as a result of opening the doc.
   At
   this point, another login screen is presented to the end user.
   While
   the login screen appears to be the same as the initial login
   screen (it
   is still a form-based login screen), this one is being presented
   by the
   MS office application.  The TAM ESSO AccessAgent does not
   provide an
   automated login.  However, the interaction between the MS Office
   application and the authentication service is still HTTP based
   authentication.
   
   Mohit recommended that they can do the following:
   
   There are going to be two profiles
   
   a) one for the normal web shared ppoint logon windows
   
   b) the one will be winword in this case. With an windows
   activate
   trigger and a "start installing bho....
   action.
        The overhead is minimal and much less than wht they would
   get by
   enabling sso for a typcial because we are doing is enabling web
   profiles
   to run inside winword.
   
   
   Results: It works for all the microsoft doc such as excel, doc,
   ppt  in
   2010 and 2007 version except ppt in 2010.
   
   I?ve ran into an issue with one of the Office apps and I?d like
   to get
   input from you and your team.  For Office 2007 I?ve been able to
   create
   profiles for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, InfoPath, and Access.
   I?ve been
   able to use a basic profile that just starts the BHO when it
   sees the
   login screen.  The existing profile for that login page is
   taking over
   from there.  The profiles for the office apps have been the same
   flow
   and signatures for each of the apps.
   
   When I started testing on Office 2010 four of the apps work fine
   (Word,
   Excel, InfoPath, and Access), PowerPoint is not working though.
   The
   profile recognizes the login window and is starting the BHO but
   SSO is
   not occurring.  If I use Access Studio to highlight the window
   it
   recognizes the signature as expected.  I tried to see if Studio
   could
   see the HTML fields in the window but it is not having any luck
   (it was
   actually crashing Studio 8.0).  I?ve tried testing with both AA
   8.0 and
   AA 8.1 with the same result.  I also tried making the signature
   more
   specific to make sure the embedded IE window was present before
   trying
   to load the BHO but ended up with the same result.  Have also
   tried
   using a Window Found trigger instead of Created or Activated.
   
   I?ve attached a copy of the profile for PowerPoint (modified
   with the
   more specific signature) and one for Word for comparison.  I?ve
   also
   attached AA logs for the behavior with PowerPoint and then with
   Word for
   comparison.
   
   Please let me know if you or your dev team have any thoughts on
   why the
   BHO doesn?t seem to be working in this case.
   
   U
   sers do not receive SSO when accessing Office documents via
   Sharepoint.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:see problem description
   
   Desired Behavior:see problem description
   
   
   Environment:TAM ESSO v8.1, Sharepoint web profile, MS office
   2010 or
   2007 , Powerpoint.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  23756
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When accessing a PowerPoint 2010 document through Sharedpoint
   and the PowerPoint file is opened in an embedded browser, single
   sign-on will not work as the signature is not recognized
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This limitation will not be addressed.
