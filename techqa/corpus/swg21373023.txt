Title: IBM Apply a Filter on Yesterday's Data - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Is it possible to apply a filter to retrieve only yesterdays data?


Solution #1:

Try the following filters, which use the 'add-days' and the 'today' functions:

add-days(today(),-1)

Add-day Function:

Syntax: add-days (date_exp, integer_exp) 
Returns the datetime resulting from adding integer_exp days to date_exp.

Today Function:

Syntax: today 
Returns the current date according to the clock of the computer Impromptu is running on.


Solution #2:

This is achieved within the filter expression.

First, determine the datatype of the date field that will be compared. This will matter, as the filter expression will differ.

Steps to determine the date type:
1. Open the report.
2. From the Report menu, click Query.
3. Click the Profile tab, and then select Query Columns.
4. Cross reference the type of the column.

For Date format, apply the following expression to the filter:
Date = 
Today() - 001 00:00 00 000
- the 001 00:00 00 000 value can be inserted by using the Value component Interval

For DateTime format:
DateTime > Today() - 002 00:00:00.000 and DateTime < Today()
or
DateTime between Today() - 002 00:00:00.000 and Today()

For both Date and DateTime formats:
Date = Add-Days(Today(),-1)
or
DateTime = Add-Days(Today(),-1)


Note:
The 00# 00:00 00 000 values can be inserted by using the Value component Interval.

The database defined function Now() may be used in place of the Today function.

Add-days Function:
Syntax: Add-days (date_exp, integer_exp) 
Returns the datetime resulting from adding integer_exp days to date_exp.

Today Function:
Syntax: today ()
Returns the current date according to the clock of the computer Impromptu is running on.

Now Function:
Syntax: now () 
Returns a datetime value representing the current date and time of the computer 
that the database software runs on.
