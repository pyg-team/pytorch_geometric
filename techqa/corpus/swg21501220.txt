QUESTION
 What are the known limitations of IBM FileNet Rendition Engine 5.0 and 5.1? 

CAUSE
FileNet Rendition Engine 5.0 and 5.1 are built on Liquent© Enterprise Services 3.1.4. This technote lists the known limitations of the Liquent Enterprise Services 3.1.4 software as described in their documentation.

TAB NAVIGATION
 * 5.0/5.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21501220]
 * 5.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21626280]



Before publishing source documents, consider the following limitations. 

General limitations


 * On a 32-bit Windows 2008 server, when Show/Hide Rendering is set to Hide, Microsoft Excel fails and closes when you attempt to open an Excel file. If you need to use Excel on the server, open Domain Manager and set Show/Hide Rendering to Show before opening the Excel file. This limitation does not affect the rendering of Excel documents. 
 * When generating rendered output, Rendition Engine works with the applications that are associated with the content types being rendered. By default, Rendition Engine uses these applications in non-interactive mode, which means that the applications and any windows are hidden from the user during the rendering process. However, when Rendition Engine is run on a 64-bit Windows 2008 server, an information-only printing window is displayed for Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Excel. For Microsoft Project, the application opens fully. 
 * To render documents accurately, Rendition Engine requires each authoring program to run cleanly, without problems, and without dialogs or prompts. After you install each authoring program, start the program to confirm that it runs properly without dialogs opening, including the registration dialogs. 
 * The most current version of the supported authoring applications must be installed in your Rendition Engine environment with respect to the versions of the documents that you are rendering. For example, to render Microsoft Word 2007 documents, having Microsoft Word 2003 installed on the servers is not sufficient. Microsoft Word 2007 installation is required for rendering to work properly. 
 * You cannot publish document files with built-in or native passwords to HTML or PDF format. Rendition Engine does not process password-protected documents, including sheets in a Microsoft Excel workbook. Publishing a document with a built-in password can cause Rendition Engine to become unstable. 
 * Rendition Engine cannot render a document that has links to other documents or graphic files. Links to other documents or files must be disabled. 
 * Rendition Engine does not resolve hyperlinks in Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, or Project documents. 
 * When using a reference as a field code in a Microsoft Word document, the reference is rendered by the Render business service as a hyperlink, and the link color matches what is defined for preserved internal table of content links in the Word content type. 
 * Documents with content of the Chinese government standard GB18030 are supported only in Microsoft® Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for rendering to PDF and HTML.


Limitations when publishing to PDF 

Rendition Engine generates the PDF rendition by opening the source document in the authoring application and printing it to the Liquent PDF Creator printer, configured with the PDF Converter printer driver. Because a PDF file can accommodate many more features of the document then a printed page, such as bookmarks, additional steps are done to support these features, but the process is complex and has many limitations.  * On a 32-bit Windows 2008 server, to successfully render symbol fonts in the bookmarks for Microsoft Word source documents, open Domain Manager and set Show/Hide Rendering to Show before rendering the Word documents to PDF. 
 * Rendition Engine can render documents for many different authoring programs to PDF or other formats, license permitting. The authoring programs for which you want to render source documents must be installed on each Rendition Engine server. Use the service account (FNRE_Admin) that you created when you installed the Rendition Engine to install the authoring programs according to the vendor instructions. 
 * Microsoft Word allows you to create bookmarks to hidden text. If you deactivate hidden text and then render a document, such bookmarks still appear in the rendered document. Consequently, because the hidden text (containing the targets for such bookmarks) is excluded, some or all of the bookmarks can reference the wrong pages. 
 * Rendition Engine does not render Microsoft Word source documents that contain the AutoOpen macro fields. Confirm that your Word source document does not include AutoOpen macro fields before attempting to publish to PDF. 
 * You can create a PDF file from a Microsoft Word document that contains secured or protected fields. However, there is no guarantee that any transformation options you have selected will work. Word documents that contain secured or protected fields can be successfully rendered to PDF, but features such as bookmarks and links might not work. 
 * Microsoft Project renditions might contain more pages than you expected from the original source document. The pages that are rendered depend on what was displayed in the Microsoft Project window when you last saved the document. To avoid additional pages, you must save the Microsoft Project source file with only the desired information displayed. 
 * When printing a Microsoft Excel file containing multiple sheets, you can print page numbers in the header or footer in sequential order across all the sheets in the workbook. However, the rendered output of the same workbook results in the page numbers starting over for each sheet. With Rendition Engine, you can render an entire workbook, but the pagination is not preserved in the PDF output.


Limitations when publishing to HTML 

Rendition Engine uses some of the authoring applications to save or generate the document as web page when rendering to HTML. Therefore, there are certain limitations due to the limitation from the authoring application.  * Rendition Engine uses the Microsoft Office application Save As Web Page option to render the source document to HTML, and is therefore limited to the capabilities provided by the application. The resulting HTML file might look best if viewed with Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
 * Microsoft PowerPoint Design Templates (.POT) and PowerPoint Show (.PPS) files cannot be rendered in HTML. 
 * You cannot publish to HTML if the document file contains built-in or native passwords. Trying to publish a document file with a built-in password can cause Rendition Engine to become unstable. 
 * When rendering Microsoft Excel documents to HTML format, sometimes a hidden error dialog is generated by the Excel plug-in, warning that the data conversion feature will not be saved in the HTML file. Rendition Engine does not properly handle this dialog and the rendition job fails.
