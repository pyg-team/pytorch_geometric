APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Load Balancer Administration Guide does not document that on
   a windows system the entire command may need to be enclosed in
   quotes when entering a dscontrol command in a DOS command prompt
   for adding a rule that requires special characters. Normally
   only the keywork would need to be enclosed in double quotes.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TITLE : Contect rule (pattern) syntax update
   PROBLEM : Appendix B of the Administration Guide
   refers to syntax to be used for special characters.
   This syntax does not always work for the windows
   operating system.
   CAUSE : Different syntax is needed depending on if the
   command is issued within the dscontrol shell (you've typed
   dscontrol<enter> and then the command or the command is
   issued from a configuration file) or if the command is
   entered the windows shell (dscontrol rule add ..).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  SOLUTION:
      1) This same syntax is applicable for any "rule
   add" command; whether using cbrcontrol or dscontrol.
      2) If the command is being entered from the dscontrol shell,
   cbrcontrol shell, or a configuration file, the special
   characters
   are encased in quotes as the Administration Guide documents.
   Example (from configuration file):
      cbrcontrol rule add 10.1.203.4:80:cbr_prod_rule_ek type
   content
      pattern "uri=/nipoek/*"
      3) If you are entering the same the same command from the
   windows
   problem, you must encase the entire command in quotes instead of
   just the special characters:
      cbrcontrol "rule add 10.1.203.4:80:cbr_prod_rule_ek type
   content
      pattern uri=/nipoek/*"
