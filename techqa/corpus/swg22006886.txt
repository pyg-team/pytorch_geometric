Title: IBM Index error in log with IBM Datacap Maintenance Manager - United States

Text:
NENU index zero argument deleting TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When deleting batches using Datacap Maintenance Manager (formerly NENU), the batch appears to be properly deleted, but an error is posted to the log stating:

Error deleting batch:'C:\Datacap\APT\Batches\20170802.000000'

Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list. 

CAUSE
The batch folder had previously been deleted, but the database entry remained. This can occur if Datacap is not used to delete the batch.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Datacap Maintenance Manager is working correctly. No action is needed.
