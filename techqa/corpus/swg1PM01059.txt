APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Workstations defined as WAIT do not honour the time
   interval specified in the operation definition, if the system is
   configured with non zero leap seconds.

   ****************************************************************
   An operation running on a wait workstation is waiting for a
   time different from the duration time defined. This new wait
   time depends on the value of CVTLSO value (Leap Second Offset)
   contained in system vector table (CVT).
   Local time is obtained by acquiring the TOD clock value and
   making adjustments for both leap second offsets and local time
   offsets (timezone and daylight saving time).
   UTC (GMT) is obtained by acquiring the TOD clock value and
   making an adjustment for the leap second offset.
   Then if we get the value for the local time offsets (CVTLDTO)
   the rules will be:
   UtcTime = TODTime - CVTLSO
   LocalTime = TODTime + CVTLDTO - CVTLSO
   On the wait workstation the Leap Seconds Offset wasn't
   considered.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now the interval time for a wait workstation is taking in
   consideration the leap seconds too.
