   ****************************************************************
   An earlier change introduced LOBTYPE, a synonym for column
   TYPE, which is used in some utilities processing.  LOBTYPE is
   used because there are conflicting uses of a variable named
   TYPE.  However, not all callers of panel ADB21S have provided
   LOBTYPE, which results in errors.
