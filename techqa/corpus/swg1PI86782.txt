APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It has been observed that applying IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0-Fix
   Pack 2 to a Statistics Client 32-bit installation will corrupt
   the string values of a data set when exporting to a *.mdb (MS
   Access 2000) file format.
   
   Instead of values such as 'FAMBA_R' or 'AA00705', being present,
   Statistics 24.0-FP2 will produce values containing double-byte
   Japanese, Chinese characters as well as various garbage
   characters.
   
   Exporting the exact same data using Statistics 24.0-GA or
   24.0-FP1 will not reproduce this issue as it seems 24.0-FP2
   introduced this defect.
   
   
   The expected behaviour is that exporting should retain the
   string values without corrupting the exported data source.
   
   
   To reproduce:
   Install Statistics 24.0-GA or 24.0-FP1 as a 32-bit application;
   Install MS Access runtime or MS Office as a 32-bit application;
   Open a test .sav file in Statistics Client;
   Export the data and observe the correct results;
   Install Statistics 24.0-FP2 and execute the same test. You will
   observe the corrupted string characters when opening the .mdb
   file in MS Access;
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a temporary measure, please revert back to IBM SPSS
   Statistics 24.0-GA or 24.0-FP1 where the behaviour is not
   observed.
