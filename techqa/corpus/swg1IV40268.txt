APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a multi-instance WebSphere MQ 7.x queue manager configuration
   multiple entries are specified for the CONNAME for the SENDER
   channel. If The channels are SSL/TLS encrypted with SSLPEER set,
   the following  error is recorded in the MQ error logs when a
   failover is forced by  stopping the receiver channel for the
   'active' queue manager.
   'AMQ9636: SSL distinguished name does not match peer name,
   channel aaaaa.to.bbbb'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users that are using multi-instance queue managers and has
   multiple entries in the CONNAME for a sender channel that is
   SSL/TLS encrypted with a SSLPEER name set.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When the first connection in the CONNAME list was used, the
   SSLPEER name was expanded with the values of that channel. When
   that connection failed then the next channel in the CONNAME list
   was used. The SSLPEER name was not reset to the configured value
   so SSLPEER name from the first channel was checked against the
   second channel which resulted in the AMQ9636 error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been fixed to reset the SSLPEER name to the
   configured value when a different channel in the CONNAME list is
   used.
