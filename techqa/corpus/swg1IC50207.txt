APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  By using the supportUtil, provided with the Admin Center
   package, the timeout value for Integrated Solutions
   Console/Admin Center sessions can be changed, however, if the
   desired value is greater than 120 minutes, the ISC session will
   still time out after 120 minutes.
   .
   The reason for this is that the supportUtil only updates one of
   the two parameters that needs to be changed in order for the
   value to be honored.
   .
   See Local Fix for the workaround until the supportUtil has been
   corrected.
   .
   Initial Impact: Low
   ISC Versions Affected: ISC 6.0.1
   Additional Keywords: AC Admin Center Administration time-out
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Stop the ISC service and then manually enter the desired values
   by editing the following files:
   .
   1.
   <ISC_HOME>\AppServer\profiles\default\config\cells\DefaultNode\
      security.xml :
   .
   Change the parameter: timeout="120" to the desired value, in
   minutes, where the maximum value is 2147483647
   .
   2.
   <ISC_HOME>\AppServer\profiles\default\config\cells\DefaultNode\
      nodes\DefaultNode\servers\ISC_Portal\server.xml :
   .
   Change the parameter: invalidationTimeout="30" to the desired
   value, in minutes, where the maximum value is -1 (do not time
   out).
   .
   Restart the ISC service.
