APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Server names in historical samples use "server name" parameter
   value defined in ITM situations.
   The sudden appearance of the unexpected server names during the
   real time data collection has been verified by providing a
   debug version of "kwjwb.jar".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Temporary remove the "Server Name" column from the situatiion
   definition, until a fix is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   ITCAM KYN environments with ITM situations that
   have server name in filter argument.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   When the server name is specified in the situation filter, the
   name is being applied to that attribute group for the data
   collected from all other servers.  For example, if a situation
   is created by selecting "Server Name = MyServer1" for J2C
   Connection Pool attribute group, the data collected for this
   group from all other servers will have MyServer1 as the value in
   the Server Name.
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   releases:
   
     | Interim Fix | 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS-IF0006
     | Interim Fix | 7.1.0.3-TIV-ITCAMAD-IF0009
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The server name is not required in the situation.  Instead, the
   distribution should be used to assign it to the proper
   server(s).
