QUESTION
How does IBM support gather general Information to troubleshot IBM Packaging Utility issue? 

CAUSE
When working on problems with Packaging Utility, it is essential for IBM support to have Packaging Utility’s ciclogs and pluginState folder. Packaging Utility stores its plug-ins settings in pluginState and its runtime’s log in ciclogs. The data from these folders provides more information than a simple Packaging Utility’s error message. IBM Support can use the data to diagnose the problems and learn the history of Packaging Utility usage.

ANSWER
To obtain the ciclogs and pluginState folder, use the following instructions.

Linux & UNIX

Zip up “/tmp/ciclogs_[username]” and “[user home dir]/.ibm/pu/pluginState”



Windows 2000, 2003, and XP

Zip up “c:\Document and Settings\[username]\Local Settings\Temp\ciclogs_[username]” and “c:\Document and Settings\[username]\.ibm\pu\pluginState”



Windows Vista

Zip up “C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp\ciclogs_[username]” and
“C:\Users\[username]\.ibm\pu”
