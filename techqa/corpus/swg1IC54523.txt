APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS CHANGE TO ACCOMODATE OEM VENDOR'S CODE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The serviceDeploy mechanism, which is used to build an
   application .ear file from a .jar or .zip file, will not allow
   a configuration where a Mediation Module contains an Export
   which is directly connected to a Java Component, where the
   target runtime server is WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus.
   
   Any attempt to build such a configuration fails, as is shown
   in the following console output:
   
   $/opt/ibm/WebSphere/ESB602/bin/serviceDeploy.sh myModule.zip

   An error message was reported during deployment:
   
   Severity:       [error]
   Description:    Module "myModule" contains an export "Export1"
   that is connected to a java component, which is unsupported.
   An export can only be connected to a Mediation Flow component.
   Connect a mediation flow component to a Java component, or use
   a custom mediation primitive in a mediation flow component.
   Resource:       Export1.export

   Due to errors, /home/username/tmp/myModuleApp.ear was not
   created. Run with -ignoreErrors to override.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 who are using serviceDeploy to build         *
   *                 applications which contain Mediation         *
   *                 Modules where Exports are connected          *
   *                 directly to Java components.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In the early releases of WebSphere      *
   *                      Enterprise Service Bus, the design      *
   *                      decision was taken to not allow         *
   *                      this application configuration.         *
   *                      Instead, it was a requirement that      *
   *                      when the target runtime was set to      *
   *                      be WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus,    *
   *                      the export should be connected to a     *
   *                      Mediation Flow Component.               *
   *                                                              *
   *                      This decision has since been            *
   *                      revisited, with the outcome that the    *
   *                      product will now permit this            *
   *                      configuration.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you encounter this issue when using       *
   *                 WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus v6.0, it    *
   *                 is recommended that you install the fix      *
   *                 pack which contains the code change          *
   *                 associated with this APAR.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   This restriction on connecting Exports to Java components was
   only implemented on WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus v6.0.
   V6.1 of the product does not have this restriction.
   
   Note that there was no issue when connecting an Export to a
   Java component within a Mediation Module, provided the message
   flow passed through a Mediation Flow Component inbetween, such
   as in the following configuration:
   
     Export  -->   Mediation Flow Component  --> Java Component
   
   This has always been a supported configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code change associated with this APAR removed this
   restriction.  With the code fix applied, the serviceDeploy
   command will not throw an error due to Mediation Modules
   having a configuration where an Export is directly connected
   to a Java component.
   
   This code fix was targetted to be included with v6.0.2 Fix
   Pack 4 (v6.0.2.4).
