ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the ICC Interactive archiving feature, Outlook emails are
   being archived into P8 and declared records into IER. During
   some testing, we discovered if the same email is sent to
   multiple people and each declares the email to a different
   record category, only the first email archived is declared a
   record. We are attempting to alleviate this records
   shortcoming. Our goal is that one email sent to multiple people
   should be declared to each record category chosen by the users.
   When I opened a previous PMR on this issue (PMR 19801,756,000
   with Tyler Sky), it was recommended we use the ICC Script
   Connector feature and write code that modified the Hash so each
   email would be considered unique and not deduped. If each email
   was considered unique, it would be possible to declare the same
   email to different record categories. 2015-06-01T16:49:03Z
