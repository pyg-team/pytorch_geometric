APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This issue has been reported in IBM SPSS Collaboration and
   Deployment Services 5.0 GA, but still occurs after applying C&DS
   5.0 FixPack 1 and FixPack 2.
   
   In a trusted multiple domain environment where IBM SPSS Client
   applications (such as SPSS Modeler Desktop and SPSS Deployment
   Manager) are installed on one domain (USERDomain) and IBM SPSS
   Server applications (such as SPSS Modeler Server and SPSS
   Collaboration and Deployment Services [C&DS] Server) are on
   another domain (APPDomain), connecting to C&DS server from
   Deployment Manager client using SSO authentication fails.
   
   This should not occur and C&DS client should successfully
   connect to C&DS Server with SSO.
   
   Our domain environment setup has been configured as a 1-way
   External Trust Relationship and we have verified C&DS server SSO
   setup in one domain (APPDomain) works fine.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue has been reported to the IBM SPSS Collaboration and
   Deployment Services development team and will be addressed in
   the next Fix Pack. Please refer to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   
   Within the IBM SPSS C&DS code, we set two system property for
   realm and KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Centre). If you need
   cross-realm authentication, you need to also specify a krb5.conf
   file and specify the cross realm information there. But IBM JDK
   does not read the krb5.conf file if KDC and realm property was
   set. This is a bug within the IBM JDK. If this bug did not
   exist, customers would have been able to add the system property
   to the Modeler jvm.cfg file and cross realm authentication would
   be working for Java client without any code change. This will
   require a code change within the IBM SPSS C&DS application to
   temporarily resolve this issue. The ultimate fix would be made
   on the IBM Java to successfully read the krb5.conf' file.
