APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the kd4agent has stopped or is running behind, the Data Power
   Data Collector may continue writing to a single log file
   indefinitely. This can create very large metric log files. The
   Data Power Data Collector should limit the size of a metric log
   file and write a new file if grows beyond a configurable size.
