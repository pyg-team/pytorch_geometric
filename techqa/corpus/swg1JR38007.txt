APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This problem can only occur when "Generate truncate statement at
   runtime" is "Yes" and when the generated "ALTER TABLE TableName
   ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY WITH EMPTY TABLE" statement fails
   such as when the user does not have privileges for that
   statement.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the
   "Generate truncate statement at runtime" property to "No" and in
   the "Truncate statement" property specify the "DELETE FROM
   ANLYSIS.ANL_REL_AVAIL_PERF" statement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   DB2 Connector generated truncate statement fails on Unix
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   On Unix, when the DB2 Connector's "Generate truncate statement
   at runtime" property is "Yes" and when the generated "ALTER
   TABLE TableName ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY WITH EMPTY TABLE"
   statement fails such as when the user does not have privileges
   for that statement, the connector then generates a "DELETE
   FROM TableName" statement that fails with the following errors:
   
   DB2 reported: SQLSTATE = 42601: Native Error Code = -104: Msg =
   [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/AIX64] SQL0104N  An unexpected token
   "END-OF-STATEMENT" was found following "???".  Expected
   tokens may include:  "JOIN <joined_table>".  SQLSTATE=42601
   An error occurred when truncating the table. Statement =
   ?????????
   
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   Install the patch for JR38007 which has a prerequisite that the
   patch for JR36020 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR36020] is already installed.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DB2 Connector now generates the delete statement correctly.
