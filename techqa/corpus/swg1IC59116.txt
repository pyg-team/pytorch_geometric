APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the default SOAP envelope can result in an AxisFault if
   the body is not in UTF-8.  A Java exception will be thrown
   giving the AxisFault, indicating that the Character Set Encoding
   from the transport information does not match with the character
   set encoding in the received SOAP message [utf-8].

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker V6.1   *
   *                 using SOAP Request Nodes.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The SOAP Request Node creates default   *
   *                      headers in charset UTF-8. If the body   *
   *                      has a different charset then an error   *
   *                      can occur while processing the reply.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When an outgoing message is not already in the SOAP domain,
   then the SOAP Request node creates a default SOAP envelope
   using charset of UTF-8.
   
   If the message body is in a different charset the resulting
   mismatch can result in a BIP3701E error when the reply is
   processed.
   
   In this example the body is in charset iso-8859-1.
   
   A Java exception was thrown whilst calling the Java JNI method
   ''Axis2Requester_processResponseMessageSync''. The Java
   exception was ''org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Character Set
   Encoding from transport information [iso-8859-1] does not
   match with character set encoding in the received SOAP message
   [utf-8]''.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the default
   SOAP envelope is created using the same charset as the message
   body.
