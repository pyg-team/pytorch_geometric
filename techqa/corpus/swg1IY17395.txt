PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Due to the change in the behavior of next key locking, after
   issuing ALTER TABLE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY, the next key lock
   holds tables around the table being altered.
   .
   For example,
   create table t1 (x int)
   create table t2 (x int) not logged initially
   create table t3 (x int)
   update command options using c off
   alter table t2 activate not logged initially
   .
   Then t1 and t3 are locked out. You cannot drop t1 and t3 until
   after a commit.
