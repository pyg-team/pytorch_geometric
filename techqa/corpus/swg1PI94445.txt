APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a fetchable module linked RENT is called repeatedly (ie. more
   that 32767 times) via an alias, the use count for the alias is
   exceeded, though the base module's count remains at 1.
   
   The somewhat misleading message
   
       IBM0590S ONCODE=9250 The fetchable procedure with entry
           {alias} could not be found.
   
   will be generated as a result of the failure; the CSV002I
   message can be seen in the joblog.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid using aliases for fetchable modules.

   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The Enterprise PL/I for z/OS run-time library was not keeping
   track of reentrant routines with alias names correctly. This
   led to the unnecessary reloading of the routine, which would
   eventually lead to the use count being exceeded.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Enterprise PL/I for z/OS run-time library has been modified
   to correct the problem.
