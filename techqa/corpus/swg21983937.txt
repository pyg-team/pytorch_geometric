Title: IBM Even though pdjrtecfg finished successfully, PD.properties was not created. - United States

Text:
pdjrtecfg; PD.properties TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 PD.properties is not created when you configure using pdjrtecfg with -interactive option for WebSphere Application Server. It should be created under $WAS_HOME\tivoli\tam\PolicyDirector. 

CAUSE
 

You can see this explanation in knowledgecenter (link is below):
> When pdjrtecfg runs with -interactive, the utility detects WebSphere Application Server, version 8, and automatically provides the -cfgfiles_path and -alt_config options.



It works if you are using the default Java runtime which comes with the WebSphere Application Server.

You can use the other Java runtime with WebSphere Application Server. For example, Java 1.7.1 with WebSphere 8.5.5.2( or later). 

If you select such Java runtime with managesdk.sh, then -interactive can not provide above parameters automatically.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

You need to use -alt_config along with -cfgfiles_path in such case. 

 

(Please adjust directory names etc. for your own environment.) 

# cd /usr/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin 

# . ./setupCmdLine.sh 

# /opt/PolicyDirector/sbin/pdjrtecfg -action config -host <host name of policy server> -alt_config -cfgfiles_path /usr/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/tivoli/tam
