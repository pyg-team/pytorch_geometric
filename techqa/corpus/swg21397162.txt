SYMPTOM
When trying to upload a server license key, to Jazz Team Server the error is displayed, even if there are no floating licenses configured: 

 * 
   "CRJAZ0975I- The policy requires the bundle com.ibm.team.jazz.foundation.server[1.0.0,1.1.0), but it could not be found.
   
   There is a problem with the server license. Resolve the issue described in the status section below to continue.  
   
   The new server license does not support floating licenses. If the license changes are saved, the active floating leases will be terminated.
