PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After assigning all roles to a user, only blank pages show in the Tivoli Integrated Portal. 

SYMPTOM
Only blank pages show after logging into TIP. 


CAUSE
Missing policy files for war modules that cause authorization issues. TIP uses external JACC provider called Argus which uses the common authz policy files for user/role related authorizations. These policy files will get generated at the application deployment time but for some reason the impact related modules were missing. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the SystemOut.log for errors like these: 

0000002a ApplicationPo E ApplicationPolicy_implies( String, Permission, EvaluationContext ) CWRGS4111W The XACML policy element with the identifier 'href:TIPCell/isc/impactAdmin.war' 
could not be found. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 To fix this, you can generate these policy files anytime manually.

Follow these steps: 

1) Login to the WAS admin console -> Security -> Global security -> External authorization providers.
2) Select the third radio button and type the name isc and then click Apply and after that save. 
This step will regenerate the policy files for isc application (which is for TIP and all the modules under TIP)
3) Restart the TIP Server




Please note: Make sure the server is not part of a HA (High Availability) configuration, otherwise the newly created policy files may get overwritten the next time the server is being restarted.
