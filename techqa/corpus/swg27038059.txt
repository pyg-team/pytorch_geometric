Time Questions asked 00:00 General introduction 03:20 Technical introduction 04:45 Are any new features or enhancements for Database integration in the 5.0 Firmware? 07:16 How to debug integration problems related to DataPower with MQFTE ? 19:29 What are some networking best practices and troubleshooting steps to consider when using the appliance? 29:49 How are timeouts handled in DataPower, and what should be considered? 39:10 What precautions should be taken when employing DataPower regular expressions? 43:24 How can I filter out IPs from my log target (I'm talking about IP suppression)? 44:53 Will there be support for mqmd version 2 on the XI52 appliances? 46:40 How do I make a recursive LDAP query that will return the third descendant of a group? (My Enterprise uses A.D which support a recursive query : (member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=somegroup,cn=users,dc=somedc,dc=com). As for now, we are using an ldap-search procedure but we're open to changes. 47:49 Is it possible to upload several files from a browser by marking them all at once?
