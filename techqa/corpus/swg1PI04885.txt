APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Creating any job in C&DS 5.0 FP2 and adding subscribers in the
   Notifications list is successful. However, after making any
   change to the job (such as moving the job-step within the
   canvas) which requires a save, the subscribers are being lost.
   
   The Deployment Manager log (%appdata%\SPSSInc\Deployment
   Manager\spssemgr.log) does not record any errors:
   Oct 28 2013 09:09:50 [main] WARN
   com.spss.mgmt.content.core.authorization.security.Authorization
   - sso enabled = false
   Oct 28 2013 09:09:58 [Thread-9] WARN

   Oct 28 2013 09:09:59 [Thread-9] WARN
   com.spss.mgmt.common.core.update.FeatureInstaller  - Install
   operation complete
   
   Have checked the 'cds.log' and 'server.log' and both contain the
   following error message at the time of the issue occurring:
   2013-10-28 07:11:15,283 ERROR [STDERR] AbstractLoggingWriter
   (http-0.0.0.0-8080-5) The database is unavailable, underlying
   error: java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException:
   [SPSSOEM][Oracle JDBC Driver] Internal error: Net8 protocol
   error has occurred.
   
   
   After a few instances of the above message, C&DS then writes the
   following in its logs:
   2013-10-28 07:11:15,377 ERROR [STDERR] AbstractLoggingWriter
   (http-0.0.0.0-8080-5) Rethrowing Exception as MetaException: The
   database is unavailable, underlying error:
   java.sql.SQLException: [SPSSOEM][Oracle JDBC Driver] Object is
   closed.
   
   
   This occurs when the repository database in use is Oracle. We
   were not able to replicate this issue when using DB2 or SQL
   Server as the repository database.
   
   This problem does not occur when subscribers are listed in the
   Job-Step rather than the Job.
   The expected behaviour is that re-saving jobs should not clear
   the subscribers in the notification list for the job.
