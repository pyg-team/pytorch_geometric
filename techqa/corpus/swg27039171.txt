 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document contains a list of known issues for IBM Content Navigator and non-IBM Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) repositories. 

CONTENT
Known Issue: Checked out documents from Alfresco show two items on the browse page 

When you check out a document from an Alfresco repository with IBM Content Navigator, two items are displayed on the Browse page:


 * The checked out document (version 1.0). 
 * The in-process document (version 1.1).



Known Issue: The MIME type of a Microsoft SharePoint document cannot be changed 
When you use Microsoft SharePoint with IBM Content Navigator, the MIME type of a document and its subsequent versions is set when the document is created. 

The MIME type is based on the file name extension of the first version created and cannot be changed. 

The user interface allows you to change the name of a document when editing properties and checking in new versions. However, changes to the extension are not saved. 

For example, create a document named test.doc. Check out the test.doc file. If you re-name the file to final.txt the new version is checked in as final.doc.
