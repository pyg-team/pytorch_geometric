QUESTION
 What information should be collected when you experience a problem during an IBM FileNet Application Engine (AE ) installation or upgrade? 
Collecting this information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 

ANSWER
The installation/upgrade of FileNet P8 Application Engine (AE) is comprised of multiple steps within several specific phases. Depending on the step or phase of the installation/upgrade being completed, various logs will be of use in troubleshooting any issues encountered. An AE installation/upgrade can be broken down into at least the following 4 phases:
1. Installing Application Engine (AE)
2. Installing the latest Content Engine (CE) Client files and Process Engine (PE) client files on AE servers
3. Deploying AE on the application server
4. Logging into Workplace

The sections below outline the logs that should be reviewed and attached to a PMR if an issue is encountered at a given phase.

Note: The default paths given below are in Unix format; they are essentially the same paths in Windows, just replace "/" with "\". Only where the Windows path is different will both the Unix and Windows paths be specified.



Installing Application Engine: Laying down the binaries  * <AE_install_path>/AE/Logs/app_engine_install_log_4_0_2.txt


InstallShield directory files: These are useful when an install/uninstall has been attempted multiple times. Below are the InstallShield default locations for various platforms: 

 * AIX (Premier Only) 

/usr/lib/objrepos/InstallShield/Universal  * Generic Unix 

/usr/lib/InstallShield/Universal  * HP-UX 

(user.home)/InstallShield/Universal  * Linux 

(user.home)/InstallShield/Universal  * Solaris

(user.home)/InstallShield/Universal  * Windows 

â€¦.\InstallShield\Universal

Installing the Latest Client Files on AE Servers 
Unix  * /opt/IBM/FileNet/CEClient/ceclient_install_log_4_5_1.txt 
 * /opt/IBM/FileNet/BPMClient/PEClient_install_log-4.5.1.txt


Windows  * <drive>:\ProgramFiles\IBM\FileNet\CEClient\ceclient_install_log_4_5_1.txt 
 * <drive>:\ProgramFiles\IBM\FileNet\BPMClient\PEClient_install_log-4.5.1.txt


Deploying AE on the Application Server 
WebSphere Application Server (WAS)  * The WAS Admin console can be used to verify whether the following tasks completed successfully:  * Workplace application is listed under Enterprise applications and deployed to the expected application server.
   
   
 * SystemOut.log if failing at the deploy step:  * <WAS_install_path>/profiles/<profile_name>/logs/<server_name>/SystemOut.log
   
   


Oracle WebLogic Application Server  * The Weblogic Administration console can be used to verify whether the following tasks completed successfully:  * Workplace application is listed under Enterprise applications and deployed to the expected application server.
   
   
 * <AE_server_name>.log if failing the deploy step:  * <WLS_install_path>/user_projects/domains/<domain_name>/servers/<AE_server_name>/logs/<AE_server_name>.log
   
   


JBoss Application Server  * <JBOSS_home>/<AE_server>/default/conf/log/server.log, if failing at the deploy step.
   



Logging into Workplace 
WebSphere Application Server (WAS)  * <WAS_install_path>/profiles/<profile_name>/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/ p8_server_trace.log 
 * <WAS_install_path>/profiles/<profile_name>/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/ p8_server_error.log 
 * <WAS_install_path>/profiles/<profile_name>/logs/<AE_server_name>/SystemOut.log


Oracle WebLogic Application Server  * <WLS_install_path>/user_projects/domains/<domain_name>/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/p8_server_trace.log 
 * <WLS_install_path>/user_projects/domains/<domain_name>/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/p8_server_error.log 
 * <WLS_install_path>/user_projects/domains/<domain_name>/servers/<AE_server_name>/logs/<server_name>.log


JBoss Application Server  * <JBOSS_home>/bin/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/p8_server_trace.log 
 * <JBOSS_home>/bin/FileNet/<CE_server_name>/p8_server_error.log 
 * <JBOSS_home>/<AE_server>/default/conf/log/server.log
