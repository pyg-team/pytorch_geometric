Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Security AppScan Standard. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]

DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

 * IBM Security AppScan Standard - 9.0.2, 9.0.1, 9.0, 8.8, 8.7, 8.6, 8.5, 8.0 
 * IBM Rational AppScan Standard – 8.5, 8.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
In order to mitigate this risk, please follow the instructions in the below article from Microsoft which explains how to disable RC4. 

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2868725 [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2868725] 

 

This should be done on the machines where AppScan Standard is installed. 

 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
