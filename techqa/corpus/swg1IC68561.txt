APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A scheduled transfer with a triggering condition is created
   in WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (WMQFTE) v7.0.2.
   
   Whenever the scheduled transfer runs and the triggering
   condition is not met, two FTE reply messages are sent to
   WMQFTE.<some identifier> queue on the FTE queue manager.
   Messages should not be going to WMQFTE.<some identifier>
   since it does not exist.
   Since there is no such queue on the FTE queue manager,
   the messages are sent to the dead letter queue (DLQ).
   These messages continue to build up on the DLQ every
   time the condition is not met.
   Example of messages generated to the DLQ:
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><reply version="3.00"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="Reply.xsd"
   ID="414d51205253544746544543202020204bcd28c220581972">
   <status resultCode="42"></status></reply>
   
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><reply version="3.00"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="Reply.xsd"
   ID="414d51205253544746544543202020204bcd28c220581972">
   <status resultCode="-2"></status></reply>
   Note the status resultCodes in each message: "42" and "-2"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a schedule is created on the command line a temporary reply
   queue is added to the schedule definition. This reply queue only
   lasts for the life of the command. The reply queue name is not
   removed from the Scedule definition, which will cause a reply to
   be sent to a queue that does not exist, and hence to the Queue
   Manager dead letter queue.
   
   
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Those creating scheduled transfers from the command line
   
   PLATFORMS AFFECTED:
   All supported platforms
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The reply destination is now removed from the scedule definition
   at the time the scheduled transfer is run.
