ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 client for Mac OSX
   and attempt to launch.  Immediately you are met with the error
   message:
   
   'SPSS Statistics Client Scripting failed to start. The network
   host cannot be found, inet:Local Computer:0'
   
   and the Statistics Server login dialog is presented.  Thus far,
   in most reported cases, you are able to select the "Local
   Computer" entry and click "OK" to complete launching the
   product.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This behavior has been traced to a known issue with Java 7 on
   Mac OS X.
   
   This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please
   refer to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
   
   If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support. An Interim Fix was
   developed for customers who need the fix prior to the next
   upcoming Fix Pack.
   
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI42233
   and technote # 1959190. Before you apply this interim Fix make
   sure you have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 23 for Macintosh on
   default path location and do not use other installation
   directories.
   about Interim Fix 10 for Statistics 23.0 on Mac OS X.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers. They are normally sent only
   to customers who have reported one of the corrected problems,
   and who require an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not
   address customer enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted testing of specific
   fixes, not full regression testing. If the fix is not urgently
   required, you may prefer to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack
   Release, which will be fully regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
