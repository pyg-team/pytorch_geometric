PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to add a document using Workplace XT on Firefox, the Add Document window hangs and the add document operation cannot be completed. 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to add a document using Workplace XT on Firefox, a separate "Workplace XT: Add Document" window opens displaying a white box in the middile that says "Initializing". The add document operation does not progress beyond that point. Documents can be added using Workplace XT without problems when using Internet Explorer. Documents can be added without problems using Firefox when using FileNet AE/Workplace.


CAUSE
The Java plug-in for Firefox is disabled.

ENVIRONMENT
Workplace XT any platform

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If documents can be added using Internet Explorer, it is unlikely the cause of the problem is with the Workplace XT application. Diagnosing the problem should focus on the browser. When attempting to add a document, Workplace XT invokes JavaScript. If the Java plug-in for the browser is disabled, the JavaScript code is not able to execute. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Make sure that Firefox has an enabled Java plug-in so that it is able to execute Java code:




 1. Select "Plug-ins" or Add-on, then Plug-ins from the "Tools" dropdown menu in Firefox. 
 2. Scroll down the list and look for any Java-related plug-ins that are disabled. Disabled plug-ins will have an "Enable" button. New versions may have a drop down set to "Never Activate". 
 3. Look for a plug-in called "Java(TM) Platform SE Uxx" or something similar. The plug-in will say "Next Generation Java Plug in for Mozilla browsers" or something similar. 
 4. Once a Java plug-in is enabled, start restart FireFox and test adding a document again.
