Title: IBM How to Locate Packages in the IBM Installation Manager Repository - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document includes information on how to locate what packages are contained in an Installation Manager repository. This information can be used for installing WebSphere Application Server. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When installing software on the IBM i system, the usage of the IBM Installation Manager may be required. The IBM Installation Manager software requires a package to complete the installation of products such as IBM WebSphere Application Server. Each package is contained in a repository. 

To locate what packages are contained in a repository, you would run the following commands:

STRQSH
umask 022
cd /QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools
./imcl listAvailablePackages -repositories <repository>

In the following example, the repository is a virtual media device for the IBM Web Enablement V8.5 package available from IBM Entitled Systems Support (ESS).

Example
STRQSH
umask 022
cd /QIBM/ProdData/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools
$
./imcl listAvailablePackages -repositories /qopt/WASV85_WEBENAB/WAS
com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v85_8.5.0.20120501_1108
$

The package com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v85 would be used when running the imcl install command as follows:

./imcl install com.ibm.websphere.WEBENAB.v85 -repositories /QOPT/WASV85_WEBENAB/WAS

If a package is not found, the following error message is produced:

CRIMC1011W WARNING: The following repositories are not connected:
WARNING: Failed to connect repository '/QOPT/Testing' either because the repository does not exist, the repository is close
d or the repository server can not be reached.
WARNING: Some reasons why a repository connection fails are:
WARNING: Is the Repository location mistyped?
WARNING: Is the local network down?
WARNING: If you use a firewall, does it allow the Installation Manager to access the server?
WARNING: If your computer uses a proxy server, are the proxy settings for the Installation Manager set correctly?
