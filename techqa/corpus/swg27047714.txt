ABSTRACT
 An error occurs if you attempt to connect to the System Monitoring portal from a PureApplication Software for US Federal Services environment:"KFWITM392E internal error occurred during logon." 

CONTENT
Problem: Due to networking differences in the Amazon Web Services environment, an error occurs if you attempt to connect to the System Monitoring portal from a PureApplication Software for US Federal Services environment:"KFWITM392E internal error occurred during logon." 


Resolution: Complete the following steps to connect to the System Monitoring portal. 

Note: There are two features that will not work even after implementing this workaround: 

 1. The "Role Type Perspective Deployment overview", which indicates the role type of each virtual machine and shows the topology diagram of the deployment, does not work. 
 2. The "Logical view" cannot be displayed on "Navigator". Normally, The "Role Type Perspective Deployment overview" of the instance will be displayed on System Monitoring portal when you click the "Advanced monitor" link for a deployed instance. However, only the "Physical" View is displayed on the "Navigator". You can get the metrics from the agents in the virtual machine nodes, but you will not see the information about which virtual machines belong to the deployment. 


Steps for the workaround: 

 1. Open the instance details page for the instance and expand the Middleware perspective section. 
 2. Download the LICServlet file by clicking the Monitor link in the Middleware Status column for the node. 
 3. Open the LICServlet file with a text editor and add the following property to the <resources> entry: <property name="jnlp.tep.connection.protocol" value="http"/>. 
 4. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047714&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047714&aid=1]Add the public IP Address and hostname for the ITM-Hub-TEMS virtual machine to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.  * You can find the hostname in the LICServlet file in the jnlp.cnp.http.url.host property. 
     * You can find the IP Address for the ITM-Hub-TEMS virtual machine on the Shared Service instance page.
    
    
 5. Open the LICServlet file with the Java Web Start Launcher by right clicking on the file and choosing Open with > Java Web Start Launcher.  * You will see the Tivoli Enterprise Portal login page.
    
    
 6. Log in as sysadmin with the password that you set for that user when you deployed the System Monitoring shared service. 
 7. Click OK.
