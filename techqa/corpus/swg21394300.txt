QUESTION
 Which IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client levels support VMware ESX service console, vStorage APIs for Data Protection, and VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) backups? 

ANSWER
 

VMware vStorage APIs for Data Protection (VADP) 

VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB)#ESX%20SERVICE%20CONSOLE 

ESX Service Console 

ESX Guest 

 There is information in the Backup-Archive Client User's Guides for each TSM version on how to configure your client for VMware and ESX backups. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/tivolidoccentral/Tivoli+Storage+Manager [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/tivolidoccentral/Tivoli+Storage+Manager] 

 

A separate product, TSM for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware, is also available for VMware backups. 

 

VMWARE VSTORAGE APIS FOR DATA PROTECTION (VADP)

Both full-vm and file off-host backups are supported with the VMware vStorage APIs for Data Protection (VADP). 

The Backup-Archive client is also the data mover for the TSM for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware product (TSM VE: DP for VMware). This TSM VE: DP for VMware technote describes the vSphere support levels and other support for the various Backup-Archive data mover levels which use the VADP APIs: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672351 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21672351] 

 

 

VMWARE CONSOLIDATED BACKUP (VCB) - End of Support 

VMware Consolidated Backup is no longer supported. It was previously supported for backups with client levels that have reached End Of Support: 

 * the 5.5 TSM Windows x32 Backup-Archive client 
 * the 6.1 and 6.2 TSM Windows x32 and x64 Backup-Archive clients


VCB is not supported with the "Free License" version of ESXi. 

ESX, ESXi Levels VCB Framework Level TSM Windows Client supported version for VCB 3.0 and 3.5 1.0 and 1.1 5.5 and 6.1 3.0 and 3.5 1.5 and 1.5 Update 1 5.5, 6.1 and 6.2 4.0 1

(including vSphere) 1.5 Update 2 3 6.1 2and 6.2 3 
1 Backups are supported using direct interaction with an ESX 4.0 or 4.1 server or through a vCenter or Virtual Center 4 server. Recovery using full-VM restores requires VMware Converter Standalone 4.0.1 or higher. 

2Proxy support:  * Windows 2003 with any 6.1 or 6.2 client 
 * Windows 2008 beginning with the 6.1.2 client and with any 6.2 client (requires VCB Framework 1.5. Update 1 or 2)


36.2 client Off-host full-machine backup requires VCB Framework 1.5 Update 1 or 2. However, Off-host file-level backup uses the VMware vStorage APIs for Data Protection and does not require any additional VMware software. 
 

ESX SERVICE CONSOLE - End of Support 

The VMware ESX Service Console is no longer supported. It was previously supported for backups with the TSM Linux x86/x86_64 Backup-Archive client for TSM Versions 5.5, 6.1, and 6.2. 

Note: ESXi does not have a supported Service Console and therefore there it is not possible to install the TSM Linux x86/x86_64 Backup-Archive client on ESXi. 

 

ESX Level TSM Linux x86 Client supported version for ESX Service Console 3.0 5.5 3.5 5.5 4.0 and 4.1 5.5, 6.1, and 6.2  

ESX GUEST 

TSM client support of backups as a VMware ESX guest is discussed in this technote: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21239546 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?&uid=swg21239546]
