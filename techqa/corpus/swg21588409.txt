Title: IBM HTTP 500 Internal server error when attempting to login to a project in IBM Rational RequisiteWeb - United States

Text:
http 500; internal error; reqweb TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After a new installation of IBM Rational Requisite Pro RequisiteWeb 7.1.3.x along with WebSphere Application Server 8.x and IBM HTTP Server 8.x, users will not be able to get to the login page but observe 'HTTP 500 Internal server error' when clicking on 'Login' after selecting a Project. 

CAUSE
One of the causes for this error is if during the installation of WebSphere Application Server 8.x if you choose 'IBM 64-bit SDK for Java, Version 6' instead of 'IBM 32-bit SDK for Java, Version 6' under the 'IBM Software Development Kit' in the IBM Installation Manager.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As mentioned in the ReqWeb Documentation, you need to install 32-bit version of WebSphere Application Server for ReqWeb to function as designed. This also includes its sub components as well to be on 32-bit version. 


To resolve the issue, please uninstall all the components of ReqWeb, WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server and re-install the components by choosing only the 32-bit versions (including their sub-components if any) in the IBM Installation Manager as shown in the screenshot below.
