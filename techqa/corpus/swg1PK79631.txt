APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Current installation guide and Multisite administration guide la
   ck information about  incompatibility issues between earlier Cli
   ent versions and latest VOB feature levels.
   
   There is the following statement in Multisite administration gui
   de 'Planning a multisite implementation' ? 'Multisite use model'
    ? 'Identities and permissions strategy for VOB replicas' ? 'Per
   missions-preserving replicas' section:
   
   'In order for you to change a replica to be permissions-preservi
   ng or to create a new permissions-preserving replica, the VOB fa
   mily feature level of the replica must be at least 4. Also, the
   cleartool protect command fails if you use the ?chmod option, sp
   ecify an object in a permissions-preserving replica, and your cl
   ient host is running a version of Rational ClearCase associated
   with feature level 3 or lower.'
   
   However, other operations will also fail when client with lower
   feature levels tried to perform the functionalities that support
   ed by higher feature levels.
   
   For example, mkbranch operation from 2002.05.xx client(FL3) will
    fail if mkbranch is run against permission preserving replica V
   OB since permission preserving mode is implemented from FL4.
   (See RATLC00753480 for more details)
   
   Since we specifically state that older clients can access newer
   VOB and View servers, there must be a note on the Feature Levels
    as well and this should not limit 'protect' command.
