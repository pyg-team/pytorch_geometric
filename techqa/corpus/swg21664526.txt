Title: IBM Mttrapd probe unable to start up with error "socket name-has been already used" - United States

Text:
port 162; snmp probe; mttrapd; socket; name; udp; unknown host; E-UNK-000-000; snmpd TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The mttrapd probe fails to start with the following error:

Error: E-UNK-000-000: SNMP Message (priority=3): UDP snmp_open: Unknown host (udp:162) (socket name-has been already used) 

CAUSE
Another application is using port 162.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
By default, snmpd is configured to use port 162. Make sure that the snmpd is not running. 


Check the output of netstat -an command to determine whether or not port 162 is in use by another application; e.g. IBM Tivoli Storage Productivity Center.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Disable the other application or configure mttrapd probe to use another free port.
