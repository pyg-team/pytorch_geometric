Important Upgrade Information 


V6.4.0.0 introduced Real-time compression. It is important to note that when the first compressed volume is created, the performance of existing volumes may be affected due to re-allocation of hardware resources. 

Please refer to the IBM Real-time Compression in SAN Volume Controller and Storwize V7000 Redpaper for more details:

Please ensure you have read the release note and are familiar with the following Flash Announcements before upgrading: 

Global Mirror Relationships Must Be Stopped When Upgrading to V7.2.0 or above [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004472] SAN Volume Controller and Storwize V7000 Software Upgrade Test Utility [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S4000585] If a SAN Volume Controller or Storwize V7000 Code Upgrade Stalls or Fails then Contact IBM Support for Further Assistance [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1002894] Intra-Cluster Global Mirror Not Supported With V6.x and V7.x Code [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003725] 

If upgrading from a version prior to V7.3.0.1 please be aware that this upgrade introduces a new cache architecture. For the duration of the upgrade the cache will be disabled for the entire system, which may affect performance. Once this upgrade has completed the cache will be automatically re-enabled. 
This system-wide cache disable is only required when installing the new cache architecture for the first time. Subsequent upgrades will not disable the cache on the entire system. 

You should ensure that the system event log does not contain any unfixed events prior to applying a software upgrade, since these events may prevent a successful upgrade. Use the Troubleshooting Guide or the Maintenance Procedures to fix any outstanding errors. In addition to checking the system event log IBM also strongly recommend using the upgrade test utility.
