APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Oracle DB has a limitation of 1000 parameters in an sql 'IN'
   clause. Having a huge number of tasks can lead to hitting that
   limitation.
   The SystemOut.log shows the following exception:
   java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-01795:
   maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Oracle limitation when searching for tasks in Process
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   Customer does a task search in the process portal and gets
   "CWTBG0019E: Unexpected exception during execution".
   This is caused by an error thrown from the oracle jdbc driver,
   since the internally used jdbc statement contains more than
   1000 parameters in the 'IN' clause: ORA-01795: maximum number
   of expressions in a list is 1000.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The internal query construction logic was fixed to not cause the
   problem anymore.
