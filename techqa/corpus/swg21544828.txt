QUESTION
 How to limit an FTP remote to view only their batches (SCI22966) 

ANSWER
Incorporate the use of the FTP sessions security exit and/or additional security package (aka RACF, ACF2, etc.) definitions for exception security rules for users. Refer to chapter 8 of the User's Guide for security and/or the Application Agents and User Exits Guide for the sessions security exit.

NOTE These still do not prevent a directory view of other mailboxes, just batch access.
