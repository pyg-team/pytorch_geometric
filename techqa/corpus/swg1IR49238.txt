APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  java.util.MissingResourceException: can't find resource for
   com.ibm.ace.jaceintf.AceJavaMsgs_en_US error on startup of the
   SureVision application.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   It appears that there was an issue with the TOF
   input file. We were missing one file to bundle with the
   resources and classes.  This file was psk.jar.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Added the psk.jar file to the sureview.rci f
   file so that the resources in psk.jar will also get bundled
   for TOF.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *   Modify SUREVIEW.RCI to include adx_ipgm:PSK.JAR
