- Check the box for Use Authorization Providers to Protect JMX Access. (Enable it) - Now go to the tab Roles and Policies -> Realm Policies 
- Click on the link JMX Policy Editor 
- The next screen will give you an option of selecting policy. 
- Select global scope so that the policy applies to all instances 
- click next
