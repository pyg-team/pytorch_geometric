Title: IBM Cannot get a Statistics syntax Job to run on Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS). - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am attempting to run a Statistics syntax job in C&DS, but the job is failing with the following error messages in Deployment Manager:
--- PRMS ---
statisticsb.exe -f syntax.sps -type html -out "showlic.html"
The process terminated with the exit code 1.
--- STDOUT ---
--- STDERR ---


Why am I getting this error? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please check your Statistics Syntax file for syntax errors. The above error is typical to see if you have made a syntax error. Please try to run your syntax file via Statisticsb (the batch line verison of Statistics) to assure there are no syntax erorrs. Please correct any syntax errors that you receive and store your new syntax file back to the C&DS repository
