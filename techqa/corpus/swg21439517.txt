QUESTION
 How do I change the default port that the NetApp Storage Agent uses to connect to the NetApp(R) DataFabric Manager (DFM) server? 

ANSWER
The default ports are 8088 for HTTP and 8488 for HTTPS.
Users may change the port used by the NetApp Storage agent by setting the KNU_DATASOURCE_PORT environment variable. 

On a Windows system, the procedure to do this is as follows:


 1. From the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) window, right-click on the agent instance whose behavior you wish to change. 
 2. Choose Advanced, then Edit Variables... 
 3. In the resulting window, click the Add... button. 
 4. Enter KNU_DATASOURCE_PORT for the variable, and the desired port number for the value. 
 5. Restart the agent.


On a Linux system, the procedure is as follows: 
 1. Open the file $CANDLEHOME/config/nu.ini in a text editor. 
 2. Add the following line to the end of that file:
    
    KNU_DATASOURCE_PORT=<port number>
    where <port number> is the desired port number, e.g., 443. 
 3. Restart the agent.


Note that the port number that the agent uses must be the same as the one the DFM server is configured to listen on.
