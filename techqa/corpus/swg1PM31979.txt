APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WCM content is not updated on one of the cluster member. This
   makes the data inconsistent.
   
   The fix resolves this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This APAR is concerned with Navigator components only. The
   scenario is as follows
   
   1. Set up a clsuter with two nodes. The cluster must also be the
   subscriber in a syndicator-subscriber pair. For convenience of
   testing, you can syndicate to one of the nodes (say , NodeA) in
   the cluster.
   2. Create a navigator which displays some items and syndicate it
   to the cluster. Make sure you can view it correctly by hitting
   both nodes of the cluster directly.
   3. Now clear the navigator cache on NodeA only by running the
   clearcache.jsp or by restarting the node. Make sure you do not
   render the navigator now on either nodes.
   4. Now make an update to the navigator results on the syndicator
   and let the syndication go through. So we basically want NodeA
   to process this syndication update when its navigator cache is
   empty.
   5. Wait for few minutes (to ensure the cache has been
   replicated) and render the navigator on NodeB.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The cache removal messages are now sent even if the cache on
   NodeA ia empty.
