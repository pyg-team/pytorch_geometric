PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Users are unable to filter by ORGID for the VENDOR field on Planned Service.



SYMPTOM
 

1) Go to > Work Orders> Work Order Tracking.
2) Create a new work order.
3) Create new line in Plan Services (WPSERVICE). 
4) From the Vendor field> Select Value. 
5) List shows vendors from all Organizations 


CAUSE
There is no ORGID in the where clause when trying to select a vendor. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This is working as designed. You can get a service from any organization and you can also filter within the list on the Organization field to choose the vendor you wish from a particular organization.

For Materials (item) and Standard Services (Service Items), they are inserted within Maximo and will default the vendor that is specified on the Service ITEM when choosing DIRECT Issue Check box.
