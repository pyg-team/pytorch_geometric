ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   TEMS:
     OS: Linux
     Level: ITM 6.1
   TEPS:
     OS: Linux
     Level: ITM 6.1  +  6.1.0.1-TIV-ITM_TEP-IF0001
   
   Problem Description:
   The dos2unix called in ImportAgentTEPS.sh fails to convert
   files.
   As a consequience the ImportAgentTEPS.sh cannot complete some
   operations and situations definition, workspace and queries are
   not imported correctly.
   
   The problem is that the do2unix is called from the application
   installer's directory to convert the files in the /tmp
   directory, that's where the installer copied them before.
   
   Unfortunately dos2unix has a bug and fails if it is called from
   another directory then the one where the files are, which are to
   be converted.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   To reproduce install Apllication Suport for any candle agent on
   TEPS on linux OS

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the ImportAgentTEPS.sh  adjusting the dos2unix path:
   # workaround
                   cd /tmp
                   dos2unix /tmp/$i
                   cd ${KFW_BIN_DIR}
   # workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The fix was to make sure that the script has the right path to
   find dos2unix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The path to the dos2unix file was fixed.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be included in the following
