   in .simx, such as:
   <property name="date.from" style="idp-block" xsi:
   type="dateProperty" displayName="From date" required="false">
   </property>

   request:
   java.lang.Long cannot be cast to javax.xml.datatype.
   XMLGregorianCalendar

   unexpected error is reported while processing simulation
   request : java.lang.Long cannot be cast to
   javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar When using custom

   to avoid that we need to convert long timestamp value to
   XMLGregorianCalendar.
