 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 IBM ClearCase 9.0.x and IBM ClearQuest 9.0.x use a new Java version that is not compatible with the default Java version supplied with the IBM WebSphere Application Server profiles. Therefore, you must install IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology version 7.0 or higher on hosts where you plan to install server features. 

CONTENT
To install the IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology, follow the instructions in the IBM WebSphere documentation links in "Related information" below. 

NOTE: If an incompatible IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology is installed, the installation fails as follows: 

 * Clean install, Modify Add and Upgrade Add (GUI/Console). When setting up the inputs in the WebSphere Application Server panel you will see an error message similar to this and you will not be able to continue: 
   
   
   "A compatible IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology version was not found. In order to install any server feature you must install an IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology version 1.7 or higher."
   
   Depending on the nature of the failure, different error messages could appear. 
   
   
 * Clean install and Modify Add (Silently). The installation fails immediately and an error message is displayed 
   
   
 * Upgrade (GUI/Console or Silent mode). No errors appear during the panel configuration and you are able to continue. The failure occurs at the end of the installation process, when an error message is displayed. The ClearCase or ClearQuest servers have not been upgraded.
