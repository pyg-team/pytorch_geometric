APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a restore is done on AIX into a new database, by default
   only 3 prefetcher processes are started, causing slow restore.
   
   This does not happen when the restore is on existing database,
   when NUM_IOSERVERS parameter is set to a higher value.
   
   And when restoring into a new database, there are no means to
   set NUM_IOSERVERS database configuration parameter.
   
   
   This does not happen on Linux where by default 255 prefetcher
   processes are started.
   
   The workaround to this issue is to create a dummy database,
   update NUM_IOSERVERS to a higher value (ex: 20), then do a
   restore. This will cause equal number of prefetcher processes
   start as it is defined by NUM_IOSERVERS parameter.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Create a dummy database
   
   2. Update NUM_IOSERVERS to a higher values (20 is a good
   starting point):
   
   db2 connect to <db_name>
   
   db2 update db cfg using NUM_IOSERVERS 20
   
   3. Start a restore.
