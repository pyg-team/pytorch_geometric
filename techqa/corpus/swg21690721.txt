QUESTION
 How do you install missing WebSphere MQ (WMQ) Client version 7.0.1.6 connector.jar to IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI) version 5.2.5 (and below)? 

CAUSE
To use the WMQ Adapter, the WMQ Suite Services, and/or the WMQ File Transfer Edition Services in ISBI, a set of WMQ Client jar files needs to be installed.
ISBI installation (version 5.2.3 to 5.2.5) includes WMQ Client jar files version 7.0.1.6.
Only WMQ Client connector.jar is not automatically available (see IBM Knowledge Center: ISBI Version 5.2.3 > What’s New > WebSphere MQ Suite [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JSW_5.2.0/com.ibm.help.release_notes_523.doc/523_featurePack_WebSphereMQ.html]).

Note: 

 * connector.jar is no longer needed when using IBM MQ Client Lib jar files version 8.0 (see IBM MQ 8.0 Knowledge Center "Changes to IBM MQ classes for Java" [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q115900_.htm]). 
 * ISBI version 5.2.6 includes IBM MQ Client Lib jar files version 8.0.0.2.

ANSWER
If needed, install WMQ Client version 7.0.1.6 connector.jar following the steps below. 


Note: 

 * Ensure that other installed WMQ Client jar files are on the same version prior to installing WMQ Client connector.jar. 
 * All other versions of WMQ Client jar files need to be uninstalled (see IBM Technote "Uninstall WebSphere MQ Client jar files from Sterling B2B Integrator" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21690573]). 
 * WMQ Client jar files version 7.0.1.6 cannot be used on Java 7 (see IC88187 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC88187]).
   Thus at least version 7.0.1.10, 7.1.0.3, 7.5.0.1 or 8.0 is needed when you running ISBI 5.2.5 (that requires Java 7) or ISBI 5.2.4.2 on Java 7. 
 * IBM WMQ SupportPac MQC7: WebSphere MQ V7.0 Clients cannot be downloaded anymore, because "End of Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS914-067]" has been reached for MQ 7.0 in 2015. 
 * If you want to upgrade all MQ client jar files to a newer version see IBM Technote "Get and install new WebSphere MQ Client jar files for Sterling B2B Integrator" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21670087].


The required WMQ Client connector.jar can be obtained:  * either from an existing MQ server or MQ Client installation
   (this should be a version 7.0.1.6 installation to ensure compatibility with existing WMQ Client jar files)  * it is located in <mq-inst>/java/lib/connector.jar
   
   
 * or extract it from IBM WMQ SupportPac MQC7: WebSphere MQ V7.0 Clients installation files if available
   (this cannot be downloaded any more, because "End of Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS914-067]" has been reached for MQ 7.0 in 2015)  * if you have the installation files for a WebSphere MQ Client for Windows, install the WebSphere MQ Client and get the required WMQ Client connector.jar as described in option 1 above 
    * if you have the installation files for a WebSphere MQ Client for Linux you may extract (also on Windows) the required WMQ Client connector.jar without installing as outlined below  * download: mqc7_7.0.1.6_linuxx86-64.tar.gz 
       * from this .tar.gz file, extract /MQSeriesJava-7.0.1-6.x86_64.rpm 
       * from this .rpm file, extract /opt/mqm/java/lib/connector.jar (you can use rpm2cpio [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-lpic1-v3-102-5/#N1047F] or 7zip for extraction)
      
      
   
   


Copy the WMQ Client connector.jar to a temporary directory accessible on the server where ISBI is installed (for example, to: <mq-jars-tmp>/ connector.jar). 

To install the WMQ Client connector.jar change on command line to the folder <si-install>/bin and execute:  * on Linux/UNIX 
   ./install3rdParty.sh mqseries 7_0_1_6 -j <mq-jars-tmp>/connector.jar 
 * on Windows
   install3rdParty.cmd mqseries 7_0_1_6 -j <mq-jars-tmp>\connector.jar


Restart ISBI for the changes to take effect.
