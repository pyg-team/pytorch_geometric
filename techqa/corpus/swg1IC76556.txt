APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DB2 INSPECT ROWCOMPESTIMATE option estimates the
   effectiveness of row compression for a table. It can leak memory
   when the compression dictionary was built successfully but
   attempting to insert it into table didn't succeed or complete.
   For such case, the dictionary should be free'ed from the memory.
    The most common situation for this is when INSPECT
   ROWCOMPESTIMATE runs against a table that does not support data
   row compression.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the database to free the leaked memory in DBHEAP
