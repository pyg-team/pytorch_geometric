LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This ifix increases the limit for the size of forms shown in BPC
   Explorer.
   Instead of a limit for the nesting of a message which was 15
   levels, the form can now have 30 nesting levels.
   Nevertheless it is not recommended to use processes or tasks
   which have such a high nesting level at least
   if human interaction is needed.
