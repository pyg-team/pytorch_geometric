 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why does the Notice Sender timer task not run automatically but runs when executed manually from the IBM Atlas timer task page? 

SYMPTOM
Notice Sender timer task does not run automatically but runs when executed manually from the timer task page. You will not see any error message in Atlas log file


CAUSE
This is caused by the unsupported JRE version which is 1.7

ENVIRONMENT
Websphere 8.5.5 with JRE 1.7

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When the application server is restarted the Notice Sender timer task runs once automatically but stops running afterwards. You are able to execute the timer task manually. You will also see that the Next fire time is updated though the timer task is never executed automatically

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM






 1. Navigate to {WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/java and confirm that the java is JRE 1.6 by reviewing the readme document 
 2. Login to Websphere admin Console 
 3. Navigate to Environment > Websphere variables 
 4. Edit JAVA_HOME and point it to ${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/java 
 5. Save to master configuration and restart the application server.
