DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM Integration Designer is the "one tool, one set of skills" solution for end-to-end integration in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). Based on Eclipse, Integration Designer is a tool for building SOA-based business process management (BPM) and integration solutions across IBM Business Process Manager, IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus, and IBM WebSphere Adapters. It simplifies integration with rich features that accelerate the adoption of SOA by rendering existing IT assets as service components, encouraging reuse and efficiency. 

The IBM Integration Designer Version 8.5.7 test environment includes the IBM Process Server. You can use this test environment to monitor BPEL processes. You can install the Business Monitor V8.5.7 server on top of the process server and create a profile with process server and monitoring capabilities.
