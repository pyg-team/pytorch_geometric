APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a 7.2 Data Collector is configured only for ITCAM Agent for
   WebSphere Applications, any custom PMI specified in
   datacollector.properties (or datacollector_custom.properties) is
    ignored.
   
   Users Effected:
   All users of ITCAM 7.2 data collector not using the ITCAM
   Managing Server
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the configuration runtime directory, you should find a file
   called: *.*.*.dcManualInput.txt
   
   Edit that file, and change the value of property
   am.camtoolkit.gpe.dc.operation.mode=WR
   to read
   am.camtoolkit.gpe.dc.operation.mode=WR,MS
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ITCAM Converged Data Collector does not use custom PMI
   levels defined in datacollector.properties, if DC is not
   configured for ITCAM MS (i.e if operation.mode configured only
   for wr).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code to set custom PMI levels has been moved from MS-DC specific
   startup component (which is only executed when a DC is
   configured for Managing Server use) to a new independent startup
   component which will set custom PMI values defined in
   datacollector.properties file. Additionally, custom PMI values
   for Monitoring On Demand (MOD) level 2 will now be changed when
   the ITCAM Agent collection level is changed to level 2 as well
   as when Managing Server MOD level is changed.
