Title: IBM Information about compatibility of IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) with IBM API Connect - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is IBM API Connect compatible with the IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT)? 

ANSWER
This document is intended to inform customers about the technical incompatibility between API Connect and IBM License Metric Tool. As a result, licensing must be tracked manually.

IBM API Connect v5.0.x.x is a Virtual Appliance, and users do not have access to the filesystem on the appliance to install and run the ILMT Agent. Furthermore, IBM API Connect version 5.0.x.x has a dependency on DataPower Gateway 7.5.x.x, which does not support the use of IBM License Metric Tool and the ILMT Agent (see Information about IBM License Metric Tool and the License Agent on DataPower Gateway [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980549] ). 

There are two charge metrics available for API Connect: the PVU charge metric and the API calls/month metric. If using the PVU model, subcapacity usage can be tracked through the Hypervisor management software. If using the API calls/month metric, statistics generated by the product UI can help determine usage. Full capacity licensing does not apply to the API Connect components as they are available only as virtual machines. 

With the License Agent unavailable and API Connect not being a supported system for IBM License Metric Tool, customers must manually track subcapacity licensing for the API Management nodes, Developer Portal nodes and Node.js microservices runtime instances if running on a virtual machine.

In environments where Node.js microservices runtime instances are run directly on an operating system that is deployed on server hardware, customers must manually track full capacity licensing for those instances. More information can be found here:
