APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I'm not getting Sequence and Activity diagrams to get imported
   correctly, with either 7.6.0.1 or
   7.6.1 version of Rhapsody.
   
   To summarize again, Sparx EA Activities come in as full Rhapsody
   Activities
   instead of Actions, meaning that each individual Action has it's
   own empty
   Activity Diagram. Meanwhile, EA Activity Diagrams get imported
   with an
   incorrect name, and missing flows between Actions.
   
   Sequence diagrams get imported with a generic name (e.g.
   EACollaboration_1)
   and miss all the messages (they only have lifelines).
   Furthermore, only one
   Sequence Diagram gets imported for package, and the other ones
   are completely missing.
   
   I have been using Sparx EA 9 in my testing efforts, while the
   customer is
   actual using EA 8. Both should be supported according to our
   documentation,
   but I noticed that I don't have the 'full roundtrip' option in
   EA 9, while
   it exists in EA 8.
   
   
   I tried both XMI version 1.3 and 2.1 when exporting from EA (and
   put the
   appropriate version when I added that line to the file).
