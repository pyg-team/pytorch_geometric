APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to use Rational Developer for System z (RDz)
   9.1.1 and the Integrated Debugger to debug CICS transactions
   that contain, or execute, many EXEC CICS LINK statements, the
   transaction is abnormally terminated.
   This can occur at any time when stepping over, or into an EXEC
   CICS LINK statement.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Integrated Debugger was modified so that EXEC CICS LINK and EXEC
   CICS XCTL are handled differently. LINK now behaves like a
   function call, and XCTL behaves like exec() on UNIX systems.
   
   This APAR is being closed FIN with concurrence from the
   submitting customer. This means that a fix to this APAR is
   expected to be delivered from IBM in a release which is being
   developed at the time that the APAR was closed. The latest
   release of the product to exit development at the time this
   APAR was closed was: Rational Developer for z Systems V9.5.
