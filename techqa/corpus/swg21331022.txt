What is the Report Server for ClearQuest?
The Report Server for ClearQuest is a web server application that allows organizations to manage and share their ClearQuest data-pull reports. 


What are its capabilities? 

 * Basic access control 
 * Run reports 
 * Manage reports and folders 
 * Save and share report snapshots 
 * Export reports to PDF or Word




Which report providers are supported? 
For ClearQuest 7.1, the Report Server for ClearQuest supports management and execution of reports constructed with BIRT and Crystal Reports. 


Can other enterprise report providers be used for managing ClearQuest data-pull reports? 
Yes. Reports constructed using the data-pull model can be managed using an enterprise reporting server that supports the target reporting engine. 


What versions of BIRT are supported? 
BIRT 2.2.1 
BIRT 2.2.2 


What versions of Crystal Reports are supported? 
See technote 1216371 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg21216371] for more information on Crystal Reports support. 


What is the Security Mechanism? (authentication) 
User authentication is performed using a ClearQuest database. During report server configuration, the server administrator updates a configuration file to include the connection information for a ClearQuest database that is used for user credential validation. All user validation is performed through the ClearQuest API. 


Is LDAP authentication supported? 
LDAP is supported if the ClearQuest database used for authentication is configured to utilize LDAP. All user validation is performed through the ClearQuest API. 


What artifacts are managed by the Report Server for ClearQuest? 
The Report Server for ClearQuest manages reports created in BIRT or Crystal Reports. For BIRT reports, the Report Server for ClearQuest supports creation and management of report snapshots that are saved representations of formatted report output. 


How are the artifacts managed? 
The Report Server for ClearQuest uses the Jazz API to manage report design artifacts in a Derby database that is provided with the report server. 


Can report designs be saved using another database management system? 
No. For ClearQuest 7.1, report designs can only be saved in Derby databases. 


Are there facilities for backing up the Derby database that stored the report designs? 
Yes. For information about backing up Derby databases, see http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.0/manuals/admin/hubprnt43.html [http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.0/manuals/admin/hubprnt43.html]. 


Does the Report Server for ClearQuest support Multisite replication of report server sites? 
No. Multiple Report Server for ClearQuest instances can be deployed, but each instance is independent and data stored in the different instances is not propagated to the other instances. 



What platforms are supported? 
See technote 1294762 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg21294762#ClearQuest%207.1%20Report%20Server%20with]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg21294762#ClearQuest%207.1%20Report%20Server%20with] 


What browsers are supported? 
Internet Explorer 7 
Firefox 2.0.0 
Firefox 3.0 


Are report designs stored in ClearQuest? 
No. The report design files are stored in a separate Derby database provided with the Report Server for ClearQuest. Only the report designs are stored in the Derby database. When executing reports using Report Server for ClearQuest, ClearQuest data is always pulled directly from the ClearQuest database using the ClearQuest Reporting Driver. 


Where are report artifacts stored? 
Report files are stored in a Derby database provided with the Report Server for ClearQuest. 


How is the Report Server for ClearQuest deployed against ClearQuest systems with multiple schema repositories, or systems with multiple databases created against a given schema repository? 
Reports are managed by the report server (not in ClearQuest). Each report specifies connection information to retrieve the runtime data from ClearQuest. While user authentication for the Report Server for ClearQuest is performed against a single ClearQuest database, the reports themselves can pull data from multiple databases. 

If you have users in multiple schema repositories running reports on a single Report Server, you must add all users that require access to that Report Server instance (to the database you have chosen to use for authentication for the Report Server). The Report Server instance uses a single ClearQuest database for access control. Otherwise, you will need multiple installations of the Report Server. 

Once access to a Report Server is gained, a user can only run a report for which he has credentials to the data source or sources that are in the BIRT report. If you then try to run a report using a data source that you do not have access to, you will get a data connect error. 


Does the Report Server for ClearQuest support the same scaling patterns as ClearQuest Web? Can you deploy multiple instances of the Report Server for ClearQuest behind a load balancer? 
You can deploy multiple Report Server for ClearQuest instances behind a load balancer. However, since the report design files are accessed by Report Server for ClearQuest locally through an embedded Derby database, there is no way to load balance the entire system. 


How is the report hierarchy in the Report Server for ClearQuest related to the artifact hierarchy in CQ core? 
There is no relationship. The Report Server for ClearQuest is a separate web application and report designs are managed using a Derby database that is separate from the ClearQuest database where the actual data is stored. The report server supports the notion of "Private" and "Shared" reports. This concept is very similar to the ClearQuest "Public Queries" and "Personal Queries" concept. The report server does not expose full ACL capability. However, execution of reports is regulated by the ClearQuest security model which does support ACLs. When a report is launched from the Report Server for ClearQuest, the logged in user's credentials are passed to ClearQuest in order to execute the queries that a report requires. Access errors occur if the user does not have visibility or sufficient privileges to run the queries used by a report. 


What web servers are supported? 
The Report Server for ClearQuest is deployed to WebSphere Application Server. 


Is user management transparent to the Report Server for ClearQuest, or must you take special action in the Report Server for ClearQuest when users change? 
The administrator must initially grant ClearQuest users access to the Report Server for ClearQuest web site. When new users are added to ClearQuest, they must specifically be given access to Report Server for ClearQuest also. The administrator can also remove users. 

This is done using the "Users" link of the Report Server. The "Users" link is only visible to users with super user access. Any logged in user can upload reports. 

In order to share reports, the user must have "Public Folder Administrator" privilege in the ClearQuest database. 

The current version supports one administrator/schema repository configured per report server installation. If users are naturally segregated by schema repository, you may want to deploy multiple servers for each of these configurations.
