Title: IBM Application Integration (AI) Mapping from a Microsoft Excel File with Sterling B2B Integrator - United States

Text:
Excel spreadsheet; .xlsx file TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can the Application Integration Map Editor translate a Microsoft Excel .xlsx file, with Sterling B2B Integrator? 

ANSWER
No, the AI Map Editor cannot translate a .xlsx file, as it is not a text file. The .xlsx file can only be opened or viewed properly in the proprietary software. 

To work with the data in a .csv file, open the file in Microsoft Excel. Then convert it by saving it as a .csv file. 

A .csv file is a type of Variable Delimited file. The map editor can translate Variable Delimited files. Use that option when you create the map.
