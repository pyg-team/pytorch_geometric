Title: IBM Clustering a transparent decision service - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Can I cluster my tranparent decision service (HTDS or MTDS) and how should I proceed? 

ANSWER
A transparent decision service, whether it is hosted or monitored (HTDS or MTDS), is like any other client to Rule Execution Server, which calls it locally (using a Java SE or POJO rule session). Therefore, you cluster it along with the eXecution Unit (XU), on each server of the cluster.


Note: Refer to section "WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1: Java EE add-ons > Installing on <your application server> > Installing Rule Execution Server > Rule Execution Server deployment on cluster environments" of the JRules 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC.html] to get more information on how to deploy Rule Execution Server on each supported application server.
