ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Sybase Agent 06.20.01.06,
   OS: ANY
   
   Problem Description:
   
   When the agent accesses db with problem, for example suspect db,
   the Sybase stored procedure reports error without any data
   returned. In this case, the "Database Detail" view shows the
   user wrong data for the corresponding db.
   Furthermore, the number of Total DB In Error is correct but no
   databases are showed in Error Status.
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Create a problem db. When run "sp_helpdb <dbName>" or
   "sp_spaceused <dbName>" manually, it reports error without valid
   data returned.
   2. Go to ITM TEP, check the Sybase Server->Database, check the
   corresponding data of "Database Detail" view.
