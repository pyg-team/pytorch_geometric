PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the maximum number of characters that can be stored in a table created in ICM Admin client 

SYMPTOM
Sometime users try to import data into the tables created in ICM Admin Client, and because of the table column size limitations, data is truncated or the import fails.


CAUSE
Table column size limitations

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Cognos ICM Admin Client

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When an ICM application administrator creates a table in ICM Admin Client, the ICM software will create that table at the database level.

Table columns limitations are dependent on the column type. Below is a mapping between ICM table column types and the max characters / digits that the column can store.

Column type Max limit
-----------------------------------------------
Numeric ……………………… 28 digits, with a scale of 14 digits (14 digits on the right side of the decimal point)
Text …………………………….. 100 characters
Email …………………………… 100 characters
URL ……………………………… 1000 characters
Comment ……………………. 1000 characters

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the ICM application administrator will hit the column size limitation, s/he needs to edit the length of the data file that needs to be imported.
