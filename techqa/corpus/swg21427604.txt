Text:
stalls; fails; freeze; pause TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running a silent mode installation of InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for WebSphere Application Server and Oracle 10G database hangs without showing errors in the console. 

SYMPTOM
The user starts the silent mode installation by using a response file: 

 

 * install.bin -i silent -f MDM_ResponseFile_2.res


The installation appears to hang indefinitely after displaying the initial silent installation information message. No error messages appear after this. The only text in the console is: 
 * bash-3.00$ install.bin -i silent -f MDM_ResponseFile_2.res
 * 
 * Preparing to install...

 * ---------------------------------------------------


The user can close the terminal or kill the process to end the stalled installation. 
CAUSE
The hang in the installation is caused by an automatic check for db2level when running a silent installation with Oracle. The check will not resolve, and the installation hangs as a result.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, take the following steps: 

 

1. Suppress the db2level check by adding the following line to the response file: 

 DB2VersionCheck=false 


 * 
 * DB2VersionCheck
 * 


2. Save the response file and run the installer again.
