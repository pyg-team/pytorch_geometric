Text:
xmlaccess; ReleaseBuilder TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
How can I determine the equivalent XMLAccess input for an action taken in an administrative portlet?

ANSWER
1. Export a release of the portal or virtual portal, depending upon where the administrative action will be taken. Use ExportRelease.xml as input to XMLAccess. Name the output release1.xml. 

2. Take the administrative action via the administrative portlet (e.g. Manage Pages). 

3. Export another release. Name it release2.xml. 

4. Use ReleaseBuilder to identify the difference between the two releases: 

ReleaseBuilder -inOld release1.xml -inNew release2.xml -out delta.xml 

5. Modify or generalize delta.xml as needed for future use.
