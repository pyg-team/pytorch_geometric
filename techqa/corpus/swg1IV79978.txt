APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During KQI install, the prereq-checker can not discover IIB 10
   if there is no previous Broker versions (7,8,9) installed.
   As a result, the prereq-checker reports a failed result.
   This problem only occurs on AIX and it can be ignored.
   
   Users Affected:
   WebSphere Message Broker Monitoring Agent users
   
   Environment:
   AIX. IIB 10 or higher version is installed without Broker 7,8 or
   9.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Skip the prereq checking and install the WebSphere Message
   Broker Monitoring Agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Agent installer pre-checker can not detect IIB 10. If
   IIB 10 is installed on system without previous versions (7,8,9),
   Pre-checker will get a failed result. This error can be ignored
   and skipped.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In case the incorrect pre-checker result is shown during agent
   install, we will remove the check for IIB 10. If Broker 7,8,9
   are not found, pre-checker will still return a successful
   result. The fix will be addressed in 7.3.0 FP2.
