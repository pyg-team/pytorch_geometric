PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to create an IBM WebSphere Portal 8 runtime with WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 8.5.x and Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) versions previous to 9.0.1 results in the error "Application Server Installation Directory Is Not Correct" when using "New Server Runtime Environment" wizard. 

SYMPTOM
The full error message is as follows:

Application Server Installation Directory Is Not Correct


Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Open any version of RAD from RAD 8.5.x to RAD 9.0.0, where the Portal 8.0.01/WAS 8.5.x configuration is supported 
 2. In RAD, go to Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments > Add 
 3. Select WebSphere Portal v8.0 from the dropdown list and click Next 
 4. Under WebSphere Portal Location, click Browse and point RAD to the Portal 8 installation directory. 
 5. Under WebSphere Application Server Location, click Browse and point RAD to the WAS 8.5.x server installation directory.
    
    You will see the error message in this wizard.


CAUSE
This error occurs because, while Portal 8/WAS 8.5.x is a supported configuration, the following configuration is not supported in RAD 8.5.x or RAD 9.0.0. RAD 9.0.1 and later versions will be supporting the following configuration.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are using RAD 9.0.0.x, upgrade to Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software 9.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036697] or later. 

 

Note: If you are using RAD 8.5.x, this is not a supported configuration. Either install RAD 9.0.1 or later or use the Portal 8/WAS 8.0.x configuration that is supported in RAD 8.5.x.
