APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Netcool/OMNIbus ODBC Gateway Reference Guide available from
   
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v8r1/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v8r1/index.jsp]
   
   states:
   
   "The Informix and DB2 versions of the ODBC Gateway do not
   support full data exchange with IBM Tivoli Netcool/Reporter."
   
   on page 4.
   
   This should only apply to Informix, as DB2 is supported for
   Reporter but Informix isn't.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None available.

   *                      does not support full data exchange     *
   *                      with IBM Tivoli Netcool/Reporter.  It   *
   *                      is only the Informix version of the     *
   *                      gateway that does not support full data *
   *                      exchange with IBM Tivoli                *
   *                      Netcool/Reporter.                       *

   ****************************************************************
   The reference to the DB2 versions of the ODBC Gateway as
   unsupported for full data exchange with IBM Tivoli
   Netcool/Reporter will be removed.
   
   The third sentence of the IBM Tivoli/Reporter topic in the
   Overview will be changed to:
   
   The Informix version of the ODBC Gateway does not support full
   data exchange with IBM Tivoli Netcool/Reporter.
