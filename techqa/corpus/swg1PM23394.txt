APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Resource rates are visible and editable in the staffing view: My
   Resources
   
   The Reg Cost/hr and Special Cost/hr fields are visible and
   editable in the My Resources tab of the staffing view by Project
   Managers without the appropriate security rights.
   See attached customer screenshot: cost_rates.jpg
   
   Found by customer on 7112ifix7
   Reproduced by TSE on 7112ifix11
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1) Create a resource pm01 with Portfolio Manager security role
   2) Set in Application Administration ? Security that the
   Portfolio Manager role has Resource Record ? Records of Other
   Resources ? Rates ? View and Edit both unchecked
   3) Login as pm01
   4) Create a proposal
   5) Go to the staffing view and search for a resource having
   rates
   6) Add the resource to My Resources
   7) Despite the security settings, rates are visible both on My
   Resources. They can also be edited, but the modifications seems
   not to be saved in the resource record.
   8) Note that opening the resource record, rates are correctly
   not visible as expected
   9) Also the WBS security setting for Project Group/Project
   Manager ? Staff Acquisition ? Cost/Rates ? Resource /Profile
   Rates ? View and Edit doesn't affect the visibility of the Rates
   in My Resources
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem is with missing security validation in My Resources tab
   in Staffing view
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Solution is to add Security validation that already exist in the
   other tabs in the top grid of the Rational Portfolio Manager GUI
   Search and assigned area, in order to keep consistency.
   
   Important comments:
   1. Rates in top grid in My Resources tab are not supposed to be
   editable. This grid is read only, like the rest of the top grids
   in other tabs in staffing view.
   2. Security mentioned in the description of the defect is
   Resource security and does not control Rate and Cost fields in
   the staffing view. These fields are controlled by Assignment
   security that can be found under Staff Acquisition -> Cost/Rates
   node in WBS security tab in Application Administration.
