APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENV: Redhat 6.9 x86-64, TWS 9.3 FP03 + IV97080 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV97080], TDWC 9.3 FP03
   (JazzSM 1.1.3 + Cumulative Fix 2 + WAS 8.5.5 FP11)
   
   Jobstream in EXEC shows "Running and EXEC" in DWC, change the
   priority to 0 (HOLD) and the jobstream still shows "Running and
   EXEC."
   Running 'planman resync' results in DWC showing "Held and EXEC".
   Recreated in the following envs:
     IWS 9.3 FP2 DWC 9.3 FP2
     IWS 9.3 FP3 DWC 9.3 FP3
     IWS 9.4 GA DWC 9.4 GA
     IWS 9.4 FP1 DWC 9.4 FP1
   
   Recreate scenario for "Running" vs. "Held" issue:
   
   1. Start a long running job:
    conman "sbd m93#\"sleep 10000\";alias=sleep10k;logon=m93"
   
   2. Change the priority of the JobStream to 0 via DWC.  Notice
   that the
   jobsteam in EXEC shows "Running and EXEC" - no change.  This is
   the
   issue.

   logs

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After the fix, changing the priority of a Job Stream in EXEC to
   '0' will change the status in HELD as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This apar will be fixed  9.3.0-TIV-TWS-FP0003 and
   9.4.0-TIV-TWS-FP0002
