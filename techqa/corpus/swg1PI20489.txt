APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In this scenario the userid attempting to login to RDZ server
   from RDZ
   client did not have access to the FEKAPPL RACF class. However
   the error
   message provided to the client was misleading.
   
   If the authentication is by userid and password, the message
   indicates that the
   password is revoked.
   
   If the authentication is by certificate, the message indicates
   that the certificate is revoked.
   
   Example message when authentication is by userid and password:
   "Failed to connect to the daemon with an unexpected exception:
   server failure: server failure:
   password revoked. Make sure the daemon is running on port xxxx"
   
   
   A proper error message in this case would be:
   "Failed to connect to the daemon with an unexpected exception:
   server failure: User xxxxxx
   has insufficient permission to profile FEKAPPL in the APPL
   class. RACROUTE AUTH
   returned SAF return code 8 - RACF return code =16 RACF reason
   code =8 "

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.When RDz user does not have RACF     *
   *                         access to the APPL class, the        *
   *                         response said "USERID is revoked"    *
   *                         when using a password, and "Invalid  *
   *                         Certificate" in using a              *
   *                         certificate. The error message in    *
   *                         the client dialog is quite           *
   *                         misleading.                          *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.When RDz user does not have RACF access to the APPL class,
      the response said "USERID is revoked" when using a password,
      and "Invalid Certificate" in using a certificate. The error
      message in the client dialog is quite misleading.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Now, the following message will be shown when RDz user does
      not have RACF access to the APPL class: "server failure:
      User, userid has insufficient permission to profile FEKAPPL
      in the APPL class. RACROUTE AUTH returned SAF return code =
      nn - RACF return code = nn RACF reason code = nn"
