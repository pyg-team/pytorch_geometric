APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A lot of jobs(PIF jobs) which used JCL variables to modify AD
   run concurrently. But JV file was busy and couldn't get enque
    despite 15 retries.Error batch job got return code 8 with a
   message as below,
    EQQX268W Update rejected, data set used by another OPC/ESA func
   It looks like that request couldn't get enque despite 15
   retries which was thought to be failure because other jobs
   appeared to use JV file. There could be seen 93( uses jcl
   variables) jobs during 1 or 2 minutes period of time.
    Now customer wants to increase the number of ENQ retries in
   EQQGSENV for OPC 2.3.0 to prevent many jobs getting error
   in peak time.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users with heavy load of PIF programs.       *
   *                 FUNCTION=GS                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A PIF application updating an OPC       *
   *                      database record failed.                 *
   *                      Its message log contained MSGEQQX268W,  *
   *                      indicating that an OPC batch program    *
   *                      was using the file in update mode.      *
   *                      Also dialog users may get message       *
   *                      EQQX268W, or EQQX267W, and the record   *
   *                      update is not saved.                    *
   *                      The problem occurred for JCL and for    *
   *                      JCL Variable table record updates.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY THE PTF FIXING THIS APAR               *
   ****************************************************************
   When several PIF programs were submitted within a couple of
   minutes an update request may be locked out due to the locking
   mechanism used. In General Service before starting an update
   request to a database record an ENQ lock of type ADUPD must be
   taken to prevent from updating the vsam file while a batch
   program is using it, like the daily planning programs.
   However if several read requests are coming while an request
   is waiting for updating the same record type the read requests
   may lock out the update request as each read request starts
   immediately as long as the update request has not started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A longer ENQ retry time is set for pif programs, 3 minutes.
   Dialog requests will retry up to 1 minute.
   The checking for lock availability is changed to each 0.3
   second from the previous each 6:th second.
   For JCL Variable table updates the ENQs are done without
   parameter ret(USE) as scope is STEP and the ENQs serialize
   within the Controller only and not for batch jobs.
   JCL record handling is changed in same way as JCL variable
   tables.
