APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If one or more Virtual Machines (VM) fail in a virtual system
   deployment but then recover, the deployment health status will
   be shown as "Running but with error (Workload agent failure)"
   
   Even if you stop and restart the deployment the status does not
   change.  The deployment health status should change if a
   virtual machine recovers from an initial error and be
   displayed correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The virtual system deployment watcher code should be enabled to
   detect when an initial error condition in a virtual machine has
   been resolved and initiate a new check to update the deployment
   health status.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been updated to detect certain health status
   transitions to improve recovery detection.
