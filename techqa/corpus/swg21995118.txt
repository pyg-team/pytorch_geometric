VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2178 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/113889] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6303 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6303]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function. By using unknown attack vectors, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117023] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6304]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By repeatedly requesting renegotiation, a remote authenticated attacker could send an overly large OCSP Status Request extension to consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117110] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-6306 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6306]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by missing message length checks when parsing certificates. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117112] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-5983 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5983]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code with a serialized object from untrusted sources. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116468 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116468] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-5986 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5986]
DESCRIPTION: IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of responses under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain server identification information.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116556 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116556] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-6042 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6042]
DESCRIPTION: IBM AppScan Enterprise Edition could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by improper handling of objects in memory. By persuading a victim to open specially-crafted content, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system in the same context as the victim.
CVSS Base Score: 8.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117108 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117108] for the current score
