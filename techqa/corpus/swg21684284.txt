Title: IBM Rulerunner intermittently cannot write file with Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Intermittently batches abort when run in Rulerunner. A check of the rrs log shows an error like the following:

04:25:27.776 (0) t:1F50 p:BC0768 warning! couldn't save dco;
DCO err:Error writting in file \\DatacapServer\BatchesFolder\Batches\20140811.000527\Rulerunner.xml; 

CAUSE
Rulerunner performs many file I/O operations very quickly. If there are a sufficient number of threads and/or Rulerunner servers running simultaneously, this can overwhelm the file system. This is particularly true with NAS or SAN servers, as they are also processing file I/O requests from many other locations.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Reduce the load on the file system. Some possible methods include: 

 1. Reduce the number of threads running on the Rulerunner servers or reduce the total number of Rulerunner servers running simultaneously. 
 2. Reduce or turn off logging. In particular, make sure any Log Reflush options are unchecked. 
 3. Move the batches folder to a location that can handle a higher volume of file I/O.
