Title: IBM Renewing an expired SSL certificate for the Sametime Gateway - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
How do you replace an expired SSL certificate on the Sametime Gateway? 

SSL/TLS certificates are used on the Gateway to associate trust between external instant messaging services. These certificates have an expiration date when they no longer can provide the associated trust.


ANSWER
The Sametime Gateway application uses the WebSphere Application Server Java keystores to maintain the SSL/TLS certificates. You have the following options when replacing the expired certificate: 

 * Create a new certificate request 
 * Receive a renewed certificate request from your CA


More information on each option is provided below. 



Create a new certificate request 

Create a new certificate request and apply that certificate by following the procedures in the Sametime product documentation: 

For a single server > Requesting a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/sametime/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.help.sametime.v85.doc/config/config_gw_ssl_request_cert.html] 

For a cluster server> Creating a certificate request [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/sametime/v8r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.help.sametime.v85.doc/config/config_gw_ssl_request_cert_clus.html]





Receive a renewed certificate request from your CA 

You can receive a renewed certificate from your certificate authority (CA) without recreating the request by using these steps: 

 1.  Locate the keystore in use  1.  For a single server the keystore (key.p12 or STGWKS.p12) will be located in the following directory path:
        
        \WebSphere\Appserver\profiles\[RTCGWServer]\config\cells\[CellName]\nodes\[NodeName] 
     2. For a cluster the keystore (key.p12 or STGWKS.p12) will be located in the following directory path:
        
        \WebSphere\Appserver\profiles\[RTCGWServer]\config\cells\[CellName]\nodes\[SIP Proxy Node Name]
    
    
 2. Load IBM Key Manager, iKeyman, by running the following script:
    
    \WebSphere\Appserver\bin\ikeyman.bat
    
    
 3. Once loaded, click open, then change the keystore type to PKCS12, and browse to the keystore you located above. The default keystore password is "WebAS"; you will need to enter this password to open the keystore.
    
 4. Once the keystore is opened within ikeyman, you can "receive" the renewed certificate that was delivered by your CA. This step can be achieved by selecting the "Receive" button and browsing to the renewed certificate on the file system.
    
 5. Next confirm that you successfully received the renewed certificate by selecting "View Details" within ikeyman. This task shows you the validity of the certificate so that you can confirm that the expired certificate has been replaced with the renewed certificate.
    
 6. Launch the Integrated Solutions Console for the Sametime Gateway server, and navigate to the SSL Configurations.
    
    Security -> SSL certificate and key management -> Manage Endpoint Security configurations  1. For a single server select the inbound node name (for example, STGWNode)
        
        For a cluster expand the ProxyNode and select the SIPProxyServer
        
        Screen capture of SIPProxyServer node:
        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21442836&amp;aid=1] 
     2. You will be brought to "Specific SSL configurations for this endpoint." Do not change anything on this page; simply select "Update certificate aliases." This step loads the newly received certificate into memory. 
     3. Repeat this procedure on the outbound node on the Manage Endpoint Security configurations page.
    
    
 7. Now your Sametime Gateway has been configured to use your renewed certificate. In some cases, it might be required to restart the environment.
