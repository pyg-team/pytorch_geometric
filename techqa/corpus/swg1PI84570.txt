PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender Map Analyzer (Design Studio,
   mcompile) users
   
   Problem Description:
   Map Analyzer fails map compilation of a map during map analysis
   due improper handling of expression types used in functions like
   TEXT in the map rules which lead to M113 error.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed a problem with Map Analyzer where it now analyzes map
   rules properly instead of reporting an M113 error when a numeric
    or text expression is provided for a function like TEXT as an
   argument.
