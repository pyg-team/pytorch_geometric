QUESTION
 How do I delete the job configuration files ( job_*_conf.xml ) generated in the JobTracker local directory? 

CAUSE

Typically, JobTracker is designed as a long running process (> several months) but if hadoop is restarted, it does not delete the configuration files that were created by an older run of hadoop job tracker. So a simple shell script or a cron job is recommended to remove any leftover configuration files after a restart of JobTracker.

For example:

find $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/hadoop/logs -type f -mtime +3 -name "job_*_conf.xml" -delete


ANSWER
 

There are two configuration parameters which control the deletion of the job configuration XML files:

1. mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval: Default value is 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 (1 Day). 

That means the files are deleted one day after the jobs are completed by default.

2. mapred.jobtracker.completeuserjobs.maximum: Number of completed jobs to keep on per user basis. Default value is 100.

You can change either one of them (or both) with less values.

For example, set mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval to 360000 (one hour) in mapred-site.xml.
