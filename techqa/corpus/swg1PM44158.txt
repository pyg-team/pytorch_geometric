APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are working with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0.0.1 and created
   output. In the output viewer you click on Page attributes and
   try to enter multiple rows in header and footer with different
   fonts, font size and different alignment of the single rows
   (e.g. one row left justified, the other centered and so on).
   However, for the header it seems that you cannot justify the
   lines on page attributes dialog. It seems they all stick on the
   left.
   When you click on OK and go to print preview however, you will
   notice that the header rows are justified in the way you defined
   whereas you will notice that there are no multiple rows
   displayed for the footer.
   Also the font settings and size are not reflected on the footer
   but on header.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development and is expected to be
   resolved with 19.0.0.2 FixPack.
