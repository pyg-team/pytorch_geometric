COMMENTS
 *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   Section view A-A is created with some bold lines.
   
    CORRECT APPLICATION:
   The thick lines represent a non visible pattern (the pitch is
   great compared with the size of the area to be patterned, so
   so that it is not visible).
   The pitch of the two hatchings of the pattern has to be
   decreased and then the thickness of the line will be correct.
