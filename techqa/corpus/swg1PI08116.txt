APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ClearQuest 8.0.0.6 and 8.0.0.8
   Internet Explorer 10
   I tested with Internet Explorer 10.0.12
   This problem does not happen in Internet Explorer 11 but the
   client cannot upgrade to 11 because 10 is their company standard
   
   When creating or editing a query on the Web, you cannot use your
   mouse to select the scroll bar to the right of the field list
   and move it up and down.  You can use your scroll wheel to
   scroll in the list, you can select an empty place and right
   click on the scroll area and the bar will move and the field
   list will scroll but you can't select the bar with the mouse and
   move the bar with the mouse.
   
   I'll attach a document with a screen print.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  IE9 is currently supported with this release of ClearQuest Web,
   please use IE9 as a temporary workaround.
