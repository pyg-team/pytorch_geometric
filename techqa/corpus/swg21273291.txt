QUESTION
 What information should you collect when you receive an error in the form "Java VM exit=NN"? 

CAUSE
Any error of the general form "Java JVM exit=NN" means the Javaâ„¢ VM (JVM) involved crashed.

ANSWER
When a JVM crashes, it will leave behind various dump files. 


There are three types of dump files that can be generated:


 * javacores, 
 * snap traces, 
 * core dumps.


You may not have all three. 

Javacores are text files which contain information about the state of the JVM when it crashed. 

They are called 
javacore.<date>.<time>.<pid>.txt 

For example : javacore.20080304.1002.1224.txt. 
his was written on 2008/03/04 at 10:02 AM, and the JAVA VM was running under process id (pid) 1224. 

Snap traces contain "flight recorder" data from the JVM -- information about what the JVM was doing in the moments prior to the crash. 

They are called 
SnapNNN.<date>.<time>.<pid>.trc 

For example: Snap001.20080705.1112.1234.trc. 
This was written on 2008/07/05 at 11:12 AM, and the JAVA VM was running under process id (pid) 1234. 

Core dumps contain the complete process memory space at the time of the crash. 
The JVM does its own crash dump processing and produces core dumps called 
core.<date>.<time>.<pid>.dmp. 

The core dump needs to be processed with a tool called jextract (or j9jextract) to gather information needed to analyze it properly on other machines. 

For Java releases 1.2.x, 1.3.x, and 1.4.x : use "j9jextract" if the J9 VM was used, otherwise use jextract. 
For Java 1.5 and above, the "J9" JVM engine is the standard; use the supplied jextract program. 

The directions that follow will only refer to j9jextract, in the interest of brevity. 

To process a core file, find the j9jextract.exe file in the JVM install directory. 

Rational Application Developer v6 ==> Crash files in <RAD6-INSTALL-DIR>\eclipse\jre ; 
j9jextract will be available as <RAD6-INSTALL-DIR>\eclipse\jre\bin\j9jextract.exe 

Rational Application Developer v7 ==> Crash files in <RAD7-INSTALL-DIR>\jdk\jre\bin ; 
j9jextract will be available as <RAD7-INSTALL-DIR>\jdk\jre\bin\j9jextract.exe 

For WTE (or WebSphere Application Server) Java VM crashes: 
Crash files in <WAS-INSTALL-DIR>\java\bin ; 
j9jextract will be available as <WAS-INSTALL-DIR>\java\jre\bin\j9jextract.exe 

Then run 
j9extract core.<date>.<time>.<pid>.dmp. 

This will produce a file called 
core.<date>.<time>.<pid>.dmp.xml 

which contains the original core file, system libraries and other data collected from the machine the crash 
happened on. The j9jextract utility will be found in the directory containing the JRE running when the JVM crashed. 

So, when you get a Java VM Exit type error you should find any: 
 * javacore files 
 * snap trace files 
 * core dumps ( and process them with j9jextract, if possible)


ZIP them up, and send them to IBM Support. 

The files will almost certainly be too big to e-mail. 

You will have to FTP them, following one of the procedures outlined in the document titled Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support [http://ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html] .
