Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have migrated my License Manager to a new host. How do I change/convert my existing License Manager client(s) to the new host. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM SPSS desktop products acquire their licensing information from the 'DaemonHost' configuration value found in the 'spssprod.inf' file located in the installation directory of product. 

Follows is a list of the default location of the 'spssprod.inf' file. 

Note 1: Replace <prodname> with the actual product name (examples: Statistics, Modeler, Amos)
Note 2: Replace <vernum> with the one-digit or two-digit product version number (examples: 18, 24, 3).

Windows - SPSS Modeler
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\<vernum>\bin\

Windows - All Other SPSS Products
C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\<prodname>\<vernum>\

Mac OS - SPSS Statistics
/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/<vernum>/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents/bin

Mac OS - Modeler
/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Modeler/<vernum>/Modeler.app/Contents/bin

Linux OS - Statistics
/opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/<vernum>/bin

To migrate a License Manager client installation to a different License Manager
(1) Open file 'spssprod.inf' in a simple text editor (example: Notepad, TextEdit, nano)
(2) Locate the 'DaemonHost' configuration variable.
(3) Change the value after the 'equals' sign (=) to the new License Manager network identifier (IP address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name of the License Manager host).
(4) Save file 'spssprod.inf'

If you wish to perform a mass migration of existing License Manager clients to a new License Manager host:
(1) Perform the procedure in in 'To migrate a License Manager client installation to a different License Manager'.
(2) Use the edited 'spssprod.inf' file as an exemplar and replace the 'spssprod.inf' file on existing License Manager clients with the exemplar.
