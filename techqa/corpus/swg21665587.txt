PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote describes a user interface issue that may be observed with multiple versions of Internet Explorer. 

SYMPTOM
If an administrator selects the Admin tab in the user interface (UI), they may not be able to navigate to other tabs until the browser configuration is updated. 

This issue is linked to a display issue when the browser setting for Document mode is configured to an incorrect value. 

 

Additional symptoms: administrators might notice that text typically located on the right-hand side of the screen is displayed much farther left than expected. 

 

Text displayed incorrectly in Internet Explorer 8:

This issue has also been reported by administrators who use a Group Policy Object that restricts or sets the Document mode in Internet Explorer to an incorrect version. 


CAUSE
An incorrect Document Mode value is configured in Internet Explorer.
