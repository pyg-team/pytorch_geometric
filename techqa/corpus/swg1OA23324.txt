PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All OMEGAMON II for CICS users.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When attempting to initialize OMEGAMON  *
   *                      in CICS, message 'OC1144 EXEN PROCESS   *
   *                      ENABLE TRUE I' is issued and OMEGAMON   *
   *                      is not initialized in that region.      *
   *                      Following that any attempts to          *
   *                      initialize/terminate OMEGAMON fail      *
   *                      with message.  OC1014 OCOMEG BYPASS     *

   ****************************************************************
   A previous attempt to remove OMEGAMON from the region
   failed because one of the OMEGAMON exits was being
   accessed by another task.  This caused the exit to remain
   in an enabled state.  Further attempts to initialize
   OMEGAMON fail because the exit is already enabled.  Once this
   occurs processing of OMEGAMON commands is bypassed until the
   CICS region is recycled.
   
   On OMEGAMON removal, storage used by OMEGAMON exits is being
   freed before the exits have been disabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  OMEGAMON remove processing was changed to wait and then retry
   disabling exits that are being accessed by another task.  If
   after several retries the exit is still being accessed
   OMEGAMON will revert to a state as if an OMEG SHUT had
   occurred.
   
   Code was changed to ensure that upon OMEGAMON removal all
   OMEGAMON exits are disabled prior to releasing storage
   acquired for their usage.
   
   The following new messages were added to the product.
   
   OC1038 GLUE|TRUE IN USE, OMEGAMON II CANNOT BE DE-INSTALLED
   
   Explanation: The OMEGAMON TRUE or GLUE was in use at the time
   that an OMEG REMOVE was being performed.
   
   System Action: The TRUE or GLUE is not removed and OMEGAMON
   is reset to a status as if an OMEG SHUT had been performed.
   
   User Response: Retry the remove and if the problem persists
   contact OMEGAMON support.  An OMEG INIT can be performed to
   restart OMEGAMON functions using the previously loaded code.
   
   OC1039 DE-INSTALL HALTED BECAUSE OF INTERNAL OMEGAMON ERROR
   
   Explanation: OMEGAMON encountered an error during removal
   that it could not recover from.
   
   System Action: OMEGAMON is not removed from the CICS region.
   
   User Response: Contact OMEGAMON support.
