PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are using VSAMREC and receive an error stating that an allocation of a DDNAME failed. VSAMREC is the name of a list command and line operator that can be issued from the ISMF data set list. It is a function of CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR). 

CAUSE
A data set allocation in VSAMREC might be specified incorrectly or the data set might not exist or might not be cataloged.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Enter VSAMREC with the list parameter to create a list of every command (or subcommand) executed by VSAMREC along with any information messages that are issued:


VSAMREC LIST(YES) 

This will help you determine the cause of the allocation error. In addition, you can enter the ISRDDN command from ISPF to display a list of current data sets allocated to your current TSO sessions. ISRDDN [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.f54ug00/addn.htm] is a built-in TSO service that lets you examine your dataset allocations.
