Title: IBM Check SSL/TLS communication status in Tivoli Storage Manager - United States

Text:
TSM SSL TLS12 ANR8592I ANR0406I TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to check if the communication between Client and Server is SSL/TLS protected? 

SYMPTOM
When SSL/TLS is configured correctly in the Tivoli Storage Manager Client / Server there is no 

immediate message that would confirm that the SSL/TLS protocol is used for communication.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are several ways to check if the communication between Client and Server is SSL/TLS protected: 

1. Check the activity log on the Tivoli Storage Manager Server and look for message ANR8592I and ANR0406I. The messages indicate the protocol and the cypher being used for the connection. 

For example, in a Tivoli Storage Manager environment set up for communication via TLS12, the following messages are issued in the activity log after a successful Tivoli Storage Manager client connection: 

ANR8592I Session 8 connection is using SSL version TLSV12, cipher specification AES-256 certificate serial number 3c:63:60:96:cf:a2:23:19. 
ANR0406I Session 8 started for node RH64TSM71 (Linux x86-64) (SSL 10.0.2.15(36290)).

The message ANR8592I states the used protocol SSL/TLS12 with Cypher AES-256 and the message ANR0406I confirms that a session using the SSL protocol has been started successfully.

2. Running a "query session" on Client side.
For example here we have a TLS12 secured communication:
[root@rh64tsm71 bin]# dsmc q session
...

3. Running a "query session f=d" command on the Tivoli Storage Manager Server.

For example here a sesison SSL protected on the TivolI Storage Manager Server:
tsm: RH64TSM71>q session f=d
