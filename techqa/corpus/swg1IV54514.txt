APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Lotus Mobile Connect 6.1.4
   Using HTTP Access with IBM Notes Traveler
   The LTPA token lifetime is set to a low value like 10 minutes.
   It appears that there are times when LMC is not recognizing an
   expired LTPA token and sends on a request from a Traveler
   Cllient (most likely Android based) to IBM Domino / Traveler.
   Domino recignizes the token as being expired and sends back an
   HTTP 401 authentication challenge which the device responds to,
   but when it gets to IMC since it is on an existing session LMC
   joins the request to the existing session and uses the token
   again which repeats and results in a Authentication Popup
   message to the end user device.  This scenario repeats for a
   small amount of time, but it would appear to the end user like
   their credentials are not being accepted even though they are
   valid.  After a minute or two LMC detects the expired token and
   recovers, but the user may have given up by this time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set a longer LTPA Token life time within the Authentication
   Profile associated with the HTTP Access Service on LMC.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: IMC configured to use LTPA tokens in the     *
   *                 Authentication Method.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: IMC not recognizing an expired LTPA     *
   *                      token due to clock skew.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update to IMC build containing this apar.    *
   ****************************************************************
   Added a dead zone window of 90 seconds to address clock
   differences between Domino server and IMC server.  If clocks
   are in sync, this is not an issue.
