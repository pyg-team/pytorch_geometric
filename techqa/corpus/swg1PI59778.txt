APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have successfully installed IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 (or IBM
   SPSS Modeler 18) and
   applied the Trial license (default behavior for all installs)
   Now you would like to associate your IBM SPSS Statistics client
   with an existing Sentinel RMS License Manager.
   You launch statistics 24.0 and see the welcome screen.  You
   click the  "License Product" button and supply your license
   manager's hostname or IP address.  You click "Next" and see this
   error:  "The License Server provided is invalid"
   
   WORKAROUND:
   The License Activation Wizard (LAW) tool is trying to 'ping' the
   license manager server to verify it exists.  If port 7 TCP is
   blocked by firewall, or configured not to answer, the above
   error will result.
   
   To work around this, manually edit the 'spssprod.inf' file to
   redirect
   the "DaemonHost=" line to point to your license manager server
   either by hostname or IP address.
   Next, rename the file lservrc on installation directory or
   otherwise disable the local Trial license in 'lservrc' by adding
   a # before the ttial license code in LSERVRC file.
   
   These files can be found here by default:
   Windows -- "C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics \24"
   Mac --
   "/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/SPSSStatistics.app/Content
   s/bin"
   Linux -- "/opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/bin"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The 'License Server provided is invalid' for Statistics 24.0
   concurrent/network licensing clients was corrected in an
   updated version of the Statistics 24 desktop client uploaded on
   June 23, 2016.
   If you are encountering this behavior prior to a mass
   installation of the product using a version of the Statistics
   24.0 desktop client software downloaded prior to June 23, 2016,
   please download the updated version of the Statistics 24
   desktop client and use this version for your installations.
   If you are encountering this behavior after a mass installation
   of the product, there is a 'workaround' for this behavior:
   WORK-AROUND:
   Manually edit the 'DaemonHost' value in the 'spssprod.inf' file
   located in the Statistics 24.0 product installation directory
   to direct the client installation to the network identifier
   (hostname/IP) of the License Manager host.
   For products installed to the default installation directory,
   the location of the 'spssprod.inf' file is:
   Windows: C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics \24\
   Mac:
   /Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/SPSSStatistics.app/Contents
   /bin
   Linux: /opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/24/bin
   If you are performing a large-scale update using remote
   installation technology, you could create a exemplar
   'spssprod.inf' file with the correct values and add a procedure
   to the installation routine to replace the existing
   'spssprod.inf' file with exemplar.
