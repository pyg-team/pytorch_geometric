APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using side channel timing based analysis it might be possible to
   decrypt a secret SSL/TLS session key of a sniffed session of a
   DataPower device.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower appliances might be subject to side channel timing
   based attacks resulting in the decryption of an SSL/TLS secured
   transaction.  The attack can only be performed if the attacker
   is on the same LAN network as the DataPower device.  The
   attacker has to send several million requests to DataPower and
   monitor the response times for each of these messages in order
   to recover the PreMasterSecret used in the SSL/TLS
   communication.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.17, 6.0.0.9, 6.0.1.5 and 7.0.0.2.
