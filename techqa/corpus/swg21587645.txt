QUESTION
 
When you click the top-level Transaction Reporter node in the TEP Navigator tree, the default Transaction Reporter workspace does not display in the TEP or the KFWITM575E error message displays. How do you display this workspace? 

CAUSE

This issue has been identified as a product defect under the following APAR:

APAR IV03319 REPORTER TRANSACTIONS OVERVIEW WORKSPACE NOT VIEWABLE WITH SUN JRE 1.6.0_26 

This issue is caused by changes in the Sun/IBM Java runtime package. 

Starting in Sun JRE 1.6.0_26 and IBM Java 6.0 SR 9-FP02, the Java runtime package introduced a change in a class that the Transaction Reporter workspaces depend on for storing icons. This change breaks the ability of these workspaces to display. 

APAR IV03319, which resolves the issue, is included in 7.3.0.0-TIV-CAMTT-FP0001 and 7.3.0.1-TIV-CAMTT-IF0020,



ANSWER
 

In ITCAM for Transactions 7.3, the default Transaction Reporter workspace does not display when you click the top-level Transaction Reporter node in the TEP Navigator tree. However, you can right-click this node and select other workspaces from the pop-up menu. 

Note: The default workspaces for the other ITCAM for Transactions agents display correctly.

In addition, in ITM 6.2.3 FP01 and ITM 6.2.2 FP08, when you click the top-level Transaction Reporter node in the TEP Navigator tree, a blank workspace displays, or the KFWITM575E error message displays. 

If the KFWITM575E error message displays, click Yes to delete the damaged workspace.

To restore the damaged workspace, and correct this defect, install the following updates:

_ 7.3.0.0-TIV-CAMTT-FP0001
_ 7.3.0.1-TIV-CAMTT-IF0020

Note: IF0020 supersedes and replaces FP0001. If you have already installed FP0001, install IF0020 on top of FP0001. If you have not already installed FP0001, install IF0020 instead of FP0001.

Other Issues Resolved

The following issues are also resolved in updates 7.3.0.0-TIV-CAMTT-FP0001 and 7.3.0.1-TIV-CAMTT-IF0020.

_ All of the Transaction Tracking topology views in TEP workspaces under the Transaction Reporter node are empty or blank, but the Transaction Reporter lists the applications and transactions correctly in other workspaces.

_ The Topology View workspace displays the title 'Topology view', and the bottom part displays 'Total: 0 Selected: 0' and the workspace itself is blank.
