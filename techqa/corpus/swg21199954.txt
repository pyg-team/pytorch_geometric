PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The wsadmin tasks or any of the other server command-line tools might not work with the version 5.x WebSphere Test Environments installed with WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD) version 5.x or Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software version 6.x. 

CAUSE
Usage of any of the WebSphere Application Server command-line tools such as wsadmin is not supported with the version 5.x WebSphere Test Environments.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Support summary for the version 5.x WebSphere Test Environments: 

 * The WebSphere Test Environments (WTE) are a subset of the full WebSphere Application Servers (WAS) and are used for local testing. They are not intended (or licensed) for stand-alone use. 
 * The WAS command-line tools in the WTEs are not intended for development use. 
 * The WAS Administrative Console packaged as part of the WTE is not supported, and hence activities like setting up LDAP are also not supported.


The use of the wsadmin tasks, or any of the WebSphere Application Server command-line utilities packaged with the version 5.x WebSphere Test Environment in WSAD and Rational Application Developer are not supported. It is possible to try to modify the scripts to point to the correct directories, since some of the structures are changed as part of the integration into WSAD version 5.x or Rational Application Developer version 6.x/v7.0, however, there is no guarantee that this will work. 

The product documentation does not state that the use of wsadmin is supported. These stand-alone server features might function correctly most of the time in the WebSphere Test Environment, but they are not officially supported. 

Note - Remote WTE/WAS v5.x servers: 
The same server security restrictions apply when testing with a remote WebSphere Application Server v5.x using WTE v5.x. For more information on remote WTE v5.1 usage, consult this technote under the Related Information section: 
Remote WebSphere Application Server version 5.x configuration with WebSphere Test Environment version 5.x , and the articles it references. Naturally you can make changes in the admin console for a remoter server , but the technote stresses do this once and continue to use the WTE v5.x environment after that for further changes and so forth. 


Rational Application Developer version 6.x or v7.x with WebSphere Test Environment version 6.x: 

When using the Rational Application Developer version 6.x/7.x - WebSphere Test Environment version 6 or v7 (starting with Rational Application Developer v7.5), the Administrative Console, LDAP security, and command lines tools are supported. When using the WAS version 6.x or v7.0 runtime, the WAS Administrative Console replaces the WTE server configuration editor for administering the version 6 or v7 servers. 

Note: Rational Application Developer v7.0 only provides WTE v5.1 and Rational Application Developer v7.5+ no longer provides WTE v5.x.
