APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is possible to cut, copy, and paste actions from one activity
   diagram to another in the diagrams.
   
   These options are available in the browser, but they don't do
   anything.  As an example, one can select an action, right click,
   and Cut or Copy are available options.  Go to another diagram in
   the Browser, right click, Paste is an available option.  Doing
   this results in nothing happening.
   
   If you right-click in a diagram, after using Cut or Copy on an
   action in the Browser, the option to Paste is grayed out.
   
   Either the edit functions should work, or they should not be
   available
   for selection.
