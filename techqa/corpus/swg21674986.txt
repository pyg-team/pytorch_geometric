Title: IBM Saving reports on file systems - United States

Text:
file system directory folder output report save tcr birt cognos tcr TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I have output of reports produced directly on a specific directory of TCR system? 

ANSWER
The report outputs are saved within the Cognos Content Store by default for both BIRT and Cognos.
There are anyway two procedures to configure Cognos Engine to produce the reports directly on the file system.

The first one allows to work at report level, but it is valid only for Cognos reports.
It means, you can decide which is the report that can be saved in the Cognos content store and the reports that will be saved on the file system.

The second procedure configures Cognos to save all the executed reports on the file system instead, and this works also for BIRT reports. 

The first procedure is described here:

The second procedure is the following:

1) Start IBM Cognos Configuration
2) Click Data Access and then Content Manager
3) Select True for "Save report output to a file system"
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=1]

4) Save and exit from Cognos Configuration.
Restart TCR.

5) On TCR GUI, select Launch---> Administration.
6) Select System and from the All Server drop down menu, select Services and then Content Manager

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=2]

7) From ContentManagerService drop down menu, select "Set Properties"

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21674986&aid=3]

8) Select Settings tab and then click Edit on "Advanced Settings" row.
9) Put the parameter name: "CM.OUTPUTLOCATION" in the Parameter column and a fully qualified path in the Value column.
This is the directory where the reports will be saved.
10) Click OK and run your reports.
They will be now saved on the File System under the path you specified on step 9.
