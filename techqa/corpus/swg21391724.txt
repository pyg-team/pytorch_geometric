QUESTION
 How can I flush out old entries in the MQ Series Events workspace for channels or queues that no longer exist? 

ANSWER
The MQSeries Events workspace displays data from the Current Events attribute group. Since this data is stored in memory, stopping and restarting the MQ Monitoring agent will clear all the data in the Current Events table.
