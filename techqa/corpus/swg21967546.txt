QUESTION
 Is there an ITCAM demo application that I can use with a monitored WebSphere Liberty Profile? 

ANSWER

Yes, there's an Application written by our Dev/L3 that you can use to monitor a WebSphere Liberty Profile. Here's how you can download and use it. 

1. First get the application from this link:
http://ausgsa.ibm.com/home/f/l/flivits/web/public/TestSoftware/ [http://ausgsa.ibm.com/home/f/l/flivits/web/public/TestSoftware/]
- download "Demo4LibertyDerby.zip" from the above link.

This is an IBM Internal only site, the application is IBM Non-Confidential. So if you are an IBM external customer and want to get this demo application, then send me an email at nalewis@us.ibm.com and I will put it out on an ftp server for you to download. (Or please provide feedback at the bottom of this technote.)

(Note: This is NOT a supported application but works great if you wish to demo an application with ITCAM and the monitored WAS Liberty profile.)

2. Install the WAS Liberty Profile, then unzip the above zip file into the ..\usr\servers directory. This is how it looks after you unzip the file.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=1]

3. The server is now already installed for you. All you have to do is start it. Use the 'server' command to start (or stop) the Demo4LibertyDerby server.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=2]

4. Go ahead and configure the new Demo4LibertyDerby server with the APM WAS agent DC v7.3.0.9 or higher, and restart the server again after configuration.

5. After you restart the server, the application will start on port 9044. So simply point your browser to this port 9044, the application will start as shown here. [http://localhost:9044/ITCAM/Demo]
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21967546&aid=3]

6. You can now use the above browser application to do things like Memory Leaks, Heap Size manipulation, Java Object Generator, Method/Stack traces, JSP Requests, etc.. etc.. Try some transactions out using the above browser application, then login to your APM server side GUI and see if you get the transactions show up there. [http://%3chost%3e:9044/ITCAM/Demo]
