CAUSE
The Application Pool that Controller was using was on an incorrect version of .NETFramework.
In one specific example, Customer was having issues with CDM and to resolve the issue. .NETFramework V4.0 was registered through CMD which caused all Application Pools (including the Controller Application Pool) to change its .NETFramework version to V4.0
Below is the screenshot with the INCORRECT configuration.
