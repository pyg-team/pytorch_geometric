APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The file wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear should include only these 2 archive
   files:
   
     WMQ_IVT.war
     WMQ_IVT_MDB.jar
   
   However, from IBM MQ 8.0.0.3, the ear file erroneously included
   the following .jar files from the MQ classes for JMS:
   
     com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
     com.ibm.mqjms.jar
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete the following .jar archive files from the file
   wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear :
   
     com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
     com.ibm.mqjms.jar
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ V8.0.0.3, V8.0.0.4 or
   V8.0.0.5 installation verification test program for the IBM MQ
   resource adapter.
   
   This issue does not affect the IBM MQ V9 installation
   verification test program.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The installation verification test program for the IBM MQ
   resource adapter is supplied as an enterprise archive (EAR) file
   called wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear.  A packaging error introduced from IBM
   MQ V8.0.0.3 resulted in the following two MQ classes for JMS
   .jar files erroneously being included within the EAR:
   
     com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
     com.ibm.mqjms.jar
   
   These two MQ classes for JMS client jar files should not have
   been included in the wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear package.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The build and packaging process for the installation
   verification test program for the IBM MQ resource adapter has
   been updated to ensure that the com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar and
   com.ibm.mqjms.jar MQ classes for JMS client jars are not
   included within the  wmq.jmsra.ivt.ear enterprise archive file.
