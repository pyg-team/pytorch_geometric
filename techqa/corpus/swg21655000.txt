Title: IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine - No target servlet configured for uri - error displayed when trying to access ACCE - United States

Text:
acce; logon; No target servlet configured TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Content Platform Engine -"No target servlet configured for uri" error displayed when trying to access ACCE 

SYMPTOM
When FileNet Content Platform Engine is deployed in IBM Websphere, attempts to access the Administrative Console for Content Engine (ACCE) results in the following error message being displayed instead of the form logon : 

com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.exception.NoTargetForURIException: No target servlet configured for uri: 


When accessing the Content Engine Ping Page ( /FileNet/Engine ) or the Content Engine Health Servlet (/P8CE/Health ) only text may be displayed ( no images or other Cascading Style Sheets formatting ). 


CAUSE
This behavior is observed if the IBM Websphere web container custom property fileServingEnabled is set to 'false'. ACCE needs access to various image, CSS, Javascript assets in order to function. Unless a Web Server has been configured host all these assets and all access by clients is made through the web server, attempting to access ACCE by going directly through the web container port will fail. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

To resolve the issue:



 1. Access the IBM Websphere Admin Console 
    
    
 2. Application servers
    
    
 3. <<servername>>
    
    
 4. Web container
    
    
 5. Custom properties 
    
    
 6. Set the fileServingEnabled custom property to 'true'
    
    
 7. Restart the respective JVM.
