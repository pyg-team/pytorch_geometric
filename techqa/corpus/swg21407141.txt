SYMPTOM
DFHTD0101I [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhtd/TD0101I.html] Transient Data initialization has ended.
DFHAP0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0001.html] An abend (code 0C4/AKEA [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/AKxx_abend_codes/AKEA.html]) has occurred at offset X'FFFFFFFF' in module DFHRCEX.
DFHAP0002 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0002.html] A severe error (code X'0516') has occurred in module DFHAPAC.
DFHSI1521 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsi/SI1521.html] CICS unable to continue for reasons given above.


CAUSE
You are running with an old version of the ASG-TMON for CICS TS for z/OS startup program.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Reviewing the dump taken on the DFHSI152 message, you find that the abend 0C4 actually occurred in TMON module TM8N960 at offset x'3992'. The module header looked like:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure you have the correct version of TMON in the startup PLTPI. You can also remove TMON from the PLTPI until you can find the correct version. 

In this particular case, ASG (TMON) support confirmed the problem was due to having an old version of the TMON startup (PLTPI) program. TM8N680 was being used and caused the error, but TM2N680 should have been used instead.
