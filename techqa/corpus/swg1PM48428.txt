APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading to ITCAM for Application Diagnostics 7.1,
   summarization is failing.  This also applies to ITCAM for
   WebSphere 6.1.
   
   ODI file changes were made in ITCAM to use alternate timestamp
   column, what caused that Summarization & Prunning agent stops to
   use ITM internal, not null column WRITETIME, what causes an
   error during each update of summariozation tables.
   
   A technote and workaround needed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Technote
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449755 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449755]
   was written for the same problem occurring with ITCAM for
   Transactions and can be used as a model for what needs to be
   done for ITCAM for Application Diagnostics and ITCAM for
   WebSpere - WebSphere Agent.
