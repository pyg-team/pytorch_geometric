APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you use IBM Process Designer V8.5.7 to model an error
   boundary event and select Catch Specific Errors in the error
   properties, specifying an error code is optional according to
   the IBM Knowledge Center documentation. However, you observe
   that when you do not specify an error code an incorrect
   validation error is shown (independent of what is specified as
   error mapping):
   
   "No error events that are thrown contain an error code that
   matches the error code specified for the '<event name>' catch
   event on the '<activity name>' activity."
   
   You can still successfully run the process containing this error
   boundary event.
