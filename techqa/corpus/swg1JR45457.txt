APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If pre migrated artifacts has DataBinding class with package
   containing uppercase letters, then after migration this issue
   happens as version 7.0 adapter generates the package names in
   lowercase as per Java standards, however when WID/IID tries to
   generate package with lowercase it fails as the package (folder)
   with uppercase letters already present in the workspace
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After adapter module migration from version 6.* to
   7.*, the workspace build in WID/IID is failing
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This happens when the DataBinding class package contains any
   upper case letters in v6.* of adapter module migrated to v7.*.
   This is due to adapter converting the package name to lowercase
   in v7.* to support Java standards. Adapter migration ifix
   7.0.0.5IF02 on WID/IID 7.0.0.5 is released to fix this problem.
