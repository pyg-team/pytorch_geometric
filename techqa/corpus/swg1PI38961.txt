PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An Action is a State with a subType == 'Action', that's the
   reason it doesn't appear in the Available Metaclasses. The same
   issue we have with some of the connectors in statechart and
   Activity, some of them are an IConnector with a subType. This
   causes that type not to appear in the Available Metaclasses. It
   the same reason why users can't create new terms on these
   elements.
