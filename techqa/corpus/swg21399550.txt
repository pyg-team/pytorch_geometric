Title: IBM PDACLD not disabling accounts in user registry - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 With max-login-failures enabled and disable-time-interval disabled, a user should see their account disabled via the user registry so that it affects all applications until an administrator changes account-valid to yes. 

When using an application which checks the user's password via the authorization API, such as via PDPrincipal(), the account gets disabled properly but not in the registry (account-valid does not change). 

CAUSE
The problem is caused because the id which the authorization server (pdacld) is using does not have the required permissions to change the secAcctValid attribute in the registry.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the pdacld admin userid (ivacld/hostname) to the SecurityGroup group, and re-start the pdacld process.
