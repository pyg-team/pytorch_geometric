QUESTION
 What does the mpimshow utility do and how do I run it? 

ANSWER
The mpimshow diagnostic utility is used to dump the in-memory contents of a member identified by memRecno. The entire contents of the member are dumped to stdout including derived data.
This command takes “memRecno” as input text at the command line. It outputs the detailed information for a member as text. You can specify -html to output the file in an html format or -xml to output the file in a xml formation. This command only operates in ODBC mode.

Steps to run the mpimshow utility:


 1. On the computer hosting the Hub, open a command line window and navigate to the MAD_ROOTDIR\bin directory. (Note: if MAD_ROOTDIR/bin is in your path you do not need to navigate to bin directory) 
 2. Make sure your profile is loaded. The profile will contain the MAD_ROOTDIR, MAD_HOMEDIR, etc... 
 3. Syntax is mpimshow <entity type> <memrecno>. Save the output to a file example: mpimshow id 100 -html > c:\temp\mpimshow\100.html) 
 4. Navigate to the file, open it and read the results.

Note: Running mpimshow without the -html will produce a text file representation.
