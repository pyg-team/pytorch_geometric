Title: IBM Error opening task page from In-basket in Case Manager Client - United States

Text:
solutions import; cant's open task; can't visit the page TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to open a task from In-basket using IBM Case Manager Client results in the error message: You can't visit the page, because it has been deleted or you do not have authorithy. 

SYMPTOM
Customer had previously imported some of the solution spaces manually.


CAUSE
The case step processor is referencing a nonexistent page id in Business Space.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
A. Validate the step processor information used by the affected task. 

1. Search for the affected work item in Process Administrator 

2. Identify the F_StepProcId value, see example below. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=1]

3. Using vwtool, issue the stepprocess command and provide the step 
processor id. See example below. 
<vwtool:1>stepprocessor 
Search by id/type (CR = i/t): 
Processor id (CR = all): 1061 
Id Type Name H W JavaExtra 
-- ---- --------------- ---- ---- -------------------- 
1061 40 AC_Work Details 600 800 
Paths: 
9 : MC0A840077C34EAB833AF2F0C26B11C00019B 

4. Verify that the page id match the location value for the step 
processor in Process Configuration Console, see example below. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=2]

5. Export the corresponding page from Manage Space -> SolutionName Step Pages -> Work Details page -> Action Export. See example below. 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=3]

6. Extract the zip file from step 5 then open the topology-template.xml in a Text Editor and look for the theme_id tag, see example screenshot below.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&aid=4]

In all the examples above, notice that the Bspace page id is MC0A840077C34EAB833AF2F0C26B11C00019B

However when customer performed the validation steps above, the ID in steps 3 and 4 do not match the ID in step 6.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1.  Login to Case Manager Client and go to Manage Spaces.
     
 2.   Delete the affected solution spaces, for each of the space listed below, click on Action and select Delete: 
     - SolutionName
     - SolutionName Case Pages
     - SolutionName Step Pages
     
 3.  Login to FEM, navigate to the the Design Object Store -> Root Folder. Right click on the "IBM Case Manager" folder and go to Properties. Show All properties and change the "IsHiddenContainer" from FALSE to TRUE and click Apply.
     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673761&amp;aid=5]
     
 4.  Login to Workplace/ WorkplaceXT, Browse the Design Object Store and navigate to the IBM Case Manager folder.
     
 5.  Checkout the connection definition file.
     
 6.  Make a copy of the connection definition file for comparison later and edit the connection definition file:
     - Remove the line the "space_deployment_date.[solution prefix]=..." associated with the solution for example: 
     space_deployment_date.XXX=....
     
 7.  Save the changes to the connection definition file and check it back in via FEM. - Verify that the the connection definition major version is incremented by one. 
     
 8.  Re-deploy the solution using CMAC.
     - CMAC will detect that there is no space_deployment_date.[solution prefix]=.... which inform CMAC that the solution has never been deployed before and it will create the solution spaces and pages in Business Space using the files Design Object Store -> Root Folder -> IBM Case Manager -> Solutions -> SolutionName -> Pages. The objects under this folder is basically the compressed business space space exports from the lower environment. 
     - Once the spaces /pages have been created in Business Space, the IDs in the connection definition files will be updated and the step processor Location value will be updated with the new IDs.
     
 9.  After the solution is redeployed. 
     - Verify that the connection definition file is re-populated with new values for page.[solution prefix]_ (you can compare the IDs with the values from the copy of connection definition file taken from step 6)
     - Verity whether you can open the work items in In-Baskets
     
 10. Hide the IBM Case Manager folder. Login to FEM, navigate to the the Design Object Store -> Root Folder. Right click on the "IBM Case Manager" folder and go to Properties. Show All properties and change the "IsHiddenContainer" from TRUE to FALSE and click Apply.
