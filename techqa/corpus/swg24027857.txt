Avoid encountering known problems in the underlying WebSphere Application Server and IBM-provided Java SDK used with WebSphere Portal by installing, testing and deploying the latest recommended levels documented in the technote, " Recommended fixes for WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]," for your specific version of WebSphere Application Server. Because WebSphere Application Server has a different release cycle for fix packs from WebSphere Portal, these later releases are not always fully tested with the portal. However, we expect full compatibility to remain with such service releases. Applying these recommendations reduces the risk of rediscovery of problems corrected in these subsequent service releases. Customers should ensure that the fixes required for the Application Server are either incorporated into the later service release or available for download. For a complete listing of fixes integrated for the Application Server, follow the link under the "Additional information" section in the Recommended fixes for WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980] technote for your version. 


For additional information regarding the support for later service releases than were tested, review the WebSphere Portal Support Statement in the Version 7.0 Information Center [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/WebSphere_Portal_Support_Statement_wp7]. DOWNLOAD PACKAGE
