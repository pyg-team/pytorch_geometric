PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote provides the required manual steps to remove an installation of IBM Rational® XDE™ when a removal attempt at Add/Remove Programs is incomplete. If a Rational XDE installation was interrupted or damaged so that it cannot be uninstalled using normal Microsoft® Windows® procedures, or a complete uninstall of XDE is required in order to complete a re-install without conflict, these procedures will restore a system to a state without XDE. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow the steps below to perform a clean uninstall and reinstall of XDE. 

XDE UNINSTALL:


 1. If XDE is integrated with Rational ClearCase, rebase the views before proceeding with an uninstall.
    
 2. Back-up or remove existing projects
    
    The project files should be removed if a complete uninstall is desired. If XDE is to be reinstalled or upgraded, then the project files can be left alone, but a backup should be made to aid recovery if additional problems should appear.
    
    The project directories are typically under My Documents on the drive where Windows is installed. The project folders will be in a subdirectory called "XDE Workspace" (for Java™) or "Visual Studio Projects" (for Microsoft® Visual Studio® .NET). The project folders can also be found by doing a search of local drives for files named *.wdx. Files found in directories under C:\Program Files\Rational\XDE (or the XDE program directory if different from the default) can be ignored.
    
    For Windows® 2000 or Windows XP®:
    XDE projects are stored by default in the user's My Documents under the
    C:\Documents and Settings directory, away from the XDE program files. 
    
    For Windows NT® 4.0:
    XDE projects are stored by default in the user's My Documents directory under the C:\WINNT\profiles directory away from the XDE program files.
    
    Back up each project directory separately and restore into the "XDE Workspace" or "Visual Studio Projects" directory (which may be located elsewhere based on XDE configuration choices) after re-install.
    
 3. Uninstall by using Windows Control Panel Add/Remove Programs.
    
 4. Remove all remaining XDE program files and directories. The path to the program files by default is: 
    C:\Program Files\Rational\XDE
    Delete this directory and all its contents.
    
    Check to see if SRWB1 and Workbench1 directories exist under C:\Program Files\Rational\ and delete them.
    
    Delete per-user XDE configuration data under each user's Application Data directory:
    
    For Windows 2000 the path to the configuration files by default is:
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Rational\XDE
    where <user> is the Windows login of each user who accesses XDE on this system.
    
    For Windows NT 4.0 the path to the project files by default is:
    C:\WINNT\profiles\<user>\Application Data\Rational\XDE
    where <user> is the Windows login of each user who accesses XDE on this system.
    
    The Application Data folder is a hidden folder. If the user does not see the Application Data folder configure Windows Explorer to see hidden folders.
    
 5. For a complete uninstall, remove XDE project directories. 
    
    These are the directories and files identified in Step 1. If a backup has been made, or a complete uninstall is desired, then remove the XDE Workspace directory. Since the Visual Studio Projects directory is shared with Visual Studio, do not remove this directory.
    
 6. Remove XDE program settings from the Registry.
    
    =======================
    CAUTION
    Using the Windows Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require a reinstall of the operating system. IBM Rational cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. 
    
    For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If you are running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk (ERD). 
    
    Rational requires you to make a Windows Emergency Repair Disk or otherwise backup the Registry before altering the Registry. See the topic below: RESTORING THE REGISTRY
    =======================
    
    The XDE (for Java or .NET) registry keys to be removed are:
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rational Software\XDE]
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rational Software\XDE]
    
    Using Regedit.exe, select each of these folders, press the "Del" key or choose from the menu: Edit > Delete, and choose Yes in the Confirm Key Delete dialog box. After both keys are deleted, exit Regedit.exe.
    
 7. Restart the computer. This permits Windows to restart using the updated and clean registry settings.
    
 8. Remove any shortcuts or Start Menu items manually.
    
 9. If reinstallation will follow, skip down to the REINSTALL XDE steps, provided below.



Removing the Microsoft® Visual Studio .NET integration:  1. Start VisualStudio .NET
    VS.NET will report "Help is updating your help file contents based on recent changes. This may take several minutes." Afterward, this warning will be reported:
    ===
    Package Load Failure
    Package 'rtepackage Package' has failed to load properly ( GUID = {C59EF73F-55D1-402D-A4F4-23BB8E07F302} ). Please contact package vendor for assistance. Would you like to disable loading this package in the future? You may use 'devenv /resetskippkgs' to re-enable package loading. Application restart is recommended, due to possible environment corruption.
    [Yes] [No]
    === 
 2. Respond to the warning by clicking the Yes button. 
 3. Close Visual Studio .NET.



Removing the IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSSAD) Integration:  1. Remove from C:\Program Files\IBM\Application Developer\plugins the directories:
    com.rational.xde_1.0
    com.rational.hshell.ratltool
    com.rational.hshell.ratltoolstartup 
 2. Remove from
    C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\XDE Workspace\.metadata\.plugins the directory:
    com.rational.hshell.ratltool 
 3. Repeat step 2 for each separate user on this system. 
 4. Start WSSAD.
    WSSAD will report once "Errors during startup" but will then be functional without XDE extensions. 
 5. Close WSSAD.
    


REINSTALL XDE:  1. Before installing, stop all other running applications.
    Windows may start helper applications and a virus scanner automatically after you restart. Stop these programs as well before reinstalling.
    
    Windows NT users: Press CTRL-ALT-DELETE. A Windows NT Security dialog box will appear. Click Task Manager. Under the Applications tab, click an item, and click End Task.
    
    Make sure any virus checking program currently running is disabled.
    
 2. Install XDE.
    If the install process requires a reboot, log in again once using the same login id used to start the install. This permits the setup program to complete any tasks postponed until after a reboot.
    
 3. Gather the following information if you have questions or if problems continue:
    
    * install log
    The Installer in the 2003 releases uses the Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) and creates the rational_install.log and rational_eventhandler.log in the user's %TEMP% directory. There may be additional logs such as: response.ini, clearquest_installation.log, and MSI*.log (MSI72025.log for example).
    
    Forward these files to Rational Customer Support, and include your answers to the following questions:
    * Were any other errors returned during install? If so what *exact* messages appeared?
    * Which operating system and platform is involved, and which of its service packs?
