 * Content Search Services to V5.5.0 
 * Case Foundation to V5.3.0 
 * Content Navigator to V3.0.3 If you are running any plug-ins to Content Navigator, such as Case Manager, check to see if: 
   
    * Upgrading Content Navigator will require upgrading the plug-in 
    * There are versions of the plug-in that are compatible with ICN V3.0.3
   
   


Upgrading to FileNet Content Manager V5.2.1

The following information shows the required released version, build number, and fix pack level (where applicable) for each FileNet P8 component before starting an upgrade to Content Platform Engine V5.2.1.

If any FileNet P8 component is below the minimum build or fix pack level documented here, update that component accordingly before starting the upgrade.

Applying a fix pack to one component might necessitate applying fix packs to other components. Before applying any fix pack, review FileNet P8 Fix Pack Compatibility Matrices [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3278&uid=swg27014734] to assure compatibility between all installed components.
