QUESTION
 How do you identify where a DOORS data folder (.mod directory) is located in IBM Rational DOORS database? 

CAUSE
IBM Technical Support may ask you to provide the .mod directory for analysis or repair.

ANSWER
DOORS information is stored in data folders on the database server referred to as a
.mod directory. While working with support you may be requested to provide a zip file of the effected data folder. 

Note: Ensure you have a valid backup of the data prior to making any changes below. 



Steps to identify the location for a DOORS data folder:


 1. Open the project or folder that contains the item to be analyzed 
    
    
 2. Click Tools > Edit DXL
    
    
 3. Run the following DXL
    
    [<code>]
    Item i
    for i in current Folder do {
    print (name i)" \t\n ""m" uniqueID i".mod" "\n\n"
    }
    
    
    
 4. This will return output with a contents list of the item name and Unique ID
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21402877&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21402877&aid=1]
    
 5. Select the ID for the troubled module
    
    For example: Stakeholder Requirements Specification
    the number listed below the name is the m00000280.mod 
    
    
 6. Search for folder m00000280.mod in DOORS database directory
