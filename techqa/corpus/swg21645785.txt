QUESTION
 The attached whitepaper is written for a DB2 v9.5/9.7/10.1 Automated Failover HADR environment, however the core upgrade and migration steps apply to any TSAMP v3.2 or v4.1environment. 

ANSWER
This whitepaper details the installation of a v3.2.x.x fixpack in a IBM Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (TSAMP) v3.2.x.x environment, tailored for a DB2 v9.5/9.7/10.1 high availability disaster recovery (HADR) environment. This procedure keeps database service available throughout the upgrade process, however automated failover and other automated recovery actions would not be available.
This document assumes the initial environment is a HADR pair running DB2 v9.7 GA and TSAMP v3.2.0.1 on Linux. However, the same migration procedure will apply to any DB2 v9.5 or v9.7 or v10.1 deployment with TSAMP v3.2.x.x.
