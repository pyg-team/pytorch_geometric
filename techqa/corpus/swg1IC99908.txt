APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Tivoli Storage Manager Reporting and Monitoring  workspaces
   on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal may report  different and
   outdated values with respect to the ones reported by real time
   queries executed on the Tivoli Storage Manager Server.
   
   
   For example the "Storage Pool" workspace may report an outdated
   "space util" percentage with respect to the one shown by the
   "query stgpool" command.
   
   
   
   
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:
   When the Agent first starts, the Tivoli Storage Manager
   Reporting and Monitoring Agent runs through all of the attribute
   groups running the Tivoli Storage Manager queries for that
   attribute group sequentially.
   The Agent instance will store that data into the Prefetch cache
   (DERBY database).
   After the last query has been run, the Agent instance will sleep
   for whatever the variable  KSK_PREFETCH_MINUTES is set to in the
   instance configuration file.  By default it is 60 minutes.
   If a query or a select is slow (any query), it will have an
   effect on when the data for each attribute group gets populated
   into the DERBY database.
   
   Why is this important:
   The Prefetch cache (DERBY database) for each instance is where
   the Tivoli Storage Manager Instance pulls the data for the
   following requests:
   On-Demand -- this is when a user selects a workspace in the
   TEPS.  Data from DERBY is sent to TEPS workspace.
   Historical -- If the attribute group is set up for historical
   request, then data in this request is taken from the DERBY
   database and sent to the WAREHOUS database on a defined
   interval.
   Situation -- If the attribute group is setup for situation
   processing, then data in this request is taken from the DERBY
   database and sent to ITM for situation processing on a defined
   interval.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Turn off the Client Node Status attribute group in order to
   speed up the refresh in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
   from 4-5 hours to less than 1 hour.
   Contact the Technical Support to obtain the updated jar and
   instructions on how apply it.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Monitoring operations daily with Tivoli Monitoring for
   Tivoli Storage Manager" section in the Administrator's Guide
   will be updated to include the following information:
   "You can use the workspaces that are available in the Tivoli
   Enterprise Portal to view real-time data. By default, the data
   is collected every hour. You can set the schedule by using the
   KSK_PREFETCH_MINUTES environment variable.
   
   Restriction: All of the data-collection queries to the Tivoli
   Storage Manager, for each attribute group, are run
   sequentially. The next query cannot start until the previous
   query is complete. For larger Tivoli Storage Manager server
   instances, the queries might take considerable time.
   Therefore, the regularly scheduled data collection might be
   delayed."
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, Linux, and Windows.
