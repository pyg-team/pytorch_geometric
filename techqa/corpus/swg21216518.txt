PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A channel on a distributed queue manager receives:

AMQ9202: Remote host '<hostname> (<ipaddr>) (<port>)' not available, retry later. 

CSQX202E is the equivalent message on the z/OS platform.

The CHIN log on the z/OS queue manager contains:

+CSQX208E CSQXRESP Error receiving data,
channel <channel_name>, 
connection <hostname> (<ipaddr>) 
(queue manager ????) 
TRPTYPE=TCP RC=00000D78


CAUSE
The DVIPA address was deleted as a result of an explicit command or the DVIPA was not properly associated with the listener in the CHIN.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Create a DVIPA that is not dependant on sockets by adding two MODDVIPA steps to the IBM MQ CHIN proc. This is the proc that executes CSQXJST and initiates the Listen socket. In the first step, create the DVIPA. In the last step, delete the DVIPA. That last step should have COND=EVEN specified on the EXEC statement. This will provide automatic maintenance of the DVIPA for normal operations.

Reference the Commnications Server: IP Configuration Guide [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.halz002/vipa_moddvipa.htm] for syntax for the MODDVIPA command.
