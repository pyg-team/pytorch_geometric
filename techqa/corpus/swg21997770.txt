Title: IBM Stewardship Virtual MDM Dashboard fails to operate following a snapshot update of the MDM Application Toolkit - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If a snapshot of the MDM Application Toolkit is taken, and the dependency on the toolkit in the Stewardship Virtual MDM process application is updated to use that new snapshot, UI elements in the Stewardship Virtual MDM Dashboard may begin to fail. This is due to multiple copies of a required client library being returned to the client side code, causing an unintended loading sequence and subsequent errors. 

SYMPTOM
On viewing the details of a search result in the Stewardship Virtual MDM Dashboard, UI elements, such as buttons and table sorting capabilities, will not work as expected when interacted with.


CAUSE
When the snapshot is updated, the BPM server begins to return multiple copies of the jQuery library to the client, causing an undefined behavior during loading of the Stewardship Virtual MDM Dashboard. A PMR has been raised against BPM to investigate why this second copy of jQuery is being returned.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In your web browser, open the web developer tools console (normally accessed via the F12 key), and review the output of the console tab. You will see the following errors in the console output: 

Error: multipleDefine(…)(anonymous function) @ dojo.js?build=201609281221:8(anonymous function)…

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Two workarounds are available for this issue: 


1) Restart the server running BPM. For a ND environment all servers must be stopped and started in the cluster. Once restarted, the Stewardship Virtual MDM process application UIs will function as expected.
2) Temporarily remove the reference to ‘jQuery.min.js’ from the list of Included Scripts from the VIDetailView coach view.
