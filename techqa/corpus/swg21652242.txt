QUESTION
 I installed Informix Dynamic Server 12.10.xC2+ and selected the JSON Client Support install set. Why am I not able to use NoSQL? 

CAUSE
The installation was not used to "Create a server instance".

ANSWER
During the Informix Dynamic Server installation, you must answer "Yes" to the question "Create a server instance?". If you do not do this, the NoSQL feature will not be configured even though the supporting code is installed automatically by the installer. 

This step is the only way to configure the initial instance to be able to use NoSQL. After the initial instance with NoSQL support is created, additional instances with NoSQL support can be added using a method documented in another article. See the related documents section for more information.
