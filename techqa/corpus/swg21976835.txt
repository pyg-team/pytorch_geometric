For CVE-2015-7575:

Users of Java 7 (SPSS Statistics 23) and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

 * Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 
 * Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA

Java 6 (SPSS Statistics 19 thru 22) requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
