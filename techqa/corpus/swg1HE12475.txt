APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Migration of General Settings is not started if only SMTP is
   used as source system
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TBD
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In case the system has been migrated to version 4.0.1 and if
   only SMTP or IBM Connections is used as source system, IBM
   Content Collector will enable the JDBC connection of the IBM
   Content Collector Configuration Web Service and eventually stop
   and re-start the IBM Content Collector Web Application service
   each time IBM Content Collector Configuration Manager is
   launched.
   This behaviour is due to the fact, that the General Settings
   configuration was not migrated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix the General Settings configuration is
   migrated at the next start of the Configuration Manager.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
