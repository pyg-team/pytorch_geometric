ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Product: Tivoli Network Manager
   Version: 411
   Component: GenericCsv Collector
   
   
   The documentation discusses how to handle protocols and provide
   an example of IP versus non-IP protocols.

   bm.networkmanagerip.doc_4.1.1/itnm/ip/wip/disco/task/
   nip_dsc_configurin gdevicep rotocolhandling.html?lang=en
   
   An example is needed for other protocols, such as microwave
   links, showing the usage of the relevant files such as
   microwaveLinks.csv.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * An example is needed for other protocols, such as microwave  *
   * links, showing the usage of the relevant files such as       *
   * microwaveLinks.csv.                                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Microwave link support is only available in the Perl CSV     *
   * collector, and not on java CSV collector. The example data   *
   * provided in the Perl CSV collector should be enough for the  *
   * user to generate on his/her own.                             *
   *                                                              *
   * Add a note to the topic to indicate that Microwave link      *
   * support is only available in the Perl CSV collector          *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Updated the following 4.1 topic and merged to equivalent topic
   in 4.1.1 and 4.2.
