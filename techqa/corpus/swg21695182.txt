QUESTION
 Is there a prerequisite checker for Jazz for Service Management (JazzSM)? 

ANSWER
Yes, there is a prerequisite checker you can use to verify system settings before installing JazzSM. You can access the tool by launching the JazzSM installation. After you download all of the required software for JazzSM as specified in the user guide, start the installation wizard. 

For Windows users, double click launchpad64.exe to start the installation wizard. 

For AIX/Linux users, type "./launchpad.sh" to start the installation wizard. 

 

The prerequisite scanner is located in the Tools option.

Note that if you have already installed IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager 7.1, DB2 should have been installed as well. It is normal for the Prereq Scanner to report this error:

network.availablePorts.db2instance FAIL

DBType FAIL DB2 DB2ShdNotBeInstalled

This error can be ignored.
