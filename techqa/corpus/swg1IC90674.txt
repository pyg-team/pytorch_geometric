APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IIS application fails to remotely connect to a queue manager
   and throws Win32Exception with access denied error on an
   OpenProcess call
   
   Exception Reported for the first time :
   System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been
   thrown by the target of an invocation. --->
   System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been
   thrown by the target of an invocation. --->
   System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: Access is denied at
   System.Diagnostics.ProcessManager.OpenProcess(Int32 processId,
   Int32 access, Boolean throwIfExited) at
   System.Diagnostics.NtProcessManager.GetModuleInfos(Int32
   processId, Boolean firstModuleOnly) at
   System.Diagnostics.Process.get_Modules() at
   IBM.WMQ.CommonServices.TraceEnvironment() at
   IBM.WMQ.CommonServices.CreateCommonServices() at
   IBM.WMQ.CommonServices.TraceEnabled() at IBM.WMQ.MQBase..ctor()
   
   This connection, however, works locally because
   authentication/impersonation works differently when connection
   is local vs when browsed from a client.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Granting "Query process information and read process virtual
   memory" rights to the impersonated user so that OpenProcess
   succeeds.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IIS applications that remotely connects to Queue
   manager
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   WebSphere MQ client code issues an OpenProcess call on itself.
   However, an IIS application with impersonation turned ON does
   not have the required security privileges to issue OpenProcess
   call on itself. Hence the application throws Win32Exception with
   access denied error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere MQ client code has been modified such that the
   Win32Exception is handled gracefully.
