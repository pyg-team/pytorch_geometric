Title: IBM PM71235: NPE ON THE SYNDICATOR CREATOR WIZARD WHEN SYNDICATION INTERVAL IS SET TO 0 - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Syndicator Creator Wizard first creates the syndicator
   remotely, before creating the subscriber, a syndication interval
   delay of 0
   will trigger the syndicator to attempt an initial syndication
   before the subscriber can finish creating its subscriber
   component.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The call back mechanism which triggers an initial syndication
   when persisting a syndicator was modified to differentiate
   between a update, vs a create. When a Syndicator
   is created, if no longer schedules a synchronization request,
   but instead, being triggered from the subscriber
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
