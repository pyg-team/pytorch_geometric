ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description from customer:
   
   Support for IBM Lotus Domino on Ubuntu Server
   
   1.) Because of cost saving and a very stable OS System the
   customer
   would like that IBM Lotus Supports the Ubuntu Server OS. Domino
   is free
   and it could be help save some money during Lotus Domino
   
   implementation.
   
   2.)
   
   If a company is using Windows as OS they sometimes switch to
   Exchange.
   But I never have seen a company who loves and used Linux
   switching to
   something called Exchange.
   
   3.)
   
   We could build testenvironments in a VMWare to test Lotus Domino
   
   Features and things before we roll them out without spending a
   licence
   or money. [This VMWare could also be uploaded to the IBM FTP
   Server, so
   that the support could use my machine where I could reproduce a
   issue.
   So support and bugfixing could be faster. But using a Windows
   2003
   licence to build a testenvironment is very expensive solution.]
   
   4.)
   
   Developers are able to run a Domino Server in a VMWare to test
   things
   before they go live without spending money.
