PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All WebSphere Message Broker v6.0 users      *
   *                 who have the HTTPRequest node configured     *
   *                 to use HTTPS.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The default truststore for the          *
   *                      HTTPRequest node is the cacerts file    *
   *                      in the Message Broker installation      *
   *                      location                                *
   *                      $MQSI_FILEPATH/jre/lib/security.        *
   *                      This file may be overwritten by         *
   *                      FixPack installs.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The default truststore for the HTTPRequest node is the cacerts
   file in the Message Broker installation location
   $MQSI_FILEPATH/jre/lib/security, and it is not easy to
   configure the Broker to use a different file location.
   This file may be overwritten by FixPack installs and
   therefore it is recommended that customers back this file
   up if configuring for use with the HTTPRequest node and SSL.
