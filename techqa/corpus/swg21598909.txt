Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Installing TKLM v2 FP005 fails with Exit Code 24, problem creating response files for TIP Installation 

SYMPTOM
 

After running \updateTKLM.bat tipadmin tipadminpwd >> D:\updateTKLM2005.log the installer quits rapidly. The updateTKLM2005.log file shows below entry: 

 Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager Exit Code = 24, Problem creating response 
files for TIP Installation 


CAUSE
 

The fix pack installation fails because the installer is executed from another drive that is not the default (C:\) for %userprofile%.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

During the installation process the installer creates a response with different installation parameters (tipadmin, tipadmin pwd, etc) in the %userprofile% path which by default is the C:\Users\Administrator on Windows 2008. Since the fix pack installer is being ran from D:\ , when the script tries to access %userprofile%, the path is not recognized because it does not exist in D:\. Therefore, installation fails with

files for TIP Installation
