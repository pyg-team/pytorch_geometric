QUESTION
 Why does ILMT 7.2.0 Fix Pack 1 is unable to run the installation in graphical mode? 

ANSWER
When installing ILMT 7.2.0 Fix Pack 1 on base WAS, it is unable to run in graphical mode. It fails with the following error message: 

"The installer is unable to run in graphical mode. Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag. " 
If running it with the -console flag, it gives another error message:

"The wizard cannot continue because of the following error: Invalid command line option: console is not supported (1001) (403)".

So the solution in order to apply this fix pack to License Metric Tool installed on the base version of WebSphere Application Server, would be to perform the following steps: 

1. Stop the License Metric Tool Admin server. 

2. Locate and backup the following directories: 

* WebSphere_installation_path /profiles/profile_name/installedApps/cell_name/LMT-TAD4D_Agent_message_handler.ear/com.ibm.license.mgmt.msghandler.web.war 

* WebSphere_installation_path /systemApps/isclite.ear/lmt_admin.war 

3. Overwrite directories located above with the ones supplied in 

7.2.0-TIV-LMT-FP0001-Server-WAS-Base.zip archive. 

4. Start the LMT Admin Server. 

5. Open the Admin Web UI and browse to the About page to verify if the reported product version is 7.2.0.1.

If it still fails, collect the logs located under the COD directory and contact IBM Support.
