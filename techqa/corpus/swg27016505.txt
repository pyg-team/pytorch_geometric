ABSTRACT
 To demonstrate the use of a simple but functional Message Driven Bean (MDB) in WebSphere Application Server V7, V8.0 and V8.5, which interacts with WebSphere MQ V7 as the Javaâ„¢ Messaging Service (JMS) provider. WAS 9.0 ships with MQ RA 9.0. 

CONTENT
The MDB was created with Rational Application Developer (RAD) 7.5 and the Enterprise Archive File (EAR) file which contains the MDB can be downloaded from this techdoc.

The main scenario is to show how to configure both WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere MQ V7.x, in order for an MDB to get messages from MQ, using a WebSphere Application Server Listener Port from a Queue (Point to Point).


What is new in this update:

- On Apr-2017, the procedures were tested with a queue manager running on MQ 9.0.2.0 and a WAS server 9.0.0.0 (using MQ RA 9.0.0.0), in Windows 10

- On Aug-2016, the procedures were tested with a queue manager running on MQ 9.0.0.0 and a WAS server 9.0.0.0 (using MQ RA 9.0.0.0)

- On May-2013, the procedures in this techdoc were successfully tested with a queue manager running on MQ 7.5.0.1 and a WAS server 8.5.0.2 (using MQ RA 7.1.0.2).

- On Aug-2012, the procedures in this techdoc were successfully tested with a queue manager running on MQ 7.0.1.9 and a WAS server 8.0.0.4 (using MQ RA 7.0.1.7).

- When using MQ 7.1 or 7.5 queue managers, if the MQ JMS client in WAS gets a RC 2035, one possibility is that the "channel authentication records" are enabled. For more details see the following technote:
WMQ 7.1 / 7.5 / 8.0 / 9.0 queue manager RC 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED or AMQ4036 or JMSWMQ2013 when using client connection as an MQ Administrator [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21577137] 

Additional scenarios are provided to illustrate the following: 

 * How to use MQ Topics to exploit Publish/Subscribe from MQ. 
 * How to use a WebSphere Application Server Activation Specification, instead of a Listener Port from WebSphere Application Server.


This document shows all of the screen shots needed for beginners. 
This document has the following chapters:  1. MQ V7 configuration: queue and topic 
 2. WebSphere Application Server V7 and V8 configuration: JNDI objects 
 3. WebSphere Application Server V7 and V8 deployment and testing of MDB 
 4. Additional scenarios: Topic, Activation Specification
