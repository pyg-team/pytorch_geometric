   4 years fail.
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N
   By Who (L3, Support, customer)
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. BPF users, User1, User2
   Question: what's the two users configured, has which inbaskets?
   Answer: BPF Inbasket is configured to have cases corresponding
   to Inbox (0) queue i.e. all work items in user inboxes. No
   special setting for User1 and User2.
   
   2. Change the Queue Filter as the F_BoundUser = '%'
   Question: which queue filter, and the queue filter is configured
   for which inbasket?
   Answer: Configure the queue filter for inbasket queue for User1
   and User2.
   
   3. (Any user can create a case) Create a case and assign it to
   User1 (i.e. F_BoundUser = User1)  (i.e. F_BoundUser = User1)
   Question: who create a case and assign it to User1?
   Answer: Any one can create a case and assign it to User1, for
   example, p8admin or User2
   
   5. If User1 login BPF, he can open case successfully,
   Question: he open which inbasket? here is Inbox, after he create
   a case, he need to do some action to make the case to Inbox
   Answer: After other user (for example User2) create case for
   User1 and assign to User1, the case will appear in the Inbox of
   User1
   
   6. If User2 login BPF, he can't open and met the same error
   message in this case
   Question: The same as above, open case in which inbasket?
   Answer: User2 open case in his inbasket, got the error message
   described in this case 'This item is no longer in this Inbasket
   and can not be opened. It might have been already processed by
   somebody else. '
   Actual Results:
   
   If User2 login BPF, he can't open and met the same error message
   in this PMR
   
   We ever suggest customer to set
   Set the queue filter to 'F_boubdUser=%USERID% and
   F_StepName='%StepName%' order by %ORDERBY%, F_EnqueueTime,
   F_UniqueId asc'
   But customer refused for this will impact on their business
   logic which has already used for 4 years.
   
   Expected Results:
   
   If User2 login BPF, he can open and no error message pop-up
