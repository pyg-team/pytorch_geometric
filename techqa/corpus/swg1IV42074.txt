APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are potential performance issues when processing
   persistent messages within and outside a unit of work
   (syncpoint). This information is not mentioned in the
   Infocenter. SupportPac MP6N states very plainly "Processing
   messages inside syncpoint can help reduce the amount of time
   the queue managers takes to write a group of persistent messages
   to the log disk." But this information is not in the Information
   Center.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere MQ.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   WebSphere MQ InfoCenter is not explicit on the performance
   implications of writing persistent messages outside a unit of
   work.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ InfoCenter will be updated to be more
   explicit on the potential performance problems when writing
   persistent messages outside a unit of work.

   A note should be added as follows.
   Note:  A combination of the writing persistent messages within
   a unit of work and writing persistent messages outside a unit
   or work can cause potentially severe performance problems for
   your applications.  This is particularly true when the same
   target queue is used for these operations.

   slowly?"

   Please add a sentence similar to the following:
   "A common cause of slow application performance or the build
   up of messages on a queue (usually a transmit queue) is one or
   more applications which write persistent messages outside a
   unit of work. For more details see <LINK TO PREVIOUS SECTION>"
