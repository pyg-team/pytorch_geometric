APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Situation against Message Statistics attribute group fails with
   reason 9008 when USEQACCESS is specified for MSGACCESS and
   MSGAUTHUSERS is specified with something other than *.
   
   Situations requests do not have userid passed, so checking for
   match with MSGAUTHUSERS will fail.  The following message will
   be written to the agent log:
   
   KMQMI210E Collection of message statistics failed.
   QMgr=<qmgrname>,
   Queue=<qname>, Userid=                , RS=9008

   ****************************************************************
   Situations requests do not have userid passed, so checking
   for match with MSGAUTHUSERS will fail. Accessing to the
   queue messages is then denied for the Message Statistics
   requests.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is changed to allow situation request to access
   queue messages.
