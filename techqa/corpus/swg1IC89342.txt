ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCP log target may cause system hang if the SCP server is
   unresponsive during time of file upload.
   
   The appliance may remain in a hung/wait state for up to 130
   seconds before it recovers and resumes processing.
   The log may show successive inactivity errors during the time
   of the hang:
   
   system,error,,,0,,0x80400025,,,"Watchdog system detects no
   activity for at least 49 seconds"
   
   system,critic,,,0,,0x80400025,,,"Watchdog system detects no
   activity for at least 50 seconds"
   
   
   Also, once the appliance recovers, the following log target
   errors may be seen at the end of the inactivity errors:
   
   [system][error] logging target(scp-log): tid(415730367): File
   not found.
   
   [system][error] logging target(scp-log): tid(415730367): Log
   upload of target scp-log failed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use Syslog log target instead.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are users of all firmware releases up to and including
   version 5.0.0.x using log targets with SCP or SFTP upload
   method.
   
   SCP/SFTP log target may cause system halt if the the
   target SCP/SFTP server is unresponsive during time of file
   upload.
   
   The appliance may remain in a wait state for up to 130
   seconds before it recovers and resumes processing.
   
   Fix will be provided in a next major release. No formal fix is
   planned for the current releases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The safest workaround for the problem is to use upload method
   other than SCP or SFTP.
