LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  CVE Detail List:
   CVE-2013-7423 glibc: A function in resolv/res_send.c allows
   remote attacks.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7423]
   The send_dg function in resolv/res_send.c in GNU C Library
   (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.20 does not properly reuse
   file descriptors, which allows remote attackers to send DNS
   queries to unintended locations via a large number of request
   that trigger a call to the getaddrinfo function.
   .
   CVE-2015-1472 glibc: A macro in vfscanf.c allows context-
   dependent attacks.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1472 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1472]
   The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library
   (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider
   data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-
   dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer
   overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
   long line containing wide characters that are improperly
   handled in a wscanf call.
   .
   CVE-2015-1473 glibc: A macro in vfscanf.c allows context-
   dependent attacks.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1473 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1473]
   The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library
   (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider
   data-type size during a risk-management decision for use of the
   alloca function, which might allow context-dependent attackers
   to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or
   overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary via a
   long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled
   in a wscanf call.
   .
   CVE-2015-1781 glibc: Buffer overflow allows context-dependent
   attacks.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781]
   Buffer overflow in the gethostbyname_r and other unspecified NSS
   functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22
   allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
   (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response,
   which triggers a call with a misaligned buffer.
   .
   CVE-2015-5229 glibc: This candidate has been reserved.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5229 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5229]
   ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an
   organization or individual that will use it when announcing a
   new security problem.
   When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this
   candidate will be provided.
   .
   CVE-2015-5277 glibc: A function allow local users to cause a
   denial of service.
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5277]
   The get_contents function in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name
   Service Switch (NSS) in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
   before 2.20 might allow local users to cause a denial of service
   
   (heap corruption) or gain privileges via a long line in the NSS
   files database.
   .
   CVE-2015-7547 glibc: Multiple buffer overflows allow a denial of
   service
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547]
   Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) send_dg and
   (2)send_vc functions in the libresolv library in the GNU C
   Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 allow remote attackers
   to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response that triggers a call
   to the getaddrinfo function with the AF_UNSPEC or AF_INET6
   address family, related to performing "dual A/AAAA DNS queries"
   and the libnss_dns.so.2 NSS module.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  These issues were identified for "KVM for
   Systems Z" 1.1.0.5 level.
   .
   Apply the mentioned temporary fixes to solve the described
   deficiencies.
   .
   All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updates
   packages, which contain backported patches to correct these
   issues.  The system must be rebooted for this update to take
   effect.
