PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The steps will guide you through the manual uninstallation process of IBM® Tivoli® Common Reporting 1.2. Use the procedure in case of an installation failure. When the installation fails (for a know reason, such as insufficient disk space), it is sometimes impossible to start the installation program over, even though the cause of the failure has already been removed. You can then remove the software manually. 

SYMPTOM
The IBM Tivoli Common Reporting server cannot be uninstalled or reinstalled.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The manual uninstallation procedure uses the following variables: 



 * TCR_HOME - installation root directory of IBM Tivoli Common Reporting. By default, it is set C:\IBM\tivoli\tip for Windows® and /opt/IBM/tivoli/tip for UNIX/Linux platforms.
 * xxxxx is the port chosen during the installation procedure (the default port is 16310).



To manually uninstall the program: 
1. Stop the IBM Tivoli Common Reporting server, and remove the automatic start services by running the following commands in the command line interface: 

 * 
 * For Windows:
   
    * TCR_HOME\bin\WASService.exe -stop TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx
    * TCR_HOME\bin\WASService.exe -remove TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx
   
   
   
   Note: If the installer/uninstaller did not manage to include/remove the WASServer.exe, a manual termination of the process is required. In such a case, make sure that the following entries are deleted from the Windows systems registry:
   
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\IBMWAS61Service - TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Services\IBMWAS61Service - TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IBMWAS61Service - TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx
   
   
   
   After the registry is updated manually, reboot the system to be sure the service is completely removed.
 * 
 * 
 * For UNIX/Linux:
   Kill the IBM Tivoli Common Reporting server process by running:
   
    * ps -ef | grep java
    * kill -9 TCR_Server_PID
   
   
   
   Additionally, if you enabled the automatic start of the IBM Tivoli Common Reporting server during system startup, remove the symbolic links:
   
    * TCR_HOME/products/tcr/bin/setTCRUnixLinks.sh uninstall
   
   
   



2. All platforms: Remove TCR_HOME directory. 

3. Remove the Deployment Engine (DE) component. For a non-root user the DE is located under <USER_HOME_DIR>/.acsi*. Follow the steps with the adjusted path to the files (by default drive C: is used here): 

 * For Windows:
    * Open the command line interface, and source the DE environment:
      C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\setenv.cmd
    * Uninstall DE:
      C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\si_inst.bat -r -f
    * Remove database backup:
      rmdir /s C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi
   
   
 * For UNIX/Linux:
    * Source the DE environment:
      . /var/ibm/common/acsi/setenv.sh
      Important: Make sure you include the . (dot and space) characters when running the command.
    * Uninstall DE:
      /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/si_inst.sh -r -f
    * Remove database backup:
      rm -rf /usr/ibm/common/acsi
    * Remove acsi var directory:
      rm -rf /var/ibm/common/acsi
