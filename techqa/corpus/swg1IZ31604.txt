APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS USER ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When creating users via the ITIM admin console sometimes, even
   when choosing to manually enter a new password (as opposed to
   letting ITIM generate one for the user), ITIM actually set the
   person's password to a randomly generated password. This can be
   observed in the ITIM directory, where the erpersonpassword and
   ersynchpassword attributes for a newly created person with
   password entered manually are different. Most notably
   erpersonpassword is set to the correct value but ersynchpassword
   is set to a different(incorrect) value. All accounts for that
   person are then provisioned with the randomly generated
   password.
   
   Note that this issue is not absolutely constant - some
   environments on which this problem was tested did not show that
   behaviour. It is not known why.
   
   Customer has the environment:
   
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 4 (Nahant Update 6)

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is being closed as a USER Configuration
   error.
   For the customers policy configuration;
   When persons are created, the following accounts are provisioned
   automatically to the users:
   - ITIM Account
   - ITAM Account
   - ADAM Account
   The C/T investigated the reported issue in depth and found that
   the issue reported using these three policy configurations is
   not an ITIM defect, but is a user error in configuration.
   The user is expecting the new accounts to have the same password
   that they enter during user creation. Note that, in a default
   configuration, the entered password is set as 'erPersonPassword'
   and ITIM will allow you to enter this password only when the
   'Setting a password when a user is created'  property is set to
   'true' in 'Set System Security > Set Security Properties'.
   By default the ITIM account created through automatic policy
   will use the 'erPersonPassword' as the ITIM account password.
   Please see this configuration under 'Account Defaults' for
   ITIM service.
   So with the default policy configuration everything works fine.
   The problem appears only when they have some other Services
   provisioned automatically during the user creation. In this
   case, customer is expected to provide the account defaults for
   'erPassword' attribute for those Services too. This is clearly
   explained in the ITIM 5.0 InfoCenter at the following URL:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v2r1/topic/
   com.ibm.itim.doc/tsk/tsk_ic_admin_pwsetonusercreate.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v2r1/topic/com.ibm.itim.doc/tsk/tsk_ic_admin_pwsetonusercreate.htm]
   Regarding the inconsistence behavior:
   Since the erPassword is configured to use 'erPersonPassword' in
   the ITIM Service account default, you will not see the issue
   when the ITIM account creation operation is performed first
   and then other accounts are provisioned sequentially during
   person creation. If ITIM accounts is not provisioned first
   and other services do not have the 'erPassword' account
   default, then you can see the behavior reported here.
   To correct the configuration, the user needs to confirm that
   they have configured all the requirements to use
   'Setting a password when a user is created' property
   as mentioned in the above given InfoCenter URL.
