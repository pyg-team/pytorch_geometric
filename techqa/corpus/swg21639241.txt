 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Once a Preservation Plan in Atlas has been moved from "Execute" status to "On Hold" status, the ability to add new custodians is removed. How can new custodians be added at this point? 

CAUSE
When a preservation plan is first drafted, custodians can be easily added and removed. Even after it is published, as long as the plan is still in "Execute" status, the ability to add new custodians remains. The "Execute" status is basically letting the owner(s) of the plan know that work still needs to be done. When the owner(s) of the preservation plan finish the work and place all the custodians on hold, they update the plan status to "On Hold". At this point, the plan is locked down and there is no longer an option to add new custodians.

ANSWER
When a plan is "On Hold", in order to add any additional custodians it must first be suspended. Only then will the option to add custodians be available again. After adding the new custodians and resuming the plan, it will be placed back in "Execute" status, as there is additional work for the owner(s) to do. All of the individual custodian status values will remain in the same statuses as they were before the suspension, so custodians with "On Hold" status before will not be touched.
