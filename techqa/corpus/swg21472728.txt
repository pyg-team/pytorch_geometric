QUESTION
 How can I know whether the MQ/MC Agents are stopped successfully? 

ANSWER
Before you can upgrade to ITCAM for Application for WebSphere Messaging agents V7.0.1 on i5/OS, you first need to stop the running agents by the following steps. 

1. Access i5/OS command line. 

2. Issue 'WRKOMAMQ' and select 'End' to stop active MQ monitoring agent(s). Note that if your agent level is V350 or even lower, issue 'GO OMAMQ' instead. 

3. Issue 'GO OMAMC' to select 'End' to stop active MQ Configuration agent(s). 

4. Issue 'WRKACTJOB SBS(KMQLIB) and 'WRKACTJOB SBS(KMCLIB)'. 
You must see this message on the active jobs screen -> (No active jobs to display).
