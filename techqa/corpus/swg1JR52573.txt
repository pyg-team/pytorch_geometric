ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you try to resubmit a SCA-type failed event in a migrated
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) environment that uses the
   previous version of the SCA bus names (SCA.SYSTEM.<cellName>.Bus
   and SCA.APPLICATION.<cellName>.Bus), you see an exception
   similar to the following exception:
   
   Failed event with ID 0A639FED82C6D8A2_93001169 could not be
   resubmitted. The server returned: com.ibm.websphere.sib.
   exception.SINotPossibleInCurrentConfigurationException:
   CWSIC8007E: An exception was caught from the remote server with
   Probe Id 3-008-0001. Exception: CWSIK0015E: The destination
   sca/ExecuteTransactionV002 was not found on messaging engine
   Advantage_SYS.Messaging.000-SCA.APPLICATION.Cell01.Bus...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The failed event manager tries to resubmit SCA-type failed
   events by using the SCA application bus instead of the SCA
   system bus. However, the SI destinations are defined on the SCA
   system bus.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that ensures the failed
   event manager uses the SCA system bus instead of the SCA
   application bus to resubmit SCA-style failed events.
