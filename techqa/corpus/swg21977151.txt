QUESTION
 Data Source setup page failed with "Data source file replication failed for URL http .,.... UploadReplication" error. 

CAUSE
After installed ILMT 9.2.2.0-20151209-1636 on Linux, a failure occurred during the data source setup page as shown below.

The tema.log showed

[09/02/16 20:07:37:019 UTC] 000000f3 com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp 
I SRVE0292I: Servlet Message - [tema]:.[INFO] Upload replication check 
failed with error: getservbyname_r failed 
(Java::JavaLang::RuntimeException) 

[09/02/16 20:07:37:020 UTC] 000000f3 com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp 
I SRVE0292I: Servlet Message - [tema]:.[INFO] Data source file 
replication failed. Install a 32-bit version of the glibc library on the 
IBM License Metric Tool server. 

==========================

These errors below indicated problem executing the getservbyname routine due to missing glibc library file on the ILMT server. 

Comparing to another working ILMT server on Linux, it has these glibc library files installed and they are not installed on a NOT working ILMT server.

rpm -qa | grep -i glibc 

glibc-headers-2.12-1.166.el6.x86_64 
glibc-devel-2.12-1.166.el6.x86_64 
glibc-2.12-1.166.el6.x86_64 
compat-glibc-headers-2.5-46.2.x86_64 
glibc-2.12-1.166.el6.i686 
compat-glibc-2.5-46.2.x86_64 
glibc-common-2.12-1.166.el6.x86_64 
. 


ANSWER
Ensure the glibc library files especially these ones below are installed. 


glibc-2.12-1.166.el6.x86_64 
glibc-2.12-1.166.el6.i686 

 

Once they are installed, need to restart the ILMT server service in order to take affect.
