   APAR PM00924 provides support for running IBM WebSphere
   Application Server V7.0 Feature Pack for SCA V1.0.1 Refresh Pack
   on z/OS. The WebSphere Application Server V7.0 Feature Pack for
   Service Component Architecture (SCA) V1.0.1 Refresh Pack
   provides updated Service Component Architecture (SCA)
   capabilities, which benefit both operations and development
   personnel in building and managing composite applications based
   on Service Oriented Architecture. SCA simplifies development and
   management of composite applications by moving service details
   out of the application and into the middleware. The developer
   can focus on the business logic, allowing more flexible
   management of composite applications that can respond to changes
   in the environment.
   
   Highlights of the IBM WebSphere Application Server V7 Feature
   Pack for SCA V1.0.1 Refresh Pack include:
   
   * Java Message Service (JMS) binding support
     -   Added JMS binding support to allow SCA components to
         communicate with an asynchronous message queues (JMS API)
         in the following:
         --  WebSphere Application Server integration with
             WebSphere Default Provider
         --  WebSphere Application Server integration with
             WebSphere MQ
     -   Simple message transformations via API and hook point to
         plug in a user routine to convert between custom JMS
         payload formats and SCA application data. An additional
         API and hook point plugs in a custom operation selector.
     -   Dynamic resource creation allows for simplified
         development scenarios
   
   * Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) integration
     -   Build SCA composites within Java EE components - EJBs and
         Servlets
     -   Expose EJBs as SCA services
     -   Include transaction and security QoS for Java EE
         components
   
   * Web 2.0 support
     -   Expose SCA assets for use in scripting and Web 2.0
         applications through lightweight, Web-oriented protocols
         - ATOM and JSON-RPC
     -   Use SCA annotations in Web pages by leveraging JavaScript
         UI components to be composed on the server and returned to
         browsers or other JavaScript enabled runtimes. This allows
         SCA annotations to be used, and DOJO subroutines inserted
         to connect the UI to the back-end services.
     -   Includes security support for HTTP bindings.
   
   * Spring Framework support
     -   Support components implemented with the Spring Framework
         Version 2.5.5.  Developers can wrap applications written
         for the Spring Framework platform in the SCA composition
         model.
     -   Compose Spring applications with other types of
         applications as well as expose the Spring application via
         the various Feature Pack supported bindings
     -   Include security authorization for Spring component
         implementation
     -   Deliver transaction and security QoS for Spring Framework
         components
   
   * Service Data Objects (SDO) 2.1.1 support (provided as a
     optional feature via a separate PTF)
     -   Support as a data-binding on SCA service definitions,
         which are JSR 235 (SDO 2.1.1) compliant (requires the
         Feature Pack for XML as a prerequisite)
