ABSTRACT
 This document explains how to configure support for full n-gram parsing and tokenization in IBM OmniFind Enterprise Edition V8.5. 

CONTENT
Beginning with version 8.5, OmniFind Enterprise Edition supports full n-gram parsing and tokenization.


Overview of full n-gram parsing and tokenization 

Full n-gram parsing enables users to search documents by using a query with characters that belong to the Unicode category of symbols, such as parentheses and other syntax characters.

Full n-gram parsing and tokenization enhances n-gram search by considering special characters in both the index and the query. With full n-gram parsing and tokenization, documents that include special characters, such as AB@CD, are returned by the query ‘AB@CD’. Documents that include AB@CD are not returned by a query that specifies a wildcard character for the special characters, such as the query ‘AB%CD’.


Supported full n-gram tokenized characters

Full n-gram parsing and tokenization applies full n-gram tokenization to all characters except for white space characters (white space and tab characters) and period characters. In an enterprise search system, syntax characters are reserved for use in query syntax. To include syntax characters in a query, you must escape them. If syntax characters are not preceded by the escape character, they are treated as syntax characters in the query and are not shown in the dynamic summary.

Escape character

Use the back slash character ( \ ) as the escape character to allow syntax characters be n-gram tokenized. The escape character is available only when the full n-gram mode is enabled for the collection.

The syntax characters are: 



+ - ^ ‘ ? = ~ * “ : ( ) ‘ \ 
To apply n-gram tokenization to syntax characters, you must escape the syntax characters by preceding them with a back slash character, as shown below. You cannot escape white space and tab characters. 

\+ \- \^ \’ \? \= \~ \* \“ \: \( \) \‘ \\ 
Configuring support for full n-gram parsing and tokenization 


1. In the enterprise search administration console, select the Enable for languages that do not use blanks as word delimiters on the Create Collection page. When you create a collection, you select the type of lexical analysis that you want to use for parsing documents that are written in languages that do not use white space to delimit words. 

2. To configure support for full n-gram parsing and tokenization, edit the following annotator descriptor file, where collectionID is the ID that was specified for the collection (or that was assigned by the system) when the collection was created: 

ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/collectionID.parserdriver/specifiers/jtok.xml

3. Change the NgramMode parameter setting from normal to full. For example:

....
<nameValuePair>
<name>NgramMode</name>
<value>
<string>full</string>
</value>
</nameValuePair>
....

4. Restart the parser for your collection.

5. Configure the wildcard settings for your collection before you build the first main index.

In the enterprise search administration console, edit the Index page for your collection and select Options for Wildcard Characters. Select the Support wildcard characters in queries check box and select unrestricted in the Wildcard character position and type field.

This option allows users to search with a query that includes only one character. For example, a query for 'A' finds documents that include 'AB', 'CA', 'CAB', and so on. The ability to search with one-character queries is supported only when the wildcard character position and type is unrestricted.

If you want to specify one-character queries for fields, ensure that the target fields are enabled for wildcard queries by selecting the Support wildcard characters in queries that search fields option.

6. Add the following property to the ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/collectionID.runtime.node/runtime-genetic.properties file. For a multiple server configuration, make this change on both search servers:

....
es.runtime.textfilter=com.ibm.es.search.query.textfilter.FullNgramFilter
....

7. Restart the search server (or search servers) for your collection.
