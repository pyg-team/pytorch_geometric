APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Content Collector does not support stubbing of digitally
   signed Microsoft Exchange messages.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you used IBM Content Collector to archive Microsoft Exchange
   messages and you configured the EC Collect Email by Rules
   collector or the EC Create Email Stub task to ignore encrypted
   items, both encrypted items and clear signed items were
   excluded from processing. The EC Create Email Stub task marked
   the messages as being stubbed, even though the content of the
   message was not stubbed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, messages that are signed with the
   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (SMIME) protocol
   (messages of class IPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned) are
   recognized as being clear signed and are no longer considered
   encrypted. The stubbing option "Remove nothing and add text" is
   not supported for clear signed messages. The stubbing options
   "Remove attachments", "Remove attachments and cut body", and
   "Remove attachments and body" change the message class to
   IPM.Note, so that the icon that is displayed for the message in
   Outlook and Outlook Web App changes and the stub is no longer
   signed. Clear signed messages that were marked as being stubbed
   before this fix was applied are not reprocessed automatically.
   To remove content according to the stubbing lifecycle, restore
   the message, so that it is selected for stubbing by the EC
   Process Email Stubbing Life Cycle collector.
   
   If you use the offline repository feature or if Content
   Collector is configured to retrieve and display message when
   opened, you must install the fix pack 2.2.0.1-IBM-ICC-OE-FP001
   to ensure proper handling of clear signed messages that were
   stubbed after applying this fix.
