ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Defect: wsdbu00268676
   
   We are using  IBM Infosphere warehouse 9.7 edition . We are
   using the SQL workbench feature of Infosphere Design Studio  to
   build the flows and populate the data in our warehouse.
   
   We are using Generic JDBC connection to connect to a third party
   data modeling (EII) tool and pull out that data.
   When connecting using this connector we are not able to see the
   Source Models reflected properly in the Infosphere Warehouse
   Design Studio for building the flows.
   
   The root issue seems to be that InfoSphere Design Studio 9.7 is
   not properly reverse engineering the source Model when using
   this JDBC Connector.
   
   Our third party data modeling tool is optimized for Java 1.5.In
   fact when using that tool to connect to Database from Eclipse, I
   used to start the eclipse specifying the VM args pointing to
   JRE-1.5. As Infosphere warehouse Edition uses Java 1.6
   exclusively , so we unable to get the reverse Engineered Source
   Model appropriately.
   
   Expected Results:
   The Reverse Engineering should work properly using the Reverse
   Engineering Wizard.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Drag the schema from the Data Source Explorer and drop it in
   Data Project Explorer's Data Model folder under the Data Design
   Project.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Design Studio v9.7 is not correctly reverse engineering the
   source model when using generic JDBC connector.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This is resolved in Data Studio Tools v2.2.2.1.
