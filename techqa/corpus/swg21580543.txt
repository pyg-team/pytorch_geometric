Title: IBM Error: CWPST1015W: <Plugin name> failed to install.  Signature status is unknown due to error - United States

Text:
Install; plugins; CWPST1015W; signature status TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You have a third party plugin that is signed and added into the notes installation process. However it fails during the Installation process with a provisioning error similar to the following: 

 * 
 * Verifying: <Plugin name>
 * Unexpected results have occurred during the provisioning operation. For additional information, please refer to the logs: ...\Notes\Data\workspace\logs

SYMPTOM
Unable to install customized plugin. 



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This SEVERE error was observed in the trace-log-0.xml file... 

 * 
 * 
 * CWPST1015W: <Plugin name> failed to install. The reason provided is CWPST1009E: Signature status is unknown due to error
 * 

and the cause was listed as:  * 
 * Caused by: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: No algorithm found for 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error deals with Eclipse and Java 7 and signing. It is caused by a change to the behavior of the jar signer tool in Java 7. Previously it used an algorithm called SHA-1 (Secure Hashing Algorithm) as the default, but now JAVA 7 uses a different one, SHA256. This is the problem, because Eclipse doesn't recognize that algorithm. This is the pertinent error from the tracelogs: 

 

 * No algorithm found for 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1
 * 

The number reveals that they are the signature of SHA256. This signature is unknown to the relevant Eclipse class, which is org.eclipse.osgi.internal.signedcontent.PKCS7Processor (or theSignedContentConstants class that defines the available algorithms). 

To resolve the issue, you must use the the 1.6 JDK, which includes a .jar signer that defaults to SHA-1. Refer to the following link for more information regarding Java 6, Platform Names and Version Numbers.
