ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An access violation FDC is reported by a WebSphere MQ v7
   unmanaged .Net client when opening an object with MQOD version
   less than 2.
   
   A snippet of the FDC is as follows:
   
   Probe Id :- XC130031
   Component :- xehExceptionHandler
   Major Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC
   Minor Errorcode :- OK
   Comment1 :- Access Violation at address 1CF13000 when reading
   
   The FDC function stack is as follows:
   UnmanagedNmqiMQ.MQCONNX(String,MQConnectOptions,Phconn,out
   int,out int)
   UnmanagedNmqiMQ.MQCONNX(String,ref MQCNO,Hconn,Phconn,out
   int,out int)
   UnmanagedHconn.UpdateHconn(UnmanagedNmqiMQ,Phconn)
   UnmanagedNmqiMQ.MQOPEN(Hconn,MQObjectDescriptor,int,Phobj,out
   int,out int)
   MQOPEN

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere MQ v7 unmanaged .Net Client applications
   which use MQOD version less than 2 to access queues.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When an unmanaged .Net application tries to open a queue with
   MQOD version set to 1, internally, an attempt is made to access
   a field that is not a part of version 1 MQOD resulting in an
   access violation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A condition check was added to ensure that the queue manager
   does not try to access fields corresponding to MQOD version 2
   when the client uses MQOD version 1.
