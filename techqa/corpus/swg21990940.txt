Title: IBM Cognos TM1 Certificate Expiry - FAQ - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 On November 24th 2016 the bundled/default/pre-configured TM1 SSL certificate will expire (APPLIX certificates). This means all connections to the TM1 Server will be refused hence causing a perceived major outage.

TM1 has historically bundled certificates to make certain every client has SSL enabled and communication between clients and the data server are secured. This is against the norm in that most vendors have transferred ownership of SSL Configuration to their customer base. The TM1 team has taken a different view of simplifying the ability to have secured communication while allowing for customer owned custom certificates to be used as well. This ensures all of our customer regardless of skill level and understanding will achieve secure communication.

While this is a very good thing, once every 10 years the certificates expire and we are forced to react quickly to prevent a mass outage. The team has been working hard to ensure the best possible experience for customers prior to certificates expiration. This FAQ has been compiled with anticipated questions and answers, to help customers understand, resolve and prevent expiring certificate issues.

When do the TM1 Certificate expire?  * The default TM1 (APPLIX) certificates expire on November 24 2016



Why are the TM1 Certificates expiring?  * Certificates are created with an expiration in mind. They may be due to policy, standards changing, or simply the license authority wanting fees to renew. The pre-contained certificates provided by IBM are self-signed, typically with a 10yr life span. As SSL encryption evolves so to does the need to update certificates to ensure the latest encryption methods are adhered to. The APPLIX certificate was created on Nov 27, 2006 whereas encryption methods have evolved greatly since that time



Who is affected by TM1 Certificate expiration?  * All non-cloud TM1 Customers who are NOT using custom certificates or have NOT updated to the TM1 v2 certificates WILL be affected. If you rely on the bundled/default/pre-configured APPLIX certificates - they WILL expire November 24 2016



What TM1 Versions will be affected?  * All versions of TM1 are affected by the certificate expiry. See 'How do I know if this affects my organization?' to determine if / how you need to react



How do I know if this affects my organization?  * The easiest way to check if you will be affected:  * Log on to the box where your TM1 Admin Server is running 
    * Open Cognos Configuration (for TM1) 
    * Click on the 'TM1 Admin Server' entry and in Explorer pane 
    * Look at the 'Certificate File Location' parameter  * If blank, you have NOT configured TM1 for Option 3 (Custom Certificates) 
       * If blank, you WILL be affected by the SSL certificate expiry
      
      
    * Look at the 'TM1 Admin Server Certificate Version'  * If '1', you have NOT configured TM1 for Option 4 (v2 Certificates) 
       * If '1', you WILL be affect be the SSL certificate expiry
      
      
   
   
 * Additional ways to confirm:  * If you have configured TM1 for Option 3 (Custom Certificates) you will have the following entries in your tm1s.cfg file  * SSLCertAuthority= 
       * SSLCertificate= 
       * SSLCertificateID=
      
      
    * If you have configured TM1 for Option 4 (v2 Certificates) you will have the following entry in your tm1s.cfg file  * CertificateVersion=2
      
      
   
   



Can the Certificate Expiration be delayed?  * No! Once a certificate expiration date has been defined and built into a certificate, the date cannot change or be extended without invalidating the certificate



Can old and new certificates be used?  * No! The certificates must remain consistent and trusted in order to achieve secured communication.
