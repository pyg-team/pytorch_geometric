PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ITCAM Applications ITCAM_Application.ear and DATAQuery.ear missing after custom managing server installation. 

SYMPTOM
After performing a custom installation of the ITCAM managing server there could be missing ITCAM applications in the WebSphere. 


CAUSE
There is a property in WebSphere - soap.client.props file for DM & Node level which controls the time out for JACL for application installation. The value may need to be increased to allow the ITCAM applications to be installed in the WebSphere. 

ENVIRONMENT
UNIX/Websphere

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Look in the trace-install.logs for these messages:


<Trace Level="INFO"> 
<Time Millis="1251727556152"> 2009-08-31 10:05:56.152-04:00</Time>

<Principal>livlpscimw7/10.249.56.108</Principal> 
</Trace> 

Also look in the wsadmin.traceout: 

[9/1/09 17:39:52:395 EDT] 0000000a AbstractShell E WASX7120E: 
Diagnostic information from exception with text 
"com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.ConnectorException 
org.apache.soap.SOAPException: [SOAPException: 
faultCode=SOAP-ENV:Client; msg=Read timed out; 
targetException=java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out] 
" follows: 

These messages indicate a timeout. Increase the value in soap.client.props and try the installation again. 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Edit the soap.client.props file in DM & Node level in WebSphere to increase the value to something like 1200 seconds.
