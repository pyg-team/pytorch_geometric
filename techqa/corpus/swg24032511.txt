ABSTRACT
 Download the IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1 firmware upgrade. You can also download the client, which is required for WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance to work 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This firmware release includes improved capability and new features for WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1. 

Caution: After you upgrade either 9235-92X or 7199-92X appliance types with Version 2.1 firmware, you cannot roll back to any previous firmware version. You must operate at the Version 2.1 or higher firmware level. 

When you are upgrading to Version 2.1, you cannot run a firmware upgrade on a collective that is currently servicing workload. When you upgrade a collective from a previous major version of DataPower XC10 Appliance, all of the data, not including your configuration, that was loaded into the data grids is lost. In addition, all members of the collective must be upgraded to the same major version (Version 2.1.0.x) before service can be restored. Upgrades between fix packs, for example, versions 2.1.0.0 to 2.1.0.1, can be done with no loss of service and while servicing workload as long as each appliance is upgraded individually and you wait for the upgraded appliance to reboot and re-replicate before proceeding to upgrade the next appliance. When you are running firmware upgrades on the appliances in a collective from a version prior to 2.1, the appliance that you upgrade does not fully restart until all of the appliances in the collective are upgraded to Version 2.1. 

You must complete the firmware upgrade process on one appliance before starting the process on another appliance within the collective. Do not make any configuration changes until all of the appliances are on the same firmware level. See Updating the firmware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wdpxc/v2r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/aa/aat_updating_firmware.html] in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Information Center, for more information.

For IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance to work with WebSphere Application Server or clients in a stand-alone environment, you must install the WebSphere eXtreme Scale Client or package the client Java archive (JAR) files with your application. You can download the client from this document as well.

Client installation: If you have a previous version of the client, an upgrade is not available. Use IBM Installation Manager to install the full version of the client.
