APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Executing a  Test scenario fails with an error saying 'An error
   has occurred while deploying the XOM to Rule Execution
   Server...'
   whereas there is no XOM to deploy (project is based on XSD)
   and in the log, we can see the following information:

   nullilog.rules.teamserver.model.IlrXOMDeploymentException: An
   error has occurred while deploying the XOM to Rule Execution
   Server 'Execution Server'. If the Rule Execution Server is not
   deployed on the same server and port as the Decision Runner,
   the RES_URL init parameter of the Decision Runner web
   application must be set to the URL of the Rule Execution Server.
    Contact your administrator.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Uncheck the option "enable XOM management" in Decision Center
   from the Decision Service properties.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Decision Center always tries to collect xom information for the
   project being deployed. When no XOM is deployed then this
   exception may  happen
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  the code is fixed
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
