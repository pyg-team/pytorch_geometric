 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Excel format options for reports on the properties of the Run with Options, Schedule and Run options missing. When all excel options are missing, one can choose only between HTML and PDF. 

CAUSE
There are two possible causes:
1) configuration files (system.xml) from an earlier CRN version can cause this behaviour
2) the system.xml had been edited earlier and the excel options had been deactivated

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
for scenario 1)
Recover the original system.xml which comes with your edition of CRN.

for scenario 2)
Backup of the system.xml before making any changes.
Using a XML editor, check the following in the system.xml file located in the <install directory>/templates/ps/portal/ directory if set to false set to true.

<!-- Enables/disables support for the various excel formats -->
<param name="enable-excel-support">true</param>
<!-- Enables/disables support for csv formats -->
<param name="enable-csv-support">true</param>
Once this is done, save the xml file and re-start Reportnet
