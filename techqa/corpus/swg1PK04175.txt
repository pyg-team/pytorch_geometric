PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of DB2 Administration Tool,  who run   *
   *                 GEN to produce DDL for CREATE TRIGGER, may   *
   *                 be affected.                                 *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: DB2 Administration Tool was generating  *
   *                      invalid trigger syntax when the trigger *
   *                      contained a "referencing" clause. Error *
   *                      manifested by creating three part names *
   *                      in the where clause. In addition, the   *
   *                      "referencing" correlation-name was seen *
   *                      within a column definition prefix.      *
   *                      .*                                      *
   *                      In some circumstances, the created DDL  *
   *                      was in error because columns listed in  *
   *                      the UPDATE OF clause were qualified.    *
