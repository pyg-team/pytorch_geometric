ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ODBC Connector jobs connecting to Sybase ASE Database would
   abort with the following cryptic error message whenever
   EnableBulkLoad is set and the input data has NULL values. The
   error message would be of the following pattern:
   
   ODBC function "SQLExecute" reported:  SQLSTATE = HY000: Native
   Error Code = 4,837: Msg = [IBM(DataDirect OEM)][ODBC Sybase
   Wire Protocol driver][SQL Server]Bad row data received from the
   client while bulk copying into object 2044595016 partition
   2044595016 in database 4. Received a row of length 22 whilst
   maximum or expected row length is 6.
   (CC_OdbcDBStatement::executeInsert, file
   CC_OdbcDBStatement.cpp, line 829)
   
   This is a problem with the DataDirect Sybase ASE ODBC Driver
   and this has been fixed in the driver version: 07.16.0210
