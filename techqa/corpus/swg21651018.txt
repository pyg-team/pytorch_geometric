QUESTION
 What are the changes in the JDE activities in Cast Iron? Specifically, what are the JDE activities supported in Cast Iron 6.3.0.0, how do I configure the functionality of the JDE activities present in Cast Iron version 6.1.x.x /6.0.0.x/5.x/4.x with the current version (6.3.0.0) of Cast Iron, and how can I migrate a project for use in 6.3.0.0? 

CAUSE
Restructuring of activities of the JDE connector in Cast Iron version 6.3.0.0

ANSWER



Supported activities: 

 

Cast Iron version 
6.0.0.x/5.x/4.x

Activity name Cast Iron version
6.3.0.0

Activity name(s) Invoke Business Function Invoke Business Function Poll Real-Time Events Supported scenarios for projects containing JDE activities from Cast Iron version 6.1.x.x /6.0.0.x/5.x/4.x 

Open an earlier project (6.1.x.x or earlier) containing JDE activities in Studio 6.1.x.x and then publish the project on the appliance version 6.3.0.0. 

For an old connector project containing JDE activities to work on the new 6.3.0.0 studio/appliance/cloud environment, an additional library file called jdbj.ini from the JDE server needs to be added to the standard set of libraries. 

The deployed project works as expected. 

1. Take a par file (built using 6.1.x.x or an earlier version of studio) containing JDE activities and deploy it directly on the appliance version 6.3.0.0. The project works as expected. 

2. Upgrade a 6.1.x.x appliance (running JDE projects) to the appliance 6.3.0.0. All the projects containing JDE activities work as expected. 

3. Open an earlier project (6.1.x.x or earlier) containing JDE activities in WebSphere Cast Iron Studio version 6.3.0.0. To migrate this open project, complete the following steps. 

Migrating a project containing JDE activities created in Cast Iron version 6.1.x.x/6.0.0.x/5.x/4.x, to be used in Cast Iron version 6.3.0.0 

1. Ensure that you take a backup of the project. Open the project in WebSphere Cast Iron studio version 6.3.0.0 

2. Make a note of the objects used in each of the JDE activities present in the orchestrations of the project. 

3. Delete each of the JDE activities present in the orchestrations. 

4. Create the JDE endpoint and the required activities. Also, complete the necessary mappings for each of the activities. 

5. Save the project and complete the basic testing to validate the changes. 


Note: A project/orchestration containing JDE activities available in Cast Iron versions 6.1.x.x/6.0.0.x/5.x/4.x and also JDE activities present in Cast Iron version 6.3.0.0 is not a valid scenario. The project should contain either the JDE activities from 6.1.x.x/ 6.0.0.x/5/x/4.x or from 6.3.0.0.
