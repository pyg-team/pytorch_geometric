APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using a Java managed XOM in RES, the parsing of the
   ruleset may cause unnecessary DNS lookups that can cause
   parsing time to be much longer than really needed.
   Taking thread dumps during ruleset parsing could show:
   Java callstack:
     at java/net/Inet4AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(Native Method)
     at java/net/InetAddress$1.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:
   1020)
     at java/net/InetAddress.getAddressesFromNameService(
   InetAddress.java:1431)
     at java/net/InetAddress.getAllByName0(InetAddress.java:1379)
     at java/net/InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1292)
     at java/net/InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1217(
   Compiled Code))
     at java/net/InetAddress.getByName(InetAddress.java:1167(
   Compiled Code))
     at java/net/URLStreamHandler.getHostAddress(URLStreamHandler.
   java:454(Compiled Code))
      (entered lock:
   com/ibm/rules/res/urlhandler/PreLoadedURLStreamHandler@0x0000000
   7F30EC160, entry count: 1)
   ...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  use unmanaged XOM or make sure that dns lookups are fast in the
   environment where RES is running
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  during class loading using managed XOM the resuri  url are
   resolved and this can take time to proceed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  resuri do not need to resolved they are for internal usage in
   the RES. The code is modified to suppress this  feature.
