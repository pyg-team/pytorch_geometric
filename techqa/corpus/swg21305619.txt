Title: IBM WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files terminates during the polling operation with Synchronous Interaction style setting - United States

Text:
Flat File Adapter Inbound Module; Synchronous Interaction Style TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files V6.0.2, when the synchronous Interaction Style setting is used and a ServiceRuntimeException is generated at the endpoint, the adapter terminates; however, the adapter should continue to poll and generate the exception. 

CAUSE
Because the adapter is using Synchronous Interaction style mode, which is a synchronous method of communication, if any error or exception occurs at the endpoint, the request is not processed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install the latest Fix Pack for Adapter for Flat Files Version 6.0.2.
