QUESTION
 Do the Policy functions BatchDelete and BatchUpdate operate against Internal DataTypes? 

CAUSE
Official documentation states: 

 * 
 * 
 * internal
 * 


and: 

 * 
 * internal
 * 


This is incorrect. 


ANSWER
Yes, the Policy functions BatchDelete and BatchUpdate do operate against Internal DataTypes. 


This was addressed in Impact 3.1 Fix Pack 5 (APARs IY90134 & IY88386 ) onwards.

We are seeking to correct future documentation in this regard.
