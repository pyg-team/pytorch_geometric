   Pack.
   
   The CICS Transaction Server for z/OS Version 4 release 1
   Messages and Codes manual (GC34-7035-00) will have the
   following messages added or replaced;
   
   
   DFHCZ0400  DATE TIME APPLID USERID TERMID
             TRANID PROGRAM NAME  JVMSERVER THREAD WAS
             CANCELED IN  MODULE  BECAUSE THE JVMSERVER IS
             DISABLING.
   
   EXPLANATION:  The current JVMSERVER thread has been
   canceled because the JVMSERVER is disabling.
   
   SYSTEM ACTION:  CICS writes this message to the TD queue
   CCZM.
   
   USER RESPONSE:  No action
   
   DESTINATION:  CCZM
   
   MODULE:  DFJCZDTC (DTCSupport.c)
   
   XMEOUT PARAMETERS: date, time, applid,
   userid, termid, tranid, program
   name, module
   
   ****************************************************************
   
   DFHSJ0206  DATE TIME APPLID  THE RUNTIME
             OPTIONS SPECIFIED IN DFHJVMRO ARE TOO LONG. THE
             LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT ENCLAVE CANNOT BE
             INITIALIZED.  THE JVM WAS NOT STARTED.
   
   EXPLANATION:  The Language Environment runtime options
   specified in DFHJVMRO are too long. The options specified in
   DFHJVMRO are concatenated with runtime options required by
   CICS for use when initializing the Language Environment
   enclave. The total length of the runtime options that may be
   specified cannot exceed 255 characters.
   
   SYSTEM ACTION:  The JVM is not started. Exception trace
   point SJ 0225 is issued.
   
   USER RESPONSE:  Data 1 in the exception trace shows the
   Language Environment runtime options from DFHJVMRO. Data 2
   shows the Language Environment runtime options provided by
   CICS.
   
   Examine the options from DFHJVMRO. Remove any unnecessary
   options and if possible abbreviate any Language Environment
   runtime options in your source for DFHJVMRO. Assemble and
   re-link DFHJVMRO after making your changes.
   
   If CICS has not been restarted since the failure you will
   need to use CEMT SET PROGRAM(DFHJVMRO) NEWCOPY before
   attempting to restart the JVM.
   
   DESTINATION:  CSMT
   
   MODULE:  DFHSJIN
   
   XMEOUT PARAMETERS: date, time, applid

              JVMSERVER  IS BEING DISABLED DUE TO A
              {PHASEOUT |   PURGE |   FORCEPURGE |
               KILL}  REQUEST.
   
   EXPLANATION:  A JVMSERVER resource is disabling but cannot
   complete at this time as in-flight work is outstanding.
   
   SYSTEM ACTION:  CICS will disable the JVMSERVER resource
   when the in-flight activity has completed.
   
   USER RESPONSE:  None.
   
   DESTINATION:  CSMT
   
   MODULE:  DFHSJJS

             HAS FAILED, FOR JVMSERVER  JVMSERVER .
   
   EXPLANATION:  An attempt to locate the  method_name
   method with signature  signature  within the the class
    classname  has failed for JVMSERVER  jvmserver . An
   exception is output to the standard error stream.
   
   SYSTEM ACTION:  CICS was unable to run the specified
   method of the given class in the JVMSERVER and returns an
   error to the calling module.
   
   USER RESPONSE:  Use the exception output from the standard
   error stream to determine the cause of the problem.

             CREATED} .
   
   EXPLANATION:  An attempt to attach to a JVMSERVER failed.
   
   SYSTEM ACTION:  An error response is passed back to the
   caller of DFHSJJI.
   
   USER RESPONSE:  Check that the paramters passed to DFHSJJI
   were valid and that the target JVMSERVER is enabled. If an
   application running within the JVMSERVER failed then locate
   the diagnostics for that problem.
   
   If the problem persists you might need to use the trace
   facility to determine the cause of the problem.
