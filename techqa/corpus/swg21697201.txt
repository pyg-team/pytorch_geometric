 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL that is used by IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Transactions. These issues were disclosed on January 8, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.

CVSS Base Score: 2.600
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99710] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3571]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when handling malicious messages. By sending a specially-crafted DTLS message, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault.

CVSS Base Score: 5.000
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99703] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99705] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8275 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8275]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the modification of the fingerprint without breaking the signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.

CVSS Base Score: 1.200
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99709] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 4.300
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.

CVSS Base Score: 2.100
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99708] for more information

CVE-ID: CVE-2015-0206 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0206]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function. By sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory resources.

CVSS Base Score: 5.000
