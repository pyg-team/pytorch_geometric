CVEID: CVE-2016-6816 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1

CVEID: CVE-2016-8745 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector when the Connector code for Tomcat 8.5.x is refactored. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain the session ID and the response body.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
