APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  By default the Virtual Application Instance deployment ID is
   used in the MQ data directory path and MQ data is removed when
   updating the IBM MQ Virtual System Instance.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This affects users of IBM Pure Application System
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   By default the MQ Data directory includes the deployment id so
   that Queue Manager log directories are separated for each
   deployed instanced. On deletion of the Virtual Instance the MQ
   data tree is deleted as part of the clean-up.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM MQ Pattern now includes an option so that the user may elect
   to manage their MQ data directory manually. If is option is
   selected, then the IBM MQ data directory will be set to the
   value specified in the pattern (the deployment Id will not be
   used) and the GPFS directory structures will not be deleted when
   the Virtual Instance is deleted.
