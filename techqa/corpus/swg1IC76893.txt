APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Permission is
   denied when trying to delete a subdirectory that is defined
   under the local:/// directory.
   
   The user group's access profile is defined with the following
   settings:
   
     */*/*?Access=r
     */TestDomain/device/create-dir?Name=.*&Directory=.*&Access=x
     */TestDomain/device/remove-dir?Name=.*&Directory=.*&Access=x
     */TestDomain/file/local?Access=r+w+a+d+x
   
   The above settings should allow the following:
   
     - Read privilege to all objects on the box.
     - Privilege to create subdirectories under the local folder in
       the TestDomain.
     - Privilege to delete subdirectories under the local folder in
       the TestDomain.
     - Read, write, add, delete and execute privileges to all files
       under the local directory in the TestDomain.
   
   However, attempts to delete a subdirectory defined under local
   results in a permission denied message.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround for the delete folder issue is to change the
   following access profile setting from:
   
     */*/*?Access=r
   
   to:
   
     */*/*?Access=r+x
   
   However, this grants execute privileges to all objects on the
   appliance.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  User is unable to delete a subdirectory that is defined under
   local:/// even though the user belongs to a user group with
   access settings that permits delete of directories under the
   local folder in the specified domain.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 3.8.0.14, 3.8.1.14, 3.8.2.5, 4.0.1.2
