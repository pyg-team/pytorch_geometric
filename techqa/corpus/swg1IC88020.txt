APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XSD files located on a server not supporting RFC5746, secure
   renegotiation can not be retrieved by Datapower. Datapower
   always requires secure renegotiation to be supported. The SSL
   Proxy Profile controling this is not configurable.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There are  several work arounds for this issue.
   
   1) change the connection to backend server serving xsd files
   to HTTP
   2) Enable RFC5746 support on the backend server
   3) locate the xsd files local to the Datapower Appliance
   4) Modify the Datapower appliance so that the connection to
   backend server is not directly accessed by the WSP
   configuration on Datapower.  Modify the WSP configureation to
   connect through Datapower appliance first. For example the
   connection would be from the WSP to a Datapower front side
   handler for a MPGW. Configure the MPGW SSL proxy to allow
   connectivity to a insecure SSL server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A new configurable SSL Proxy will be added to default domain and
   used for retrieving remote Schemata (instead "system-default").
   
   By default it does not allow connections to insecure SSL servers
   and results in the same error logged as before, just with a
   different SSL Proxy name:
   yyymmddThhmmssZ [ssl][error]
   sslproxy(system-wsgw-management-loopback): tid(.....): SSL
   handshake aborted due to detection of insecure SSL server
   
   Setting "Allow connection to insecure SSL" to "On" for
   system-wsgw-management-loopback will allow Web Service Proxies
   to retrieve Schemata from an insecure SSL server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix will be available in next major releases.
