Title: IBM Problems with exporting data from SPSS into MySQL - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS for Windows and I'm having some problems trying to export data out of SPSS into MySQL database with the Save Translate command syntax. Using the recommended 3.51 MySQL ODBC driver, I cannot export dates or numeric fields with decimals defined. All of the numeric values with decimals export to MySQL as zeros, and variables defined as dates do not export at all, and the following warning appears in the Output Viewer:

>Warning # 6480. Text: MYDATE
>Variable has been dropped - it's type is not supported by the data base

How do I work around this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The behavior changes depending on the driver - however, other applications, such as Access, can successfully export to MySQL using both drivers.

If you are using the mySQL ODBC driver version 3.51, you cannot save date or datetime fields to MySQL. You will recieve an error message saying that the type is not supported by the database.

If you try to export time formats, or non-integer data (F8.2) data, SPSS will create a field defined as double, but all the data will be set to 0.

If you use the 2.5 driver, it can successfully export date and datetime fields, but non-integer and time data still saves as zeros.

This has been corrected in Statistics 17.0.1 and we apologize for any inconvenience
