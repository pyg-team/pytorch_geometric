QUESTION
 How do I configure R GUI for use with R, nzMatrix (NZM), and nzAnalytics (NZA)? 

ANSWER
This document describes how to configure R GUI to work with IBM Netezza Analytics (formerly Netezza i-Class) R, nzAnalytics, and nzMatrix functions. 
Prerequisites

The following server software must be installed:


 * Netezza 6.0 
 * IBM Netezza Analytics Beta 4 version or later 


The following client software should be downloaded on your system: 
 * NZODBC package 
 * R GUI version 2.10 or later 


R GUI packages: 
 * e1071 
 * tree 
 * caTools 
 * bitops 
 * RODBC 


Procedure 

Assuming that you have already installed the server components, do the following on your client system: 
1. Install the nzodbc package. 

2. Install the correct version of the R GUI (which is R 2.10.1 as of this writing). 

3. Copy the iclassbetaRGUI-1.0.0.7.zip file to the machine on which you are running the R GUI and unzip the file. The following three files will then reside in either the Linux or Windows directory, depending on your platform: 
 * nzr_0.6.2-76 
 * nzmatrix_0.4.1-76 
 * nza_0.4.0-76 


4. Use the R GUI to install the packages (Packages|Install package(s) from local zip files...). 

5. You can run a test of Netezza R plugins by running the following commands under R GUI. 

Note: The ODBC driver and server software must already be configured. 
 * library (nzr) 
 * demo (nzr) 
 * library (nza) 
 * demo (nza) 
 * library (nzmatrix) 
 * demo (nzmatrix)


These commands will load Netezza R libraries and demonstrate IBM Netezza Analytics R, nzAnalytics and nzMatrix components.
