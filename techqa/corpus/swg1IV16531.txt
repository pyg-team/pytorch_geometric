APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Autonomous Agents using private situations have EIF emitter
   functionality for sending event information directly from the
   Agent to an EIF receiver (OMNIbus for example). When using the
   EIF emitter functionality, there was not a mechanism to bind to
   a particular interface on a multi-honed machine.
   In that configuration, it was possible that EIF events could not
   be delivered because they were sent on a local network
   interface that could not route to the destination server.
   
   The EIF emitter library was enhanced to add access to the
   KDEB_INTERFACELIST environment variable, which sets the local IP
   address interface.
