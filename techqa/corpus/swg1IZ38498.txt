PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ORACLE_LISTENER_CRIT SHOWS LISTENER IN A WRONG STATE
      Additional Information: The listener status on the Tivoli
   Enterprise
      Portal Server is displayed as "Inactive", when the value of
      ORACLE_HOME is very long. The listener information cannot be
      retrieved, because the output of "ps" command is truncated to
   80
      characters on Solaris.
