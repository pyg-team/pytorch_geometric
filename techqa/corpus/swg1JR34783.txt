ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, the Dimensions
   and Reports widgets do not always correctly resize when the
   browser window is resized.  Here is an example scenario
   illustrating the resizing issues:
   
   1. Add the Dimensions or Reports widget to a page.
   2. Use Internet Explorer Version 6 to display the page in a
   non-maximized window of a smaller size.
   3. Maximize the browser window.  The widget resizes correctly.
   4. Restore the browser window to its previous size using the
   Restore button.  The widget does not correctly resize, and
   a horizontal scroll bar appears at the bottom of the
   widget.
   5. In some cases, you can drag the lower right corner of the
   browser window to slowly increase the size the window until
   the horizontal scroll bar disappears.
