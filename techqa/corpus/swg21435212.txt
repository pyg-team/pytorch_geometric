QUESTION
 Why is the X-Press Update Server in Offline status? 

ANSWER
If there is a communication problem between the X-Press Update Server and the Agent Manager, the server will be listed as Offline in the SiteProtector Console. The X-Press Update server communicates with the Agent Manager over TCP port 3995 and must heartbeat into an Agent Manager.

First, start the troubleshooting by restarting the SiteProtector Web Server Service (on the Application Server system) and IssDaemon service (on the Agent Manager server), in most cases it resolves the issue by forcing the XUS to contact the Agent Manager.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, make sure that TCP port 3995 is open between the X-Press Update Server and the Agent Manager. You can telnet on port 3995 to the Agent Manager IP from the XUS server.

Next, if TCP port 3995 is not restricted, but the Update Server is still Offline, check the trust level settings. If it is set to first-time trust do the following to download a new pem certificate:


 * Rename the existing .pem certificate to .pem.old following file from the following location:

 *  \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\ webserver\Apache2\bin\leafcerts\ _ .pem 
   
   Example: 172.16.5.36_3995.pem to 172.16.5.36_3995.pem.old 

 * Restart the SiteProtector Web Server service.


If the X-Press Update Server does not change to an Active status, follow the steps below to ensure it is heartbeating to a valid Agent Manager: 

 * Locate the following XML file on the X-Press Update Server machine:
    * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\Apache2\conf\UpdateServerGroupSettings.xml
      
   
   
 * Edit the file with a text editor, and in the tag, make sure the host-name attribute lists the correct IP address for the Agent Manager where it should be heartbeating into. Also, ensure the Agent Manager in question is Active in the SiteProtector Console. If you change the file to reflect the correct IP address, save the file and then restart the SiteProtector Web Server service.
