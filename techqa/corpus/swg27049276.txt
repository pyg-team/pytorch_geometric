Administrators should be aware of this service restart to schedule maintenance time appropriately. It is possible for the administrator to prevent a software update to a critical business asset or server from the WinCollect agent list on the Admin tab. To prevent a host from being updated, the Enable Automatic Updates field must be set to false before you install the SFS file to the Console. For more information, see http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21685330 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21685330].

For QRadar 7.2.x Consoles: 720_QRadar_wincollectupdate-7.2.0.445.sfs [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Other+software/IBM+Security+QRadar+SIEM&release=7.2.0&platform=Linux&function=fixId&fixids=7.2.0-QRADAR-720_QRadar_wincollectupdate-7.2.0.445.sfs&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc]

NOTE: Due to QRadar 7.1.x being end of engineering, there is no WinCollect 7.1.x SFS file being released to upgrade to WinCollect 7.2.5. Administrators interested in installing WinCollect 7.2.5 must upgrade their QRadar deployment to the QRadar 7.2 software version. No QRadar 7.1.x upgrade files are being offered to upgrade to WinCollect 7.2.5. Wait for installs to complete and update the user interface to WinCollect 7.2.5.  *

Download a WinCollect Agent (v7.2.5) bundle (.SFS) from the IBM Fix Central website for your QRadar version: 720_QRadar_wincollectupdate-7.2.0.445.sfs [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Other+software/IBM+Security+QRadar+SIEM&release=7.2.0&platform=Linux&function=fixId&fixids=7.2.0-QRADAR-720_QRadar_wincollectupdate-7.2.0.445.sfs&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc]
       
       Note: The installation process will restart services on the Console, which will create a gap in event collection until services restart. Administrators should be aware of the service restart so they can schedule their upgrades during a maintenance window.
       
       
    2. Using SSH, log in to your Console as the root user. 
    3. Copy the fix pack to the /tmp directory on the QRadar Console. If space in the /tmp directory is limited, copy the fix pack to another location that has sufficient space. 
    4. To create the /media/updates directory, type the following command:mkdir -p /media/updates 
    5. Change to the directory where you copied the patch file. For example, cd /tmp 
    6. To mount the patch file to the /media/updates directory, type one of the following commands: mount -o loop -t squashfs 720_QRadar_wincollectupdate-7.2.0.445.sfs /media/updates 
    7. To run the patch installer, type the following command: /media/updates/installer

    8. To continue with the update, type Y to continue.
       
       During the update, the SFS installs new protocol updates. If your Secure Shell (SSH) session is disconnected while the upgrade is in progress, the upgrade continues. When you reopen your SSH session and rerun the installer, the patch installation resumes. After the installation is complete, services are restarted and the user interface is available. 
       
       Note: By default, agents request configuration updates every 10 minutes if the WinCollect agent has Enable Automatic Updates set to true.
