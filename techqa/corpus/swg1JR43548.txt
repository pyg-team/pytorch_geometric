ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cognos Report Studio can be used to add prompts
   (user-selectable filters on dimensions) to a Cognos Report
   Viewer widget (accessible in Business Space, supplied by IBM
   Business Monitor).  The Show Instances function, however, when
   executed on this widget, does not filter instances displayed in
   a wired Instances widget based on the filters selected in the
   prompts.

   Support for the Show Instances function is being added for
   prompts that meet the following conditions:
   - The filter includes no more than one prompt (dimension).
   - The filter includes one of the following operators: "=",
   "in", or "not in".
   - If a date dimension is specified, the year, month, and day
   (in that order) must be included.
   This support will be included in future maintenance releases
   of IBM Business Monitor Version 7.5.1 and Version 8.0.
