Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on March 1, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs including the “DROWN: Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption" vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0800 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0800]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. By using a server that supports SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to decrypt TLS sessions between clients and non-vulnerable servers. This vulnerability is also known as the DROWN attack.

CVEID: CVE-2016-0797 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0797]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111142] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-0799 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0799]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory error in the BIO_*printf() functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted data to trigger an out-of-bounds read.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111143] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-0704 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0704]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. The s2_srvr.c code overwrites the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Bleichenbacher oracle to decrypt sessions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111146] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-0702 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover RSA keys.
CVSS Base Score: 2.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-0703 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0703]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to enforce that a clear-key-length value is 0 for non-export ciphers by the SSLv2 's2_srvr.c code. When clear-key bytes displace encrypted-key bytes, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct a divide-and-conquer key recovery attack.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111145] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2842 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2842]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds by the doapr_outch function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted string to cause an out-of-bounds write or consume an overly large amount of resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111304 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111304] for the current score
