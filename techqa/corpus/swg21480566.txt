 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When running the SPSS License Authorization Wizard on any IBM SPSS software product, I encounter one of the following errors:

Error Code: 106
You are not allowed to generate any more new licenses.
Express2LS

Lock Code:
Authorization Code:

OR

Authorization in progress ... (you authorization code will display here)
Authorization failed.: You are not allowed to generate any more new licenses.


What is the problem? 

CAUSE
The authorization code you are using has no more available installations.

ANSWER
Each IBM SPSS authorization code has only a certain number of uses or installations. When the number is used up, the error is returned. This error indicates that all available licenses allowed for your authorization code have been used. To correct the problem, please contact IBM SPSS Support to discuss an increase to the number of allowable installations on your authorization code. All Support options can be viewed on the IBM Help and Support page: https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/spss/spss-support/index.html [https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/get-help/].
