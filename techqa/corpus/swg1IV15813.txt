ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***Overview
   
   The BIRT report could have additional detail in setup of starter
   reports and additional JDBC connections as vague in steps of
   setup.
   
   Below examples and the addtional steps required that were
   missing from the documentation.
   
   
   Prob: Questions about setup and configuration of BIRT report
   writing tool
   
   Envir: 10.2/3.2, Oracle 11gr2, Jboss 5.1.0, win2008
   
   Documentation is not clear as to how to use JDBC or datasets
   with starter reports and adding addtional JDBC datasources.
   
   Missing steps.
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Summary of methods for configuration.
   
   Starter Reports
   
   My Method
   
   I found unzip the start report archive and open the rptdesign
   file in Eclipse,
   you should find it has the data source and datasets configured.
   
   Client method
   
   Client found this alternate method which is also useful.
   
   In the 'Reporting User Guide' for IBM TRIRIGA 3.2, the BIRT
   section on page 123.
   
   
   Import the Starter Report into BIRT, Step 6. After I imported
   the
   starter form I did not see any data sources. The documentation
   does
   not advise how to deal with this.
   
   Here is what I finally found as a solution and think some of it
   should
   be included in this document.
   If you don't see the Data Sources,
   then go to the 'Window' menu > Open Perspective > choose
   'Other'.
   Select 'Resource (default)'
   Drag the .rptdeisgn file into the main designer window.
   Now when you change the Perspective back to 'Report Design' you
   should
   see the various options in the Data Explorer.
   
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   
    Adding JDBC connection
   
   Needs to be confirmed with Dev, via a documentation APAR
   request.
   
   I found I could get a JDBC driver to work if I copied over the
   TRIRIGA JDBC jar files to BIRT plugin directory.
   
   Then added these to the managed drivers and configured the JDBC
   URL, Use Name, Password.
   
   The Driver Class is automatically populated so maybe this is the
   explanation for being "optional"
   
   When I did this my test connection worked and I then could add a
   dataset.
   
   I am going to ask L3 how to and if they can confirm these are
   correct instructions.
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   L3 reply:
   
    Please generate the APAR for this APAR request. We will have
   our documentation team update the the BIRT documentation.
   
   
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   
   My environment is SQLServer can you let me know if you get the
   Oracle to work.
   
   I found with the SQLServer drive I didn't need to specify the
   port you may find similarly for Oracle.
   
   Additional Steps
   
   What I did?
   
   1. Copied JDBC JAR files
   I copied over the two TRIRIGA jar files into the ecilipse plugin
   directory, you only need one depending on
   your database platform.
   C:\Tririga\lib
   -jtds-1.2.5.jar (SQLServer)
   -ojdbc6.jar (Oracle)
   <installdir>\eclipse\plugins
   2. Click Manage Drivers... button
   Depending on whether you connecting to Oracle or SQLServer.
   Click manage Drivers... button.
   Click add jar and add the two jars from above step 1.
   
   You should then beable to select Driver class
   
   Step 5,6,7,8 :-
   Oracle
   Driver Class: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver (v11.2)
   Database URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@databaseserver:1521:orcl
   User Name: tririga
   Password: password
   JNDI URL: jdbc/local/Datasource-TRIRIGA-data
   
   
   
   SQLServer
   Driver Class: net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver (v1.2)
   Database URL: jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://demobase/tridata
   User Name: tririga
   Password: password
   JNDI URL: jdbc/local/Datasource-TRIRIGA-data
   
   Step 9
   Test Connection...
   
   Then click finish and setup the dataset.
