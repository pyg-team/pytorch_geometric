PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using an external tool, you are unable to decompress the data compressed using IBM WebSphere DataPower dp:deflate extension function. You keep getting an error on the compression format of the data. 

CAUSE
The compression algorithm used by the DataPower dp:deflate extension function might be different from the algorithm being used by the external tool.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The DataPower dp:deflate() extension function supports a number of compression algorithms that can be specified in its optional second argument. The compression algorithms are: 

 * deflate 
 *  gzip 
 * compress 

By default, if no second argument is given, then 'deflate' is used. 

If your external tool requires a 'GZIP' compressed data, then the dp:deflate extension function will have to be called with 'gzip' specified as its second argument: 

<xsl:value-of select="dp:deflate($dataToBeCompressed, 'gzip')" /> 

Refer to the latest IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances: Extension Elements and Functions Catalog documentation for updated information on this extension function.
