The links in the Remediation column will take you to the location within IBM Fix Central where you can download the particular fix you need. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The new JREs that are supplied by the above fixes resolve the CVE-2015-7575 (SLOTH) vulnerability. 
Note that CSS 5.1 uses Java 6 and has issued a patch. 
CSS 5.2.0 and CSS 5.2.1 use Java 8 and are not issuing a patch at this time because the vulnerability can be eliminated as follows: 

For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Note: If you install a Java fix pack, that will overwrite the above java.security file changes.
