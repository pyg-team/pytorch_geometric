APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You may encounter an error when attempting to start a WAS server
   from within RAD v9.5.0.1 after you have enabled 'TLSv1.2'
   protocol within the WAS server profile's Administrative Console
   (Security > SSL certificate and key management > SSL
   configurations > NodeDefaultSSLSettings > Quality of protection
   (QoP) settings).  When the server profile is configured to
   accept TLSv1.2 communications protocol only, the following
   exception may occur upon subsequent restart of the WAS server
   profile:
   
   
   [1/13/16 14:47:17:943 EST] 00000086 SSLHandshakeE E   SSLC0008E:

   security settings have expired.  Exception is javax.net.ssl.
