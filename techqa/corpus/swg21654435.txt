On September 10th 2013, IBM Sametime 9 was released and IBM Sametime 8.5.x was withdrawn from 
market. Current IBM customers with an entitlement to IBM Notes/Domino that do not have a separate full entitlement to IBM Sametime are entitled to a limited use version of IBM Sametime that is bundled with Notes/Domino. That entitlement continues with IBM Notes/Domino 9.0.1 which was released on October 29th 2013. 


IBM Notes/Domino 9.0.1 currently includes IBM Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1. IBM intends to make available an IBM Sametime Limited Use 9 release for IBM Notes/Domino 9.0.1 customers on the IBM Passport Advantage website. This will provide the functional equivalent of IBM Sametime Entry 8.5.x. This update will be provided as soon as possible - further details on the availability date will be posted to this technote when available. 

IBM Notes/Domino 9 customers who own a independent entitlement to IBM Sametime 9 can update their embedded Sametime today from their Passport Advantage downloads.
