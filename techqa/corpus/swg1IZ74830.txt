ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The event monitor check boxes for CEI and Audit events on the
   BPEL components do not work independant of each other. If audit
   events are checked but not CEI events, you will still see events
   emitted for both. This is also true when CEI events checkbox is
   marked but not the audit event checkbox.
