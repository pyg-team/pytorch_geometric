 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Administrator launches "Cognos Configuration" and clicks "Start". Administrator clicks 'Details'. After a while an error appears. 

SYMPTOM
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21646350&amp;aid=1] 

[Start Service] 

[ ERROR ] CFG-ERR-0106 IBM Cognos Configuration did not receive a
response from the IBM Cognos service in the time allotted.
Check that IBM Cognos service is available and properly configured.


CAUSE
There are many possible causes for this error: 

 * Scenario #1 - Incorrect path to Java directory in environmental variables JAVA_HOME  * For more information, see separate IBM Technotes #1593083 & #1342592.
   
   

 * Scenario #2 - Application server's hardware specification too poor/slow, causing timeouts in the software.  * For example, in one real-life customer case the server was based on a single-CPU core Hyper-V virtual server, with 4Gb RAM.
   
   
 * Scenario #3 - Customer had incorrectly configured the audit database entry in ../p2pd/WEB-INF/web.xml  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1645422.
   
   

 * Scenario #4 - Large number of static objects in the content store, therefore requiring the use of the DuseCMLargeResultSet parameter.  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1571601.
   
   
 * Scenario #5 - Network file system outage caused tomcat-users.xml corruption  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1338826.
   
   
 * Scenario #6 - Windows DEP enabled  * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1371912. 
   
   
 * Scenario #7 - Insufficient kernel settings 
 * Scenario #8 - firewall has requires ports closed

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Scenario #1 

Correct (or delete) the environmental variables JAVA_HOME. 

 * For more information, see separate IBM Technotes #1593083 & #1342592.


Scenario #2 

Improve the hardware of the server. 

 * For example, in one real-life case the problem was solved by upgrading from 4Gb RAM to 8Gb RAM, and also increasing the number of virtual CPUs from 1 to 2.

Scenario #3 

Correct the file ../p2pd/WEB-INF/web.xml. 

 * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1645422.

Scenario #4
Use the DuseCMLargeResultSet parameter. 

 * For more information, see separate IBM Technote #1571601.

Scenario #5
See separate IBM Technote #1576139.

Scenario #6
Disable Microsoft Windows Data Execution Protection 

 * See separate IBM Technote #1371912. 

Scenario #7  * run ulimit -a to get the settings of the UNIX server. Ensure that "open files" is set to at least 8192 

Scenario # 8  * check the ports required for each Cognos install for
