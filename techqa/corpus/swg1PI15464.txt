   The problem is caused by existence of another statechart in
   derived actor. As a result, Rhapsody recognizes it is
   overridden statechart and creates it as is.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  I deleted statechart in derived actor and created Test Bench
   for based actor. As a result new statechart is created in
   derived actor,which inherits from statechart in based
   actor.Then it is possible to create Test Bench in derived
   actor. In this scenario it proposes to override existing
   statechart, create another statechart or cancel operation.
