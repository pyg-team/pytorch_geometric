   1.arsslu was using != in a predicate, which is not valid in all
   EBCDIC SBCS CCSIDS.
   2.arssyscr did not have a blank after a comma used as a
   separator.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. arsslu is change to use <> in the predicate.
   2. arssyscr is changed to have a space after the comma.
