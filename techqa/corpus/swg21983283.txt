QUESTION
 Why IBM License Metric Tool versions 7.2 and 7.5 are no longer available on PPA? 

ANSWER
Currently IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) version 9 is the new product line (based on BigFix) which is actively developed and should be used for all new deployments. 

 1. ILMT 7.5 is announced to be out of support in April 2017 (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycleapp/PLCDetail.wss?q45=V270232O00945B88 [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycleapp/PLCDetail.wss?q45=V270232O00945B88]) and ILMT 7.2 in September 2016 (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycleapp/PLCDetail.wss?q45=B063854I12020H13 [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycleapp/PLCDetail.wss?q45=B063854I12020H13]) so starting new deployments currently is not advised as the customers would need to migrate to version 9 anyway soon. Starting directly with version 9 is much easier and saves time on subsequent migration. We do not believe any new customers should now install 7.5 as fresh ILMT instance - this is why we removed it from PPA. 
 2. ILMT 9 brings also many business benefits to customers in comparison with version 7. These are all summarized in a dedicated presentation which can be found here: https://ibm.biz/why_migrate_to_LMT9x [https://ibm.biz/why_migrate_to_LMT9x] (customer needs to authenticate with IBM ID). 
 3. If customer needs to add new ILMT agents to the existing ILMT 7 deployment, then the agent installers can be downloaded from Fix Central [https://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/options?selectionBean.selectedTab=find&selection=ibm%2fTivoli%3bibm%2fTivoli%2fIBM+License+Metric+Tool] instead of PPA (where only GA versions are available) - agent packages are always full installers which can be used for either fresh deployment or upgrade and should be used in the level as close to server version as possible. 
 4. ILMT version 7 is no longer actively developed and only in maintenance mode currently - we do not provide platform currency nor add any new features or enhancement requests in ILMT 7.5. That is another reason why new customers should not start with version 7 as they may soon find out they have OSes or virtualization technologies not supported by ILMT 7. 
 5. IBM Pricing requires all PVU subcapacity customers to use the latest possible version of ILMT and promptly upgrade to version 9. So, for any new customers the version of choice should be newest ILMT 9 which is available on PPA at given time. Please refer to this official IBM Pricing document for details: https://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/ibmlicensemetrictool.html [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/ibmlicensemetrictool.html] 
 6. ILMT 7.5 is still fully supported - for all customers using it we still provide all fixpacks and patches - these can be all the time downloaded from Fix Central [https://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/options?selectionBean.selectedTab=find&selection=ibm%2fTivoli%3bibm%2fTivoli%2fIBM+License+Metric+Tool]. 
 7. Of course if customer is already using ILMT 7.5 and for some reasons requires the server install image for his activities connected with for example relocation of the existing instance to a new machine, we will be able to provide the image to customer. In such situation customer should open PMR so that support can review the business scenario, provide information about end of support dates and advise the optimal approach. This should be treated as exception rather and handled on a case by case basis. 
 8. All new ILMT 7 deployments need to be justified as it requires potentially much larger support and customer efforts to migrate the customer to version 9 in near time frame. 
 9. Endpoint side ILMT 9 has full parity with ILMT 7.5, including support for iSeries which is delivered as Beta functionality now, however can be used officially for audit reports. Details on ILMT 9 for iSeries can be found under this link: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Wa8d99d587a5c_466d_866e_814dee2e0268/page/Cloud [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Wa8d99d587a5c_466d_866e_814dee2e0268/page/Cloud]


Regarding LMT 9, some hints for new customers:  1. LMT 9 server can be installed on Linux or Windows. 
 2. Linux installer is available on PPA (it installs all components including BigFix server). 
 3. For Windows, the customers should first download BigFix Server installer from PPA and then download LMT server installer using BigFix Server (from so called 'fixlet') - this is all well described in LMT documentation [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JFY_9.2.0/com.ibm.lmt.doc_9.2/com.ibm.license.mgmt.doc/ic-homepage_lmt.html] or in this document: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/form/api/wiki/b23c013e-270c-474c-afdf-2edbe773dcd7/page/598b61e4-2972-46fe-988c-2f1e6b267a6d/attachment/511f7398-b6fd-4fbb-ac7f-4a9cd5dd11e5/media/ILMT_Quick_Start_Windows.pdf [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/form/api/wiki/b23c013e-270c-474c-afdf-2edbe773dcd7/page/598b61e4-2972-46fe-988c-2f1e6b267a6d/attachment/511f7398-b6fd-4fbb-ac7f-4a9cd5dd11e5/media/ILMT_Quick_Start_Windows.pdf]
