APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a destination is created while an server is active, but the
   messaging engine for that application server is stopped, the
   dynamic reload logic does not add that destination to the
   internal state of the messaging engine.
   When the messaging engine is later started (due to a failover in
   this case), a CWSIP0062E message is outputted, and the
   destination cannot be accessed.
   When the whole application server is restarted, the knowledge
   of all destinations for the messaging engine is reloaded, and
   the destination becomes available again.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the application server where the CWSIP0062E message
   is logged.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If a destination is created while a     *
   *                      messaging engine is stopped, but the    *
   *                      application server that hosts it is     *
   *                      running, then a CWSIP0062E error is     *
   *                      seen in the logs on startup of the      *
   *                      messaging engine, and the destination   *
   *                      cannot be accessed.                     *

   ****************************************************************
   In a failover environment, it is common for a messaging engine
   for a bus not to be running within a particular application
   server, even though the application server itself is active.
   
   If a new destination is created in the bus, and dynamic
   configuration reload is enabled for that bus, the SIBus service
   of all application servers which can host messaging engines are
   informed of the change.
   
   However, in the case where a messaging engine is inactive
   within an application server, this process was working
   incorrectly. Knowledge of bus destinations was not fully
   reloaded for the inactive messaging engine, causing the
   following error during messaging engine startup (for example
   after a failover):
   
   CWSIP0062E: The destination {0} with UUID {1} could not be
   recovered due to a possible WCCM configuration error
   
   After the messaging engine started, the destination could not
   be accessed by applications.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR fixes the issue.
