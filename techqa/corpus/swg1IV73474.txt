APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In SOA's WSRR client code there are two executeQuery calls. One
   takes a query fragment and builds the URL itself, there is a
   hardcoded "/WSRR/" in there so it will not include the instance
   prefix.
   
   This problematic executeQuery code only seems to be used for
   "getPolicyBsrURI" (PolicyExpression) queries. You've seen the
   DETACH rule is involved, other monitoring policy rules may also
   be impacted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WSRR integrations with multiple instances
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The WSRR instancePrefix was not used in
   * some WSRR queries via HTTP from the TEPS
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply 7.2.0.1 IF0005
   ****************************************************************
   Under most circumstances a prebuilt WSRR URL is used, but some
   queries build their own URL each time. Some of these queries
   mistakenly omitted the WSRR instancePrefix information from the
   URL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WSRRClientBase.getWSRRUriFragment() will now incorporate the
   server's instancePrefix
