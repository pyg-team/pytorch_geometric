ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WEBi Java Applet Viewer hangs when viewing a multi-part
   document, when the 2nd (or greater) part has mimetype
   text/plain.
   
   This problem is limited to WEBi's interaction with Content
   Manager backends, not OnDemand backends, because OnDemand does
   not have the identical concept of multi-part documents.
   
   Furthermore, this problem is limited to when the parts of the
   multi-part document are not all of the same mimetype.
   
   For example, consider a 2-part document, the first-part having
   mimetype "image/tiff", and the second-part having mimetype
   "text/plain".
   
   The WEBi Java Applet Viewer will successfully render the
   first-part, but when it attempts to render the second-part (the
   part with mimetype "text/plain"), the following exception is
   generated (as shown in the Java Console for the plugin):
   
   com.ibm.mm.wc.applets.viewer.DocServicesCallbacks.trace
   CMBStellentViewerEngine: dispatchThread started Document:
   14463035
   
    com.ibm.mm.wc.applets.viewer.DocServicesCallbacks.trace
   CMBStellentViewerEngine: loadDocument: created stellent window
   Document: 14463035
   
    com.ibm.mm.wc.applets.viewer.DocServicesCallbacks.trace
   CMBStellentViewerEngine: loadDocument: part copied to temp file
   Document: 14463035
   
    com.ibm.mm.wc.applets.viewer.DocServicesCallbacks.trace Engine
   throwing exception getting number of pages:
   
   com.ibm.mm.viewer.CMBDocumentEngineException: Stellent OIVT: No
   filter is available for this file type (rc = 4)
   
    com.ibm.mm.wc.applets.viewer.DocServicesCallbacks.trace
   Document page count:0
   ....
   ....
   
   
   This pattern continues indefinitely, until the JRE, in which the
   applet is running, runs out of memory, due to the fact that it
   cannot create any more threads. Moreover, as the applet is doing
   this, it hangs (from an end-user pespective; the applet is
   still running, infinitely looping trying to process the
   document part that has mimetype "text/plain", but the applet is
   not responsive to any end-user clicks or actions) and has to be
   restarted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Content Manager systems only.
   If a user opens an IBM Content Manager document in the applet
   viewer and the document contains multiple parts and one of the
   parts is a plain text file, IBM WEBi cannot display the
   document.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 can display documents with multiple parts
   when one of the parts is a plain text file.
   Important: The method that IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 uses to render
   documents with multiple parts when one of the parts is a plain
   text file is not consistent with:
   The method that IBM WEBi uses to render a single part plain text
   document
   The method that other clients use to render documents with
   multiple parts
   The different methods for rendering the document can cause
   problems if the document contains annotations. For example, if a
   document with multiple parts contains annotations that were
   created with another client, such as the eClient, the
   annotations might render incorrectly or display in the wrong
   location in IBM WEBi. However, if the annotations are created
   with the same client that is used to view the document, the
   annotations will display correctly.
