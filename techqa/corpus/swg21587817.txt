Title: IBM Clustering JRules or Operational Decision Manager - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Explains how to cluster the JRules or Operational Decision Manager Java EE modules. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Clustering Java EE applications is key to guaranteeing scalability and availability of their services.

JRules modules, like any other Java EE applications, can be clustered on supported application servers such as WebSphere, JBoss, WebLogic...
Each of the following documents explains clustering specifically for each module: 

 * Clustering Rule Execution Server management console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] 
 * Clustering Rule Team Server or Decision Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400812] 
 * Clustering Decision Validation Services (DVS) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21425487] 
 * Clustering a transparent decision service (HTDS/MTDS) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21473114]



In addition, the following documents add some information on:  * XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245] 
 * Limitations when deploying more than one Rule Execution Server console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449103]
