ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Expeditor server admistrators may notice an inability to finely
   control the dates on copied tasks and subtasks.  Specifically,
   an admin may copy a previously executed task in order to
   re-execute the same task and subtasks in the future.
   When the copy and submission occurs, the subtasks' expiration
   dates reflect the original subtasks' date.  Because these
   were run in the past, the current subtasks are expired and
   fail to be run.
   
   A solution is to apply the parent task's date, which is
   set by the administrator prior to submission, to all
   subtasks.
   
   The following describes in detail how the problem may be
   reproduced:
   
   1. Create a new task.  I created a Run command task.
   
   2. Choose the task to be New Chained Task.
   3. Type in a name and then the command in the next screen (for
   example
   ipconfig).
   4. Then type the subtask name and create.
   5. Create a new Run command task.
   6. Select Add to Existing chained task and select the task from
   step 2.
   7. Add a command (for example dir) then the name and select
   create.
   8. Now go to pending tasks.
   9. Submit the task from step 1 (you might have to refresh to see
   it).
   10. Accept defaults on failure and permenant settings screen.
   11. Add a client.
   12. Set a date for the task.  I set the start and expire date to
   the
   same date and only put 5 minutes between start and expire.  So
   it starts
   @ 10:30 and then expires @ 10:35 on April 18, 2011.
   13. In submitted tasks view, copy the previously run task in
   step 9.
   14. Add a client.
   15. Set a date for the task.  I set the start to be 10:40 on
   April 18,
   2011 to the same time on April 18, 2012.
   16. Now review the sub tasks in the copied task.  They reflect
   the
   original subtasks' dates and not the date we assigned in step
   15.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create an entirely new task and subtask set.
