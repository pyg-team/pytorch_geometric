Title: IBM Problems connecting IBM SPSS Statistics installation to License Manager - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to connect an IBM SPSS Statistics client to a Sentinel License Manager but am having 

problems with the connection. In checking the WlmAdmin, I see that the License Manager is licensed properly, but the client does not seem to be able to obtain a license. 


Could there be a problem with the Hostname value found in the client's spssprod.inf file? 

CAUSE
Hostname in use instead of IP address in DaemonHost value in client spssprod.inf file.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Try changing this value from the Hostname to the IP address instead. We suggest IP instead of Hostname as this will eliminate any reliance on the DNS server. If the DNS configuration is not set up properly (ie: hostname directing to a different IP address), using the IP address will still work
