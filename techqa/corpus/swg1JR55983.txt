APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It can be very slow to compare BPEL processes that use complex
   WSDL interfaces while deploying to IBM Process Server or see the
   differences in the Process Migration Specification editor in
   IBM Integration Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The BPEL process comparison component, which the Process
   Migration Specification editor uses and which is used during
   deployment, compares all WSDL references. In turn, each
   reference triggers a comparison of the target WSDL file, which
   causes multiple unnecessary comparisons of the same file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available that updates the BPEL comparison component to
   cache comparison results for a given WSDL file, thereby
   eliminating multiple comparisons of the same resource.
