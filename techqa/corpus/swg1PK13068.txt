APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following exception is thrown in the adminconsole during
   application deployment/update.
   
   ADMA8019E : The resources that are assigned
   to the application are beyond the deployment target scope
   
   Eventhough we have defined a resource of type workmanager, the
   class which picks up the resources bindings present in the
   environment for
   validating the resource bindings contained in an application
   seems to ignore the binding of type workmanager found in the
   environment.
   
   Workmanager has been configured as follows.
   AdminConsole > Resources > AsynchBean > WorkManager >
   scope (Server=server1)>
   Create New WorkManager(myWorkManager, wm/myWorkManager).

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Server users of        *
   *                 version 6.0.2.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Resource validation failed with error   *
   *                      message ADMA8019E stating               *
   *                      "TypeMismatch", for the resources       *
   *                      J2CActivationSpec and MailSession.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Validation for WebSphere resources J2CActivationSpec and
   MailSession are failing during application deployment.
   In the application, resources are defined as JMS and
   MailProvider. Resource validation code should map JMS resource
   definitions against J2CActivationSpec resource, and
   MailProvider against MailSession resource.
   Since resource definitions in the application are valid,
   application management code should not thrown any false
   validation warnings.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Identified the root cause where appmanagement code fails to
   validate these resouces, and made appropriate changes to
   validate JMS resource against J2CActivationSpec and
   MailProvider resource against MailSession.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.0.2.9.
