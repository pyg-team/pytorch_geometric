For a list of supported and out of service high-level programming languages and compilers, see the High-level language support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.applicationprogramming.doc/topics/hll_support.html?lang=en] topic in the CICS TS V5.3 product documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.home.doc/welcomePage/welcomePage.html]. 


CICSPlex SM 
If you intend to connect a CICS TS V5.3 CICSPlex System Manager address space (CMAS) to a previous version of CICS TS CMAS, you need to apply the PTF(s) for the following APAR(s) to each downlevel CMAS: 
 * PI52165 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI52165] and PI53800 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI53800] for CICS TS V4. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI17724]1 and V4.2

The CICSPlex SM Web User Interface (WUI) can be used with browsers that support HTML V4. The WUI is stabilized and you are encouraged to use the CICS Explorer as noted in "Stabilization of support and discontinued functions" in the CICS TS V5.1 announcement letter [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS212-325].
