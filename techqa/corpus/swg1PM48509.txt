APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Future.get fails with a NO_RESPONSE cause when the client ORB
   read timeout is exceeded.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.0 users *
   *                  of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.1 remote   *
   *                  asynchronous methods                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Future.get fails with a NO_RESPONSE     *
   *                      cause when the client ORB read          *
   *                      timeout is exceeded.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a remote asynchronous EJB method is invoked, a Future
   object is returned to the client.  When the get method is
   invoked, the ORB is used to call the Future on the server,
   wait for the result, and return it.  If the asynchronous
   operation takes longer than the client ORB read timeout, the
   client ORB will fail the request with a NO_RESPONSE exception.
   This causes the Future.get operation to fail before the
   Future.get timeout has been reached.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The client Future object has been changed to negotiate a
   maximum response time from the server.  The server has been
   changed to suspend the request, wait until either the maximum
   response time is reached or the asynchronous operation has
   completed, and then respond to the client indicating whether
   the wait should be retried or the result can be obtained.
   
   Additionally, server-side performance of this scenario has
   been improved when the server is using the IBM Java Software
   Development Kit (SDK) version 6 build 2.6 SR1 or later.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 8.0.0.2.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
