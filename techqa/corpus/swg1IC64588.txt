APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the return value from onstat is used to determine when
   applications can be started in a hardware failover, the
   applications can be started prior to the engine allowing
   connections if ER needs to sync at start up.  In this case ,the
   application may hang requiring manual intervention in what
   should be an automated process which will cause a greater amount
   of downtime.  If the mode is not set until after ER has finished
   syncing and connections are accepted or a new return value is
   used to indicate that the instance is on-line and accepting
   connections this would resolve the problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use onstat -g ntd , grep for sqlexec client type and when the
   next column is "yes" the instance will be ready to accept
   connections.
