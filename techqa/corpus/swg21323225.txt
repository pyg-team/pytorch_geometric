PROBLEM
When installing the Lotus Quickr Connectors, you might immediately get the following error: 

"This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package."



CAUSE
This error occurs if the executable file (.exe file) is not able to extract files to the user's temporary directory. The connector install program retrieves the value of the "TEMP" user environment variable and attempts to extract files to that directory.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct the problem, edit the client machine's environment variables to include a valid entry for the "TEMP" variable, for example: 

 * 
 * 


To set this variable, you can use the following steps:  1. Right-click My Computer and choose "Properties", or open the System Properties from the Windows Control Panel. 
 2. Click the Advanced Tab. 
 3. Click the Environmental Variables button. 
 4. Under the User variables for ZZZ section, where ZZZ is the current user's Windows login, modify the TEMP variable or add one if it does not already exist. 
    
    Specify a valid existing directory. Note that even if TEMP exists in the System variables, the User variables section is the only one used by the connector installation.
    
 5. Click OK, then OK again to save the changes. 
 6. Re-attempt the connector install.
