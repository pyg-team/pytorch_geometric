APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Statistics 22.0 for Mac you were able to launch the product
   and load a file simply by double-clicking an SPSS Statistics
   file type  (.sav, .sps, .spv,).
   
   In Statistics 23.0 the product launches but does not load.  If
   the product is already running, and you click a data file
   (*.sav) you get a message saying SPSSStatistics can't be opened.
   
   Workaround:  With Statistics already open, you can drag the
   desired SPSS Statistics file onto the running application to
   load it in a new window.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This behavior is seemingly due to a difference in the Finder
   between Mac OS X 10.9 and 10.10.  IBM SPSS Statistics
   Development is working closely with Apple to remedy this issue's
   effect in our product.
   
   This issue will be addressed in a future release.
