APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Services Support
   detects an email converter error, the populateDocuments method
   produces
   a task error. As a consequence, processing of the entire batch
   of items that FileNet P8 Content Process Engine sent to the ECM
   Text
   Search Server for indexing is stopped instead of just the
   problematic document not being indexed. This affects the
   indexing performance
   of Content Search Services.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Services Support
   Version 4.0.0.2 detects an email converter error, the
   populateDocuments
   method produces a task error. As a consequence, processing of
   the entire batch of items that FileNet P8 Content Process Engine
   sent to
   the ECM Text Search Server for indexing is stopped instead of
   just the problematic document not being indexed. This affects
   the indexing
   performance of Content Search Services.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.0 Fix Pack 3,
   IBM Content Collector P8 Content Search Service Support is
   updated with a new
   configuration option that determines how email converter
   exceptions are handled. You can add the following custom
   attribute to the
   Content Search Services Support configuration:
   
       *EmailParserExceptionThrows
           Value type: Boolean
           Default value: 1
   
   With the default setting, Content Search Service Support handles
   email converter errors as before. If you set
   EmailParserExceptionThrows
   to 0, Content Search Service Support attaches a
   MALFORMED_DOCUMENT message to the document and also adds this
   error message to the
   full-text index instead of producing a
   PopulateDocumentsException error. In this case, just the
   problematic document is not indexed and
   batch processing can continue.
