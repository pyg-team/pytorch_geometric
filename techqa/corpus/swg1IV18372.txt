APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the same metric is collected in two
   different attribute groups in less than 60 seconds, then
   the values might be different and sometimes abnormally
   high.  This can affect the common metrics in the
   'Logical Partition' attribute group and the 'CPU Summary'
   attribute group.
   
   RECREATION STEPS:
   This problem is intermittent and has dependency on the
   execution speed and load of the system.
   
   On a single workspace, create 2 views populating the Attribute
   Groups Logical Partitions and CPU Summary.
   
   Set TEPS refresh at 60seconds and watch the values for common
   attributes in these 2 views,
   
   1) Physical CPU consumption
   2) The Number of Hypervisor Calls
   3) Time in Hypervisor Pct
   
   Each view shows a different value for these attributes.

   *****
   Interim Fixes 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_AIX_PREM-IF0004 and
   6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_VIOS_PREM-IF0003 resolve the problem by
   correctly
   determining the same metrics in different attribute groups.
