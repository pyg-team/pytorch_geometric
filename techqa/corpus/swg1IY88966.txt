ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:  6.1.0-TIV-ITM-FP0003
   
   Recreation:
   
   1.  Configure the settings in the KSYENV file to this:
   
   KSYENV settings:
   KSY_USE_DEFAULTS=Y
   KSY_DEFAULT_COLLECTION_INTERVAL=15
   KSY_DEFAULT_COLLECTION_LOCATION=A
   KSY_DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE_INTERVAL=1
   KSY_DEFAULT_AGGREGATION=week,hour
   KSY_DEFAULT_PRUNING=week.3.year,hour.14.day,raw.2.day
   
   2.  Save the setting and close the S&P agent configuration from
   the MTEMS GUI.
   
   3.  select the S&P agent to reconfigure again.
   
   When reconfiguring the Warehouse Summarization and Pruning Agent
   through the "Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services", and
   arrived in the "Configure Summarization and Pruning Agent"
   window, in the Defaults tab, in the Summarization settings
   section, the Daily checkbox is checked.
   
   This shouldn't be the case, seen the settings in KSYENV. When
   clicking on the Reload button, the Daily checkbox becomes
   unchecked, while Weekly and Hourly remain checked, thus the
   correct settings will be shown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  no workaround available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When reconfiguring the Warehouse Summarization and Pruning Agent
   through the "Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services", the
   Summarization setting checkboxes do not reflect what's in KSYENV
   (sy.ini) in the Defaults tab of the "Configure Summarization and
   Pruning Agent dialog.  Instead, the default hiarachy takes
   precedence.  In other words, if Weekly had been checked and
   Daily unchecked per what was originally stored in KSYENV, upon
   reconfiguring, the Daily checkbox would also be checked because
   Weekly had been checked.  This is correct behavoir when manually
   checking a checkbox, but is incorrect behavoir when
   reconfiguring from what was saved in the KSYENV file.
   
   Clicking the Reload button forces KSYENV to be
   reloaded and correctly reflect the saved configuration.
   
   Since the defaults configuration is only used when S&P is
   started for the very first time, reconfigure has no effect on
   exisiting agents and would only effect any new unique agents
   that are installed after reconfiguration.
   
   This APAR is being closed FIN with concurrence from the
   submitting customer.  This means that a solution to this APAR is
   expected to be delivered from IBM in a release (if any) to be
   available within the next 18 months.
