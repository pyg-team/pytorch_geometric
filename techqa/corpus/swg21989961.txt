 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What are candidate form field option lists and how do I import options through Workbench? 

ANSWER
You have the capability of creating single-select, multi-select, radio button, and checkbox fields within BrassRing for your candidate forms, req forms, doc subsidiary forms, etc. These fields require options to be added so the end users/candidates are able to select from a list. 
There are three ways you can update/maintain field option lists in Brassring.
1. Manual updates through BrassRing. Admin > Admin+ > Lists > Administer the List for any field you want to edit the option list for.
2. Foundation Data Import Integration. Options can be kept up to date through an integration with your HRIS or system of record. These option list integrations are called ‘Foundation Data Imports’. A technical specification guide can be found here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045229&spng=10]. 
3. Option List excel import via Workbench. This option is available for Workbench users with Power User access or for users that have Tier 5 access with the proper client setting enabled. The steps to successfully update Options via a Workbench import are covered in the linked sections below.
