PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What is the meaning of Job EXIT code? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Sometimes we see a Job EXIT Code in the logs. What are these codes and what do they mean?

 Understanding LSF job exit codes



 LSF monitors a job while running and returns the exit code returned from the job itself. LSF collects this exit code via wait3() system call on UNIX platforms. Use bhist to see the exit code for your job.



 The LSF exit code is a result of the system exit values. Exit codes less than 128 relate to application exit values, while exit codes greater than 128 relate to system signal exit values (LSF adds 128 to system values). Use bhist to see the exit code for your job.



 For instance, if your application had an explicit exit 129, you would see Exit code 129 in your output. When you send a signal that terminates the job, bhist reports either the signal or the value of signal+128. If the return status is greater than 128 and the job was terminated with a signal, then return_status-128=signal.



 Example:



 For return status 133, the job was terminated with signal 5 (SIGTRAP on most systems, 133-128=5). For return status 139, the job was terminated with signal 11 (SIGSEGV on most systems, 139-128=11), which would mean the application had a core dump. Note that these terminate signals are operating-system dependent, so signal 5 may not be SIGTRAP on and 11 may not be SIGSEGV on all UNIX systems.



 Because on different host or different version, Linux may support different signal, so as to exit codes. So we had better run "Kill -l" which will show like below to check all the supported signals (exit codes).



 HUP INT QUIT ILL TRAP ABRT BUS FPE KILL USR1 SEGV USR2 PIPE ALRM TERM STKFLT CHLD CONT STOP TSTP TTIN TTOU URG XCPU XFSZ VTALRM PROF WINCH POLL PWR SYS Here HUP means exit code 1, INT means code 2, QUIT mean code 3 ...



 We can also use bacct -l job_ID to get more information about how the job died.
