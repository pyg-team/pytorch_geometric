QUESTION
 What causes the error: "Duplicate menu path: MapPageOVMenu" when using nco_confpack to export or import object server data? 

CAUSE
Due to having 2 menus with the same name in the tools menu. 

ANSWER
The solution is to rename or delete away (if no not needed) one of the duplicate menus. 

The object server is able to allow for duplicate menu item names because it tracks them by a numeric identifier in the database tables. For nco_confpack to be able to export and then import , it can't rely upon those numeric identifiers, because they will be different from one host to another, so we have to use the name. 

The menus and menu items are tracked by constructing a menu tree, starting from the root. Then the complete path is then used as the key. This allows for the menu and menu items to be unique, based upon a name. This is where the duplicate menu path comes into the picture. 

Solution : Make sure the names are unique. For example, append them with a sequential number (ie: by appending a 1, 2, 3....).
