PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you use the Workload Specification editor introduced in CICS Explorer V5.2, you experience problems removing the workload routing association from a system group. You edit a Workload Specification and remove a system group from being associated with the workload as a router. When you save the Workload Specification, you receive the message "Unable to remove the routing association from a system group. See the Error Log view for more information." 

SYMPTOM
The Error Log explains that "The version of CICS you are connected to does not support the API that is required to remove the workload routing association from a system group. You must upgrade your version of CICS to complete this task."


CAUSE
This is due to a limitation in the Javaâ„¢ Virtual Machine (JVM) preventing CICS Explorer from correctly invoking the CICS management client interface application programming interface (CMCI API).


To delete the link object representing a system group as a workload router, Explorer must issue a CMCI request using the HTTP DELETE method and providing an XML payload. The limitation in the Java class library implementation prevents an application from providing an XML payload when making a DELETE request (See Oracle Java bug 7167360 [http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7157360] for more details).

In response to this limitation, CICS Explorer will attempt to make the request as a POST request, using an override to indicate to CMCI that a DELETE is required. Only certain versions of CICS TS support this override.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do one of the following so you will be able to remove the workload routing association from a system group when using CICS Explorer V5.2: 

 * Download the CICS Explorer V5.2 for Microsoft Windows or for Linux zip or tar.gz file. This download contains a specific Java Runtime Environment that has a fix for the client-side problem. 
 * Upgrade to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V5.2 or higher, or apply the PTFs for PI15826 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI15826] (CICS TS V4.1 and V4.2) or PI15827 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI15827] (CICS V5.1). These fixes contain a server-side workaround.
