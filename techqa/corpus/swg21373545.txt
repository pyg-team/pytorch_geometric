PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You see error message: E 'LI' is ambiguous, LIST has been assumed. This occurs when you enter CEDA DI LI(*) for the DISPLAY LIST command in CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) 3.2 or higher. 

SYMPTOM
The message displayed on the CEDA panel is:

E 'LI' is ambiguous, LIST has been assumed.


CAUSE
Beginning with CICS TS V3.2, the CEDA command for DISPLAY LIST [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.resourcedefinition.doc/ceda/commands/dfha4_display.html] was changed. The new command syntax is: CEDA DIsplay LISt(*) or CEDA DI LIS(*).

The reason for the change was due to the addition of the new CEDA LIBrary command that was added to CICS TS V3.2. When more than one command with the same prefix is added, another letter is added to the prefix of each command.

With CICS TS V3.2 the CEMT INQUIRE LINE command was also changed to CEMT Inquire LINe.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use CEDA DI LIS(*) for the CEDA DISPLAY LIST(*) command.
