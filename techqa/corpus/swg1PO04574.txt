ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Background: the health monitor updates the index file for a
   chart, and
   then issues a search to ensure that the index was updated (I
   have some
   delays built in to give the index time to complete).  Problem
   (observed
   both on my system and on the customer production system):
   sometimes the IAP
   read log indicates that the index was updated, but it was not.
   I say
   that because I can see the messages in the read server systemout
   log
   indicating that the index update ran):

   and I have a test program that downloads the index file and
   verify that
   the term is what I think it should be:
   
   search term = 0000014b-5241-ad45-94d5-d6998ccd6e08
   
   but the update term is not found .. neither when run via the
   health
   monitor nor later when run via the IAP portal (I have extra code
   in my
   health monitor to exit when it detects this condition) -- so the
   term is
   not found in minutes after the update, and not just in 14
   seconds
