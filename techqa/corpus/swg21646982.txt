Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2LDAP; CWWIM4520E; DSID-03100641; referral; follow; ignore TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logins for LDAP users are suddenly failing with "Login failed. Check User ID and password and try again". The <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/logs/server/systemOut.log includes the following WIM and LDAP error strings: "CWWIM4520E" and "DSID-03100641" 

SYMPTOM
Local file based users can log in. Only LDAP users are affected.


CAUSE
A change in the LDAP environment is requiring the WAS referrals option to be set to "follow"
