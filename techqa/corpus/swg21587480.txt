PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A DataStage job that accesses SQL Server using ODBC receives error:

[IBM (DataDirect OEM) ][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]UPDATE failed because the following SET options have incorrect settings: 'QUOTED_IDENTIFIER'. Verify that SET options are correct 

CAUSE
When the configuration was made for the ODBC database connection, one of the following options was not set: 

Windows: Enabled Quoted Identifiers
Unix: QuotedId 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Windows: 

Edit the ODBC database configuration through the Administrative Tools, ODBC Data Sources 

check Enabled Quoted Identifiers 

 

Unix: 

Determine the location of the .odbc.ini by examining the Environment Variable Settings Log entry in the DataStage job log. Look for System Variable ODBCINI 

Edit the .odbc.ini and set QuotedId=Yes
