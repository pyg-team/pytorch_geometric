Text:
ICH408I; Connect:Direct Browser; SIGN ON; C:D TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Sign on from the IBM Sterling Connect:Direct Browser User Interface to an IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS server fails with error: Logon failed! Please try again!


SYMPTOM
On the Sterling Connect:Direct Browser User Interface side only this error is shown: Logon failed! Please try again!


In the Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS log, the following messages were found: 


ICH408I USER(user1 ) GROUP( ) NAME(??? ) 044
044 LOGON/JOB INITIATION - USER AT TERMINAL NOT RACF-DEFINED
IRR012I VERIFICATION FAILED. USER PROFILE NOT FOUND. 


CAUSE
The userid on the Sterling Connect:Direct Browser User Interface side was entered in lower case for doing a sign on to the Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS sever, but the TSO user defined on the z/OS side was defined in upper case.
RACF or other security systems on z/OS side are treating userids and passwords as case sensitive.



ENVIRONMENT
Sterling Connect:Direct Bowser User Interface
Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS having the stage 2 security exit installed and active.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check in the Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS log for any error messages at the time of the Sign on.

Here are some samples and explanations for messages available in the Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS log: 


ICH70001I USER1 LAST ACCESS AT 05:49:20 ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016 

Here a Sign on was OK with user USER1. 


ICH408I USER(HUGO ) GROUP( ) NAME(??? ) 042
042 LOGON/JOB INITIATION - USER AT TERMINAL NOT RACF-DEFINED
IRR012I VERIFICATION FAILED. USER PROFILE NOT FOUND. 

There is no user with the name HUGO defined in RACF. 


ICH408I USER(user1 ) GROUP( ) NAME(??? ) 044
044 LOGON/JOB INITIATION - USER AT TERMINAL NOT RACF-DEFINED
IRR012I VERIFICATION FAILED. USER PROFILE NOT FOUND. 

There is no user with name user1 defined in RACF. 

There is a user with name USER1 known by RACF, but because userids and passwords are handled case sensitive, these are not the same users. 


ICH408I USER(USER1 ) GROUP(CDGRP2 ) NAME(UPPER CASE USER ) 046
046 LOGON/JOB INITIATION - INVALID PASSWORD
IRR013I VERIFICATION FAILED. INVALID PASSWORD GIVEN. 

Here USER1 is coded correctly and found by RACF, but the password was not entered correctly. 

Also, the password is case sensitive.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check that the userid and password are entered correctly (case sensitive) on the Sterling Connect:Direct Browser User Interface side for the sign on to the Sterling Connect:Direct for z/OS server.
Check on z/OS that the user is defined in RACF or other used security system.
