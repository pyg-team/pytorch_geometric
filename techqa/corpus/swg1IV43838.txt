ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.15
   IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.5.0.3
   Tivoli's process automation engine 7.5.0.3
   Server OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 6.1 build 7601 Service Pack 1
   
   Concerns/Problem:
   On creation of labour contract entries in labour reporting, when
   creating an invoice from these labour transactions, the "Create
   Invoice" dialog box is displayed listing the invoice number and
   description.
   Is it possible to make the Description field mandatory when
   creating invoice from Labor Report application select action
   menu "Create Invoice" dialog box?
   
   
   When creating an invoice from Labor Report application, Maximo
   uses the object (CREATEINVOICE) which is a non-persistent
   object.
   
   I have tested this on Maximo demo,
   1. I tried to set the non-persistent object, CREATEINVOICE, the
   description field to be required field in Application Designer
   application, it does not work for me
   2. I tried to change the CREATEINVOICE description field to
   required in Database Configuration application, it does not work
   for me. After set the description be a required field in
   database, I still can create invoice from Labor Report
   application select action menu without to enter any data in the
   invoice description field.
   3. I have tried to make the invoice table/object description
   field as required in Application Designer application, but this
   still not work for the Labor Report create invoice dialog box.
   4. It works only I changed the Invoice description to required
   in database configuration application.
   
   It seems if you want to make the invoice description to be
   mandatory, you need to do this from Database Configuration for
   invoice object.
   
   But this causes another issue.
   When testing, at the point you click the "OK" button when the
   description is blank you get a message stating the field is
   mandatory, then you enter a description and click the "OK"
   button again and the following message appears:
   "BMXAA4129E - Record already exists for Site=LYB,
   Invoice=INV-59092. Ensure that the key value for the given
   record is unique."
   
   Maximo neither creates the invoice or lets you save the record
   and you must cancel the "Create Invoice" dialog box.
   When reopen the "Create Invoice" dialog box, and enter the
   description in the field, the invoice is created.
   But the problem is one invoice number is lost. That is, if at
   the first time the user does not enter data in the Description
   field and click "OK" button, Maximo shows error message (field
   is mandatory), then user has to close the "Create Invoice"
   dialog box and reopen it again,  it increments to the next
   invoice number, and one invoice number lost.
   The client does not want to lose an invoice number as this is a
   big problem for auditors.
