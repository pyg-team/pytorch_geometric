   requirements" .
   
   Under the requirements for Eclipse, we incorrectly state that
   JRE 1.4.2 will work with the APDE:

   (JRE) Version 1.4.2 or later. You can use an existing JRE
   installation, or you can install the JRE included with
   Automation Package Developer Environment.
   
   
   
   The InfoCenter should state that
   Eclipse requires the IBM JRE Version 1.5 or higher.
