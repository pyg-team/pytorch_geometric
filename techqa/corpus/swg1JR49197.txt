APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Preface:
   1. For your user ID you have set "Hide left navigation pane"
      in "Home" --> "My Settings".
   
   2. As expected you now only will see the right pane.
   
   
   Current situation:
   
   1. The left frame around the right pane will show two arrow
      symbols:
      a) the upper arrow, pointing to the right, is enabled.
      b) the lower arrow, pointing to the left, is disabled.
   
   2. When clicking on the right pointing arrow, the left
      navigation pane is not being displayed as expected.
   
   3. For displaying the left navigation pane again you will have
      to disable "Hide left navigation pane" in "Home" --> "My
      Settings".
   
   
   Desired situation:
   
      There are two options how this use case scenario should
      look like:
   
      1. The frame around the right pane should not contain any
         arrows.
         In other words: if you select "Hide left navigation
         pane" the only way to display the left navigation pane
         again should be to disable this option again.
   
      2. If the frame around the right pane contains arrows, they
         should allow users to display the left navigation pane.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  For displaying the left navigation pane again you will have
   to disable "Hide left navigation pane" in "Home" --> "My
   Settings".
