QUESTION
Is the Notes Client supported on Microsoft Windows Server Terminal Services? You are unclear as to whether IBM Notes is supported in a Terminal environment on Windows Terminal server without Citrix MetaFrame installed. In this scenario, the Notes client would be installed on a Windows 2003 terminal client and on Windows Server 2003 Terminal Services.

ANSWER
No. The Notes Client is not designed or supported to run in this scenario (using a Windows Terminal Client and Windows Server Terminal Services). A Notes Client can run on a WindowsTerminal Server (2003, 2008, 2012) only if Citrix MetaFrame is used as well. While Windows Server Terminal Services emulation with Notes Client can work, this configuration is not supported. 

Refer to the Release Notes or System Requirements that accompany each Notes Client release for the latest information on Citrix MetaFrame and Terminal Services support in a specific product release.
