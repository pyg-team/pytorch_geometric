Title: IBM The Transformation Extender Launcher will not start when using Network Drive letters - United States

Text:
Launcher; Event Server; system is not responding TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to migrate the WebSphere® Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) Launcher (Event Server) from Microsoft® Windows 2000 to a later Windows operating system results in 'system is not responding' when using network drive letters. 

SYMPTOM
The error 'system is not responding' is contained within the WTX/ITX Launcher CompoundSystem log.


CAUSE
Using Network drive letters to access files using WTX/ITX maps.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Later versions of Windows are unable to access network shares as a drive letter from a service. This is a new Microsoft security restriction. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using UNC paths instead of Network drive letters with newer versions of Windows.





For example : \\Server\share\directory\file.ext
