PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When adding a member node to the primary node in ISIM 7.0 Virtual Appliance (VA), it fails. 

SYMPTOM
Reviewing the ispim_appliance_system.log, you see error messages like the following: 

*************************************************************

*************************************************************

Then when reviewing the message.log, you see error messages like the following:

CAUSE
The problem can be caused by one of the following:
1. The time setting for the virtual appliance is not synchronized with the primary node.
2. The new member node is not defined using fully qualified hostname


ENVIRONMENT
ISIM 7.0 VA, Linux



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the support files.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The problem can be resolved by one of the following: 

1. The member node should use the same date and time settings that you used to set up the virtual appliance for the primary node. The system clocks for the member node is synchronized to within 5 minutes of the primary node (deployment manager server).
2. The hostname of the member node should use a fully qualified hostname; for example, isimva.us.example.com.
3. If none of the above applies, then review the support files for detail error messages.
