Title: IBM DataPower firmware V6 and later does not allow WSDLs with a non-digit port value for soap:address location URLs - United States

QUESTION
 Why does DataPower firmware V6 and later fail to compile WSDLs (or add them to a Web Service Proxy) if they contain a non-digit port value for soap:address location URLs? 

CAUSE
WSDL validation capabilities are improved (aligned with RFC 3986).

ANSWER
DataPower firmware now enforces "RFC 3986 - Section 3.2.3 Port", which only allows digit values for the port subcomponent of a URL of the <soap:address /> location attribute. 

Accordingly, a sample URL like 
<soap:address location="http://localhost:XXXX/hello/services/HelloServicePort"/> fails,
and needs to be adjusted to e.g. 
<soap:address location="http://localhost:0/hello/services/HelloServicePort"/> to be valid.
(Note that this sample will need to be adjusted to a valid non-zero port to get active.)

Leaving the port value blank and removing the colon will imply to use the default value for the specified protocol, e.g. port 80 for HTTP.
