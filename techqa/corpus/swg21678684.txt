Title: IBM DE User error updating JDBC Gateway - United States

Text:
different DE user; new DE user; other DE user; OMNIbus Deployment Engine; OMNIbus DE; Integrations; Fix Pack fails; user fails TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Gateway upgrade failed with a GUI error indicating userB is attempting to update a DE implementation originally installed by userA. 

SYMPTOM
GUI Message: You are updating an instance of Netcool/OMNIbus that was installed by "<userA>" but your user name is "<userB>".

The string "database_lock_already_owned" appears in the de_trace.log: 


"Caused by: com.ibm.ac.si.runtime.lock.LockException: database_lock_already_owned
at com.ibm.ac.si.runtime.lock.LockUtil.validateDatabaseLock(LockUtil.java:482)
at com.ibm.ac.si.db.DbmsUtilities.checkPermissions(DbmsUtilities.java:854)"


CAUSE
The user applying the update is different from the user who initially installed DE.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
cd to <DE_HOME>\bin\ [typically c:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Common\acsi\bin>]

Run de_backupdb -bfile <filename> to backup the current DE installation.

Change the USER value in $NCHOME\omnibus\platform\win32\install\install.properties; for example:

version=2
USER=userA
DEHOME=C\:/Program Files (x86)/IBM/Common/acsi
NCHOME=C\:\\IBM\\Tivoli\\Netcool

to

version=2
USER=userB
DEHOME=C\:/Program Files (x86)/IBM/Common/acsi
NCHOME=C\:\\IBM\\Tivoli\\Netcool

Retry the operation.

Please note: If the DE distribution has been previously altered, please restore it from a
pre-existing backup before applying the changes described above.
