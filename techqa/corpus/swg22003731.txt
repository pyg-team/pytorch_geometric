Title: IBM TADDM Discovery Management Console fails with " weak signature algorithm MD5withRSA and is treated as unsigned" after upgrading the client JRE to Oracle 1.8 update 131 or IBM SR4 FP5. - United States

 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 TADDM jar files are currently signed with the MD5withRSA algorithm. In the latest releases of the above mentioned JRE's this algorithm is restricted by default to push towards stronger cryptography algorithms. 

CONTENT
To work around this issue perform the following steps on the client to re-enable the MD5 algorithm. There is no known new threat by re-enabling MD5 signed jar support.
On the client, locate the java.security file in the java 8 installation directory, for example:

“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_131\lib\security\java.security“

edit this file and delete entry "MD5" from the jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms list:

## jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024
jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024

You may need to clear the java webstart cache after this change(the error you get would likely change to an http 502 if this is the case).
