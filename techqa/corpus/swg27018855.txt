 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 
This utility provides the capability to create a bookshelf index for your own customized bookshelves. 

CONTENT
 

All BookManager books contain an index of all of the words in the book. This book index is stored inside each book file, and is used when searching for a text within a book. It is what allows BookManager to quickly locate information for you.

However, when you want to do a search for information that may reside anywhere in a shelf, a second type of index is used -- a bookshelf index. The bookshelf index is a combination of all of the book-level indexes from all of the books on the bookshelf.

If you have a bookshelf index, searching across the shelf for a text string is very fast, because BookManager only has to look through this one index file for the information. Without a bookshelf index, each book being searched must be opened and its book-index searched for the text string. While searching an unindexed bookshelf is still effective, performance is considerably slower than searching the index for the same shelf.

When IBM ships books to you which are already organized into bookshelves, it includes the bookshelf index. However, BookManager provides the capability for customers to create their own shelves. Therefore, we provide the Index Utility to create a bookshelf index for your own customized bookshelves.

A bookshelf index created for a BookManager bookshelf (BKS) may also be used to facilitate searching indexed BookManager Books and indexed .PDF documents in an extended shelf (XKS).

The BookManager Index Utility is a free tool, which can be copied within your organization. In addition to the Windows version, it is also available for the VM, and MVS platforms. The VM and MVS versions are shipped with the mainframe products. The Windows version can be downloaded from this website
