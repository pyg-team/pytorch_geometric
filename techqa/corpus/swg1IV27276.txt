APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: There is a performance regression when creating
   lots of HashMap/Hashtable/WeakHashMap new instances on all
   platforms.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   N/A
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use previous JDK release which doesn't support alt hashing
   security fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While implementing the alternate hashing algorithm feature, a
   new field was introduced which were initialized even when the
   alternate hashing alogorithm was disabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   5.0.0 SR15
   .
   The JDK has been updated to avoid the initialization of the
   alternate hashing algorithm specific fields when alternate
   hashing algorithm is disabled.
