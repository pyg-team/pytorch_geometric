APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When adding Application Support to a remote HUB TEMS, program
   KDSTSNS is called to actually perform the task. RAS1 tracing is
   necessary if any errors are encountered during the operation.
   Without RAS1 tracing it is almost impossible to diagnose and
   correct any remote seed issue.
   
   Environment:
     Windows environment where adding Application Support to a
   remote HUB TEMS usually z\OS is required. This can also apply
   to adding Application Support to remote HUB TEMS on Unix/Linux
   or Windows from a Windows machine.
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
     To recreate:
   
     1. From Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services, right
   click on any shown application then select Advanced - Add TEMS
   Application Support.
   
     2. Provide the information requested to connect to the HUB
   TEMS
   
     3. Select the Application Support SQL files to seed, to select
   multiple files, depress and hold the Ctrl key. Press OK to
   perform the operation.
   
     4. After the operation is complete, check the
   %CANDLE_HOME%\logs directory for the RAS1 tracing logs with
   KDSTSNS in their name.
   
   Related Files and Output:
     None.

LOCAL FIX
 *  To add RAS1 tracing to a current environment and perform this
   APAR manually do the following:
   
     1. Open a DOS Prompt.
   
     2. CD to the ITM directory: cd %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM
   
     3. Set the following environment variables.
   
        set KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:KDS ALL)
   
        set KBB_VARPREFIX=%
   
        set
   KBB_RAS1_LOG=c:\IBM\ITM\logs\%(computername)_kdstsns-.log
   INVENTORY=C:\IBM\ITM\logs\%(computername)_kdstsns.inv COUNT=03
   LIMIT=5 PRESERVE=1 MAXFILES=9
   
     4. Make sure all files in the %CANDLE_HOME%\logs directory
   with KDSTSNS in their name have been deleted.
   
     5. Launch kinconfg.exe from this directory as follows:
   
        kinconfg.exe -L%CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\NEWKDSTSNS.log
   
     6. Collect from the %CANDLE_HOME%\logs directory all the files
   that have KDSTSNS in their name. Also, file NEWKDSTSNS.log from
   the %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ITM seed program (KDSTSNS.EXE) does not provide tracing to aid
   debugging.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added code to establish RAS tracing for KDSTSNS. when used to
   Add Application Support through MTEMS.
