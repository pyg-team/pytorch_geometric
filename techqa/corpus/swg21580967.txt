QUESTION
 What happens when a custodian does not confirm a hold, responds with a "No"? Can the response be changed? 

ANSWER
When a custodian does not confirm a hold, responds with a "No", the following will happen:
- When viewing the notice and reports the "Replied, No Confirmation" statistic will be incremented by 1 for the custodian's response
- If you configured the hold notice with the "On Exception, alert" setting to send to the attorney, paralegal or both; the selected people will receive an alert if a custodian responds "No" to the confirmation question

The custodian will still be considered on hold, but he/she will no longer receive any further confirmation reminders. The custodian will still receive future auto-reminders if configured for the hold notice.

In terms of having the custodian change his/her response, this depends on the type of confirmation mechanism used for the hold notice. If the embedded question was used, for example adding the $Q:FullyComply to the notice content, the custodian can go back to the hold notice email and resubmit a different response. Now if an interview was included for the hold notice, the custodian will not be able to respond to the interview again.

For the hold with interview situation, here are a couple suggestions to capture a different response.

1. The custodian can be removed and re-added as a recipient to the hold. The custodian will receive a new notice and be able to complete the interview again. This will show up as two separate interview results for the same person.

2. Have the paralegal capture the fact that the custodian responded incorrectly as an ad-hoc interview log. This is more for informational purposes only if the custodians response becomes a point of interest for the matter.
