Title: IBM Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects IBM Security Access Manager for DataPower (CVE-2014-8730) - United States

Text:
CVE-2014-8730 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Security Access Manager version 8.0.0.5 for DataPower is affected by a TLS padding vulnerability, which could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
The following vulnerability affects IBM Security Access Manager version 8.0.0.5 for DataPower.
CVEID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]

DESCRIPTION: IBM Security Access Manager for DataPower could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99216 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The following steps describe how to mitigate this vulnerability for the affected releases. You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. 

Mitigation for IBM Security Access Manager for DataPower 8.0.0.5 

 1. Select Objects > Security Access Manager > Access Manager Reverse Proxy from the WebGUI navigation panel. 
 2. Select the Reverse Proxy instance. 
 3. Select the Manage Files tab and then the Edit button for the Configuration File property. 
 4. In the [ssl] stanza, add the bold lines below to the following two sections.
    # Specify any additional GSKit attributes which should be used when 
    # initializing an SSL connection with the client. A complete list of 
    # the available attributes is included in the GSKit SSL API
    # documentation.
    # 
    # The configuration entry may be specified multiple times, one for each 
    # GSKit attribute. The entry should be of the format: 
    # gsk-attr-name = <type>:<id>:<value> 
    # 
    # - where <type> is one of 'enum', 'string', 'number' 
    # and <id> corresponds to the identity associated with a GSKit attribute
    # (e.g., GSK_HTTP_PROXY_SERVER_NAME = 225) 
    # 
    # An example configuration could be: 
    # gsk-attr-name = string:225:proxy.ibm.com 
    
    gsk-attr-name = enum:471:1
    
    # Specify any additional GSKit attributes which should be used when 
    # initializing an SSL connection with a junctioned server. A complete 
    # list of the available attributes is included in the GSKit SSL API 
    # documentation. 
    #
    # The configuration entry may be specified multiple times, one for each
    # GSKit attribute. The entry should be of the format: 
    # jct-gsk-attr-name = <type>:<id>:<value> 
    # 
    # - where <type> is one of 'enum', 'string', 'number' 
    # and <id> corresponds to the identity associated with a GSKit attribute
    # (e.g., GSK_HTTP_PROXY_SERVER_NAME = 225) 
    # 
    # An example configuration could be: 
    # jct-gsk-attr-name = string:225:proxy.ibm.com 
    
    jct-gsk-attr-name = enum:471:1 
 5. Click Apply to deploy the changes.
