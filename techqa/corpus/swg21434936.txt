QUESTION
 What files can safely be deleted to clear disk space on the SiteProtector machines? 

ANSWER
There are many files that can be deleted from the SiteProtector machines that help free hard disk drive space. This article describes which files can be safely deleted.

To clear more space on your Application Server hard disk drive, the following files can be removed:

All files from the following directories if they exist:


 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\XPU\RealSecure 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\XPU\InternetScanner 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\XPU\SiteProtector (leave the xml files) 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\RealSecure 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\Desktop 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\Proventia 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\InternetScanner 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\SiteProtector (leave the xml files) 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\X-Press Update Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\RealSecure 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\X-Press Update Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\SiteProtector 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\X-Press Update Server\webserver\IHS\htdocs\XPU\InternetScanner 
 * \Winnt\Temp\XPU**(all versions of SiteProtector) 
 * \Windows\Temp\XPU**(all versions of SiteProtector)


Note: If you are running an older installation that was upgraded from a much older version, the paths that are listed above can be found under \Program Files\ISS\RealSecure SiteProtector. 


If you have already updated your SiteProtector components to the latest versions, you might also be able to clear some space on your Agent Manager, Event Collector, and other daemon components by deleting the *.xpu files from the following directories if they exist: 
 * \Program Files\ISS\issDaemon\ 
 * \Program Files\ISS\issDaemon\ConsoleUpdate 
 * \Program Files\ISS\issDaemon\XPU*.tmp (any directories that begin with XPU and ending with .tmp can be removed) 
 * \WINNT\Temp\XPU*.tmp (any directories that begin with XPU and ending with .tmp can be removed)
   

Note: Any XPUs you apply in the future is downloaded again as necessary. 


You can remove any log files if SiteProtector is functioning normally (below are the largest): 

Event Collector logs  * \Program Files\ISS\RealSecure SiteProtector\Event Collector\Logs\*(logs for the Event Collector)

or  * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector\Logs\*(logs for the Event Collector)


Application Server logs  * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\JavaEE\Geronimo2.1.8\var\log\*.log files only (do not delete the *.properties files)


Note: If you find that you have many large log files, you might have debug logging enabled for that component. If you are not sure how to check the logging level for a specific component, contact Customer Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/handbook/contacts.html] for assistance. 


Update installation logs that can be removed: 
 * \Program Files\ISS\issDaemon\UpdateLogs\* (generic update logs for issDaemon components) 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\XPU\Install\Site Protector Core\ -- any directories in here (xpu logs) 
 * \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\XPU\Install\Site Protector Database\ -- any directories in here (xpu logs) 
 * \temp\ISS\* (installation and console update logs)



Additionally, the following can be done to get rid of old temporary files and Sensor Controller logs (these can take up much space): 
 1. Stop all the windows services that start with SiteProtector on the Application Server machine.
    
 2. Empty the contents of the \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\temp directory.
    Note: You may want to keep a backup of this directory elsewhere in case you have any exported files or logs there. If you choose to back up the directory, make sure that you remove it from the system or drive to save space.
    
 3. Restart the services stopped in step 1. SiteProtector regenerates any files it needs.


Javacore, heapdump, and snap files 

You might find some javacore, heapdump, or snap files existing within the SiteProtector directory if any of the components had a java process crash the JVM. When this occurs, these files can be created. 

Generally speaking, these javacore.*, heapdump.*, and snap.* files are safe to be deleted. However, take note of the date when these files were created. If they are several weeks or older, they should be OK to delete (the crash is not occurring any more, possibly resolved from an update). If the files are recent, you should contact Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/handbook/contacts.html]and provide the latest set of files. Generally, these files could be found in the directories below: 

Note: These only exist if the component's java process crashed the JVM. If no crashes have occurred, these files do not exist. 

\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Agent Manager\bin 
\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Application Server\bin 
\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Console\bin 
\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector\bin 
\Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\JavaEE\Geronimo2.1.8
