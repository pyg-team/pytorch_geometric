ABSTRACT
 The CICS Transaction Server (CICS TS) Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.1 enables dynamic scripting functionality in CICS TS V4.2. This document contains a list of some of the key features, a link to system requirements, and additional ways that you can become familiar with the capabilities of dynamic scripting. 

CONTENT
Dynamic scripting enables IT professionals and lines of business developers to leverage the agility benefits of dynamic scripting languages to address less-critical situational applications. By using the Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting, you will be able to benefit from reduced application backlogs, greater business agility, and tighter control over the enterprise's computing resources.

The updated feature pack is functionally equivalent with the original release, but when used in conjunction with CICS TS V4.2 JVMServer technology, 64 bit Javaâ„¢ 6.0.1, and multi-threaded JDBC support in DB2 (see DB2 for z/OS APARs: PM32360 [http://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1PM32360] for V8.1, V9.1 and V10, and additionally PM32361 [http://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1PM32361] for V9.1 and V10), it provides a robust, managed, and scalable environment for situational applications.

Note: If you are running CICS TS V4.2, you must use CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.1. If you are running CICS TS V4.1, you must use CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0.

The CICS TS Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.1 (for CICS TS 4.2) and the CICS TS Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V1.0 (for CICS TS 4.1) are available for download here [http://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?lang=en_US&source=swg-cicsds&S_CMP=rnav].
