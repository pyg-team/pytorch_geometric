RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

If all steps have been exhausted to diagnose if there is a disk enclosure related HW issue, follow the below steps to clear the system error LED (amber)

STEPS:

1) Stop NPS (it is a best practice to generate a nzhostbackup before stopping NPS)
$nzstop
2) Power cycle; power-off/power-on the S-blades and the storage groups

2.1) power OFF S-blade Chassis 
$/nzlocal/scripts/rpc/spapwr.sh -off all
2.2) power OFF storage groups 
$/nzlocal/scripts/rpc/spapwr.sh -off all -j all
- wait for 5 minutes; to allow enough time to clear system error LED

2.3) power ON storage groups first 
$/nzlocal/scripts/rpc/spapwr.sh -on all -j all
- wait for 5 minutes before power ON S-blade Chassis

2.4) power ON S-blade Chassis
$/nzlocal/scripts/rpc/spapwr.sh -on all

3) Start NPS
$ nzstart

4) Check system for HW issues
$ nzhw -issues
$ nzpush -s */1 encl show -all

5) Validate with SSR onsite if the disk enclosure system error amber LEDs has gone.
