Title: IBM Where to add INI settings - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Where does one insert code into the INI files? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Any statements in the cognos.ini are separated by entries in square brackets [ ].
For example, if you were to add the following: 

[PowerPlay DataServer]
ReadCacheSize=4096
WriteCacheSize=16384

into the cognos.ini file, it should be included either at the very end or the very beginning or at a line preceding a [ ... ] entry.
To make the following three examples functional, settings need to be saved. If Transformer is open, close the application and restart it for the new settings to take effect. 

1.
[PowerPlay DataServer]
ReadCacheSize=4096
WriteCacheSize=16384
[ServicesK]
COGN LSTAB=coglang.tab
