ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.1 needs to show an example of how to define
   a file-based repository and enable security using a wsadmin
   commands. The example needs to be similar to the "Using a
   single built-in, file-based repository in a new configuration
   under federated repositories" topic, but use wsadmin commands.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
   This APAR affects users of Information Center for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 6.1.who need to use wsadmin scripting
   to configure a single built-in file-based repository in a new
   configuration under federated repositories.
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Version
   6.1 contains a topic entitled, ?Using a single built-in,
   file-based repository in a new configuration under federated
   repositories?. However,  the steps described in this topic use
   the administrative console to complete the task and not the
   wsadmin scripting capabilities.
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The documentation needs to describe how to use wsadmin scripting
   to configure a single built-in, file-based repository in a new
   configuration under federated repositories.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuring a single built-in, file-based repository in a
   new configuration under federated repositories" topic has been
   created to address this APAR. The new topic has been added to
   the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Version
   6.1. This topic provides the steps that are required to perform
   this task using wsadmin scripting commands.  The content of this
   topic is as follows:
   
   Configuring a single built-in, file-based repository in a new
   configuration under federated repositories using wsadmin
   You can use the Jython or Jacl scripting language with the
   wsadmin tool to configure a single built-in, file-based
   repository in a new configuration under Federated repositories.
   
   Shut down the application server and ensure you have the primary
   administrator id and password.
   
   The federated repositories configuration file, wimconfig.xml, is
   supported by WebSphere Application Server 6.1.x and is located
   in the app_server_root/profiles/profile_name/config/cells/
   cell_name/wim/config directory.
   
   Use the following steps to configure for use a single built-in,
   file-based repository in a new configuration for federated
   repositories.
   1. Launch the wsadmin scripting tool.
   2. Create the fileRegistry.xml file, which is the user registry
   itself, if it does not already exist. If the fileRegistry.xml
   file does exist, this step just adds the user to registry.
        Using Jython:
   AdminTask.addFileRegistryAccount('-userId isoet01s01 -password
   oets01')
        Using Jacl:
   $AdminTask addFileRegistryAccount {-userId isoet01s01 -password
   oets01}
   3. Update the security.xml file to enable administrative
   security, set the activeUserRegistry to use federated
   repositories, and update the primaryAdmin and its password.
        Using Jython:
   AdminTask applyWizardSettings('-secureApps false
    -secureLocalResources false
    -userRegistryType WIMUserRegistry
    -customRegistryClass com.ibm.ws.wim.registry.WIMUserRegistry
    -adminName isoet01s01 -adminPassword oets01')
         Using Jacl:
   $AdminTask applyWizardSettings {-secureApps false
    -secureLocalResources false
    -userRegistryType WIMUserRegistry
    -customRegistryClass com.ibm.ws.wim.registry.WIMUserRegistry
    -adminName isoet01s01
    -adminPassword oets01}
   4. Save your configuration changes. Enter the following
   commands to save the new configuration and close the wsadmin
   tool:
          Using Jython:
   AdminConfig.save()
          Using Jacl:
   $AdminConfig save
   5. Restart the application server.
   
   Date that information will be available externally to customers:
   The modified documentation will be available in the next update
   to the Information Centers, which is scheduled to occur on or
   before September 30, 2007.
