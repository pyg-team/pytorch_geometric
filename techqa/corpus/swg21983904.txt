Title: IBM SCM check analyses are showing as <not activated> the SCA user interface - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The reason why your check analyses are no longer showing activated and returning data in the SCA user interface. 

SYMPTOM
Check analyses in the SCA interface are showing as <not activated> in the SCA user interface where at one point they were activated and returning data. Now they are not activated and not returning data.


CAUSE
The operator who activated the analysis has been deleted. The audit trail cleaner tool was run and it removed the operator and de-activated the analysis.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, have an active operator reactivate the check analyses and then run a new import in SCA. As a best practice, it is recommended that you have an operator account dedicated to activating the SCM check analyses in your deployment. This account should never be deleted.
