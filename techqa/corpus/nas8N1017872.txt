PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document describes how to easily convert files with packed numeric fields to either .CSV comma separated value or plain ASCII text files using the CPYTOIMPF command so that the file can be sent using FTP. 

There is an easy way to create a .CSV (Comma Separated Value) or plain text file from an IBM OS/400 or IBM i5/OS database file that contains packed decimal fields.

For years, we have been limited by the fact that the FTP product does not translate "...special numeric representations..." like packed decimal fields, which are the default numeric data type for OS/400. We have told customers to do things like printing the file to get a flat file.

Now there is a better way. This is available from R420 and up.

The CPYTOIMPF command lets you copy a database file into a 'flat' file with the record delimiters of your choice. This may also be used to create files that would nicely fit some of Microsoft Windows NT EOR delimiter needs, too. 

CPYTOIMPF has added a parameter STMFCODPAG to be able to convert to PCACSCII. If it does not have the parameter, download the PTFs noted on APARs SA88265 and SA88341 to have the latest CPYTOIMPF command.

Both .CSV and flat files from databases with packed fields are easily created. There has never been an easy way to do this before.

There is also a CPYFRMIMPF command that should allow you to copy your spreadsheet files directly into OS/400 or i5/OS database files.
