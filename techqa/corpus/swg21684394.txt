Title: IBM Unable to connect to Chinese Database in SQL Server using the DataDirect ODBC Connector - United States

Text:
Chinese database; ODBC connectivity TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to connect a Microsoft SQL Server database of Chinese name using DataDirect ODBC Connector, the connection returns error 

SYMPTOM
DataDirect ODBC connector reports below error when accessing a Chinese database defined in .odbc.ini file: 

ODBC function "SQLConnect" reported: SQLSTATE = 14601:Native Error Code = 4,060: Msg = [IBM(DataDirect OEM)][ODBC SQL Server Legacy Driver][SQL Server]Cannot open database "***" requested by the login. The login failed.


CAUSE
ODBC connector uses .odbc.ini as configuration to access databases. And .odbc.ini can only use ASCII English characters so it cannot have Chinese character as database name in the defined DSN.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The limitation for .odbc.ini file is imposed by DataDirect ODBC Driver Manager. Here is a work-around to connect to SQL Server database of Chinese name. 

Leave the Database entry in .odbc.ini blank or put a valid English database name so that a DSN can be specified in job. In the properties tab of ODBC Connector stage write the fully qualified table name in below format: 

[chinesename_db].[schema].[tablename]
