PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  Users of IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise   *
   *                  leveraging multi-cell star topology         *
   *                  configurations.                             *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In multi-cell star topologies, the on   *
   *                      demand router (ODR) start-up is         *
   *                      delayed by the on demand configuration  *
   *                      (ODC) component.                        *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In multi-cell star topologies, the algorithm used to initially
   fetch and consume ODC data can lengthen the amount of time
   required to start ODR processes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The algorithm used to initially fetch and consume ODC data has
   been altered so that it does not delay the amount of time
   required to start ODR processes.
   
   This fix will be included in the next available fix pack for
   IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise.
