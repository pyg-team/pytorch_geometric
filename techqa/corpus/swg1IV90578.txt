APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: 1. New requirement for iKeyman add/receive
   command
      In iKeyman, if "-cert -add" is done by accident before
   "-cert -receive", a misleading error message "The certificate
   request created for the certificate is not in the key database"
   is displayed
   2. Fix a regression in PKCS12/JKS keystore:
      1) In some cases, list certificates in PKCS12/JKS keystore,
   displays an error message - such as:
          "The key for label 'XXXX' could not be recovered."
      2) Also, convert JKS/PKCS keystore to any keystore type
   throws an exception.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Work around for issue 2:
     1) For PKCS12 keystore change file extension from .p12 to .pfx
     2) For JKS keystore:
        We need to export each certificate (key entry) to a
   different keystore. The Cert list error should be solved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  1. New requirement for iKeyman add/receive command:
      If the user accidentally adds the "-cert -add" signer
   certificate received from a CA that was requested to sign a
   certificate request using "-cert -add" command, then user will
   never be able to receive the certificate "-cert -receive" that
   replaces Certificate Request key entry to Certificate key entry.
   In the above case iKeyman rejects the request and throws an
   error message.
   
   2. Fix a regression in PKCS12/JKS keystore:
       This problem was introduced due to the fix in previous
   release 8.0.412 where iKeyman reconstructs the keystore list for
   JKS and PKCS12 as in JDK 7 for PKCS12 keystore. This problem
   will occur in JKS and PKCS12 keysore.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. New requirement for iKeyman add/receive command:
      Rather than just fixing the error message iKeyman intend to
   address the usage scenario (-add to do -receive) and make it
   work as the user assumed it would.
   2. Fix a regression in PKCS12/JKS keystore:
      The bug introduced in 8.0.412 is fixed in this release.
   .
   This APAR will be fixed in the following Java Releases:
      7    SR10      (7.0.10.0)
      6 R1 SR8 FP40  (6.1.8.40)
      7 R1 SR4       (7.1.4.0)
      6    SR16 FP40 (6.0.16.40)
      8    SR3 FP21  (8.0.3.21)
   .
