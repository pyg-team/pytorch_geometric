QUESTION
 Can the optional WebSphere Portal Server v6.1 shipped with Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software v7.5.0 be installed with the existing WebSphere Application Server v7.0? What about support of Portal server v6.1 with WebSphere Application Server v7.0 in general? 

ANSWER
 

 * The optional install images for WebSphere Portal Server v6.1.0.0 (with WebSphere Application Server ND v6.1.0.x) that ship with Rational Application Developer v7.5.0, cannot be installed over an existing WebSphere Application Server v7.0.
   
 * You cannot upgrade an existing WebSphere Portal Server v6.1.0.0 installed with WebSphere Application Server v6.1.


The Portal 6.1 technote referenced in the Related Information section below, answers this question in greater detail. The technote states: 

"... No previous releases of WebSphere Portal will support Application Server V7.0, including version 6.1.0.0, even when upgraded to version 6.1.0.1 by applying a fix pack. 

The refreshed installation images for version 6.1.0.1 must be used to install against an existing Application Server version 7.0. There is no media or included license for Application Server version 7.0 provided in any WebSphere Portal version 6.1.0.1 packaging, edition, or e-Assembly. 

..."
