QUESTION
 Why am I receiving a "Interrupt type 0 is being ignored" message in the db2diag.log? 

CAUSE

Review the following in your db2diag.log

2016-09-19-00.53.09.406978-720 I59604385B395 LEVEL: Warning

DATA #1 : <preformatted> 
Interrupt type 0 is being ignored 


ANSWER
 

The most common cause behind the above behavior is the failure of a authentication issue, related to a remote user attempting a DB2 QUIESCE DATABASE command for which that user is not allowed to do so. 

Here is the definition of sqleCheckForForceInterrupts
//===========================================================
// When independent coordinator agents are interrupted, check the interrupt 
// type for a force interrupt that is informing the icoord to shut down. 
// Also check for SQLETERMDB in case a timing scenario happens where a node 
// failure interrupt masks the force interrupt from last connection. In such 
// case the sys app will hang the db from terminating. 
// Reset the interrupt and purge error reports so that the icoord can 
// continue if the interrupt is another type

Correct the access for the remote user to avoid these warnings to re-appear.
These warnings can be ignored too.
