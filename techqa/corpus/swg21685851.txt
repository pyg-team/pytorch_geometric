Title: IBM WebSphere Cast Iron is not affected by the Bash vulnerabilites - United States

Text:
Bash; Shell Shock FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Cast Iron is not vulnerable to the Bash vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock”. This includes the Cast Iron physical appliances and Cast Iron virtual appliances.


CONTENT
Cast Iron is not impacted by Shellshock. Cast Iron Development has investigated the issue and provided the following details: 

 * Cast Iron does not expose bash shell to customers 
 * Cast Iron does not use cgi bin
   


DataPower does not ship bash in its firmware, so it is not vulnerable and hence the appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.
