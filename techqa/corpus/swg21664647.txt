Using the Monitoring Policy to automate the server startup may interfere with Application updates. This causes the startserver process to fail with port conflicts. As a result, some users may experience a problem with applying Hotfixes to Websphere based Sametime Applications. 

SYMPTOM
This may apply to any Sametime Application. User may experience: 

Hotfix application failure. 

Install failure. 

Check the following logs startserver and systemout of respective 'application server'. This example is from a Sametime Meeting 9.0 Server.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the installation manager and server logs to check if start/stop process is failing with "another instance of the server may be running" or check for error messages in the logs


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Before installing updates, Log into the Websphere Application server. 

Navigate to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name.
Then,
Java and process management > Monitoring policy. In Configuration, General Properties Set the node restart state to "stopped" 

Apply the setting 

Synchronize and Restart 

This should allow the installation of updates to succeed 

After update is complete be sure to reset the monitoring policy to "running"
