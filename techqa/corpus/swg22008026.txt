 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Health Check Dashboard UI is not displayed on fresh JazzSM 1.1.3 environment.. 

SYMPTOM
IBM Infrastructure Management Dashboards for Servers 1.1.0.2(Health Check Dashboard) user interface (UI) does not display after the fresh installation of Jazz for Service Management 1.1.3.0 (part number: CNC1PML).


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is no resolution for this issue on the Jazz for Service Management 1.1.3.0 and later versions. 

Jazz for Service Management 1.1.3.0 product introduced profile level REST libraries to support other DASH products, which does not support REST classes associated with IBM Infrastructure Management Dashboards for Servers 1.1.0.2 and return class loading error as a result.
Hence, Jazz for Service Management 1.1.3.0 and later does not support “Infrastructure Management Dashboard (Health Check Dashboard)”.

IBM Infrastructure Management Dashboards for Servers 1.1.0.2 is supported by Jazz for Service Management 1.1.2.0 and previous versions.
