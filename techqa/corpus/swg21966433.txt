SUMMARY
 Multimple glibc vulnerabilities affecting Lotus Protector for Mail Security. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-2015-1781 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1781]
GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the gethostbyname_r() and other related functions. By sending a specially-crafted argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system elevated privileges or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102500] for current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

-----------
CVE-2013-2207 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2207]
The GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a local attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in the pt_chown() function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the pseudoterminal of other users.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/86914x [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/86914x] for current score

-----------
CVE-2014-8121 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8121]
GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly check if a file is open by DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS). By performing a look-up on a database while iterating over it, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
