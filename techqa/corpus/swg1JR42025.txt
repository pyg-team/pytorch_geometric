PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  User using WPS 7.0.0.4                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When returning from FTP adapter         *
   *                      binding, CreateResponseBG the BO does   *
   *                      not                                     *
   *                      have all properties set.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Incorrect CreateResponseBG returned for ftp adapter binding
   and misses one property. This incorrect BG causes the BO
   serializer to output invalid XML which is missing a tag.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Update the exception handling code to catch this
   incorrect BG exception and correct the BG, corresponding XML is
   correct after the BG set correctly
