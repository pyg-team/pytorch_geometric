QUESTION
 When preparing for a possible failover of Gentran CICS region within the same datacenter to another LPAR within the same physical mainframe. Can multiple instances of Sterling Gentran CICS region on the same physical mainframe, each being used by a separate LPAR, access the same set of VSAM files while in the update mode?

Gentran VSAM files are built with Share Options of 2,3
