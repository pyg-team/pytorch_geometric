Title: IBM Installation of R essentials for IBM SPSS Statistics hangs - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am installing the R Essentials for IBM SPSS Statistics. It starts to install but when it gives me a DOS window with rcmd.exe listed, it hangs and the installation does not complete. What is happening? 

CAUSE
No access to internet

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The installer for R Essentials is trying to access the internet to download the R packages that IBM SPSS uses. Verify your machine has access to the internet. 


If you cannot provide access to the internet, you will need to download each package separately from the R cran website. Go to 


http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html [http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html]

Locate each one of these r packages.

"car","mvtnorm","RColorBrewer","SparseM","sfsmisc","zoo","lmtest","sandwich", "strucchange","msm","polycor","ltm","quantreg","Formula","AER","scatterplot3d","poLCA","survey","mitools","corpcor","relaimpo","maxLik", "systemfit", "miscTools", "sampleSelection"

Download each package into a common folder.

Once you have done that, run the R Essentials for IBM SPSS Statistics installer again. When it gets to the DOS window with the file rcmd.exe, click the X button to close the DOS window. The install will then complete. 

Then Start the R Gui (2.15) as an administrator (i.e. right-click and select "Run as administrator"). 
From the Packages menu in the R Gui, select "Install package(s) from local zip files"
Navigate to the RPackages folder where you saved all the .zip files
Then select all files (you can use the standard shift+click action) and click Open in the "Select files" dialog.
You should then see a listing of the packages being installed.
