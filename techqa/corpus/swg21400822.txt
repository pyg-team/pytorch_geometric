QUESTION
 What are the naming conventions for rule artifacts? 

ANSWER
As a rule author, you are allowed to use spaces within rule artifact names, as well as digits, but you are not allowed to use 

 * spaces at the beginning and the end, 
 * the following characters: ", ., :, *, /, <, >, ?, \, |.. 


Those conventions are enforced in both Rule Studio and Rule Team Server. In Rule Studio, creating a package with a name that contains one or more dots ('.') will generate a succession of imbricated folders.  

The name you create is the Business Name. For the rule to become executable, this name must be translated into a Technical Name. 

That translation uses JRules IRL code. IRL code is the runtime code that is automatically generated from rule project artifacts. IRL code follows the same syntax as the syntax used for Java identifiers. Therefore, any character that is not allowed in a Java identifier must be processed for the rule name to become valid. 

The substitutions currently performed to generate a technical name are: 

 * A space is replaced by an underscore character: _ 
 * $ is replaced by $$ 
 * _ is replaced by $_$ 
 *  A leading digit is replaced by $<char code of the digit>$



For rule tasks, a "ruleflowName#" prefix is added to the rule name to prevent name conflicts when two rule tasks have the same names.  

Note: To retrieve the rule business name from its technical name, use the method IlrNameUtil.getBusinessIdentifier(String identifier).
