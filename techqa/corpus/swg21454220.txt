PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting data for problems with IBM WebSphere Partner Gateway Integrated FTP Server. Gathering this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help expedite problem analysis. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

This section instructs the items of documentation required by the IBM WPG support team to diagnose the problem. 


Firstly, input information required for all cases:


 *  Operating system, version and patch level: WPG version and fixpack level: WPG Topology (Simple/Simple Distributed/Full Distributed?): DB and fixpack level: 
   (For instructions on how to get above information, refer to WPG ReadFirst Technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2310&uid=swg21281975]. ) The Integrated FTP Server, WPG HUB, Common File System reside on same machine? If not, are they located in same network zone? Is this a production system? Occurrence (Problem is always reproducible?) Have this specific operation ever worked before? If yes, was any change recently made before the problem started to occur? A clear, specific problem scenario. 


Secondly, please collect required data and submit them to PMR:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   1. Edit <ftpserver installed path>/common/classes/log4j.propertiesfile. 
    2. Change setting for property log4j.rootLoggeras DEBUG.(default is 'ERROR') 
    3. Save the changes. Restart FTP Server.
   
   
 * 
 *  Also take the following steps and set debug trace for the bcgconsole - This is required only when the problem is with console operations:  * Changing FTP server or user configurations. 
    * FTP Server Start/stop operations on Console  1. Start the WAS administrative console. 
       2. Click Troubleshooting> Logs and Trace 
       3. Select server name 
          (e.g. Simple mode: 'server1'; Simple distributed: 'bcgserver'; Full distributed: 'bcgconsole') 
       4. Click Change Log Level Details. 
       5. Select the Configuration tab. 
       6. Enable the components logging by entering the below trace string:
          *=info:com.ibm.bcg.*=finest 
       7. Click Apply. 
       8. Save the changes, restart the bcgconsole server. 
      
      
      
   
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Compress the new log sets under the following locations:
   
   
 *  FTP Server logs (mandatory for all cases):
   <ftpserver installed path>/conf/logs
   
   And console server logs (required for cases with console operations):
   <WPG_HUB_HOME>/wasND/profiles/<bcgprofile>/logs/<server name>
