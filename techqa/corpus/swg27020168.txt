Hardware and software information:

For information about the prerequisite hardware and software for IBM Production Imaging Edition, see the following resources for the component products: 

 * For IBM FileNet Content Manager, IBM FileNet Business Process Manager, and IBM FileNet Workplace XT requirements, see the detailed system requirements document at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654]. 
 * For IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture requirements, see the Datacap Taskmaster Capture installation guide available at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020296 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020296]. 
 * For requirements for IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro, see the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro Installation Guide available at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014].


For IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro, any additional requirements are generally the same as for the version of IBM FileNet Workplace XT included in the IBM Production Imaging Edition product bundle. Therefore, in addition to the hardware and software requirements listed in the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro Installation Guide, see also the hardware and software requirements for IBM FileNet Workplace XT in the detailed system requirements document at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013654]. 

Exceptions to the supported hardware and software for IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro that do not match the supported hardware and software for IBM FileNet Workplace XT are included in the Known problems information section of this document. 

Known problems information 

The following known problems exist in IBM Production Imaging Edition Version 5.0:  * Software that is not supported with IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro  * Oracle Solaris 9 Operating System 
    * Linux on IBM System z 
    * Windows 2003 Server (Windows 2003 R2 is supported) 
    * Oracle WebLogic 9.2 and 10.0
   
   

 * Update required for Novell SUSE Enterprise Server 9
   
   Installation of the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro software on Novell SUSE Enterprise Server 9 requires the installation of the libstdc++.so.6 file. The installation of this file is described in the Novell Knowledgebase article "Optional update for libgcc-4.1,libstdc++-4.1." See the following link:
   http://support.novell.com/techcenter/psdb/ea8545892a565af183b0f83eeaeb62ad.html [http://support.novell.com/techcenter/psdb/ea8545892a565af183b0f83eeaeb62ad.html]

 * Installation of additional viewer modules is not supported without a complete removal and reinstallation of IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro software
   
   If you use a nondefault installation process to install a subset of the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro modules and then you attempt to install additional viewer modules, the installation of additional viewer modules will fail. To work around this problem, use the steps documented in the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro Installation Guide to remove your installation and install IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro again. Make sure that the modules that you want to install are selected. The installation guide is available from the product publications link:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014].

 * Limited high availability support
   
   In a failover situation, the messages in the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro error message dialog boxes do not clearly inform the user that a failover has occurred. The user is required to close and restart the viewer.

 * Single sign-on (SSO) support for Kerberos/SPNEGO only
   
   SSO is supported only for Kerberos/SPNEGO. SSO is not supported with IBM Tivoli Access Manager or CA SiteMinder.

 * No PDF-to-PDF redaction support
   
   There are known issues for the PDF-to-PDF redaction feature in IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro. This feature is not supported.

 * No redaction support from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Widgets or IBM Case Manager
   
   If IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro is installed with a IBM FileNet Workplace XT installation that is also hosting ECM Widgets or IBM Case Manager, then the Redaction > Redact to File menu option is not available from the context menu within ECM Widgets or IBM Case Manager.

 * Known problem with redaction and the Sun JRE 1.5
   
   An empty text redaction output file is created when a TIFF document is redacted with the Sun JRE 1.5. To work around this problem, use an application server with the Sun JRE 1.6.

 * Known problem with text redactions for TIFF documents with carriage returns
   
   When a text redaction within a TIFF document contains an embedded carriage return, only the first line of the text redaction is visible on the output file.  
   
   
 * Redaction functionality fails from Workplace XT when it is installed in the Mashups created profile. 
   
   A separate Workplace XT instance should be created in a clean WebSphere Application Server profile for running the Viewer from Workplace XT, especially for the redaction functionality. 

 * Removal of IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro fails in certain environments
   
   If IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro is installed with an installation path that contains double-byte characters, then an attempt to remove the viewer installation will fail.
   
   To work around this problem, choose one of the following options:  * Do not use double-byte characters in the installation path for the viewer. 
    * If the viewer is already installed in a directory with double-byte characters, then you can manually remove the viewer installation by following the manual uninstallation instructions documented in the IBM Production Imaging Edition Viewer Pro Installation Guide. This guide is available from the product publications link:
      http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020014].
   
   


 * IBM Case Manager supports universal viewer and streamer.
   
   PDF files and Microsoft Office documents open without failure in Viewer Pro with IBM Case Manager.
