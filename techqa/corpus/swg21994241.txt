Clickjacking; security; vulnerability SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A "Clickjacking" security vulnerability affects the IBM Content Navigator toolkit which is used by the Administration Console for Content Engine (ACCE) tool. This tool is packaged with both the FileNet Content Manager and IBM Content Foundation products.

The Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) application URL can be opened within a frame in a web page. In this context it is possible for the containing parent frame to record user input to the contained frame, capturing sensitive information like login credentials. The attack requires that a user be tricked into opening a page provided by an attacker.
