APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  User upgraded TPC-R from 4.2.1.3 to 4.2.2.2, then got into this
   problem where there is WAS native Out Of Memory Errors ("failed
   to fork a thread" or "failed to create a thread"), the thread
   count is over 2000, and there were 2000-2100 threads in a
   'parked' state in the Javacore file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customers with a large amount of volumes in a session (60,000
   pairs +) and a large amount of LSS to LSS pairings are
   susceptible to this problem. It is surfaced as "An internal
   error has occurred."
   This is caused by a native Out of Memory error. "1TISIGINFO Dump
   Event "systhrow" (00040000) Detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError"
   "Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 12"
   received" and JavaCore dump files were created. In the JavaCore
   file there were an unusual amount of threads which were in a
   parked state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem was caused by the high keep-alive value defined for
   the cached thread pool. A small change was made to ensure that
   the service is shutdown after all work has completed. If this
   problem is hit replication continues on the hardware but access
   to TPC-R will be impacted.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Restart the TPC-R server
