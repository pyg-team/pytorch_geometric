PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server                                      *
   *                  Java Batch                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Database update failures are not        *
   *                      retried resulting in failed             *
   *                      operations.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Database update failures are not retried.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the endpoint server encounters a StaleConnectionException,
   it will now attempt to obtain another connection and retry the
   operation. All other types of SQLException will be propagated
   to the caller to handle.
