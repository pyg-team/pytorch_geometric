APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you use an SCA client application that makes an SCA call to
   an SCA export that was created by using an SCA message event in
   a business process definition (BPD), you see the following error
    message when you click the SCA import binding's link of the
   client application in the administrative console:
   
   ?CWMAO1504E: The module moduleName cannot be found.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually update the SCA client application to find the SCA
   export AFTER deploying the applications
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When the BPD application that uses an SCA message event is
   activated so it shows up in the SCA modules panel of
   administrative console, the name of the module is changed. After
    the change, for the client application the official name of the
    target module is different from the name of the target module
   that is written in the binding configuration file of the target
   module. As a result, the target module is not located on the SCA
    import binding panel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5 that
   allows you to view the target module and the target export on
   the SCA import binding panel in the administrative console.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually set the target module and target export in the Module
   and Export menus on the SCA import binding panel in the
   administrative console. Save your changes.
