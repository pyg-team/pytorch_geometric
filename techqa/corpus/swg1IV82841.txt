APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION:   Specifications values are lost if the
   Classification is selected with a double tap.
   
   
   PROBLEM:
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:   N/A
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   1. Go To -> Classifications
   
    2.   Create New
   
   Name it AA (this will need to appear at the top of the list of
   the device)
   
   3. Add it as a classification
   
   Give it a description AA
   
   DO NOT GIVE IT A PARENT
   
   4. Add use with Workorder Object
   
   5. Add two attributes
   
   Select Action -> Add/Modify Properties -> Attribtutes
   
   New Row
   
   Attribute TEST
   
   Description TEST
   
   Data Type ALN
   
   
   
   New Row
   
   Attribute TEST2
   
   Description TEST2
   
   Data Type ALN
   
   5. Click OK
   
   6. Add the two attributes to the Classification
   
   7. Save the Classification
   
   8. Create and assign a Workorder to Anywhere
   
   9. On the device refresh the lookup data.
   
   10. Open the workorder
   
   11. Create Followup Workorder.
   
   Note:
   On the device - If you do other things to the Follow-on
   Workorder,  e.g, open the change status screen and close it
   even without changing status, or re-open the classification
   screen and close it with no change, then you can mask the
   issue.  In order to reproduce the bug you  must not deviate
   from these instructions.
   
   
   12. Click Classification
   
   The AA classification we created should appear on the first
   page and  NOT as a child
   
   13. Click AA
   
   14. Type One into the TEST specification
   
   15. Click into the TEST2 Specification to ensure the value has
   been  accepted by the TEST specification
   
   16. Click Create
   
   This will take you back to the Workorder you assigned to the
   device.
   
   17. Create Followup Workorder
   
   18. Click Classification
   
   19Click AA
   
   19. Type Two into the TEST specification
   
   20. Click into the TEST2 Specification to ensure the value has
   been  accepted by the TEST specification
   
   21. Click Create
   
   22. Repeat creating Follow-ons ten times, changing the value
   typed into the  specification each time
   
   23. You will then get 10 Workorders on Maximo with the correct
    specifications
   
    24. Now repeat the test in Anywhere except when choosing the
   clasification   double click on it, or tap twice, varying the
   tap speed
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   The specification value does not appear in Maximo. When the
   specifications come back to Maximo some or all of
   them will be missing.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   
   Get all Workorders on Maximo with the correct Specifications
   
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   
   This cannot be reproduced on simulator as it only downloads 200
   records so you cannot be specific on the records it downloads
   for the ClassSpec as there is not an application for this..
