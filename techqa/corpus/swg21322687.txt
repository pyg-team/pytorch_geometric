PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region receives a DFHDD0001 0C4 / AKEA in DFHDDLO. 

SYMPTOM
DFHDD0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhdd/DD0001.html] An abend (code 0C4/AKEA [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/AKxx_abend_codes/AKEA.html]) has occurred at offset X'0316' in module DFHDDLO.
DFHAP0002 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0002.html] A severe error (code X'D509') has occurred in module DFHUEH.
DFHDD0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'031A' in module DFHDDLO.

The region then had recursive abends in DFHDDLO at offsets X'0316' and X'31A'.


CAUSE
CA InterTest analysis indicates that an ITST transaction was in a looping condition which caused the TIOA storage area to get corrupted.

The loop condition triggered many 2902 messages: "Sequence Number is invalid" 
followed by message: "Correct the data or press ENTER to redisplay screen". 

The PROTSYM Symbolic Data set might have had a problem for a program, and that might have triggered the invalid sequence number condition.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The dump shows the ABEND0C4 occurs in DFHDDLO+x'0316 on a Load instruction (58202000). Usually, an abend 0C4 at this location into DFHDDLO indicates there is a storage overlay. Looking at the AP domain, you see numerous storage violations detected that include the area pointed to by register 2 in the Load instruction.

You see the same data repeated multiple times, and you see that the CICS QPH control blocks along with the leading and trailing SAAs are overlaid. The data looks like:
*.8ENTER.0to redisplay screen.N&.* 

*0 or Press.8PF1.0for mor* 
*e information.0.B#...&. ..&&.8.* 
*...2902 *

* redisplay screen.N&.0 or* 
* Press.8PF1.0for more informati* 
*on.0.B#...&. ..&&.8....2902 *

SYSTRACE shows that most of the dispatches prior to the 0C4 belong to CA InterTest module IN25LGET.
