webseal ltpa portal SSO TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I configure LTPA2 authentication between webseal and websphere. When I login to webspere then access to webseal, I am successfully authenticated. However, when I login to webseal then access to websphere, I can not log in.


CAUSE
The LTPA token cookie name is different.

ANSWER
The LTPA token cookie name is case insensitive on websphere. However, webseal handle it case sensitive. 

For example, subject problem is observed with following combination. 

 LTPA token cookie name on websphere: LtpaToken2 

 LTPA token cookie name on webseal ([ltpa] cookie-name) : Ltpatoken2 

 

In webseal-instance.conf, you must set exact cookie name into [ltpa] cookie-name parameter.
