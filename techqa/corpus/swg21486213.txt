Title: IBM Scoring Configuration fails in single node Websphere setup. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS) / Decision Management scoring configuration failed. In the C&DS log we see the following error

"com.spss.psapi.session.SessionException: Unable to connect to the repository." 

In addition, the log of the load balancer (C:\IBM\HTTPServer\logs\error.log) showed the following message: 

[Mon May 03 16:03:34 2010] [error] ws_common: websphereExecute: Failed to read from a new stream; App Server may have gone down during read
[Mon May 03 16:03:34 2010] [error] ws_server: serverSetFailoverStatus: Marking mia-bench1Node01_server1 down

Note: it may also be possible that jobs may fail as well if the Load Balancer believes the Application Server is down. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was caused by the load balancer (HTTP SErver) within Websphere timing out. The C&DS server was setup to use only a single node cluster within Websphere. It is the expectation that if there were multiple nodes the score would have been picked up by another node.

Websphere provides a plugin to use with this load balancer. The configuration for the plugin is in plugin-cfg.xml (C:\IBM\HTTPServer\Plugins\config\webserver1\plugin-cfg.xml). Increasing the ServerIOTimeout value from 60 to 180 resolved the problem.
