APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Description￘
   You are running a transaction remotely over an IPCONN and MRO
   connection.  When you use an MRO connection,  you get the
   USERID that you are currently logged on as.
   However, when you run the same test but using the IPCONN
   connection  the default userid is returned.
   
   Both IPCONN and MRO connections  hould return the userid
   currently logged on at the terminal.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users                               *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The USERID is returned incorrectly      *
   *                      when issuing CEMT INQUIRE TERMINAL      *
   *                      against a remote terminal via IPIC.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When transaction routing using IPIC connection, EXEC CICS
   INQUIRE TERMINAL against the remote terminal always returns the
   default userid even if the user has signed on with a different
   userid.
   
   The reason for this is that the userid received in the remote
   region (AOR) is not propagated into the remote terminal's
   SNEX_PRINCIPAL_USER_TOKEN.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHIXSM has been changed so that SNEX_PRINCIPAL_USER_TOKEN is
   set correctly.
