QUESTION
 Why can't I run Crystal Reports after upgrading IBM TRIRIGA product? 

CAUSE
We have upgraded IBM TRIRIGA and we discovered that executing SAP Crystal Reports (either query or direct connection type reports) throws errors in the server log. On several occasions our whole application was frozen / brought down by executing Crystal Reports.

It follows a sample of the error messages printed out in the server.log file:


YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,MMM ERROR [com.businessobjects.report.web.event.ViewerBroadcaster](Default Executor-thread-6) Unable to process listener com.crystaldecisions.sdk.occa.report.lib.
ReportSDKParameterFieldException: Missing parameter values.---- Error code:-2147217394 [CRSDK00000000] Error code name: missingParameterValueError
