CAUSE
Starting with IBM Tivoli Monitoring v6.3.0 Fix Pack 02, the common installer now automatically performs a prerequisite scan of the system to ensure a successful installation. This scan is performed for both the server and agent . However, the Log File agent v6.3.0 does not ship any specific prerequisite rules and the result contains "NOT AVAILABLETivoli Log File Agent".

The Log File Agent v6.3.0 User's Guide incorrectly states in the "New in this release" section: 

 * "Added support for the IBM Prerequisite Scanner. "


ENVIRONMENT
Tivoli Log File agent v6.3.0, and interim fixes. 

 IBM Tivoli Monitoring installer, v6.3.0.2 and beyond
