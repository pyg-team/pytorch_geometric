Title: IBM Problems with Sametime Meeting Rooms based on e-mail address - United States

Text:
Meeting Room URL; email address; UUID TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Meeting Rooms and change in e-mail address, UUID based meeting rooms, Meeting Rooms based on e-mail address

SYMPTOM
We are using Sametime Meetings rooms and their links are based on e-mail address of the owner of Meeting room. We are facing problems with meeting rooms when users leave the company. We are also facing problem with users whose e-mail addresses have to be changed for some reason.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
This issue is known to IBM under SPR KABS8PSL4B and APAR LO66231.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You require one or two hotfixes(based on your requirement and use of product) to resolve this issue. The hotfixes are installed on top of Sametime 8.5.2 IFR1. If you are using only browser based meetings then you need just server side hotfix DHOD-8RA3FQ. 

If you are using meeting rooms via client as well then you would require both server and client side hotfixes. Client side hotfix is BGOD-8RALE7. 

These hotfixes introduce the concept of UUID based URLs that never change for a meeting room. The functionality is enabled via the configuration parameter meetingroomcenter.useUUIDBasedURLs. A value if true causes room URLs to be UUID based. A value of false (the default) using room URLs like previous product versions. 

UUID based rooms are not backward compatible i.e you will not be able to use them via older Sametime clients. But rooms created via older clients will still be usable in the updated clients.
