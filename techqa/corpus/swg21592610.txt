Title: IBM MQ Tracking (TH) data collector pthread error on 64-bit Windows system - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the ITCAM for Transactions MQ data collector is installed as an API exit for an MQ Queue Manager and a 64-bit client attempts to establish a connection to the Queue Manager, the connection fails with:
"KTH::TTDCMqInitExit [EXTN][ERRR]: Unable to load pthread.dll, aborting exits"

The 64-bit client may be Websphere Message Broker V8.0 or another 64-bit client. 

CAUSE
The pthread.dll library supplied with the MQ data collector is a 32-bit library, and is not able to be loaded for a 64-bit exit. The data collector is unable to find a suitable 64-bit version of pthread.dll.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A 64-bit version of pthread.dll is available with the installation package for ITCAM for Transactions and can be copied to an appropriate location for the MQ data collector to load: 

- Copy pthread.dll from tusupport into the kth 64-bit user exit directory. 
> copy <ITM_HOME>\tusupport\64\pthread.dll <ITM_HOME>\kth\exits64

The 64-bit client should now be able to connect to MQ, with the MQ data collector loading without error.
