ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the WSDL below, create a Webservice Povider and Consumer.
   
   The Request generated by the Consumer is incorrect.
   
   Example was taken from:
   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-tipjax1
   .html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-tipjax1.html]
   
   
   The issue is not strictly with the WSDL, but the request
   generated by
   the consumer.
   The generated header contains reference to a namespace that is
   defined
   in the body
   
   <soapenv:Header>
          <a0:quote_timestamp>
          </a0:quote_timestamp>
   </soapenv:Header>
   <soapenv:Body
          .......
