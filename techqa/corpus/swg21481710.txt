Title: IBM Does SPSS MIXED offer robust standard errors? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm running a mixed model in SPSS and would like to obtain robust standard errors (also known as empirical, sandwich, or Huber-White). Does SPSS MIXED offer such an option? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS MIXED currently does not offer robust (empirical or sandwich) standard errors. An enhancement request has been filed with SPSS Development. Beginning with Release 19, the GENLINMIXED procedure is available. GENLINMIXED fits generalized linear mixed models, which includes linear mixed models as a special case. GENLINMIXED does offer a robust covariance matrix estimator. Currently, GENLINMIXED's estimation options only include the equivalent of REML estimation in MIXED, not ML estimation
