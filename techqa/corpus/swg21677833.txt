Title: IBM Installation of Portal CF fails with version mismatch - United States

Text:
upgrade; cf; version mismatch TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Installation of Portal CF fails with message, "Profile
version is not the same as portal binary version before updating portal
binary."

SYMPTOM
Installation of a Portal cumulative fix fails


CAUSE
The Portal binaries and the Portal profile are at different versions. 

ENVIRONMENT
Portal 7.0x
AIX

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In this case, the upgrade-profile task was ran in 2012
after the CF14 was applied. However, in May 2013 the ConfigTrace.log
shows no indication of the upgrade-profile task being executed after
CF21 was applied. This indicates the Portal binaries may have
been upgraded to CF21 but the Portal profile remained at CF14.

You can also compare the versions in the wps.properties files:

<portal_profile_root>/PortalServer/wps.properties

and 

<portal_root>/wps.properties

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade the Portal profile by running...

<wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.sh install CF

Specifically see this section...

All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the
following command can be used to update profiles that are not included
in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in
AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is
done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be
applied.
