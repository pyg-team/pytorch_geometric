Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
CVE-2014-3566 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in IBM Rational ClearCase. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

Description: ClearCase could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
The vulnerable components are the CCRC WAN Server / CM Server, ClearCase remote client, and the integrations with OSLC providers and with ClearQuest.



ClearCase version Status 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.6 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.13 Affected 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.16 Affected 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x (all versions and fix packs) Affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
CCRC WAN Server/CM Server:
On your server host, apply fixes to IBM HTTP Server to disable SSLv3.
Follow the instructions in the following bulletin: 
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687172].
If your clients connect directly to SSL-enabled ports used by the CCRC profile of WebSphere Application Server, apply WAS fixes as described in
Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2014-3566) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687173].

Depending on your version of ClearCase, you may need extra steps to apply these fixes:



7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x, and 7.1.2.x Document 1390803 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390803] explains how to update IBM HTTP Server and WebSphere Application Server for ClearCase CM Servers at release 7.1.x. Consult those instructions when applying the fix. 8.0.0.x, 8.0.1.x Apply the IBM HTTP Server and WebSphere Application Server fixes directly to your CCRC WAN server host. No ClearCase-specific steps are necessary. 
Clients (CCRC and integration clients): Apply a fix pack for your appropriate release of ClearCase. These fixes disable SSLv3 in the client. 



Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.1.x Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 7 (8.0.1.7) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039409] 8.0.0.x Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 14 (8.0.0.14) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039407] 7.1.2.x 
7.1.1.x 
7.1.0.x Customers on extended support contracts should install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 17 (7.1.2.17) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039405] 
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Enabling ClearCase clients to use SSLv3:
If you must use SSLv3 (not recommended due to its weaknesses), you can configure your clients to permit its use. 

Client How to enable SSLv3 ClearCase remote client (CTE, rcleartool, CMAPI) for 8.0.0.x, 8.0.1.x releases
Note: 7.1.x releases of CCRC have never supported SSLv3, and cannot be configured to support SSLv3. Set Java system properties in the runtime environment. For example, to enable it in the CTE stand-alone client, add these lines to <ccase-home>/RemoteClient/ctexplorer.ini:
-vmargs
-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3=false
-Dcom.ibm.rational.clearcase.transport.client.protocol=SSL Base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration v2 Edit <ccase-home>/lib/CCCQ/config.pl to set the new configuration setting CQCC_SERVER_SSLV3 to TRUE Other integration clients Set a user environment variable CCASE_ENABLE_SSLV3=1 
Enabling CCRC WAN Server/CM Server to use SSLv3: 
To configure your servers to allow SSLv3, follow the instructions in the WAS or IHS bulletins referenced above. 
In addition, if your servers are configured to use a ClearCase integration such as CMI or UCM/CQ, you must set the environment variable in the WAS profile used to run the WAN server. Set the variable CCASE_ENABLE_SSLV3 to 1, following the instructions in tech note 1254153 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21254153]. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
