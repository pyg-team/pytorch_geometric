Text:
evolution NEWS

ABSTRACT
IBM Rational Developer for the Enterprise is a bundle of multiple Integrated Development Environment (IDE) products. Each of the IDEs could also be purchased separately, but Rational Developer for the Enterprise makes it simpler to purchase and renew licenses for customers who need IDEs for several different platforms (such as z Systems, IBM i, and distributed platforms) and languages (such as Java, Web 2.0, COBOL, RPG, C/C++, EGL, ...). It also provides an implicit price discount as compared to purchasing multiple IDEs separately.

Rational Developer for the Enterprise is a "soft bundle", meaning that each of the included products uses its own installer and requires its own license keys, and the use of the products is subject to both the License Agreements of the individual bundled products and an overarching bundle License Information document.

Rational Developer for the Enterprise 9.1.0 delivers, for each of the bundled products, new features, feature enhancements, and fixes.

Licensing: Version 9.1.0 does not require a new version of the Floating User license keys for any of the bundled products. The Authorized User (AU) license activation kits are version-specific as usual, but are included with the product installable images. (The AU activation kits also continue to be available from the Rational License Key Center for those who prefer to keep track of all their license keys there). For general information on obtaining license keys, see How to obtain license keys for IBM Rational products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250403].

Installation: Version 9.1.0 does require a full install of each product (that is, you cannot apply 9.1 as an update to an existing 9.0 or older product installation).

Obtaining product installable images: For information on downloading the Rational Developer for the Enterprise installable image from Passport Advantage, see Rational Developer for the Enterprise e-assemblies to download from Passport Advantage [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21652355].

Product Documentation: Rational Developer for the Enterprise does not have its own overarching user manual (Knowledge Center). The product documentation consists of the individual Knowledge Centers of the bundled products.
