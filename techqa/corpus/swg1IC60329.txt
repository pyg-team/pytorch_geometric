ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a Mediation Flow Component in a WebSphere Process Server or

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus    *
   *                 and WebSphere Process Server v6.1.2 and      *
   *                 V6.2 who include Mediation Flow Components   *
   *                 in sub-directories in projects.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When converting a component name to a   *
   *                      JNDI name for a Mediation Flow          *
   *                      Component any slashes in the name       *
   *                      were being converted to underscores.    *
   *                      This prevents the runtime code from     *
   *                      being able to locate the Mediation      *
   *                      Flow Component.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: If you experience problems with locating a   *
   *                 Mediation Flow Component that is included    *
   *                 in a sub-directory of your project you are   *
   *                 advised to install the fix pack which        *
   *                 contains the code update associated with     *
   *                 this APAR.                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   When converting a component name to a
   JNDI name for a Mediation Flow
   Component any slashes in the name
   were being converted to underscores.
   This prevents the runtime code from
   being able to locate the Mediation
   Flow Component.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified such that the correct JNDI name for the
   component is now used.
   
   There are no known side effects associated with this fix.
   There is no known alternative workaround should you encounter
   this problem.
   
   This code fix was targeted to be included in the latest
   WebSphere Integration Developer iFix.
