Text:
5724T6900 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TCR uninstallation does not remove the Deployment Engine. 

SYMPTOM
After uninstalling TCR v1.2 and attempting to reinstall, you will see the following message: 

Deployment Engine failed to initialize. The installer will now shut down. Please check with the log files for a more complete description of the failure.


CAUSE
The Deployment Engine was not removed during the TCR uninstallation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Perform the following steps to proceed with a manual uninstallation of TCR v1.2: 


1. Stop WAS process and remove WAS service 

TIP_HOME is your installation directory, where xxxxx is the port chosen during install (default is 16310): 
For Windows only: 
TIP_HOME\bin\WASService.exe -stop TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx 
TIP_HOME\bin\WASService.exe -remove TIPProfile_Port_xxxxx 
For UNIX/Linux: 
Stop the server 

2. Remove TIP_HOME 

3. Remove Deployment Engine 1.3.x 

* Note: Delete DE only if it is used by TCR and no other product is using DE *

It is imperative to remove any previous version of DE before deploying this release. To remove previous version of DE, proceed as follow. For non-root user, DE exists under "/home/user_home_directory/.acsi*. Follow the 3 steps below with the adjusted path to the files. (Assumes install drive is C:, adjust as needed)

* Unix: Source the DE environment: ". /var/ibm/common/acsi/setenv.sh" 
* Remove DE 1.3.x: "/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/si_inst.sh -r -f" 
* Remove Db backup: "rm -rf /usr/ibm/common/acsi" 
* Remove acsi var: "rm -rf /var/ibm/common/acsi" 

* Windows: Source the DE environment: "C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\setenv.cmd" 
* Remove DE 1.3: "C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi\bin\si_inst.bat -r -f"
* Remove Db backup: "rmdir /s C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi"

Note: If the si_inst.bat -r -f command fails or the removal of the C:\Program Files\IBM\Common\acsi fails, you may need to stop the IBM ADE service.
