APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You would like to install IBM SPSS Statistics 22 release
   directly followed by installation of FixPack 2 for this release
   on a Windows 64 bit computer.
   The pushed installation via MSI is done for authorized user
   license using AUTHCODE parameter.
   
   For example you run the two commands below from command prompt
   as administrator after you obtained the MSI file fore release 22
   and FixPack 2
   
   The installer files for both are:
   SPSS_Statistics_22_win64_.exe    (22 GA 64 bit Client for
   Windows release)
   22.0-IM-S22STATS-WIN64-FP002.exe (22 Fixpack 2, 64 bit Client
   for Windows release)
   
   The MSI files for push installation are:
   IBM SPSS Statistics 22.ms and
   SPSS_Statistics_22002_win64_Patch.ms
   
   You run below commands (example)
   
   MsiExec.exe /i "IBM SPSS Statistics 22.msi" /qn /norestart /L*V
   "logfile.txt" AUTHCODE="TO BE REPLACED with a valid authcode for
   release 22"
   
   MsiExec.exe /i "SPSS_Statistics_22002_win64_Patch.msi" /qn
   /norestart /L*V "SPSSStatistics22002PatchLog.txt"
   PYTHON_EXISTS="1"
   
   The installation went fine but after you launch the program (22
   FP2) you see only the menus file, custom and view and no
   toolbar.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This was reported to IBM SPSS development. As a workaround
   please locate a file spssprod.inf on the program installation
   path and open it in a text editor as administrator
   change the line
   daemonhost =
   to daemonhost = no-net while the program is closed
   After that save the file spssprod.inf with the same name and
   launch the program
   It will launch with all menus and will function normally
