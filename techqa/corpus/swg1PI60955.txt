APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You upgraded from IBM SPSS statistics release 19 to release
   version 24.
   In release version 19 you used to perform below steps:
   - Open release SPSS 19 without any file
   - Go to Variable View tab and create a new variable q1_1
   (numeric, 2 decimal digits),
   - Select the line on variable view, right click on q1_1 and
   select Copy
   - Select the empty row below q1_1, right click on the row and
   from context menu select Paste Variables.
   
   On the paste variables dialog set 5 as the number of new
   variables. As new variable names enter q1_ and 2 as decimal
   digits. Click OK.
    After you click OK in release 19 all is fine. You get 5 new
   variables on Variable View tab with names q1_2, q1_3. q1_4, q1_5
   and q1_6.
   
   - When you do the same in release 24.0 or 23 FP2 you cannot
   create the 5 new variables. Instead you get a warning with the
   message
   
   "Some names that end in an underscore are special variables in
   SPSS Statistics. It is inadvisable to end user variable names
   with this character."
   
   When you click OK on this dialog nothing happens.
   
   As this functionality was working in 19 it is reported to IBM
   SPSS development for review in release 24.
   It is true that variable names ending with an underscore are
   special variables in SPSS but on the example we do not want to
   create variables that ENDS with an underscore. Instead we want
   to create multiple variable names that begin with q1_ and then
   are numbered accordingly q1_2 to q1_6..
   The workaround is to insert the new variables with name q1_2 etc
   manually one  after another or use VECTOR command.
   e.g. VECTOR q1 (6).
