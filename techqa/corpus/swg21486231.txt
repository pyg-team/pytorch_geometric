Title: IBM Running AUTORECODE, RECODE and INSERT commands causes catastrophic error - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have a syntax file that runs fine in Statistics 18. Adding an extra procedure or two, such as AUTORECODE, RECODE and INSERT, it seems to result in catastrophic breakdowns. I have tried several different variations to try to identify what is causing the problem, but there seems to be little other than it just seems to be too much.

Adding the following block of code reliably results in the crash. Removing it reliably results in no crash, however it is only an example of the kind of modification that causes problems:


AUTORECODE VARIABLES=Department str_Level str_Region
/INTO division level region
/PRINT.

COMPUTE region = RV.NORMAL(0,1).
DESCRIPTIVES VARIABLES region.
RECODE region (LO THRU 0=1)(0 THRU HI=2).
VALUE LABELS region 1 'Region 1' 2 'Region2'.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES region.

INSERT FILE = 'compute_scales.inc'.

DATASET COPY NormalisedData.
DATASET ACTIVATE NormalisedData.


Dismissing the error code above brings up another error message: 'An unknown error has terminated communication with the processor. The PASW Statistics Processor is unavailable'. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Problem lies with a missing EXECUTE command because the file referenced in the INSERT command requires Transformations.

Normally, the INSERT command does not require an EXECUTE command to follow it. However, since the file being called by INSERT contains a COMPUTE command, transformations are now 'Pending' and when the syntax moves onto the next command (in this case 'DATASET COPY'), an exception error is produced by Statistics.

By editing the syntax to include 'EXECUTE .' after the INSERT command, no errors are returned and the whole syntax executed properly.

This problem has been reported to IBM SPSS Development and has been resolved in IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0. IBM SPSS would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused
