Title: IBM Changing the printer under File->Page Setup within SPSS 16 does not change the printer under File->Print - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I need to print some output from SPSS 16. I go to File->Page Setup to make my selections including clicking on the Printer button to choose a printer and add some selected properties. I make my selections and click OK to close out of the dialog. Then I go to File->Print and notice that the printer that I selected under File->Page Setup is not the printer that is chosen here. I then have to click the dropdown arrow box to re-select it. Wouldn't it be more convenient if the selections I made in Page Setup simply carried over to this dialog?

I also notice that within a Syntax window if I go to File->Print, there is no Properties button as there was in previous versions of SPSS. What is going on? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is working as designed. The Java Print dialog does not allow printer properties to be accessed easily across platforms. The decision was made to exclude this from the dialog for the time being. Access via Page Setup is not through SPSS. You are actually connecting using the OS/Printer connection that way. This is why nothing persists in SPSS. This also relates to why the Properties button no longer appears under File->Print from within the Syntax window.

For the meantime, if you need to change your default printer, you may do so within your operating system. If you need to modify the way your syntax is printed, copy/paste it into a word processing program such as Microsoft Word and print it from there
