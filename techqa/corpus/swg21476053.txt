Title: IBM Can I aggregate mode and also keep ties? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I need to do an aggregate but the function I am looking for is "mode," or the most frequent values in each group. I really need all values to show up as separate cases in the aggregated file if we have ties in most frequent categories. Mode is not an aggregate function. Can SPSS Statistics do this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here is a sample job that shows how this can be done. The key here is to aggregate the file and get the number of cases for each value within each group. We sort by group the count of cases and then create a filtering variable that we can select on.

data list free/ group score.
begin data
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 2
1 2
2 3
2 3
2 4
3 2
3 2
3 3
3 3
3 1
end data.
sort cases by group score.
aggregate outfile=*/break=group score/count=N.
sort cases by group (a) count (d).
if (lag(group) ne group or $casenum=1) test=1.
if (lag(test)=1 and count=lag(count) ) test=1.
select if (test=1).
execute
