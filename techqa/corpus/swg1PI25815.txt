APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  J2EENotConnected Monitors the connection between the ITCAM for
   J2EE data collector running in an application server and the
   ITCAM Agent for J2EE monitoring agent to ensure that the
   monitoring agent is connected and issues a
   Critical condition whenever it is not. Its formula is as
   follows:
   
   If
   Application_Server_Status.Status equals 0
   then
   the situation J2EENotConnected is true.
   
   My situation looks like this, I've tried both and neither one
   works.
   (  #'KYJAPSST.STATUS' != Running)
   (  #'KYJAPSST.STATUS' == Stopped)
   
   Status The status of the J2EE Application Server. The valid
   values are Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped, and Failed.
   
   When the status of a JVM is not = running it does not show up in
   the Application Server Status Query at all, so I'm not sure how
   it can be monitored.
   We also noticed the subnodes were cleared from TEP tree
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  modify kyjwb.properties in
   /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/yj/config directory.
   In the file, find the line with this property name:
    -Ditcam.tema.unconfigured.cleanupTimeout=3600
   and change it to:
    -Ditcam.tema.unconfigured.cleanupTimeout=604800
           (604800 is one week. so clean this up for one week only)
   .
   NOTE: the server will show unconfigured instead of stopped with
   this curcumvention. but the situation will be allowed to stop
   and start.
   none
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The subnode erroneously goes to UNCONFIGURED state after it is
   stopped. This happens because the logic to determine and process
   the unconfiguration file name was flawed in ITCAMfJ2EE V711.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Correct the logic so that the status changes to STOPPED when the
   server is stopped, and the status goes to UNCONFIGURED after the
   server is unconfigured. Note that the Data Collector
   unconfiguration process should terminate completely for staus to
   be changed to UNCONFIGURED.
