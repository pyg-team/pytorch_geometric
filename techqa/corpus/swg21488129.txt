Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error Message: Specified drivers could not be loaded due to system error 126

Installed 14.0.2 Modeler
Downloaded and installed Data Access Pack for 64 bit windows operating system SDAPWin64_6.0.3.exe.
Created an ODBC Teradata driver and tried the test connection.
Get above message when 'Test Connection' button is clicked

Also tried to add C:\Program Files\SPSSIncOEM\odbc64v60\Drivers to the Path Environment Variable. Still get the same issue. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available

Windows based SPSS OEM SDAP6 have a dependency on CLIv2 library files. This dependency is related specifically to the Teradata driver shipped with SPSS OEM SDAP6.
The version of CLIv2 library files is 13.00.00.07 or 13.00.00.05 and can be access from the TeraData.com website. 

Download the appropriate files from here: 

http://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/teradata-odbc-driver-13-0-for-windows-64-bit [http://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/teradata-odbc-driver-13-0-for-windows-64-bit]

Example: For windows these are the files:
cliv2_WINDOWS_x8664[1].13.00.00.07.ZIP (64 bit)
cliv2_WINDOWS_i386[1].13.00.00.07.ZIP (32 bit) 

You may need to use the 13.00.00.05.zip versions in the absence of 13.00.00.07,zip versions

Inside that are three programs that must be installed in this order:
1) TDICU 
2) TeraGSS
3) CLIv2
