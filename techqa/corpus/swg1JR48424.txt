ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files 7.5.0.3 with WESB 7.5.1.1 on
   AIX 6.1.  For the inbound scenario, the Flat File adapter EIS
   binding export failed to process zero length file.  The zero
   length file remains in the event directory and blocks other
   files.  Have to move this zero length file out of the event
   directory to allow other files to be processed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The FlatFile Adapter does not process the other files if there
   is any zero file length files present in the event directory.The
   files remains in the event directory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue is occuring because the BO content of the file is
   empty and it does not properly handled.So when splitting enabled
   the adapter throws an exception and stops polling.We have added
   a check and process for null empty files.
