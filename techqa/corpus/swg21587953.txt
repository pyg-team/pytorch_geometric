CAUSE
The server hostname was changed after another product was installed that used the Deployment Engine during its install. 

What this does is lay down all the Deployment Engine files with references to the old hostname. 

When you try to install another product that uses the Deployment Engine after a hostname change, not all the Deployment Engine files are updated correctly and the older hostname entries remain as a result.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, the older Deployment Engine files must be completely removed from the file structure in /var and /usr. 

To begin, remove the Deployment Engine files from /usr/ibm as described in the Technote below. 

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410973 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410973] 

 

Once this task is completed, you must then remove the /var/ibm folder. 

For the files in /var, it is recommended to make a backup of the /var/ibm folder 

before removing all the contents, just incase a roll back is required for any reason. 

 

Once all the files in /usr/ibm/ and /var/ibm have been removed, re-run the product installation.
