Title: IBM Automatic statistics collection runs even while UDI counter is less than 10% of the rows - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why automatic statistics collection (Automatic RUNSTATS) runs on the tables that have UDI counter less than 10% ? 

CAUSE
 The Automatic RUNSTATS will be checked if the UDI counter is greater than 10% of the rows on Db2 V8.2 or V9.1 as described in the following technical article "How often does automatic statistics collection process run", but Db2 realized the fixing the threshold to some percentage of the UDI counter can be a problem for very large tables and its Automatic RUNSTATS invocation requires a large amount of changed data. Then, Db2 improved so that the Automatic RUNSTATS can be tested on the large tables that have UDI counter less than 10%.

ANSWER
 The Automatic RUNSTATS checks whether UDI counter is greater than 10% of the rows. If yes, RUNSTATS is scheduled on the table. However, a 10% UDI change for large tables is a large amount of changed data. Therefore, a more stringent UDI ratio was introduced in Db2 V9.5 for large tables (more than 4000 pages). Therefore, RUNSTATS can be issued on the large tables with UDI counters of less than 10%.
