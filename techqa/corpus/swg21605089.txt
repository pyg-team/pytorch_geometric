PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to upgrade WebSphere Adapter for FlatFiles to version 7.5.0.1_IF06/AFC 7.5.0.1_IF05 result in an error. 

SYMPTOM
The following error message is seen: 

 
javax.resource.spi.ResourceAdapterInternalException: The IBM WebSphere Adapter for Flat Files has loaded file:/D: /IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/qesb/installedConnectors/CWYEM_EMail. rar/CWYBS_AdapterFoundation.jar! with version 7.5.0.1. However the base level of this jar required is 7.5.0.1_IF05. When you install multiple adapters with different CWYBS_AdapterFoundation.jar versions, the adapter returns the ResourceAdapterInternalException message due to a version conflict. To avoid this, you must migrate all adapters to the same version level. For further assistance, contact WebSphere Adapters Support for help.


CAUSE
The environment has other Adapters (JDBC and Email) installed that are in AFC conflict with the FlatFile Adapter. The JDBC and Email Adapters are at V7.5.0.1 with AFC 7.5.0.1. The AFC version 7.5.0.1 for the JDBC and Email Adapters is not compatible with the FlatFile Adapters AFC 7.5.0.1_IF05.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade all Adapters to the same AFC version to avoid this error. You can refer to the following dW Answers entry on how to verify the AFC version of your Adapter:
