ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In my ICO setup Horizon (administration UI) does
   not display network created by admin in tenant
   admin with router:external set to True. This
   prevents user to submit instances to the network,
   which is not accessible for him.
   It must be "visible" and is "visable" for the user
   to allow him/her to connect a router to allow
   external connections.
   .
   ICO UI behave in different way. It presents the
   network created by admin and in admin tenant
   when router:external set to True. It allows user
   to submit instances to the network. The request
   fails on OpenStack. It is a minor issue but very
   annoying. Customer can select the network for
   deployment and then is claiming that cloud does
   not work. Especially that in my installation it
   is first on list so it is selected by default
   and every time customer must select other network.
   .
   In my opinion ICO UI should work in the same way
   as Horizon.
