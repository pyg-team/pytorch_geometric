Title: IBM Unable to connect using network services: WebGUI or ssh after upgrading WebSphere DataPower firmware - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why can't I access the Web managment or ssh after upgrading firmware? 

CAUSE
This can occur if you are using a custom certificate or authentication for the management services and any of the associated certificates are expired. Expired certificates are removed at upgrade time.

ANSWER
The first step is to verify that the network is functioning correctly using these commands: 

show int 

show int mode 

show route 

 

Those commands will show if there is any network activity as well as the ethernet link speed. 

Once the network is confirmed, the quickest way to recover the web management and ssh services is to delete and recreate them with the default settings using the serial console. 

The following commands will reset the RBM's, ACL's, WebGUI and SSH services to the default settings. 

Note: If the ssh is working, you may omit any commands with the ssh. 

 

config 

web-mgmt 

no ssl 

exit 

write mem 

y 

no web-mgmt 

no ssh 

rbm 

reset 

exit 

acl web-mgmt 

reset 

exit 

acl ssh 

reset 

exit 

write mem (key step to remove the current settings) 

y 

web-mgmt <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is9090> 

ssh <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is22> 

write mem 

y 

 

Once complete, test the service and confirm you can now access the appliance. Then you may work to configure any custom certificates or authentication settings desired.
