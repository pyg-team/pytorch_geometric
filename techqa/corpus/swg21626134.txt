PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region is at MAXTASK (MXT) because many socket tasks are hung waiting for resource USERWAIT TCPIP. This occurs after upgrading to z/OS V1.13 from z/OS V1.11. You do have z/OS V1.13 PTF UA64875 applied. 

CAUSE
The EZACIC* TCP/IP socket modules are NOT all at the same release level of TCP/IP.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The USERWAIT TCP/IP is issued out of the TCP/IP module EZACIC01 TRU00000 UK56202.

The region was running with both z/OS V1.11 and V1.13 CICS sockets modules:


 * EZACIC01 and EZACIC21 were each at PTF level UK56202 which is R1B0. 
 * EZACIC03 was at R1D0 base as it should be. 
 * EZACIC02. the CICS socket listener module, was at UK57930 which is also at R1B0 level.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure all your TCP/IP CICS sockets modules (EZACIC*) are at the z/OS V1.13 level.
