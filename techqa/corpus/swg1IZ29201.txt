APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS RETURNED (APAR CANNOT BE RESOLVED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFO FROM IBM OR CUSTOMER.)
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem: The client has both local-response-redirect and
   login-redirect-page enabled.
   
   If the login page is displayed after the user accesses a
   challenged page, the user gets redirected to
   login-redirect-page after user changes
   password.
   
   If the user accesses an unchallenged login page (i.e., the login
   page is obtained from a site other than WebSEAL) and then
   changes password, user gets redirected to
   local-response-redirect-uri with TAM_OP=password_rep_sucess.
   
   Per APAR IY51074, the login-redirect directive should only
   redirect on login, not password changes.
   Steps to Duplicate: See above.
   
   Desired Behavior: User is redirected to the
   local-response-redirect-uri after password changes, not
   login-redirect-page.
   
   Environment: Access Manager 6.0 WebSEAL, no fixpacks
