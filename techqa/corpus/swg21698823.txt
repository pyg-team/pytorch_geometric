Title: IBM Standard rule select codelist fails - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Updating the Sterling Integrator CODELIST_XREF_ITEM table, then in separate map use the Select standard rule - it fails with Error Code 141 Standard Rule Select Data Missing. 

SYMPTOM
SQL map that updates the Sterling Integrator CODELIST_XREF_ITEM table.
Newly inserted entry can be viewed in the GUI - Trading Partner/ Code List.
The GUI refreshes the cache when the TP Code List table is accessed.



CAUSE
The cache is not updated when the Sterling Integrator tables are updated outside of the GUI. Updating the Sterling Integrator tables via an SQL map or stored procedure is not recommended.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 After the new value is inserted into the table via the JDBC map - it does not 

refresh the cache yet it is in the table and that is why a LWJDBC adapter run after the jdbc map can select the new value. Sterling Integrator does periodically throughout the day refresh the cache.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can run a command to refresh the cache or add it to a process or schedule it. 

The command that needs to be run at the root of SI is:
bin/opscmd.sh -nnode1 -cCLEARCACHE -pcache_name=ALL (this refreshes ALL)
Go to Operations/System/Troubleshooter and select Cache Usage to see the different cache names.
