Title: IBM SPSS Statistics and Apple OS X 10.9.5 and higher with Gatekeeper - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When Apple released OS X 10.9.5, they introduced a new version of Gatekeeper that uses "V2" signatures to determine application developer identity. This change made unsigned applications or applications signed with "V1" signatures to become unidentified to Gatekeeper. IBM SPSS Statistics has beem signed with V1 signatures. 

SYMPTOM
"SPSS_Statistics_Installer" can't be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed.


CAUSE
Gatekeeper settings

ENVIRONMENT
Mac Apple OS X 10.9.5 and higher

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When Apple released OS X 10.9.5, they introduced a new version of Gatekeeper that uses “V2” signatures to determine application developer identity. This change made unsigned applications or applications signed with “V1” signatures to become unidentified to Gatekeeper. IBM SPSS Statistics has been signed with V1 signatures. 


On an OS X 10.9.5 or later system (including OS X 10.10 Yosemite), with Gatekeeper set to the middle (default) setting “Allow apps downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers”, the IBM SPSS Statistics installer is blocked due to its V1 signature being rejected by Gatekeeper. Users see a message box similar to this:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21689885&amp;aid=1]

To work around Gatekeeper, do the following:

1. Context menu click (right mouse click) on the IBM SPSS Statistics installer application
2. Select “Open”

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21689885&amp;aid=2]

3. In the resulting dialog box, click Open and the IBM SPSS Statistics installer will run:


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21689885&amp;aid=3]


This is a one-time procedure – the installer will run normally via double clicking or opening the installer application.
