APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WCM import library task (import-wcm-data) needs to
   re-schedule any scheduled actions after a library import.
   However, the task runs the re-schedule for all libraries, not
   just those imported.
   This can cause the task to run excessively long if there are
   many large libraries.
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If there are no scheduled actions in the library, the refresh
   can be skipped all together by specifying the parameter
   -DskipScheduleActions=true when invoking the
   task. e.g. ./ConfigEngine.{sh|bat} -Dimport.directory={MY
   IMPORT
   DIR} -DskipScheduleActions=true
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The WCM import library task (import-wcm-data) needs to
   re-schedule any scheduled actions after a library import.
   However, the task runs the re-schedule for all libraries, not
   just those imported.
   This can cause the task to run excessively long if there are
   many large libraries.
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed wp.wcm.sr_cfg.xml to invoke the import-wcm-data task
   with this parameter:
   
   &lt;param name="skipScheduleActions" value="true" /&gt;
