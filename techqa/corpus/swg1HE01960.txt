   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   The NOA with Ditto when extracted to 2D does not
   keep its position coordinates same as that in the 3D.
   By-Pass:
   In 3D change the anchor point in properties/text
   to MiddleCenter and then extract the view to
   drafting. Now the position will match exactly
   .
   Development Request Justification:
   .
   A ditto NOA is in fact a text with a ditto. When
   it???s extracted in 2D, we create only a ditto.
   That???s why the anchor points aren???t the same for
   the 2 cases. The solution is to have the true
   ditto feature in FTA instead of a NOA composed of
   a text and a ditto. But that needs a lot of
   modifications in the model and UI.
