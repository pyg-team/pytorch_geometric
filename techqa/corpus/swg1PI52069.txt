APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are installing Statistics 23.0 and Statistics 23.0 FP2 for
   windows, using either the GUI or Silent/Push install methods.
   You note that when the intallers get to the part where they are
   installing or updating the Python Programmability Extensions,
   numerous cmd.exe and conhost.exe processes are created.  This
   has the effect of slowing the installation to a crawl and on
   some system and mimicking a 'hung' system.
