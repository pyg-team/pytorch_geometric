Title: IBM Using Oracle JDBC driver specific properties through a datasource - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Properties directly supported by the Oracle JDBC driver that are not part of the JDBC specification cannot be used as a Custom Property in a datasource. 

CAUSE
The Oracle JDBC driver has added support for a new Custom Property under connectionProperties..

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The method used with datasources is to set a Custom Property in the datasource as follows: 

Name: connectionProperties 
Value: propertyA=valueA;propertyB=valueB


For example, if you wish to set the property oracle.jdbc.V8Compatible=true, then you would specify the following. 
Name: connectionProperties 
Value: oracle.jdbc.V8Compatible=true
