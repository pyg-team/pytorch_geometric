ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Provided information/documents:
   Below is the sample APT application that configured with a task
   profile, GetOp, in iVScan task (Web Main job) and NavVscan task
   (Navigator Demo Job).
   https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/rest/download/86740%2C227%2C000/ [https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/rest/download/86740%2C227%2C000/]
   support_files/APT.zip
   Step to reproduce:
   1) Deploy the attached APT application appropriately.
   TMweb:
   1) Logon to TMWeb as admin/admin
   2) Run iVScan shortcut and select Web Main Job.
   3) Scan in some pages then upload===>Look at the batch, you
   would see the GetOp_rrs.log.  This means the GetOp task profile
   has been executed.
   Datacap Navigator:
   1) Logon to Datacap Navigator
   2) Run the NavVScan shortcut
   3) Scan in some page, then upload====> You don't see the
   GetOp_rrs.log. This means the GetOp task profile has NOT been
   executed.
   
   I think I know the reason for this.  In order for TMWeb to
   execute a task profile during VScan, we must add a property call
   "Run Rules on Start" and set it equals to 1.  I have done this
   for BOTH iVScan task (tmweb) and NavVScan task (Datacap
   Navigator).  Again, iVScan task would recognize this flag and
   executes the task profile.  However, Datacap Navigator does not.
   
   Examine ivscan.set.xml and navvsca.set.xml for more details on
   this parameter.
