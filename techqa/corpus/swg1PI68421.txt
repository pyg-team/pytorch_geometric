ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Following a particular setup, a non-system admin user is unable
   to create an environment using a blueprint and a resource
   template.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Create a "dev" team
   
   2. Create a "dev lead" role
   
   3. Add all permissions to that role except for all Server
   Configuration Permissions and the Settings Tab Web UI
   permission.
   
   4. Create a new user with only the new "dev lead" role on the
   "dev" team.
   
   5. Log in as the new user
   
   6. Create a new Resource Template
   
   7. Add a group to the resource folder in your Resource Template.
   Add a subgroup to that group.
   
   8. Add an agent prototype to the subgroup.
   
   9. Go to the Resources Tab and create a Top-Level Resource
   
   10. Go to the Applications tab and create an application.
   
   11. Create a Blueprint using your new Resource Template as its
   parent.
   
   12. Attempt to create an environment using the new Blueprint
   using the created Top-Level Resource as its base resource.
   
   When you attempt to create the new environment, you will receive
   an error saying "Alert: Cannot inherit the team on top level
   resource."
   
   Note: This does not occur in UCD 6.1.3. Not certain when this
   defect was introduced.
