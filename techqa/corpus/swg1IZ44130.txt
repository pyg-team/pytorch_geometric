   When TKLM generates asymmetric keys, the keysize is
   1024 bits.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  See Error Description
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  TKLM Server determines the keysize by reading the
   KLM_KEY_METADATA_DEFAULTS entry from the TKLM database.
   The solution is to change this entry in the TKLM database so
   that keys will be generated with keysize set to 2048 bits.
   When customer applies the fixpack, this entry in the
   database will be modified to reflect the increased key size.
