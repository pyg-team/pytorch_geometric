APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BPM operational flow topologies containing
   Import-Operation-to-Export links may unnecessarily hide the
   link and any related nodes. This can lead to disjointed
   topologies.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users viewing BPM topologies that contain
   * Import-Operation-To-Export links
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: IBM Business Process Manager projects
   * that make calls between different domains have a particular
   * type of link. These links were hidden in the SOA topology's
   * component view - along with any nodes related to them.
   *
   * The topology has been modified to not hide related nodes and
   * now to show the links as a dashed grey line.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply IFix 7 when available.
