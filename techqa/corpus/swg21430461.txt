Title: IBM JRules modules and database capacity planning - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to estimate the database capacity that should be allocated to the JRules modules Rule Team Server (RTS), Rule Execution Server (RES) and the Decision Validation Service (DVS) Decision Warehouse (DW) ? 

ANSWER
The attached utility allows to bootstrap a capacity planning effort for the database schemas that are used by the JRules modules ( RTS, RES and DW ). This utility takes as input a set of metrics used to automate the creation of an RTS project, the creation of baselines in RTS, the publication of ruleapps to RES, the creation of scenario suites in RTS and the DVS execution of the scenario suites along with capture of DW traces. 

Examples of the metrics that can be used to control the size of the generated project are: 

 * number of data classes and number of attributes per class : allows to control the overall size of the Business Object Model (BOM) 
 * number of data class instances received as input and output of the rule project : allows to control the amount of data received as input and returned as output by the ruleset, which has an impact on DW 
 * number of top level rule packages in the rule project : each top level package is populated with a action rules and decision table, a ruleflow is created that executes each top level package in sequence with one rule task per top level package 
 * number of action rules and decision tables per top level rule package 
 * number of conditions and actions for in the action rules 
 * number of condition and action columns along with size of each partition in decision tables 
 * number of baselines to create : with the creation of each baseline a configurable percentage of the rules are modified to simulate rule maintenance activities over time, a ruleapp is published to RES for each baseline 
 * number of scenario suites and number of scenario per suite



Instructions for JRules 7.0.x and 7.1.x: 
 1. Extract the jrules-dbsizing.zip zip file to a development machine where the JRules 7.0.x modules are installed 
 2. Edit the file jrules-dbsizing/build.xml to point the variable jrules.home to the base directory of your JRules product installation, for example C:/Program Files/IBM/WebsphereILOGJRules703 
 3. Edit the file jrules-dbsizing/configuration.properties to configure:  1.  URL and login/password to connect to JRules Teamserver 
     2. Name of the RES server configuration to use for RuleApp deployments and DVS scenario suite executions ( a matching name configuration should exist in RTS > Configure > Deployment > Manage Servers , note that depending on JRules version the default may be Sample or %Sample so it is recommended to recreate a new Server configuration in RTS if an error occurs in the utility such as "RES server configuration not found: Sample" ) 
     3. Adjust the metrics according to the expected complexity of the planned JRules project
    
    
 4. From a command line in the directory jrules-dbsizing execute: ant 
 5. Once the execution completes, the following side effects are expected:  1. A newly created project is present in RTS with baselines and scenario suites 
     2. For each baseline created, a RuleApp is deployed and available in RES 
     3. For each scenario suite created the Decision Warehouse contains traces for an execution
    
    
 6. Request from the database administrator to provide metrics on the database usage that results from running the tool ( the tool does not directly provide nor compute such usage information)

Instructions for ODM 7.5 and 8.x: 
 1. Extract the odm-dbsizing.zip file to a development machine where the ODM product is installed 
 2. Edit the file odm-dbsizing/build.xml to point the variable odm.home to the base directory of your ODM product installation, for example C:/IBM/ODM85/ODM 
 3. Edit the file odm-dbsizing/configuration.properties to configure:  1. URL and login/password to connect to ODM Decision Center 
     2. Name of the RES server configuration to use for RuleApp deployments and DVS scenario suite executions ( a matching name configuration should exist in Decision Center Enterprise > Configure > Deployment > Manage Servers , note that depending on ODM version the default may be Sample or %Sample so it is recommended to recreate a new Server configuration in Decision Center Enterprise if an error occurs in the utility such as "RES server configuration not found: Sample" ) 
     3. Adjust the metrics according to the expected complexity of the planned ODM project
    
    
 4. From a command line in the directory odm-dbsizing execute: ant run 
 5. Once the execution completes, the following side effects are expected:  1. A newly created project is present in Decision Center Enterprise with baselines and scenario suites 
     2. For each baseline created, a RuleApp is deployed and available in RES 
     3. For each scenario suite created the Decision Warehouse contains traces for an execution
    
    
 6. Request from the database administrator to provide metrics on the database usage that results from running the tool ( the tool does not directly provide nor compute such usage information)

Note: because of the side effects listed above this tool should not be used on a production environment.
