PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document shows sample usage and description of the parallelperiod MDX function. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
parallelPeriod

Syntax: parallelPeriod ( level , int_exp , member )

Description:

Returns a member from a different period in the same relative position as a specified member. This function is similar to the "Cousin" function, but is more closely related to time series. It takes the ancestor of "member" at "level" (call it "ancestor"); then it takes the sibling of "ancestor" that is offset (follows) by "int exp" positions, and returns the descendants of that sibling in the same relative position as the specified member as under "ancestor".

Example:

Note, the following examples are done with the sample "great_outdoors_company" package.

parallelPeriod([great_outdoors_company].[Years].[Years].[Quarter],-1,[2006/Au g] )
result: 2006/Nov

parallelPeriod([great_outdoors_company].[Years].[Years].[Quarter],+1,[2006/Au g] )
result: 2006/May

parallelPeriod([great_outdoors_company].[Years].[Years].[Year],+2,[2006/Aug] )
result: 2004/Aug
