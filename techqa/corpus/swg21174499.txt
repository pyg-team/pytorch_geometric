PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 To enable event notification in OneWorld, custom business components must be created. The Related URL section provides links to documents that provide step by step instructions for creating and deploying event custom business components. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These components are required by the adapter for polling from the application. IBM® also provides some sample EXE and C source files for event creation. Sample files are shipped with the adapter. If you decide to use the samples, work with your JDE specialist to customize the sample EXE files to suit your JDE implementation.
