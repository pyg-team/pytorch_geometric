Title: IBM Implement custom checking for Rule Team Server ruleset generation - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to implement a custom checker in WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server?
How to catch during ruleset extraction a runtime warning such as: Parsing Ruleset /ruleapp/1.0/rules/1.0 WARNING: Compilation warning in task ruleproject#rule_task_a: unknown rule "package_A.rule_A" ? 

CAUSE
It is sometimes useful to implement additional checking on a ruleset archive during extraction so as to catch early certain types of issues before the ruleset is deployed to an execution environment.
Example Scenario:
During rule flow design, it is permitted for a rule task to select individual rules instead of a rule package. For instance, rule_task_a can select package_A.rule_A instead of package_A.*

This may cause problem later during execution if the rule is filtered out by an extractor. In Rule Team Server v7.x, rule extractor is a popular tool used for ruleset generation. If package_A.rule_A referred by rule_task_a is excluded by the extractor, the ruleset generation will continue without this rule, deployment to Rule Execution Server is fine, but during parsing at runtime, a warning may be thrown:

Parsing Ruleset /ruleapp/1.0/rules/1.0 WARNING: Compilation warning in task ruleproject#rule_task_a: unknown rule "package_A.rule_A"

A customized rule checker allows to detect this kind of scenario during ruleset generation, and display an error message about missing rules in rule tasks to avoid a warning during runtime later on.


ANSWER
The solution includes: 

 * Create and compile a custom Rule Team Server Session Controller that overrides the method onCheckRulesetArchive() 
 * Repackage teamserver ear/war file 
 * Redeploy teamserver ear/war file and configure Rule Team Server to use the Session Controller 
 * Make sure ruleset checking is enabled (default) in Project > Edit Project Options > Check the ruleset archive 


A sample java project for this implementation on JRule sample WASCE server is available for reference.
