QUESTION
 How do I configure an existing Workplace XT instance to point to a different Content Engine server than what it is currently connecting to? 

CAUSE
An administrator wants to re-configure Workplace XT to point to a different CE server. An example is, changing an existing Workplace XT deployment to point to a Development CE server instead of pointing to a Production CE server or vice versa.

ANSWER
Follow the steps below to 're-bootstrap' Workplace XT to a different CE server: 

 1. Edit the three RemoteServer URLs in the WcmApiConfig.properties file in 
    the installed Workplace XT location 
    (.../FileNet/WebClient/WorkplaceXT/WEB-INF) to point to the other CE 
    server, 
 2. Rebuild the Workplace XT war/ear files using the batch files in the 
    WebClient/deploy directory.  * For detailed instructions on recreating the war and ear, or redeploying the application to the web application server, see Related Information below.
    
    
 3. Blank out the value for "objectStoreId" in the bootstrap.properties file 
    in the .../FileNet/Config/WebClient directory. 
 4. Redeploy the updated war or ear file for Workplace XT.



When accessing the application there will be a prompt to bootstrap 
Workplace XT to the desired object store where it will then store user 
and site preferences.
