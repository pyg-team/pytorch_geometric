RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. If you are doing the install on Linux that does not have a display 
connected to it then: 






- Install the X Windows subsystem on the Linux server and 


- Forward X when you run the fixpack update and confirm by forwarding xcalc.
You can then launch an xterm from the Linux server to your Windows 
server. 


If you don't have X11 installed on your system, you need 

- libaio 

- libXp, 

- libXft 

and 

- libXtst. 


Example: 

yum install libXtst 


2. Also install all linux libraries are installed.
