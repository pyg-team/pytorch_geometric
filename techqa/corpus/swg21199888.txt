PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Configuring a WebSphere Test Environment version 5.x server using the Administrative Console with LDAP or LTPA global security fails to function correctly. This failed in WebSphere Studio v5.x and Rational Developer v6.x. 

CAUSE
Usage of the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Administrative Console, non-Local OS global security or any of the WAS command-line tools such as wsadmin are not supported with the v5.x WebSphere Test Environment (WTE) servers. 

ENVIRONMENT
RedHat Enterprise Linux WS
SUSE Enterprise Server
Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server
Windows 2000 Professional
Windows 2000 Server
Windows Server 2003
Windows XP

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
These server configuration and usage scenarios are not supported. The product documentation does not state they are supported. Server support summary for the v5.x WTE(s) of WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD) v5.x and Rational Application Developer (RAD) v6.x/v7.0:


 * The WTEs are a subset of full WAS servers for local testing, not intended (or licensed) for stand-alone use. 
 * The WAS command-line tools in the WTEs are not intended for development use. 
 * The WAS Administrative Console packaged as part of the WTE v5.x servers is not supported, and hence activities like setting up LDAP are also not supported. Only local OS security is supported in the WTE v5.x environment. 
 * Although setting Java2 security in the administrative console is not supported, it can be set in the v5.x WTE Server Configuration editor. This setting is known to bring down the v5.x WTE servers as a result of a JDK crash (APAR PK02119) in some circumstances. When running applications on the v5.x WTE, Enterprise modules (EJB JAR, WAR, etc) and Java utility project directories are not under the EAR directory as required by Java2 security since it relies on the file system.
   
   Note: In Rational Application Developer v6/v7 if you deploy an EAR to a v6.0+ WTE with Java2 security enabled and Run server with resources on the Server enabled in the Server Overview editor then it should work. Refer to the Limitation on Java™ 2 security application policy on WSAS item in the Related information section.
   
   

Alternatives 

The v5.x WebSphere Test Environment is a local test environment. It was never intended to be treated as a fully fledged WebSphere Application Server. An alternative to this limitation, is to make use of a remote server to provide complete WAS v5.x functionality. Information on how to use the remote deployment functionality in WSAD v5.x is documented in the product Help. 
 * Note - Remote WTE/WAS v5.x servers:
 * 
 * 
 * remote
 * 
 * 
 * Remote WebSphere Application Server version 5.x configuration with WebSphere Test Environment version 5.x 
 * 


The following unsupported article, see Related information section, covers how multiple developers can make use of a remote WebSphere Application Server with WebSphere Studio: 

Setting up a Remote Test Server for Multiple Developers 

The product documentation does not promote setting up LDAP security or using the Administrative Console. Some customers have been successful with the LDAP scenario presented in the unsupported article: 

Using LDAP to Secure J2EE Applications in WebSphere Studio Application Developer V5 

Both articles should be readily adaptable to the legacy v5.x WTE in Rational Application Developer v6.0 or v7.0. The authors should be contacted for further information or feedback on the contents of these articles. 

To configure Local OS security for WTE v5.x in a Windows environment consult Related information item: Enabling Local OS security for the WebSphere Test Environment v5.x in a Windows or Linux Environment. 


WebSphere Test Environment v5.x Background 

The v5.x WebSphere Test Environment servers inside Studio or Rational Ap0plication Developer are modified to be used as a test environment to quickly test applications. It is integrated with the Studio and Developer edit/compile/run/debug environments. The development environment takes over and modifies the WSAS v5.x configuration files such that any WAR/EJB/EAR projects do not need to be exported and individually installed on the WTE v5.x servers. The WTE v5.x server configurations files are modified to point directly to the project locations in your workspace. 


WTE v5.x Con clus ion 

The purpose of the v5.x WTE is to provide a rapid edit/compile/run/debug of WebSphere server applications in Application Developer.It is specifically licensed for development use only (with WebSphere Studio or Rational Application Developer) and not for use as a stand-alone WebSphere server(s). The stand-alone server features may function correctly most of the time in the WTE, but are not officially supported. 


Rational Application Developer v6.x with WTE v6.x 

In the Rational Application Developer v6/v7 WTE/WAS v6.x server: the Administrative Console, LDAP security and command lines tools are supported only when using the WAS v6.x run-time. The WebSphere Application Server Administrative Console replaces the WTE server configuration editor for administering the v6 and v7 servers. Rational Application Developer v7.5 introduced support for WAS v7.0. WTE v5.1 is no longer supported as of Rational Application Developer v7.5.
