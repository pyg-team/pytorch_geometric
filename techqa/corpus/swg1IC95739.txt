APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is possible to import an invalid WSDL in a Web Service Proxy
   that contains two address tags for a single port. No error is
   reported, however, SOAP requests fail and the operation does
   not show up in the "Web Services Operations" menu.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove all secondary address tags from the WSDL so that
   exactly one address tag remains per port.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is the use of WSDLs in DataPower, e.g. in a Web Service
   Proxy.
   
   WSDL spec http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#_soap:address requires
   "A port using the SOAP binding MUST specify exactly one
   address.". DataPower did only complain on a missing address.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.11 and 6.0.0.3.
   
   Existing error message
   Missing {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/}address in
   wsdl:port
   will be used in case of more than one address, too.
   
   New error message
   Missing or more than one
   {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/}address in wsdl:port
   will be available in a next major release.
