APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Steps to replicate the behavior:
   ========================
   1> Select any Module which has Objects in it and open this
   Module in Read Only Mode. (As any user including Administrator)
   2> Insert a new Column in the Module, say Object Heading or
   Object Text.
   3> Double click on any of the Object's such the cursor starts
   blinking in the newly added Column of step 2
   4> Click on Edit -- Edit Mode -- try changing the Mode to either
   Exclusive Edit or Shareable Edit.
   
   Expected Result:
   =============
   Upon selecting the required Edit Mode, the Module's editing mode
   should be changed.
   
   Current Behavior:
   =============
   Instead of the Edit Mode being changed, the Module continues to
   remain in Read Only Mode.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  You can either click away from that Object or double click on
   the Object's Main Column.
   This will allow the Module's edit mode to be changed as
   required.
