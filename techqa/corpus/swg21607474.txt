QUESTION
 The ITCAM docs incorrectly reference a non-existent file when uninstalling the YN agent. 

ANSWER
The ITCAM docs (see below) wrongly indicate how to uninstall the ITCAM YN agent. The docs indicate to use this file: $DC_HOME//installer/_uninst/uninstaller.exe to remove the ITCAM for AD 
7.1 program. However, the _uninst dir does not exist in ITCAM for AD 7.1 on Windows.

Here is where its documented in the docs:

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/index.jsp] 
- Composite Application Manager for Application Diagnostics 
- Agent for J2EE Data Collector Installation and Configuration Guide 
- Uninstalling and unconfiguring ITCAM for J2EE Data Collector 
- Uninstalling the Data Collector
- Step 1: Launch the InstallShield Wizard 
- (on the right panel) you see the first line under Step 1 to run the uninstaller.exe file to uninstall. This does not exist on a Windows environment.

This is corrected in the next documentation review cycle. The correct way to uninstall the YN agent is to use the standard Windows Add/Remove programs from the Control Panel.
