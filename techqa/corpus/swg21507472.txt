QUESTION
 What is the software catalog update/fix implementation timeline while troubleshooting cases of not detected software? 

ANSWER
While troubleshooting ILMT software catalog issues concerning software not detected by ILMT agent, you need to take under consideration some time limitations and processes. 

1) After you import the newest software catalog/fix to the server you need to wait 24 hours until it generates the software catalog version for the agents. To force/speed up this process you may restart ILMT server.

2) Agents should download the newest data from ILMT server within 6 hours. To force/speed up this process you may stop the agent, delete the '/scanner' and '/cache' folders from the agent's location and restart the agent. It will download the latest information from the server.

3) Then you can wait for the scan upload/scheduled scan or force it by running the 'tlmagent -sw' command. This command ensures that the scan data will be sent to the server just after the scan triggered.

4) In 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 versions changes in the 'Software Products' tab are visible after 6 hours and changes in the 'Current capacity' panel are visible after 2 days. In 7.5 version changes in the 'Manage Software Inventory' panel are visible after 6 hours..
