Title: IBM Support notice for Java Runtime Environment (JRE) versions supported in IBM FileNet P8 client products - United States

Text:
 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6.0_17 and later versions introduced tighter security for applets. 

CONTENT
The increased security results in a "Warning - Security" pop-up alert. By selecting No when prompted to block the applets, users can proceed. The applet loads and works correctly. 

For information about the security enhancement, refer to the information Oracle has posted:

JRE 1.6.0_14 is the currently supported version, as stated in the IBM FileNet P8 Hardware and Software guide.

In order to bring IBM FileNet P8 in line with the enhanced JRE security, all relevant Java jars must be available in a trusted configuration. This includes all IBM FileNet P8 applets provided by Application Engine, Workplace XT, and Process Engine and Content Engine. 

The following IBM FileNet P8 product fix packs are the minimum required to fully resolve the issue for JRE version 1.6.0_25. Support for JRE versions later than 1.6.0_25 will be documented in future releases of the P8 Hardware and Software guide. IBM has not performed complete testing on JRE 1.6.0_15 through _24. Ttherefore, those versions are not supported. 

If using P8 5.0 or 5.1, at a minimum, you must have Content Engine 5.0 or 5.1 and Process Engine 5.0.0-001 installed, and the respective Content Engine and Process Engine client installers run on the Application Engine 4.0.2.12 or higher, or Workplace XT 1.1.4.12 or higher. 

The following must all be installed and the client files applied to Application Engine and Workplace XT: 

 * Content Engine 5.0.0.0, Content Engine 5.1.0.0, or Content Engine 4.5.1.5 and higher 
 * Process Engine 5.0.0.1 or Process Engine 4.5.1.3 and higher 
 * Application Engine 4.0.2.12 
 * Workplace XT 1.1.4.12


Workplace XT 1.1.5.0 also provides JRE version 1.6.0_25 support with the following known issues:  * Annotations in the Image Viewer: Adding and modifying annotations in the Image Viewer will result in a security warning. 
 * The Process Engine Process Simulation Designer: When using Process Simulation Designer, saving a scenario will fail. To resolve this issue, add application-utils to the appletParameters.properties file in the WEB-INF directory under the install location:
   
   pe/trusted=pe, pe3pt, javaapi, Jace, applets, psclient, applets-i18n, peResources, application-utils
