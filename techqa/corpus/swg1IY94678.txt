   Customer suggested the removal of information about  Remedy 5
   support from guide.
   
   However, as confirmed by L3 development, the document contains
   the correct information, and are thus rejecting this APAR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  I am closing this APAR as the guide does correctly state the
   version of Remedy supported.
