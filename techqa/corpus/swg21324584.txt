QUESTION
 Is there a limit on the number of baselines that can be created in DOORS? 

ANSWER
No, there is no limit on the number of baselines that may be created. As each baseline results in the creation of additional database files, the only limit will be on the size of the database which is constrained by the disk space available. If a database is very large, then performance issues may occur. For tips on improving performance, see the Related URL below: Tips for improving DOORS performance.
