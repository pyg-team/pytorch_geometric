APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abend906-08 in TCPIP R310 for USS table module linked RENT
   REUS because it is not being deleted.  Also seen are messages:
   CSV002I requests for MODULE xxxxxxxx exceed maximum use count
   (where xxxxxxxx is the name of the USSMSG10 module)
   and CSV028I ABEND906-08
      This only occurs with LUSESSIONPEND specified for TELNET
   users. It occurs no matter what method they use to exit TELNET.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Turn off LUSESSIONPEND for TELNET
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Telnet users with LUSESSIONPEND.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The USS Table use count is not getting  *
   *                      decremented during the termination      *
   *                      process of a Telnet connection. This    *
   *                      will eventually cause an ABEND906-08    *
   *                      in TCP/IP because the table is never    *
   *                      deleted.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The USS Table (USSTAB) delete use count is never decremented,
   causing MVS to exceed the maxium use count. The USS Table
   delete function in MVPVTWK was receiving control to delete
   the table during the termination of each Telnet connection.
   However, since the USS table was loaded by another task the
   Delete function was ignored.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modules MVPVTWK (EZACA03S) and MVPDG7C (EZACA01D) was changed
   to resolve the problem of decrementing the table Delete USE
   Count. The USS Table delete code was removed from MVPVTWK and
   added to MVPDG7C.
