 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Apache Tomcat vulnerability affects IBM Storwize V7000 Unified. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
This bulletin relates to vulnerabilities in the Apache Tomcat component which is used to provide the productâ€™s management GUI. The CLI interface is unaffected.
CVEID: CVE-2016-6816 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119158] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-6817 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6817]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 header, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119156 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119156] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-8735 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error in the JmxRemoteLifecycleListener. By sending specially crafted data to a JMX port, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119157 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119157] for the current score
