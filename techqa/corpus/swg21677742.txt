QUESTION
 How do you work with user defined helper applications (custom programs like plugin) on actively managed IBM Rational Rhapsody model? 

CAUSE
The tool provides the capability to allow user creating domain from model profile but there is no information mentioned regarding how to share helper applications in actively managed model. 

ANSWER
You can use Rhapsody controlled file to deliver helper related files to Rhapsody Design Manager Server along with the process you creating user domain from local profile. 

STEPS TO ACHIEVE ABOVE:


 1. Add Controlled File elements under model profile.
    
    
 2. Associate each Controlled File element with an individual file of your helper application like .hep, .class or .jar file.
    
    
 3. Create domain from your profile [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Wecb8ab5c4be5_4a1e_a0d0_e5a706eb66dc/page/Design+Manager+Create+Domain] to save the helper in Design Manager along with domain creation.
    
    
 4. Associate the newly created domain with your current RDM project area.
    
    
 5. Create a model on server side with previously created domain or add the domain into an existed active model.
    
    
 6. The tool would download the helper application to local folder which by default is under %TEMP%\DesignManager\Models\[modelname]\[modelname]_rpy\ .
    


NOTE: Rhapsody Controlled File element doesn't support directory structure. 
WORKAROUND:


You can load helper application from local file system.


 * 
 * When Rhapsody DM rich client loading helper which is defined in any system domains like SysMl profile, the tool actually reading the information from client environment other than from server.
   


STEPS TO ACHIEVE THE SAME MECHANISM IN USER PROFILE:

 1. Create domain from your profile [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Wecb8ab5c4be5_4a1e_a0d0_e5a706eb66dc/page/Design+Manager+Create+Domain] and name it "MyPluginProfile" for example. 
    
    NOTE: You are not required to add helper info in the profile via controlled file elements
    
    
 2. Upload the created profile from context menu > Design Manager > Create Domain from Profile. 
    
    
 3. Move your profile with helper info under Rhapsody installed directory \Share\Profile\ and you should include MyPlginProfile.hep, MyPluginProfile.sbs, MyPluginProfile.txt, MyPlugin related class file or jar files into \Share\Profiles\MyPluginProfile\ folder. 
    
    NOTE: This step 3 should be carried out for each DM client environment.
    
    
 4. Also copy the whole folder of MyPluginProfile from client environment to server side directory JazzTeamServer\RhapsodyModelServer\Share\Profiles\.
    
    
 5. Create a model on server side with previously created domain or add the domain into an existed active model. The corresponding plugin would be directly loaded from client environment.
