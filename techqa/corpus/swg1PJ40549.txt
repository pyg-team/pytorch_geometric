APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enumerations of GCD objects that span the page size and whose
   result set is a subset of the entire set of objects doesn't
   return the expected results.  For example, the ObjectStores
   enumeration off the Domain worked fine (because the result set
   is the entire set), but the VirtualServers enumeration didn't
   work correctly off a Site if there were a) more VirtualServers
   on that Site than the page size and b) other VirtualServers
   assigned to other Site objects.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers using Content Engine 5.0.1.2-P8CE-FP002 and prior  *
   * retrieving GCD collections in which the sub-set of collected *
   * objects exceeds the retrieval's page size.                   *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The retrieval of GCD object collections (enumerations) will  *
   * not function correctly when the set of enumerated objects is *
   * a sub-set of the overall collection.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.0.1.3-P8CE-FP003 or higher.                     *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  5.0.1.3-P8CE-FP003 and higher will resolve this GCD collections
   retrieval problem.
