ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a user attempts to connect to the database and if there
   is a failure, there may be a memory leak in DBHEAP.
   
   For example, user with no connect privilege when attempting to
   connect fails with -1060. Connect initiates some monitor control
   blocks which does not get cleaned up when the connect fails and
   may cause a leak in dbheap
