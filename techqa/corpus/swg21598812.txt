 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When installing from the DVD on Windows, the installer fails to complete the Custom Install. 

SYMPTOM
The following error might show with the Custom Install on a Windows machine (seen on a 64 bits): 


Error occurs during the install
CRIMC1029E: Failed to add the plugin org.eclipse.datatools.enablement.sap.maxdb.dbdefinition.nl1_1.0.0.v201102241419 to the repository C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer-Shared. 
CRIMC1085E: The download retry failed for C:\temp\jrules\DVD2\WDS\plugins\org.eclipse.datatools.enablement.sap.maxdb.dbdefinition.nl1_1.0.0.v201102241419.jar

Alternatively, MD5 checksum errors have been seen in a similar scenario.


CAUSE
The file corruption that is being seen here is due to the WinZip tool used to untar the file as it converts UNIX or Linux formatted files into Windows Format.

As a result, the text files in the WebSphere Operational Decision Management TAR file may be modified during the extraction and are found to have an incorrect MD5 checksum and/or incorrect carriage returns.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Steps to resolve the issue using WinZip:

1. Open WinZip.
2. Click Options > Configuration, and click the Miscellaneous tab.
3. Clear the TAR file smart CR/LF conversion check box.
4. Extract the TAR file.

For more information about using WinZip, see the item about TAR file smart CR/LF conversion in the WinZip Knowledge Base at http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm [http://kb.winzip.com/help/help_config_misc.htm].

Alternatively, you can extract the installation TAR file by using a different product, such as 7-Zip.
