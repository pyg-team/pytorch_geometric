Customer Service & Support:
The primary goal of the SAN Volume Controller Software Customer Service & Support process is to offer superior support and service levels to customers through regular transitions from current versions or releases of SAN Volume Controller Software products to new deliveries of those products. These deliveries come in the form of new SAN Volume Controller Software versions/releases. The SAN Volume Controller Software products adhere to the IBM Software Support Life Cycle Policy (see below) for International Program License Agreement (IPLA) products. 

Product Delivery Definitions: 
Product deliveries are categorized according to a Version.Release.Modification (V.R.M) format. A new product "Version" typically would indicate that the designated delivery would have significant new code, features or functions. A new product "Release" may indicate a new update of the same product Version, and may typically include changes to existing functions and features, or may include new minor product features. These new features would customarily be smaller in scope than those provided in a new "Version" product delivery. 

A new product delivery "Modification" would typically consist of minor upgrades to some of the current product functions and features. A Modification may consist of defect fixes, with no new function additions. 

Upgrades
SAN Volume Controller Software intends to provide appropriate methodology for software transition (e.g., migration or upgrade paths) to the new product deliveries from all currently supported product deliveries. The objective is for customers to be able to concurrently upgrade from their current code level to the most recent code level in one step. However, it might be necessary for the customer to upgrade to an intermediate code level and then upgrade to the most recent code level, depending on the original level of SAN Volume Controller Software from which they are starting. 

Maintenance
The SAN Volume Controller Software customer support objectives are to fix reported defects in the most current level of the product, and in prior supported levels where feasible. Fixes for less severe defects may be deferred to the next product release if it is not feasible to fix them in the current level of code. While the SAN Volume Controller Software Support team will evaluate all problems and issues on currently supported software (i.e., offer Level 2 support) the customer may be required to install the most current maintenance level to receive defect fix support. 

If a supported SAN Volume Controller Software V.R.M is running with operating systems, storage controllers, or other SAN fabric elements that are no longer generally supported, SAN Volume Controller Software Support may be limited to defects that can be duplicated on fully supported configuration environments. 

Support Matrix
Voice support is available for the following products by calling your country support phone number [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=591&uid=ssg1S1003141]. When an "End of Service" date has been announced for a product release, it will be updated here and in the Software Support Lifecycle page www.ibm.com/software/support/systemsstorage/lifecycle/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/systemsstorage/lifecycle/] for Storage Software.
