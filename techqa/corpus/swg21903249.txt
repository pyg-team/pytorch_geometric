 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Version 6 that is used by IBM PureApplication System. This also includes a fix for the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) SSLv3 vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). These were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2014. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6457 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6457]

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148] for the current score

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.2.1.3 
IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.3.1.0 
IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.3.2.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to apply the following IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool version fixes.

Upgrade the IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool to the following fix levels or higher:

 ForIBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.2.1.3 

 * 


 For IBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.3.1.0  * 


 ForIBM Image Construction and Composition Tool v2.3.2.0  * 



IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
