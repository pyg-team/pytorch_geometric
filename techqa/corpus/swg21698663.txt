PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The tipcli export command in Tivoli Integrated Portal fails with the following error in the command output:

"Error loading: <TIP home>\java\jre\bin\msvcr71.dll" 

CAUSE
The <TIP Home>/java/jre contents has become corrupted, possibly by an attempt to apply a java update package that does not match the bit-ness (32bit vs 64bit) of the existing java install.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Run the following command:
<TIP home>/java/jre/bin/java -version
Replace "<TIP home>" with the actual path for the TIP install.



If the same error is reported, the jre contents is likely corrupted.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy the contents of: 
<TIP home>\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\java\jre 

To: 
<TIP Home>\java\jre 

Retry the "<TIP home>\java\jre\bin\java -version" command and verify it works. If so, retry the tipcli export.

Note: If the "WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7" directory doesn't exist, the jre can be obtained from a TIP fix pack installation package under:
<Fixpack unpack location>/cdimage.fixpack/COI/PackageSteps/WebSphereUPDI/FILES/7.0.0.XX-WS-UPDI-<platform>/JDK/jre.pak/repository/package.java.jre/java/jre
