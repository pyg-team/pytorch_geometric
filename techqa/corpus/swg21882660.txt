Check if the sendmail service are started : "service sendmail status", this problem occurred when the service is stopped.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the sendmail service are not started, run "service sendmail start" ; the sendmail service will then start processing the mail queue and reduce the file-system space usage. 


Having the service started can also prevent the issues from re-occurring , because the unsent message will no longer going into the spool files.
