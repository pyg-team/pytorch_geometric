APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows Remote Deploy only.
   
   Problem Description:
     Code checks for HOME\InstallITM\plugin directory but does not
   verify that the *.jar and *.properties files exist. This causes
   plugins to  fail and anything they do will not be done. For
   example resolve agent specific variables.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
     1. Use tacmd createnode to deploy the NT agent.
     2. Use tacmd addagent to deploy the YN agent to the same
   machine.
        Plugins are not run and the ITM_HOME variable in the yn
        configuration files are not  updated.
     3. The error does not occur if the agents are installed
   locally in GUI mode
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Remove ITM then install the NT agent in GUI mode using the
   full Agent image, then deploy the failing agent to the target
   machine.
   
   2. Copy the files in the CDImage WINDOWS\InstallITM\plugin
   directory *.jar and *.properties to the HOME\InstallITM\plugin
   directory then redeploy the failing agent.
   
   NOTE: The failing agent may have to be uninstalled on the target
   machine before it is deployed, if it does not resolve the
   unresolved variables.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Remote Deploy to a Windows target machine may fail or be
   incomplete.
   
   
   Remote Deploy to a Windows target machine where
   HOME\InstallITM\plugin directory exists but the plugin driver
   files are missing may fail or be incomplete.  The missing jar
   files cause the plugin code to fail so the action to be
   performed by the plugin is not executed.  This may cause agents
   to fail when started or their configuration may be incompletely.
   Agents do not report data to their Tivoli Enterprise Management
   Server (TEMS).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed code to check for files as well as the directory and
   copy the files if they are missing.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Install the agent locally using the GUI.
