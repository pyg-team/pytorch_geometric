CAUSE
Both of the following are true: 

 * The customer has implemented Cognos 8 (= non-native) security 
 * The user running this ad-hoc report is not a member of the Cognos 8 security role 'Controller Administrators'

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Ensure that the relevant user(s) are members of both "Controller Administrators" and "Controller Users" security groups, inside Cognos Connection. 

 

Steps

1. Launch Cognos Connection website 

 * TIP: By default, this is http://<servername>/ibmcognos [http://servername/ibmcognos]


2. If prompted, click ' Administer IBM Cognos content', and open the section ' Security': 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=1] 

3. Open the namespace 'Cognos' 
4. Locate the Cognos Controller user groups: 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=2] 
 * Locate the group "Controller Administrators" 
 * Click 'More...' 
 * Click 'Set Members' 
 * Add the relevant Windows AD users (the people who get this error) for example:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21371052&aid=3] 5. Test.
