ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  **********************************************
   **********************************************
   Title: Reconciliation with a filter by AD adapter registers
   duplicated account entry in ITIM server
   
   Problem Description:
   User directly changed an attribute of AD account on AD/Windows
   after performing full reconciliation.
   Then he tried to reconciliate the changed AD account using the
   changed attribute value for filter.
   He expected that the account data gets replaced with the new
   data on TIM server, but the recon created one more extra AD
   account that is having the same name.
   The original AD account entry still has the old data for the
   attribute, and the AD account newly added by the recon has the
   new data.
   
   Can Customer Recreate: Yes, and Japan L2 duplicated.
   
   ITIM Server Version - 4.6 with FP61 + IF 62 (Latest as of today)
   Agent Version - AD Adapter V4.6.20          (Latest as of today)
   
   Agent Environment
   Operating System : Windows 2003
   
   Desired Behavior:
   Recon should not create extra duplicated account.
   
   Steps to Duplicate:
   1) Create a role
   2) Create a service for AD
   3) Create a provisioning policy
      - Set the role and the service
   4) Create a person, then set the role so that he will have AD
      account.
   5) Set "XXX" to Title attribute of his AD account on ITIM GUI.
   6) Change Title attribute to "YYY" on AD.
   7) Recon the changed AD account using (Title=YYY) filter.
   8) Search AD account using the account name.
      Two AD accounts will be listed.
      - One is the original account that is tied to the person. The
        changed attribute still has the original data - "XXX" in
        this case.
      - The other is account registered by the recon, and it
        doesn't tied to the person. The changed attribute has the
        new data - "YYY" in this case.

COMMENTS
 *  This is being closed as a USER ERROR.
   L3 investigated this issue and found that the problem as
   described is a USER ERROR and ITIM is working correctly.
   Basically, when you make modifications to any of the attributes
   including "ou" "logonprofile", and "title"outside of ITIM, the
   results will be unpredictable.
   The scenario described is where the customer is using filtered
   reconciliations to partition the account data for a resource
   (based on the "title" attribute value in this case). Plus the
   customer is then manually changing the "title" attribute value
   for one or more accounts outside of ITIM, so that the account is
   moved into a different filtered subset than it was in the last
   time ITIM reconciled it.
   Consequently, the next time an ITIM reconciliation is run, the
   account is now in a different partitioned set. This will of
   course either result in ITIM creating a duplicate account (if it
   was externally moved INTO the filtered subset for the new
   reconciliation), or WILL RESULT in ITIM deleting the account
   (if it was moved OUT of the filtered subset for the new
   reconciliation).
   This is as we would expect, and is working as designed.
   If a customer wants to use filtered reconciliations to partition
   the account data, then they cannot EXTERNALLY TO ITIM modify the
   value of the attribute being used for the partitioning criteria
   in any of the accounts, as this invalidates the criteria being
   used to partition the accounts.
   Note that everything would work fine if they used ITIM to modify
   the field value being used for partitioning ("title" in this
   case).  The problem is because the partition key attribute
   value is being modified externally to ITIM.
   This is a limitation of using filtered reconciliations, and is
   due to the purpose behind this functionality. The filtered
   reconciliation functionality was designed to be used for
   basically one or more of two purposes:
   1. Increase the speed of reconciliations by limiting the data
   to a subset of the entire accounts list for a particular
   resource.
   2.Increase the scalability of reconciliations by not requiring
   so much data to be processed during a reconciliation, and hence
   limiting the memory utilization for reconciliation. In
   particular, the size and memory used for the list of current
   accounts (as of the last reconciliation).
