CVEID:CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION:The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly known as "SLOTH".
CVSS Base Score: 7.1

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

Principal Product and Version(s) Affected Supporting Product and Version IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager 6.2
IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway 6.2 IBM WebSphere Application Server 6.1 IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager 6.2.1
IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway 6.2.1 IBM WebSphere Application Server 6.1, 7.0 IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager 6.2.2

IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager and IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway is affected through IBM WebSphere Application Server. If you use one of the affected versions of WebSphere, update your IBM WebSphere Application Server SDK with the appropriate Interim Fix based on information in the WebSphere security bulletin (Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Java SDK affect WebSphere Application Server January 2016 CPU (CVE-2016-0475, CVE-2016-0466, CVE-2015-7575, CVE-2016-0448) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21975424]).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

 Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

 Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5 

Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution.
