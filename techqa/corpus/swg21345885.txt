Note: Running the Import Data from CAC also generate the same error.


CAUSE
Records with no values in the import file are stopping the data import. The Oracle Import Table does not allow NULL columns.

ENVIRONMENT
Oracle DB

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove the invalid contents from the import text file.

Steps:1. Open the source file and find cells with no values. 2. Add a value or remove the record.

3. Save the file.

4. Execute the "Upload and Import File" macro again.
