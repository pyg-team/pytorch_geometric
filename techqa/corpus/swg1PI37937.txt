APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you execute a test suite from the test suite section of a
   test plan, you cannot change the iteration on the generated
   execution record.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a test plan and add iterations (schedules).
   2. Create a test suite with test cases
   3. Add the suite to the test plan and save the plan.
   4. On the Test Plan's Test Suite Section, select the suite and
   choose "Run".
   5. Choose "New Test Suite Execution Record".
   6. The information in the test plan field is grayed out.
   
   What is the expected output?
   When there are multiple iterations for a test plan you should be
   able to change the iterations for the execution record.
   
   What do you see instead?
   The iteration is grayed out, same as the test plan field.
   And you cannot change the iteration and test plan for an
   existing execution record and result.
   
   This defect is being adressed in the following work item on
   Jazz.net:
   https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/Rational%20Quality%20Manage
   r#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=128158 [https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/Rational%20Quality%20Manager#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=128158]
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Work-around:
   Create a test suite execution record before executing and select
   the test plan and iteration, or
   execute the test suite from the test suite editor and then
   select the test plan and iteration on the execution record.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * You can't change iteration on an executed test suite when    *
   * start execution from inside of a test plan                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * You can't change iteration on an executed test suite when    *
   * start execution from inside of a test plan.                  *
   * To reproduce:                                                *
   * Have a test suite with test cases, add it to a test plan     *
   * that has iterations (schedules) and save the test plan.      *
   * Mark the test suite from inside the testplan (Test Suite     *
   * section), chose "Run".                                       *
   * Chose "New Test Suite Execution Record", you can now see the *
   * actual test plan and it grayed out (which is ok).            *
   * But the "iteration" scroll bar is also grayed out !!!        *
   * This is a big problem for us because we learn all users to   *
   * execute from inside the test plan !                          *
   * (I know the work around is to start the test suite execution *
   * from the test suite itself, but the users often then forget  *
   * to chose test plan = you can't change and add a test plan to *
   * a TCER later on (there is an enhancement on this who not     *
   * been fixed)                                                  *
   *                                                              *
   * Work-around: Create a test suite execution record or run the *
   * test suite from the test suite editor.                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
