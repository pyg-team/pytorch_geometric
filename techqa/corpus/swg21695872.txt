Title: IBM ASE 9.0 scan results in "Archive file not found" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Security AppScan Enterprise (ASE) 9.0 and 9.0.0.1 scans results in "Archive file not found". 

SYMPTOM
Running ASE scan occasionally results in "Archive file not found" error. In many cases, the error is transient and can't be reproduced. 

The SdkDebug log shows errors: 

Error: Failed to get "SOFTWARE\IBM\AppScan Standard" registry key
....
Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\AppScan Enterprise\Xslt\Scripts'. at AppScan.GuiLayerImpl.Scan.IssueInformationManager.Init()
...
Error: Results Expert Modules configuration file is invalid: Xml file not found. Expected at: C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\AppScan Enterprise\ResultsExpert.xml


CAUSE
The scan is suspended before it can create an archive. 

This is actually masking a deeper problem.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error message has not been seen in AppScan Enterprise version 9.0.3.4 nor 9.0.3.5. 


 

If the problem repeates, set the following to see the original error: 

 * uncheck the advanced option KEEP_LOCAL_DB 
 * set "autoresume" to "0"
