PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 BMXAA5457E Error During Report Import After Fix Pack Upgrade 

SYMPTOM
Clients upgrading from Maximo TPAE 7502 to TPAE 7504 on Weblogic may experience issue running reports. 


After the upgrade to Maximo 7504, when Maximo Administrator tries to import reports (importreports.cmd), the following error occurs: 


"BMXAA5457E - The report import process failed. Verify the specified information is correct before proceeding again." 

Running reports from Maximo give the error below: 

"Error 500--Internal Server Error psdi.util.MXApplicationException: BMXAA5476E - The report custom_woprint.rptdesign could not be prepared to run." 
CAUSE
Three files were missing from the following directory:

applications\maximo\maximouiweb\webmodule\WEB-INF\birt\platform\plugins 


1.
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.script.javascript_3.7.1.v20110905.jar

2. 
org.eclipse.compare.core_3.5.200.I20110208-0800.jar

3. 
org.mozilla.javascript_1.7.2.v201005080400.jar



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

Review the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Follow technoteReference #:1661187as a checklist to ensure Java 2 Securitysettings are in place.

Reference #:1661187 - Cannot run and import BIRT reports 
Problem(Abstract): Cannot run BIRT reports due to error BMXAA4214E and cannot import reports due to error BMXAA5457E 


2. Check to see if a Birt temp directory path "-Dmxe.report.birt.tempfolder" is set in JVM parameter of Websphere console. This should have some value like:

C:\temp\birttemp

This can be done by adding a parameter to the Generic Java Parameters in either WebSphere or WebLogic.

eg. Dmxe.report.birt.tempfolder=c:\tempReport\BIRTTEMP

This process varies in WebLogic and Websphere, but in both cases, the Directory Path to this folder should contain no spaces.

If "-Dmxe.report.birt.tempfolder" is not set then search for the "birtplatform" directory under 

<domainpath>\servers\AdminServer\tmp 

Check all files under this Birt temp directory.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Contact Maximo Support to obtain copy of these files. Copy these three files into the Birt Platform Plugins directory. If issue persists, consider re-installing Maximo again.a
