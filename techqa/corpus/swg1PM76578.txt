PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V8.5                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ODR does not count existing custom      *
   *                      log files (ones that were created       *
   *                      from previous run) towards history      *
   *                      limit.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The On demand router (ODR) does not scan the log directory for
   pre-existing custom logs. This can leave old history files in
   the directory between restarts which could build up and fill
   up available storage.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified ODR custom logging code to add support for the
   custom property 'http.log.history.backup.list'. This custom
   property must be set to 'true' to make ODR count existing
   custom log files towards history limt and they are rolled
   over with any newer log files created when history limit is
   reached.
   
   This property can be set in the administrative console:
   
   On Demand Routers > {odr name} > On Demand Router settings  >
   Custom Properties
