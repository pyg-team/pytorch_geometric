Title: IBM PM02995: WHILE CREATING A NEW DOCUMENT, THE LANGUAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT THE PREFERRED LANGUAGE OF THE CREATOR. - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:-
   
   While creating a new document, the language of this document is
   NOT the preferred
   language of the creator, if the preferred language is Simplified
   Chinese. Instead it defaults to Arabic.
   
   Issue Description and Cause :-
    When the user has Simplified Chinese as their locale the locale
   identifier zh can be passed through to PDM, however only zh_CN
   is handled at the server side by PDM. This led to the first
   locale in the stored list being assigned which is Arabic.
   
   Exception/Symptoms :-
   The output of the session locale in PDM showed zh which did not
   have a corresponding entry in the list of locales within PDM. No
   log exceptions - default was to insert Arabic as a fail-over
   case.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Handle correctly locales within PDM on document creation - eg zh
   correctly mapped to Portal JVM language.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes packaged for Portal version used in Quickr 8.1.1.
