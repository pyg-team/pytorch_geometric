Text:
MSGHSCF0219 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 HMC Version 7.7.2 added an additional check to the server upgrade and change licensed internal code tasks. The HMC now checks that the server firmware level being applied is allowed for the model and type of server being targeted. The check includes blocking the update/upgrade of licensed internal code AL720 levels that do not support model 8233-E8B and 8233-E8C servers. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
HMC Version 7.7.2 added an additional check to the server update and upgrade licensed internal code tasks. The HMC now checks that the server firmware level being applied is allowed for the model and type of server being targeted. The check includes blocking the update/upgrade of licensed internal code AL720 levels that do not support model 8233-E8B and 8233-E8C servers. 

Problem
If an attempt is made to apply a server firmware level to a server that does not support the level being applied, a HSCF0219 error is returned: The selected target system <%1> is not compatible with the selected firmware release <%2>.

Recovery
Review the server firmware readme file for further information on the server models supported by a particular firmware release. Server firmware readme files can be found in Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] or at
the recommended fixes page at http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.nsf/ibmscdirect/e58d7bbf0eac9a2786256ead005f54d8?OpenDocument&TableRow=2.3#2. [http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.nsf/ibmscdirect/e58d7bbf0eac9a2786256ead005f54d8?OpenDocument&TableRow=2.3#2.]

To find the HMC and Server Firmware levels recommended for a particular model server, use either the Server Firmware and HMC Code Wizard at http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/DocNumber/408316083 [http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/DocNumber/408316083] or Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].

Repeat the server firmware upgrade/update with a supported level of code. 

HSCF0161 errors
A related error is HSCF0161 - The requested License Internal Code is not compatible with the current management console level. This error implies the HMC must be upgraded or updated before the server firmware update can be applied. For example, 01AL720_066 requires HMC version 7.7.2 with fix MH01235, The level of HMC code required by a particular server firmware fix is returned in the error message text and also documented in the server firmware readme file. To resolve the error, update the HMC to the required version. For further information on updating the HMC, you should see either the recommended fixes Server Firmware and HMC Code Wizard at http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/DocNumber/408316083 [http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/DocNumber/408316083] or Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].
