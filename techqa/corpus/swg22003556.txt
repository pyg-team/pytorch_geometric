CAUSE
This error message is seen when the ApplicationServerVersion property value in the applicationserver.xml file is set to 8.5.5 instead of the correct value 8.5. The WebSphere Application Server version value should include only the first two numbers. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To avoid the misleading error message, edit the applicationserver.xml file to set the ApplicationServerVersion property value to 8.5 instead of 8.5.5: 


<property name="ApplicationServerVersion">
<value>8.5</value>
<description>Enter one of the following WebSphere Application Server version values: 7.0, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0</description>
<displayName>Application server version</displayName>
</property>

To ensure that the deployment was successful, rerun the deployment task after you correct the property value in the applicationserver.xml file.
