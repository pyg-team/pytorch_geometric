APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As per Tomasz Stopa, the SHA-256 (aka SHA2) is fully supported
   by both BigFix Platform as well as BFI application. Customer
   can already use this as of today - customer can read about it
   here:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKLLW_9.5.0/com.ibm. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKLLW_9.5.0/com.ibm.]
   bigfix.inventory.doc/Inventory/security/t_configuring_secure_com
   munication.html
   
   The table in our BFI documentation is indeed misleading in this
   context
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKLLW_9.5.0/com.ibm
   .bigfix.inventory.doc/Inventory/security/c_sha_supported_scenari
   os.html).
