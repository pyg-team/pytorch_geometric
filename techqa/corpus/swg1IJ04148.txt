APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installing the Oracle Database Extended agent patch's
   application support prevents graphical remote configuration of
   any version of the agent. The following Oracle Database Extended
    agent patches include new configuration parameters that are not
    present in the 'base' version 6.3.1 Fix pack 2 of the agent.
   The depot needs to be patched for the base version of an agent
   when new configuration parameters are added.
   
   Affected patches:
   - 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0005
   - 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0004
   - 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0003
   - 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002
   
   This is a known problem listed as follows in the
   6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0005 patch:
     - Problem: 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0005 includes new
   configuration items. After upgrading the agent support file to
   06.31.02.05, click 'Add Managed System' from portal or brower,
   no matter what you select in the 'Select a Monitoring Agent'
   panel - version 06.31.02000 or 06.31.02000, the 'New Managed
   System Configuration' panel always shows new configuration items
   in 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0005.
   
         As a result, GUI remote deployment fails on a freshly
   installed system with the following error message:
         KDY0015E The property advanced.KRZ_SUBNODE_ONLINE is
   incorrect for version 063102000 of the rz agent
   
       Workaround:
         Use 'tacmd addSystem' command to deploy the Oracle
   Database Extended agent 'base' version 6.31 Fix pack 2.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No local fix.
   
   Workaround:
   Use 'tacmd addSystem' command to deploy the Oracle
   Database Extended agent 'base' version 6.31 Fix pack 2.c
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The agent was unable to remotely install an agent after
   installing IF0002 due to a change in configuration. The
   application support expected a new configuration variable that
   was not available in the base version. The installation process
   has been updated to account for this.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is released in 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0006
