 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After migrating, if you configured the Business Process Choreographer (BPC) Archive on your source environment, the BPC Archive database schema is not upgraded by the upgradeSchemaAll.sh/bat command in IBM Business Process Manager. 

SYMPTOM
You receive the "The system cannot find the path specified" error after following these steps when upgrading the database schema of the BPC Archive database: 

 1. Enter the Oracle SID for BPC Archive Database [orcl.orcBA00]:orcl 
 2. Enter the Oracle user[default=orcBA00] for connecting to the BPC Archive Database [orcl.orcBA00]: 
 3. Enter the Oracle password for connecting to the BPC Archive Database [orcl.orcBA00]:xxxxxx


CAUSE
The error was caused by the schema upgrade scripts of the BPC Archive not being correct in the upgradeSchemaAll.sh/bat command.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Run the generated schema upgrade scripts for the BPC Archive manually. The scripts are located in the<BPM8550_deployment_manager_profile>/dbscripts/Upgrade/<De_Name>/<Database_type>/<BPC_Archive_Component>/ directory. 



For more information about the sequence of running scripts, you can refer to the <BPM8550_deployment_manager_profile>/dbscripts/Upgrade/upgradeSchemaScriptsHelp_<De_name>.txt file.
