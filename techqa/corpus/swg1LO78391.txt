APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When new mail received, inbox unread count changes but inbox
   view does not
   display newly arrived mail. To reproduce you have to set all
   settings mentioned
   above, no new mail received today and lotus notes
   client reopened. Issue can not be reproduced when File -
   Preferences - Mail -
   Sending and Receiving - Alerts has different setting.
   Also to reproduce the issue you must be at least two group by
   date like
   Yesterday and Rest of Week. There should be no messages received
   today.
   Yesterday group should be closed and Rest of Week or any next
   group
   expanded/open. Rest of Week group must contain messages that it
   will not fit
   into screen and scroll bar should be seen. After sending message
   from different
   client or window unread count for inbox view
   updated and scroll bar position changed. Today is not shown and
   I was unable to
   scroll up to see new message. Refresh view also does not help.
   Just selecting
   different view/folder and going back to inbox view
   showed new message and Today group.
