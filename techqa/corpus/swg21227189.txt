 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I want to make sure my ImagePlusÂ® Workstation Program application is at the latest fix pack level. Is there a Web site where I can confirm this? 

ANSWER
The latest IWPM fix pack is fix pack 2a and can be downloaded from the following Web page:
ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/ps/products/imageplus/fixes/IWPMv2.3fp2/ [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/ps/products/imageplus/fixes/IWPMv2.3fp2/]

Download and unzip the IWPMv23fp2a.zip file. This one zip file is so large in size because it contains all languages.. The Readme_fp2a.txt file on the same Web site has the installation instructions. 

There are also additional individual fixes on this Web site that have been released after the latest fix pack build. These individual fixes (also known as APARs) are documented in the interimAPARlisting.txt file. It is recommended that you download any and all fixes that you feel apply to your operating environment.
