APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Wrong status is shown in module browser widget when application
   has both app server and web server as deployment target
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a workaround, if the http server is started, then the
   application status will display as started.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Process Server user with SCA      *
   *                  modules that are deployed to both the       *
   *                  Application Target cluster and an HTTP      *
   *                  server.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The module browser widget displayed     *
   *                      incorrect status for SCA modules that   *
   *                      are deployed to the Application         *
   *                      Target cluster and an HTTP server.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The module browser widget displayed "Partially Started" for SCA
   modules that are started and deployed to the Application Target
   cluster and an HTTP server. The problem is that the Health
   Monitor REST API checks the application status on the HTTP
   server but gets a "stopped" status.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The HTTP server status should not be used to determine the
   status of an SCA module. The Health Monitor REST API was
   fixed to ignore the HTTP server status.
