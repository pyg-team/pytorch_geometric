Title: IBM RRT Robotic Content Capture environment checks - United States

Text:
Robotic Screen Capture; Captured Content; RPT; 71GEN-TEPWV; 71GEN-ITM; 71RRT-RPTWV; 71RRT-RPTTS; 71RRT-RFTWV; 71RRT-RFTTS; SRVE0255E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Robotic Content Capture option in TEPS->Robotic Response Time->Playback Status does not display the Captured Content. 

SYMPTOM
The Captured Content Location field has a value, but it is not displayed in the browser. An error is displayed in the browser window. Possible errors are SRVE0255E or 404. 


CAUSE
The system configuration may need to be updated

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify these items 

 * The version of ITCAM for Transactions is a minimum of ITCAMfT 7.4. 
 * The version of Rational Performance Tester is a minimum of RPT 8.2.1. 
 * The platform for ITM and the T6 agent are supported. See link below for compatibility reports. 
 * The "Enable Screen Content Capture" is set to true in the Robotic Monitoring Configuration on the T6 RRT agent. 
 * The "Enable Screen Content Capture" is not set to false in the script profile in the AMC (Application Management Configuration) Editor. 
 * <ITM_HOME>\kt1depot\T6\CONTENT\ contains .zip files from the last 8 hours if Verification Point errors have occurred. 
 * On the TEPS, netstat -a | find "1520" shows at least port 15200 is listening. 
 * The browser is Internet Explorer v7+ or Firefox v3.2+. 
 * The popup blocker is turned OFF for the browser on the system where Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server is located. 
 * The T6 agent is running on LINUX or Windows. 
 * The Eclipse Server is running on the TEPS server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the items above are in place, 

 * Upgrade to the latest fixpack available for the installed version of ITCAM for Transactions 
   
 * Reconfigure the TEPS. 
 * Verify <ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\installedApps\ITMCell\ContentCapture.ear exists. 
 * Verify symlink from <ITMHOME>/<arch>/cq/filexfer/<arch>/lib/ to <ITMHOME>/<arch>/cq/lib for libkt1.so and KfwFileXfer 
 * Try the Robotic Screen Capture option again. Use http url and https url to verify if secure setting is needed or not needed.
   

If the problem persists, send the following information to IBM Support with a PMR:  * In IE, select "Internet Options" on the Tools menu. Click the Advanced tab. Under the Browsing settings, uncheck the option "Show friendly HTTP error messages" . This shows the actual HTTP error code in the browser. 
   
   
 * Try a different client to access the captured content. If you are using the browser, try the native client and java web start. Also try using a different machine with the client.
   
   
 * Does this directory exist and are there files in the directory?  * cq/data/FILETRANSFER 
      (for Unix) 
    * CNPS/filexfer 
      (for Windows)
      
      
   
   
 * Add debugging to the TEPS  * In the <ITMHOME>/<arch>/cq/bin/lnxenv file add or verify the line : KFW_LOADLIB=KfwMain KfwFileXfer 
      and add this tracing to <ITMHOME>/config/cq.ini 
      KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:CTFileXfer ALL) 
      (for UNIX) 
    * In the <ITMHOME>\CNPS\kfwenv file add or verify the line : KFW_LOADLIB=KfwMain KfwFileXfer 
      and add this tracing to <ITMHOME>/CNPS/kfwenv 
      KBB_RAS1: ERROR (UNIT:CTFileXfer ALL) 
      (for Windows)
      
      
   
   
 * Follow the t6 debugging steps found in the ITCAM 7.4 collecting data Collecting data: ITCAM for Transactions link below  *  For RFT enable tracing for these variables
      BWM.trc.playback.rft
      BWM.trc.playback.common
      and send any data contained in IBM\ITM\TMAITM6\app\RFT\ For RPT enable tracing for these variables
      BWM.trc.rpt.rpttest
      BWM.msg.rpt.rpttest
      BWM.trc.rpt.pc
      BWM.msg.rpt.pc
      BWM.trc.rpt.util
      BWM.msg.rpt.util
      BWM.trc.playback.common
      BWM.msg.playback.common
      
      
   
   
 * Send the SystemOut.log and SystemErr.log found in the ITM platform specific directory  * <ITMHOME>/<arch>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer 
      (for UNIX) 
    * <ITMHOME>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\logs\ITMServer 
      (for Windows)
      
      
   
   
 * Send the HTTP error code, T6 logs, and TEPS logs to Tivoli support along with a PMR. Enable tracing for the TEP interface whether you are using the browser, native or java web start client.
