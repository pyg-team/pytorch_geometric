Title: IBM How to prevent CMP administrator's password getting expired - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
We have deployed Sametime 9 and SUT 9 server environments. At the 
moment SUT CMP Administrator's password gets expired after three 
months? This causes issues as scheduled SUT provisions uses the same 
credentials and once the password gets expired provision runs will fail
until someone notices the issue. 

We would like to disable the expiration of the SUT CMP administrator's password.
How can we do that?

ANSWER
The file to change this setting will be 
/enterprise/common/conf/PassphrasePolicyConfig.xml

and administrator should set MaximumAge to 0
