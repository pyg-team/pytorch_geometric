Title: IBM License error while installing ISIM 6.0 Fixpack 2 or higher - United States

Text:
fixpack install license TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation fails and the following error is seen in updatelog.txt:
CWUPI0013E: A configuration action failed. The failing configuration action is:
LAPandSUIAcceptancePrompt. 

CAUSE
The LAPandSUIAcceptancePrompt is a new license panel added to the fixpack installation starting in FP2. It was compiled with Java 1.6, and will not work with UpdateInstaller installations using Java 1.5.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the $ISIM_HOME/logs/update/<FP_dir>/updatelog.txt to see which component failed. If the failure is due to this error, then this technote applies: 

Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.InstallNIFMaintenance, err,
com.ibm.ws.install.ni.framework.NIFException: CWUPI0013E: A
configuration action failed. The failing configuration action is:
LAPandSUIAcceptancePrompt.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two known causes for this component to fail: 

A. The UpdateInstaller is using Java 1.5 rather than 1.6. 

B. A prior fixpack installation failed, and the license directory no longer exists. 

 

To determine the source of the error, please check the following: 

1. What is the output of "$UPDATE_INSTALL_HOME/java/jre/bin/java -fullversion"?

2. What is the output of "$WAS_HOME/AppServer/java/bin/java -fullversion"?

3. Does the directory "$ISIM_HOME/license" exist?

If the result of item 1 is Java 1.5, and the result from item 2 is Java 1.6, then the solution is to modify the update.sh/bat to use the WebSphere Java. This problem has most commonly been seen with UpdateInstaller v7.0.0.31. Simply change the first command in this line at the bottom:

"$updiJAVAHOME"/bin/java -cp "$currentDir"/update.jar -Xms48m -Xmx384m
$JVM_ARGS run $ISMP_ARGS

to

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/bin/java -cp "$currentDir"/update.jar
-Xms48m -Xmx384m $JVM_ARGS run $ISMP_ARGS

Be sure to use the location of your WebSphere installation in place of "/opt/IBM/WebSphere" in the command.

If the results of item 1 and 2 both show Java 1.6, but the /license directory does not exist, then next check if there is a directory named "old_license". If there is, rename it "license", then run the installer again.

If none of these apply, or the problem remains, the next step is to review the entries in $ISIM_HOME/logs/update/<FP_dir>/updateconfig.log.gz to see exactly what the problem is. At this point, please open a PMR for IBM Support to help investigate this.
