APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Business Process Manager v 8.5 , once the customer
   configures a "Advanced-Only Process Server " IBM BPM Deployment
   Environment Type and creates the ND environment by deferring
   the database configuration (by unchecking the create tables
   option in the db configuration panel) , the customer is
   directed to run the steps outlined in the "Deferred
   Configuration" panel :
   
   Admin console > Servers > Deployment Environments > [DE_Name ]
   > Deferred Configuration [seen under "Additional Properties"
   section in this panel]
   
   For an Advanced-Only Process Server BPM Deployment Environment
   the "Deferrred Configuration" panel suggests the customer to
   run the "bootstrapProcessServerData" script as shown below :
   
   "Run the bootstrapProcessServerData utility from the command
   line. The utility is found in the Deployment manager profile
   directory : BPM_Installation_root/profiles/Dmgr_name/bin. More
   information, please visit IBM Business Process Manager
   Information Center. "
   
   
   And if the customer runs the bootstrapProcessServerData script
   as per the suggestion, the customer will see the following err
   :
   
   
   
   -----------
   
   
   WASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected
   to any
   server process. Certain configuration and application
   operations will
   be available in local mode.
   java.lang.NullPointerException

   com.ibm.bpm.bootstrap.BootstrapProcessServerDataHelper.

   )

   com.ibm.bpm.bootstrap.BootstrapProcessServerDataHelper.init

LOCAL FIX
 *  -----
   For a "Advanced-only Process Server" BPM Development
   environment the user need not run the
   bootstrapProcessServerData script. The user can skip the
   bootstrapProcessServerData script and execute the rest of steps
   suggested in the Admin console > Servers > Deployment
   Environments > [DE_Name ]> Deferred Configuration  panel.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The deployment environment type is      *
   *                      not acknowledged; therefore, the        *
   *                      wrong suggestion is given for the       *

   *                      bootstrapProcessServerData utility in   *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   You are asked to run the bootstrapProcessServerData utility
   from the command line after you create an Advanced-Only
   Process Server deployment environment and database
   configuration is delayed; however, the
   bootstrapProcessServerData utility is not appropriate for the
   Advanced-Only Process Server deployment environment to run
   and, therefore, you will get the following error:
   WASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected
   to any server process. Certain configuration and application
   operations will be available in local mode.
