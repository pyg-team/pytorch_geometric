 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running a DataStage job that uses the hierarchichal stage, the warning:

"<stageName>,0: Couldn't flush user prefs: java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException: Couldn't get file lock."

is generated randomly in the log file. 

CAUSE
JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set correctly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Be sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the jdk directory of the Information Server install directory. For example:
JAVA_HOME=/opt/IBM/InformationServer/jdk 

The JAVA_HOME environment variable can be set in the $DSHOME/dsenv file for simplicity. Once this is set, restart the DataStage engine.
