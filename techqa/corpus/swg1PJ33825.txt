ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description of Problem (full details)
   Perfroming a query in Process Administrator using user index
   will return result.  However, no result is returned if users
   add index values via "Advanced" button (next to the index)
   where the min & max value were set to the range that the
   exposed data fields contain
   The problem was noticed initially using exposed time data
   field. Later the problem is also reproduced using the exposed
   integer data field.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? : Yes
   Is there a workaround? :
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. In Process Configuration Console, expose some data field
   (e.g., myInteger) for Inbox before creating a user index
   (e.g., myIntegerndex) using the integer data field
   2. In Process Designer, expose the integer data field in the
   Workflow Properties dialog when designing a new workflow
   3.  Launch the workflow a few times after set the data field to
   some number (e.g., we use 12345, 22345, 32345, 42345 when
   launching the workflow)
   4. Perform query in Process Administrator using the custom
   index.
   5. Start the search for the work items in the Inbox, user
   should get 4 rows in the result list.
   6. Now open the Specify index value dialog.  Enter "12345" as
   the  Min value and "42345" as  the Max value
   7 Start the search, users should notice that there is no
   result returned.

   Actual Results:
   No work items are returned
   Expected Results:
   Four work items returned in our case.
