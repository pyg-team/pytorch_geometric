APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a P8 Find Duplicate Email task is added to an IBM Content
   Collector task route but there is no valid FileNet P8 connection
   associated with the task, there will be an error. The task and
   task route can be saved, but cannot be loaded again. Also, the
   task route cannot be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If there is no valid FileNet P8 connection associated with the
   P8 Find Duplicate Email task, the task cannot be loaded. Before
   deleting a task route, all tasks must be loaded, because some
   connectors must be notified if tasks or collectors are not used
   anymore. As a result, task routes that use a P8 Find Duplicate
   Email task without valid P8 connection cannot be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 3, the P8
   Find Duplicate Email task has been updated to check for a valid
   P8 connection and not cause an exception if there is no valid P8
   connection.
