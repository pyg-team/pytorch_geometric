APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABEND0C4 RC00000038 occurs at DSNXOP0 +AB1C when there is an
   order by clause in a table expression and the same column is
   fully qualified (3 part name) in the select list. Below is the
   simplified SQL statement:
   SELECT * FROM
   (SELECT
   SYSADM.T1.C1
   FROM T1
   WHERE C1 = 1
   order by C1) AS TB1

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All DB2 9 for z/OS users of ORDER BY in a    *
   *                 table expression                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ABEND0C4 RC00000038 at DSNXOP0 +AB1C    *
   *                      for a query that contains an ORDER BY   *
   *                      clause in a table expression.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An ABEND0C4 RC00000038 may occur at DSNXGRDS DSNXOP0 +AB1C
   if there is an ORDER BY clause in a table expression.  The
   ORDER BY expression must be a column and it must be referenced
   as a fully qualified (3 part name) in the select list. Below
   is an example of an SQL statement where the abend may occur:
   
   SELECT * FROM
   (SELECT
   USER1.T1.C1
   FROM T1
   WHERE C1 = 1
   ORDER BY C1) AS TB1
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DB2 has been corrected to handle a column in the ORDER BY
   that is referenced in the select list of the table expression.
