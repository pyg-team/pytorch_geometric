Title: IBM Non-English character in variable names cause Viz Designer to fail - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I try to create a new visualization with some SPSS data files I get the following error message after clicking OK at the Template Chooser screen:

"An unknown internal exception prevented the operation from succeeding
[SPSS Inc][SAV JDBC]Syntax error in SQL statement. syntax error line 1 at or after token <progtv>."

This happens with every SPSS file that has some variable with non-english character in its name (for exemple, "op??o").
What could be going wrong? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Viz Designer was shipped as an English-only supported application. However, the issue described should work. This problem has been reported to SPSS Development. At this time there is no workaround other than to use English character sets. We apologize for the inconvenience.
It is expected to be resolved with Viz Designer 2.0.
