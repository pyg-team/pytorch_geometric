QUESTION
In the Lotus NotesÂ® 6.0.3/6.5 mail template, the "Block mail from sender" feature was introduced to help deal with unwanted/spam mail. This feature allows you to select a message and add the sender or domain to the Block Senders list. Is there a limit to the maximum number of addresses/user names that you can block?

ANSWER
This issue was reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# LROE5MJHCV.
The limit is not defined by the number of Internet addresses/Notes user names but currently by the size of the Block Mail From Sender list. The list is limited to 32K worth of data. One character is equivalent to one byte, except when using double-byte character languages, where one character takes two bytes.

An Enhancement Request has been submitted to Quality Engineering in SPR MCMA6XLKLE, to request for a new feature which will notify users when the limit has been reached. In addition, an Enhancement Request to increase the limit has been submitted to Quality Engineering as well in SPR ARUI6TZR5P.

NOTE: In mail templates prior to 6.0.5/6.5.4, the limit was 64K of data but this resulted in undesired behavior and the design was revised to 32K. If you are running a Notes/Domino client release or template version prior to 6.0.5/6.5.4, refer to Document #1162013 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=474&uid=swg21162013], "Domino 6.5.x Router performance, hang or crashes delivering messages to mail file using Block Sender rule," for specific changes you can make to mail templates.
