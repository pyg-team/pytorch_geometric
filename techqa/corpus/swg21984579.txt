RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the /etc/hosts file on all nodes match.

Verify that the home directory path for Big SQL (such as /home/bigsql) is the same on all nodes.

Make sure that you set up passwordless ssh for the bigsql user ID from every node to every node, and every node to itself.

Ensure that bigsql user created is the same on all nodes (confirm with id bigsql) 


** be sure the password used is the same on all nodes
