PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Status in the Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH TWL) list widget is displayed as text only. The status icon is not displayed in DASH release 3.1.1 

CAUSE
Status icons that were included in previous DASH releases were inadvertently not included in the DASH 3.1.1 release. The issue is addressed in the next DASH release 3.1.2.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In DASH 3.1.1 add a list widget to a page and configure it to display status for a dataset. Save the widget and see if the status icons are displayed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The fix is included in the 3.1.2 release that is due to be released at the end of April 2015. 

As a workaround, the status icons can be copied from a previous DASH release to the affected 3.1.1 installation. Copy the contents from the following directory on the previous DASH release, to the same directory in the 3.1.1 installation:




<JazzSM Home>/profile/installedApps/JazzSMNode01Cell/isc.ear/isclite.war/secure/isclite/scripts/tipdojo/ibm/tivoli/tip/navwidget/themes/resources/common_assets 

Restart the DASH instance after the files have been copied over. 

Alternatively, the attached file can be unpacked in the following directory on the 3.1.1 DASH install: 

<JazzSM Home>/profile/installedApps/JazzSMNode01Cell/isc.ear/isclite.war/secure/isclite/scripts/tipdojo/ibm/tivoli/tip/navwidget/themes/resources/
