Title: IBM Applet warning dialogues using Oracle JRE 7 update 45 or equivalent IBM JRE. - United States

Text:
Java; Applet; update; warnings; security FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Oracle JRE 7 update 45 has added new features to enhance the security of Applets in the browser. These features have also been added to the IBM Java 6 SR7. The appearance of the dialogs may differ slightly between Oracle and IBM JREs. This tech note describes the Oracle JRE dialogs.

Part of these enhancements include new and reworked dialogues when loading Network Manager pages that contain Java Applets. 

This note will describe why each dialogue is displayed and the impact to users.


CONTENT
When loading the Network Manager pages, such as the Network Views, Network Hop View, or Network Health View, a user may encounter a sequence of dialogues regarding different security aspects of Network Manager Applets.
An example of the messages is provided below. This is based on the results of testing in an IBM lab. 


Dialogue 1 : Do you want to Continue? “The connection to this website is untrusted”

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=1]

Context : Users will see this the first time an Applet loads for a user session

Suggested Action: Select 'Continue'

Further info: When communicating over HTTPS the certificate that is generated on the WebSphere server is "Self-Signed". The contents of this certificate can be seen by choosing “More Information” and inspecting the contents of the certificate.

NOTE : The warning (displayed in a yellow box in the dialogue above) is displayed in error and it has been signalled that it is targeted for removal in a subsequent release of the Oracle JRE, and IBM equivalent.



Dialogue 2 : Do you want to run this application?

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=2]

Context : Users will see this the first time an Applet loads for a user session. The user can choose to disable the warning using the checkbox.

Suggested Action: Select the 'Run' button

Further info: Network Manager Applets run with unrestricted access to client machines. This is to enable printing functionality and saving of network views images.

In a future release of Java (Oracle JRE 7 update 51), and IBM equivalent, there will be new security enhancements introduced to prevent the re-purposing of Java Applets. The dialogue above is a warning related to that upcoming change.

As detailed in the Oracle blog, the enhancement necessitates an application change (setting the 'Permissions attribute'). It is targeted to include this change in future releases of IBM Tivoli Network Manager.

ITNM 3.9 Fix Pack 3 Interim Fix 1, which includes this fix, is now available: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036419 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036419] 


Dialogue 3 : Allow access to the following application from this web site?

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21654628&aid=3]


Context : Users will see this security dialogue prompt once per Applet class Loader instance 

Suggested Action: Select the 'Allow' button to use the Network Manager screens.

Further Info: New functionality was introduced in Oracle JRE 7 update 45, and IBM equivalent, to add protection against unauthorised redistribution of Java applications. This is achieved by adding new attributes to Network Manager Java libraries.
