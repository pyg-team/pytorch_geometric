ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description:
   When my client created a new RSA workspace and redid the .Net so
   lution import, three times with a
   new workspace, the results were inconsistent but it never worked
   .
   When expanding the files, the ToetsExecutor did never display co
   rrectly.
   The other files sometimes they did, sometimes they didn't. It al
   so seems
   related to the order in which you click the files.
   
   From the log file of the first try he figured that the solution
   had to be
   compiled in order to work. So he compiled and tried again. The n
   ext time it somehow had problems
   with the Visual Studio connection, although the solutions was st
   ill
   opened. It also had problems reading .NET assemblies. He checked
    the
   existence, but they existed.
   
   The last time he tried the problems with compilation, and .NET a
   ssemblies
   were gone, but there were still parsing errors. The ToetsExecuto
   r did
   not show and the Toetsing-v210 did not show.
   From the log you can read that other files had parsing problems
   as well.
   I attached the log files of the three tries.
   
   I used the same model, and tested it with RSA 7.5.1 SE with RME
   7.5.1
   The solution has generated with VS 2008
   What is the Operating System ? Service Pack? Windows XP SP2
   s this an existing install or new install? Existing
   Where is RSA installed? Local C drive
   Were there any errors during installation?No
   Does the user(s) have read/write privileges to the registry?Yes
   How many users are affected?Everyone
   Is the customer using Version control? If so, what?No
   What file(s) failed to load?Can't import a .Net Solution to RSA
   - Parsing err
   Can they send the model? yes
   What has changed since the last time the product worked? never w
   ork
   Are you able to reproduce this? yes
   What are the exact steps to reproduce the issue(s)? importing th
   e attached solution into RSA using RSA .Net Import wizard
   What things have you tried? I tried to import the project server
   al times and got different results each time.
   Is it happening on just one machine? no
   What is the customer expecting as the result? Can import the pro
   ject without reciving parsing error messages - refer to the atta
   ched log files
   Does the customer have a work around? no
   What is the customer?s temperature? They need to import the proj
   ect - any workarounds or solutions
   Is this known product defect? If so, provide a RATLC number? Not
    sure, have search the RSearch but couldn't find anything relate
   d
   Have you attached all related files? yes
