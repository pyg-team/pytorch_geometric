Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Customer tries to connect to a Microsoft SQL database. An error appears.

Problem may only affect some SQL database server targets. 

SYMPTOM
com.compositesw.cdms.webapi.WebapiException: Unable to connect to data 
source "/shared/test" at "<servername>:51288@<xxxxxx>". Make sure 
the URL information, user name and password are correct. [datasrc-3961025] 
Cause: The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "SQL Server did not return a response. The connection has been closed.


CAUSE
The JDBC driver ("sqljdbc4.jar") being used was an old (out of date) version. 

 * In one real-life customer example, the JAR file was from MS SQL 2008 R1 (original release). Specifically, the "sqljdbc4.jar" (JAR) file was version 2.0.

ENVIRONMENT
Problem may only affect some SQL database servers. 

 * In one real-life customer example, the problem affected a MS SQL 2008 R2 database server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Update the JDBC driver ("sqljdbc4.jar") to a later version. 

 * In one real-life customer example, the solution was to replace the "sqljdbc4.jar" (JAR) file with the one ("version 3.0") from MS SQL 2008 R2.
