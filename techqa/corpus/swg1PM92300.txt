APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an active syndication is in progress and a change to WCM is
   made, then the Syndication engine is supposed to detect the
   change and mark any related Syndicators to 'reschedule' another
   syndication when the current Syndication finishes.
   Unfortunately
   this 'reschedule' only occurs when the Syndication-Task is
   'scheduled' to be run, not when its actually running...
   
   The impact of this issue is generally not severe given the next
   change will trigger a Syndication, however if the change that
   was missed was the last change for the day (or the last change
   for a long period of time) then it will result in changes not
   being syndicated
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Click the Syndicator 'Update' button and a syndication will
   kick
   off
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If an active syndication is in progress and a change to WCM is
   made, then the Syndication engine is supposed to detect the
   change and mark any related Syndicators to 'reschedule' another
   syndication when the current Syndication finishes.
   Unfortunately
   this 'reschedule' only occurs when the Syndication-Task is
   'scheduled' to be run, not when its actually running...
   
   The impact of this issue is generally not severe given the next
   change will trigger a Syndication, however if the change that
   was missed was the last change for the day (or the last change
   for a long period of time) then it will result in changes not
   being syndicated
   Opened for release 8001
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Analysis: The existing reschedule logic would only reschedule
   syndication if a change was detected when there was a
   syndication task in the scheduler, not when the syndication task
   was actually running (and hence won't be in the scheduler)
   
   Solution: Updated syndication logic to handle this condition
