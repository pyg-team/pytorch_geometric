APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a CICS region is configured to use SSL and the default
   certificate in the keyring used by the CICS region has a private
   key length greater than 1024 then CICS display message
   
   DFHXS0002  xxxxxxxxx A severe error (code X'0109') has occurred
   in module DFHXSDM.
   
   and then abend U1800.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create the default certificate to be used by the CICS/SSL
   connection to have a private key length of 1024 or less.

   ****************************************************************
   A keyring was created where the default certificate had a
   private key size greater than 1024 bytes, this was then
   specified as the KEYRING parameter in the CICS System
   Initialisation Table (the SIT). During CICS initialisation
   msgDFHXS0002 was issued and CICS abended with U1800.
   This is because DFHXSIS does not supply a large enough
   buffer on the IRRSDL00 call to RACF which is used to obtain
   the certificate and the private key.
   The same problem will occur if a TCPIPSERVICE or a
   CORBASERVER is defined specifying a certificate with a private
   key greater than 1024 bytes in length. In CICS TS 3.1 the
   IRRSDL00 calls are made in DFHXSEJ for TCPIPSERVICE and
   DFHXSCT for CORBASERVER. In CICS TS 3.2 both resource types
   are processed by DFHXSCT. In all cases, supplying a buffer that
   is not large enough results in msgDFHXS0002 being issued.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHXSIS and DFHXSCT have been changed to pass a buffer of
   length 4096 on the IRRSDL00 call for CICS TS 3.1 and
   CICS TS 3.2.
   DFHXSEJ has also been changed to pass a buffer of length
   4096 on the IRRSDL00 call for CICS TS 3.1.
