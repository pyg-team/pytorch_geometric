 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You received product installation media in the form of a compressed file (.zip). During installation an error presents with the following content 

"Error 1311. Source file not found" and the installation does not continue. 

SYMPTOM
'Error 1311. Source file not found' during installation.


CAUSE
Operating systems allow opening compressed (zip) files without extracting them. Some required files are not automatically extracted and are not available to be used during the installation process.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop the installation. Extract all of the files in the compressed (.zip file) to a new folder, and run the installer executable ('setup.exe') from that new folder.



Microsoft Windows operating systems
(1) Right-click the compressed file (.zip).
(2) Select the 'Extract All' drop-menu option.
(3) Select the 'Extract' button.
(4) When complete, a (new) folder containing the extracted (decompressed) files will appear in the same location as the compressed (zip) file.
(5) Run the product installer from the (new) folder containing the extracted (decompressed) files according to the product installation instructions. 

 

 Macintosh operating systems
(1) Right-click (Control+click) on the compressed file (.zip).
(2) Select the 'Open With' drop-down menu option.
(3) Select 'Archive Utility' from the available options. 
(4) The Archive Utility window displays with a progress bar.
(5) When complete, a new folder will contain the extracted (decompressed) files in the same location as the compressed file (.zip).
(6) Run the product installer from the new folder which contains the extracted (decompressed) files.
