APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using WebSphere MQ .NET interface in STA mode results in a hung
   finalizer thread, which shows as a private bytes memory leak in
   WebSphere MQ v7 .NET when SHARECONV=0. In the Component Object
   Model (COM), threading is addressed by apartment models. A
   single thread or group of thread is associated with one or more
   COM objects. Single-threaded apartment (STA) applications can
   in some cases experience delays to the Finalize methods of the
   objects that  the garbage collector collects. As a result such
   applications can see an increase in memory usage. Multi-
   threaded apartment (MTA) applications are not affected.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of the V6 leg of WebSphere MQ .NET interface.  The V6
   leg of .net interface will be active when
   factory.SetStringProperty(XMSC.WMQ_PROVIDER_VERSION, "6.0") is
   used or SHARECONV=0 set in the SVRCONN channel.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The .NET code used WMI to query the Windows userid SID, and
   that creates COM objects in the current apartment. Because
   WebSphere MQ could not dispose those objects, they relied on
   the finalizer thread to dispose of them. When the finalizer
   thread needs to dispose of them, it needs to switch into the
   STA apartment and hangs until the application pumps messages,
   which it does not do. This results in a queue of objects
   needing finalizing, and appears as a memory leak".
   
   There is a workaround to this problem and that is by calling
   the GC explicitly using GC.Collect() and
   GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers().
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  There is a new API for finding the userid SID introduced
   in .NET framework version 2.  WebSphere MQ .NET interface has
   been modified to use this function to get the userid SID.
