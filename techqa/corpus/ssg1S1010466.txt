SUMMARY
 Open Source OpenSSL Vulnerabilities affect IBM Network Advisor (CVE-2016-7053, CVE-2016-7054, CVE-2016-7055 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-7053 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7053]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when processing invalid encodings in the ASN.1 ''CHOICE'' type. By sending specially crafted cryptographic message syntax (CMS) structures, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118746 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118746] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7054 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7054]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a heap-based buffer overflow. By sending specially crafted payloads via a TLS connection using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overflow a buffer and cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118747 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118747] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-7055 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7055]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in a Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger errors in public-key operations in configurations where multiple remote clients select an affected EC algorithm and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/118748] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
