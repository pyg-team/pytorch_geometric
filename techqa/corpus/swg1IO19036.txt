ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Content Navigator is unable to run search template created
   in Filenet WorkplaceXT.
   
   Stored searches that were created previously in WorkplaceXT and
   still work in Filenet WorkplaceXT do not work properly in
   Content Navigator.  Instead of  displaying the Search Criteria
   screen, it throws a CEWEB1601 error:
   
   "The search cannot be run.The search contains criteria that are
   not valid for the repository. This problem can occur when a
   property is included in the search that is no longer available
   on the repository or if you do not have access to at least one
   of the properties in the  search.    If you have the
   appropriate permissions to edit the search, save the search
   again. When you save the search, the web client removes
   the invalid criteria from the search. If you do not have the
   appropriate permissions to edit the search, ask the owner of the
   search or your system administrator to save the search again."
