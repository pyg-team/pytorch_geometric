 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using SPSS for Windows and trying to work through the Case Studies under the Help menu. When I run the SELECTPRED command in the example found under the Base System->Select Predictors, I am getting the following error:

>Error # 9100. Command name: SELECTPRED
>Unable to load the executable library associated with the current command.
>Either the relevant option has not been installed, the library is not in
>the same directory as the SPSS executable, the library has been erased, or
>there is insufficient disk space for swapping.
>This command not executed.

>The DLL which cannot be loaded is SPSSWPRS.DLL

Why is this happening? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is a feature only available to SPSS Server. The ability to have it for Statistics/SPSS client has been logged as an Enhancement Request
