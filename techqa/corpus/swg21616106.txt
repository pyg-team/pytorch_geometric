PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Admin Console reports the wrong status for a nodeagent. The nodeagent is really running and the Admin Console reports it as "STOPPED". 

SYMPTOM
In Dmgr's SystemOut.log, we can see that the Dmgr could discover the nodeagent as usual: 

[17/09/12 11:15:05:092 EST] 00000038 DiscoveryMBea I ADMD0023I: The
system discovered process (name: example_node, type: NodeAgent,
pid: 10350)

While in nodeagent's SystemOut.log, this kind of message could not be found which means the nodeagent failed to discover the Dmgr.

Checking the serverindex.xml of Dmgr, you can see some endpoints use ${LOCALHOST_NAME} as the hostname. For example:

<specialEndpoints xmi:id="NamedEndPoint_1" endPointName="CELL_DISCOVERY_ADDRESS">
<endPoint xmi:id="EndPoint_1" host="${LOCALHOST_NAME}" port="7277" /> 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Replace all the ${LOCALHOST_NAME} with the real hostname except the endpoint of IPC_CONNECTOR_ADDRESS and restart the Dmgr, now the status of the nodeagent is correct in Admin Console.

Note: IPC needs to have the hostname as ${LOCALHOST_NAME}, do not replace it.
