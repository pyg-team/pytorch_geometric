APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IN the DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows Fix Pack site, the
   Installers FAIL to
   UPGRADE IBM Database Add-Ins for Visual Studio (VSAI) to
   DB2_V97FP5
   Currently when a VSAI installer is run and the customer has an
   existing VSAI, the upgrade completes without error
   but does not upgrade the existing VSAI to DB2_V97FP5.
   With this fix, VSAI upgrade will successfully upgrade VSAI
   v97fp4 to VSAI v97fp5 but will still not upgrade prior versions
   of
   VSAI.
   A TechNote has been written explaining that if VSAI is not
   upgraded, the customer should uninstall VSAI and rerun the VSAI
   installer.
   The Windows nt32 and ntx64 installers that include VSAI have
   been changed.

   *                                                              *
   * An indication that VSAI has not upgraded is a warning        *
   * message  "The installed version of the IBM Data Server       *
   * Provider for .NET is not compatible with this release of the *
   * IBM Database Add-Ins for Visual Studio." that occurs in      *
   * Visual Studio when the customer opens a connection to a      *
   * server.                                                      *
   *                                                              *
   * The problem is that there was directory removal done in VSAI *
   * for v97 Fix Pack 4, and v97 Fix Pack 3a  causing differences *
   * in the names of Components generated by InstallShield.       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * If VSAI does not upgrade, the customer should:               *
   * 1) For upgrading from v97 Fix Pack 4, either download v97    *
   * Fix Pack 5 or later VSAI image from Fix Central and then     *
   * apply the fixpack update, or uninstall the existing VSAI,    *
   * and re-install VSAI.                                         *
   *                                                              *
   * 2) For upgrading from a fixpack level prior to v97 Fix Pack  *
   * 4, uninstall the existing VSAI, and re-install VSAI.         *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this fix, VSAI upgrade will successfully upgrade VSAI v97
   Fix Pack 4 to VSAI v97 Fix Pack 5
   but will still not upgrade prior versions of VSAI.
   
   This fix has been made to DB2 v97 Fix Pack 5.
