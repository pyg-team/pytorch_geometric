Title: IBM Usage of TLS 1.2 with IBM InfoSphere Information Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I use TLS 1.2 with IBM InfoSphere Information Server 

CAUSE
Incomplete settings for TLS 1.2 usage results in a number of different errors related to SSL handshake, authentication, certificates, ciphers etc

ANSWER
Actions are needed on each of the tiers. Additionally, in situations where only TLS 1.2 is intended to be used, besides Information Server components, one must also configure browsers, databases, .Net etc to only permit TLS 1.2, and ensure that they have been upgraded to an appropriate version. 

1. For WebSphere Network Deployment: 

 * 
 * Navigate to: 
   Security -> SSL certificate and key management ->SSL configurations ->IISSSL Configuration -> Quality of Protection (QoP) settings  * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * Navigate to: 
   Security -> SSL certificate and key management ->SSL configurations ->NodeDefaultSSL Settings -> Quality of Protection settings  * 
    * 
    * 
   
   
 * NOTE: After updating NodeDefaultSSLSettings to TLS 1.2, you will not be able to stop WAS if you have not yet set com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2 in /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/properties/ssl.client.props. 
   
   Click the "Save" link label near the top of screen, and after saving the changes, log out from the console. 

 * 
 * /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/properties/ssl.client.props 
   /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/dmgr1/properties/ssl.client.props (for deployment manager)  * 
   
   
 * 


2. For WebSphere Liberty profile:  * 
 * /opt/IBM/InformationServer/wlp/bin/server stop iis 
 * 
 * iis.ssl.sslProtocol=TLSv1.2 
 * 
 * /opt/IBM/InformationServer/wlp/bin/server start iis 

3. Update the com.ibm.iis.ssl.protocol value in the following locations  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   * 
   
   

4. Run UpdateSignerCerts from ASBServer/bin and ASBNode/bin on all tiers (user must have write permission on the trust store).  * 


5. For clustered configuration, the steps above must be done in Deployment manager and each Node.  * 
 * 

6. Upgrade the JDKs to an appropriate level (for quick reference, here is the October 2016 JDK [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990635]) 

Also, refer to the Related information section for TechNotes of Information Server components that need component specific actions. 

For Connectivity components: 

 * the File Connector does not need any configuration changes 
 * for Hierarchical Stage, upgrade to 11.5.0.2 (no configuration changes are needed) 
 * for Salesforce Data Connector see the linked TechNotes 
 * actions for other connectors, if any, is yet to be determined.
