ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Customer has an environment that already has IBM Connections
   5.0 with CR3 for the core components, but CCM has not been
   installed yet.
   
   
   Customer wants to now add CCM to the environment by installing
   the 3 required FileNet components, along with the FixPack
   levels supported for CR3.
   This process succeeds for the CE server and fixpack, ICN (FNCS)
   and its fixpack and the CE client. However, the CE client
   fixpack does not get applied.
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   IBM Installation Manager 1.8.2 32 bit
   
   Windows 2012 R2
   
   IBM Connections 5.0 CR3
   
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   1. Create folder on file system and copy the following Filenet
   
   installers into it:
   
   5.2.1.2-P8CPE-CLIENT-WIN-FP002.EXE
   
   5.2.1.2-P8CPE-WIN-FP002.EXE
   
   5.2.1-P8CPE-CLIENT-WIN.EXE
   
   5.2.1-P8CPE-WIN.EXE
   
   IBM_CONTENT_NAVIGATOR-2.0.3.3-FP003-WIN.exe
   
   IBM_CONTENT_NAVIGATOR-2.0.3-WIN.exe
   
   2. Open IIM Preferences and add the repositories for
   Connections 5.0
   Base installer and CR3.
   
   3. Shut down Connections & nodeagent. Only dmgr is running.
   
   4. Run IIM installer for Connections in Modify mode.
   
   5. Proceed through the installer screens and choose to install
   CCM.
   Select New Deployment and browse to the installers listed in
   step #1.
   6. For the purposes of reproducing this issue, in the Topology
   screen,
   do not choose to install CCM into a Large Topology or into a
   new node.
   Instead, choose Small and install CCM into the already existing
   
   cluster/server where all the other applications are currently
   installed.
   7. Start the install by clicking Modify.
   
   
   
   RESULTS:
   
   The installer reports success, but the ccmInstall.log shows
   that the CE
   client fixpack install failed:

        [exec]      [echo] ... FNCS fix pack install completed.
   
        [exec]      [echo] Installing CE client:
   
   C:/temp/ccm/5.2.1-P8CPE-CLIENT-WIN.EXE -i silent -f

   "
   
        [exec]      [echo] CE client install result: 0
   
        [exec]      [echo] ... CE client install completed.
   
        [exec]      [echo] Installing CE client fix pack:
   
   C:/temp/ccm/5.2.1.2-P8CPE-CLIENT-WIN-FP002.EXE -f
   
   "C:/IBM/Connections/ccm/ccm/ccm/work/ce_silent_install_windows.t
   xt"
        [exec]      [echo] CE client fixpack install result: -1
   
        [exec]      [echo] ... Content Platform Engine client fix
   pack
   install completed.
   
   
   
   In this file, the version number for CE client is wrong:
   
   \IBM\Connections\addons\ccm\CEClient\ce_version.txt
   
   "Content Search Services Client 521 v 5.2.1.0 build 4694"
   
   
   
   The version for CE server however is correct:
   
   \IBM\Connections\addons\ccm\ContentEngine\ce_version.txt
   
   Content Search Services Client 521 v 5.2.1.2 build 4832
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  WORKAROUND:
   Apply CE client fixpack manually by running
   this command from <Connections_Home>/ccm/ccm/ccm/scripts
   directory:
   update-fncs-ceclient.bat -was.dm.path "C:\Program Files
   
   (x86)\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\Dmgr01" -was.admin.user
   wasadmin
   -was.admin.password password -doInstallFNCS n
   -skipInstallFNCSBase y
   -doInstallCEClient y -ceclient.fp.installer.location
   
   "C:\temp\CCM\5.2.1.2-P8CPE-CLIENT-WIN-FP002.EXE"
   -supportIBMDocs n
