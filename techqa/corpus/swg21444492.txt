QUESTION
 Why does my MQ front-side handler report an invalid address when the gateway associated with it is down? I see this in the device log:

"Front protocol handler is listening on interface 40.23.104.10:37831 but no Multi-Protocol Gateway or WS-Proxy service endpoints are registered for this address." 

ANSWER
This is a default value and cannot be changed or removed. This can be seen when the front-side handler is down. You will see one or more of these three log entries when this situation occurs: 

Front side protocol handler: processing failed: performing rollback. 

Front protocol handler is listening on interface 40.23.104.10:37831 but no Multi-Protocol Gateway or WS-Proxy service endpoints are registered for this address. 

Front side protocol handler received request of 1252. 

 

Use the devices CLI or WebGUI to confirm that the admin state of the gateway is down. The MQ-QM and the MQ Front side handler objects may both be in an admin state of Enabled, while the gateway using them has an admin state of Disabled. 

Enable the admin state of the gateway to resolve this problem.
