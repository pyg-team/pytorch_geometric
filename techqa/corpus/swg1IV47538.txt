APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Enable within the ITM infrastructure an NIST SP800-131a mode of
   operation so that the cryptography used in Tivoli Monitoring
   will meet the new U.S. Government Federal guidelines.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Enable Tivoli Monitoring Cryptography to meet NIST SP800-131a
   standards.
   
   
   Enable Tivoli Monitoring Cryptography to meet NIST SP800-131a
   standards.
   
   As a government consumer or a security conscious administrator
   of Tivoli Monitoring, a NIST SP800-131a mode of operation may be
   enabled within the Tivoli Monitoring infrastructure a NIST
   SP800-131a mode of operation so that the cryptography used in
   Tivoli Monitoring will meet U.S. Government Federal guidelines.
   
   The customer will be provided with documentation on how to
   enable NIST SP800-131a. This mode also enable FIPS 140-2 mode of
   cryptography.
   
   As a US federal agency, an organization is mandated to
   transition all current cryptographic algorithms and key lengths
   to higher levels to strengthen security, which are commonly
   referred to as Special Publication SP800-131a.  Usage of the new
   cryptography in federal agencies will be required beginning
   January 1, 2014.  A transition period is being provided during
   2013 to allow agencies to upgrade to versions of products that
   support the new minimum cryptographic requirements.
   
   Tivoli Monitoring monitoring agents must be able to connect to
   an infrastructure that is NIST SP800-131 compatible. NIST
   SP800-131 requires that TLS 1.2 be the only available protocol
   of communication with strong Elliptic curve certificates or RSA
   2048 bit certificates with strong message digest protocols be
   used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Tivoli Monitoring 6.3 Fixpack 2 enhances the IP.SPIPE and HTTPS
   connections to meet the strict NIST SP800-131a cryptographic
   requirements.  NIST SP800-131a mode forces all configured
   cryptographic protocol communication over TLS 1.2 and requires
   an Elliptic Curve Certificate or a minimum 2048 bit RSA key.
   
   Be aware that the default generated self-signed certificate
   installed during Tivoli Monitoring installation is replaced with
   a 2048-bit key.  If you have your own custom certificate
   installed, it will not be modified.
   
   Be aware that when the Monitoring Server is running in NIST
   SP800-131a mode, pre-6.3 agents will not be able to connect
   using IP.SPIPE. They must use IP.PIPE or be upgraded.  Tivoli
   Monitoring 6.3 and 6.3 Fixpack 1 agents must enable NIST FIPS
   140-2 mode to connect to a Monitoring Server running in NIST
   SP800-131a mode.
