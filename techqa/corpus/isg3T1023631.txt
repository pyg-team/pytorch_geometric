CVE-ID: CVE-2016-2842 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2842]
Description: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds by the doapr_outch function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted string to cause an out-of-bounds write or consume an overly large amount of resources.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
OpenSSH for GPFS V3.5 for Windows

REMEDIATION/FIXES
In GPFS V3.5.0.30, IBM upgraded OpenSSH for GPFS on Windows to use OpenSSL 1.0.2g to address these vulnerabilities. System administrators should update their systems to GPFS V3.5.0.30 by following the steps below. 

1. Download the GPFS 3.5.0.30 update package into any directory on your system from http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Cluster%2Bsoftware&product=ibm/power/IBM+General+Parallel+File+System&release=3.5.0&platform=Windows&function=all [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Cluster%2Bsoftware&product=ibm/power/IBM+General+Parallel+File+System&release=3.5.0&platform=Windows&function=all]

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP archive so that the .msi file it includes is directly accessible to your system.

3. Follow the instructions in the README included in the update package in order to install the OpenSSH msi package. This updated OpenSSH msi package is built using OpenSSL 1.0.2g.

If GPFS multiclustering is configured on Windows nodes, upgrade all OpenSSL packages that may have been installed. The following can be done on a small group of nodes at each time (ensuring that quorum is maintained) to maintain file system availability:

a. Stop GPFS on the node
b. Install the version of OpenSSL 
c. Restart GPFS on the node

IBM recommends if there are multiple servers sharing the same certificate to get new certificates, preferably one per server.
