SETUP CONSIDERATIONS FOR ARCHIVING ENTERPRISEONE XE, 8.0, 9.0, AND 9.1 DATA ON ISERIES
If you are using EnterpriseOne Xe or ERP 8.0, 9.0, or 9.1, you must do the following to set up the data growth solution to archive JD Edwards EnterpriseOne data on System i:

 * Install and configure the Optim server and install DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows, including the Federation Server, on the same machine.
 * Configure the Federation Server, which includes creating a SAMPLE database and a wrapper for that database.
 * Set up iSeries Database Communication, such as specifying TCP/IP communication parameters.
 * Define the iSeries Database Server.
 * Create the appropriate User Mapping from the local system to the iSeries server.
 * Create Nicknames in the DB2 SAMPLE database for the tables in your iSeries database. (Scripts are provided to create the nicknames in bulk.)
 * Create a DB Alias so the Optim solution can connect to the SAMPLE database.

The above steps are documented in the Installation Guide for IBM InfoSphere Optim Data Growth Solution for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.
