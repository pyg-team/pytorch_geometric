the iNotes configuration file without URL rewriting enabled. 20140321 IV57302 HTTP-AS performance improvements when downloading large files. 20140409 IV58757 HTTP-AS, certificate only authentication, first transaction 
does not include the single sign-on token. 20140409 IV58761 Port setting when SSO is enabled is not appended to the Ltpa
token realm. 20140409 IV58777 Cross-Site scripting vulnerability for old browsers that don't

assigned to. 20140505 IV60066 Secure only bit on SSO configuration for authentication
methods is not being honored. 20140505 IV60141 Bug introduced by IV59618, crash processing multiple bad login due to bad password requests for the same user. 20140506 IV60441 SSO using RADIUS authentication requires a configurable LDAP query to retrieve a DN to use in the token. This is needed to support WAS servers in addition to Domino back ends. 20140522 IV60638 Connections Mobile. URL rewriting does not catch links in XML documents that have been HTTP encoded. Some images and links fail to resolve. 20140520 IV61918 LDAP bind authentication, when multiple directory servers are selected, round robin requests to them. 20140626 IV61919 Memory leak, http access services error path handler for badly formatted method requests. 20140626 IV62062 Gatekeeper shows empty mobile device container in the System - Users
container. 20140630 IV62408 HTTP Access Services, add configuration option for maintaining session affinity to back end server after initial assignment. 20140714 IV63410 HTTP Access Services, SSL disabled. On redirects and rewrites, use the service URL as configured, dont change protocols or add the service port. 20140812 IV63934 HTTP Access Services, new function. Allow LTPA tokens generated by 
third parties to be accepted by IMC. Default behavior is to reject and force a new login. 20140826 IV64821 Upgrading to a new Windows Connection Manager build is unsuccessfull even though the installer reported success. Symptoms seen are GK will not launch after an upgrade and/or the IMC build version did not change. 20140916 IV65801 New feature to allow multiple matching strings to be configured on a server pool resource that work in conjunction with the pool assignment hint feature. 20141016 IV66131 Separate internal and external SSL/TLS cipher configuration to allow

Update ldap libraries to current fix level and add fips only mode configuration to dss server resource. 20150122 IV68910 IMCSUPPORT command fails running.
