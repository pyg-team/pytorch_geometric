QUESTION
 In a Policy Chain many ReturnEvent functions are used and each inserts a JournalEntry assigned in an earlier Policy 

CAUSE
The Context (including the EventContainer) passed from Policy to Policy in the Chain carries an @JournalEntry assignment and each ReturnEvent() action function it encounters will insert an entry into the alerts.journal table.

ANSWER
@JournalEntry, like @DeleteEvent, is an Event State Variable and works with the ReturnEvent() action function, which leverages the EventReader stipulated in the Context to update the event in the ObjectServer. @JournalEntry writes into the alerts.journal table and the insert is linked to the event by the Serial field value. 

In a Policy Chain the Context is passed from Policy to Policy in the Chain and each ReturnEvent() action function in each Policy will act upon this same Context including any updates or additions including @JournalEntry.
