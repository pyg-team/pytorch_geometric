ABSTRACT
 ITCAM for J2EE 7.1 install guide description is misleading - "With TTAPI, the Data Collector can send transaction information to ITCAM for Transactions" 

CONTENT
In J2EE install guide, Chapter 5. Configuring and un-configuring the monitoring agent and data collector -> Configure the Data Collector to monitor application server instances, the content shows -


* The documentation shows : 
7. You can enable the Transaction Tracking API function in the following
window. Transaction Tracking Application Programming Interface (TTAPI)
enables the integration of ITCAM Agent for J2EE and ITCAM for Transactions.
With TTAPI, the Data Collector can send transaction information to ITCAM for
Transactions; also, if ITCAM for Application Diagnostics Managing Server is
used, transaction specific information is available in the Visualization Engine.
TTAPI also enables integration of the Data Collector with the Robotic Response
Time component (or T6 agent)...


* Correction in above content : The part in bold characters should actually be read as following since TTAPI needs running Managing Server -- 

"When Managing Server is running with TTAPI, the Data Collector can send transaction information to ITCAM for Transactions;"
