ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem I have is that from the Candle Central Control I am not
   able to communicate with the Collectors.  Each time I try to
   execute a change mode to the collectors I am getting
   KYRSC005 CANNOT CONNECT OT COLLECTOR .... (5001) - CONNECT
   (CODE=10061) KYRSM002 COLLECTOR SDCLXW026.AUIAG.CORP(5001) MODE
   CHANGE UNSUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATIVE Connection to the Manager
   Client seems to  be ok - tested by trying to change mode on
   that and it executes successfully.
   
   Action: Got e-mail from Xiao
   please replace KeeAgent.exe and KeeHook.dll under
   <ART_HOME>\Mgmt\Collector directory.
   
   
   The problem is because for Citrix environment, the Colletor does
   not startup a TCP/IP listening thread on port 5001 to accept
   remote command, so the Central Control can not access it.
