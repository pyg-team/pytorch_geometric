ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I am trying to set a bookmark (the workspace) as the homepage.
   I can right click on it, get the menu, and click Set Bookmark
   as Home Page, but it doesn't pop up the confirmation box and
   the home page remains the same. I also can't change from large
   icons to small icons from the options on the left bookmark bar.
   I have tried fully removing and reinstalling Notes, deleting the
   bookmark.nsf. This has occurred on several different computers
   with different users. The current one I am working with is a
   new user that I am setting up for the first time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ask our customer to narrow down via doing an msconfig from the
   search field of windows then by disabling/enabling any
   applications then test if we could set the workspace/bookmark
   as homepage and we found out that the cause of the issue is the
   Dell Touchpad Software that's preventing it and if we disable
   the software we are able to set it and the menu work as
   expected this is also happening in Notes 9 with Dell Touchpad
   Software.
