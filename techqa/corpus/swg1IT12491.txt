APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When connecting to a remote queue manager using the IBM MQ
   Explorer 8.0.0.4 with a user ID and password and the option
   "Prompt for password" selected when setting up the connection,
   the Put Test Message, Get Test Message, Clear Messages, Test
   Publication and Test Subscription dialogues return an 2059
   MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE error.  The error is not seen when the
   "No password" or"Used saved password" options are used when
   making the connection.
   
   An error similar to the following is seen in the Queue Manager
   logs
   
   11/25/15 11:48:24 - Process(635.8) User(userid)
   Program(amqrmppa)
   Host(hostname) Installation(Installation1)
   VRMF(8.0.0.4) QMgr(QM1)
   
   AMQ9791: The client application did not supply a user ID and
   password.
   
   EXPLANATION:
   The client application 'MQ Explorer 8.0.0' running on host ''
   did not supply a
   user ID and password. The channel authentication (CHLAUTH)
   record for the
   connection requires a user ID and password, but none was
   supplied.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ 8.0.0.4 Explorer who
    - Put, get and clear test messages, and test publications and
   subscriptions
    and where
    - the connection to the queue manager from the IBM MQ 8.0.0.4
   Explorer was made specifying a user ID and Password
   and where
   - the "Prompt for password" option was selected when creating
   the remote connection to the Queue Manager.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux on x86-64, Linux on x86, Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A code change introduced into the IBM MQ Explorer 8.0.0.4
   cleared the cache of the password set by the user during the
   initial connection to the Queue Manager immediately after the
   initial connection had been made.   Instead, the IBM MQ Explorer
   should have cached the password for the duration of the
   connection to the Queue Manager.
   
   The Put Test Message, Get Test Message, Test Publication, Test
   Subscription and Clear Messages menu options each make a new
   connection to the Queue Manager when they run, for which the
   user is not expected to re-enter the password.  The IBM Explorer
   should have used the cached password for these new, internal,
   connections.  However, as the cached password had been cleared,
   no password was available to be passed to the Queue Manager.
   The Queue Manager subsequently rejected the new connection
   attempt due to there being no password supplied for the
   connection attempt causing the explorer to display a 2059  Queue
   Manager Not available error.
   
   General administration of the Queue Manager using the IBM MQ
   Explorer, such as editing a queue definition, does not make a
   new connection to  the queue manager, and so this function
   continued to work as expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ Explorer has been updated to properly cache the
   password used to connect to the remote Queue Manager.  The
   password is now available when making any new connections to the
   Queue Manager required by the internal logic of the IBM MQ
   Explorer.  The password is not cached between reconnects to the
   queue manager, instead, when the remote queue manager is
   disconnected the internal cache is cleared.
