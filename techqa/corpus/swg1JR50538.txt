APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Apache Struts 1.x could allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary
   code on the system because setting ClassLoader attributes is not
   restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
   using the class parameter of an ActionForm object to manipulate
   the ClassLoader attributes and run arbitrary code on the system.
   
   Apache Commons FileUpload and Tomcat are vulnerable to a denial
   of service because the Content-Type HTTP header is improperly
   handled for multipart requests. By sending a specially crafted
   request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause
   the application to enter into an infinite loop.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The vulnerable application is required only for IBM Support to
   gather additional information. By default, only a single
   administrative user (deployment environment administrator) can
   access the application. You can prevent access to the
   application by removing all users and groups from the security
   role mapping in this application.
   
   In the administrative console, go to Applications > Application
   Types > WebSphere Enterprise Applications >
   IBM_BPM_DocStoreAdmin_<clusterName> > Security role to
   user/group mapping and remove all users and groups from the role
   mapping.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Security vulnerabilities have been reported for the Apache
   Struts 1.1 and Apache Commons FileUpload libraries shipped with
   one component of IBM BPM V8.5.5. The vulnerable libraries are
   used only in an administrative user interface that, by default,
   is available only to one administrative user.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that updates the
   vulnerable version of Apache Commons FileUpload and introduces a
   filter to validate user input before passing it to the Apache
   Struts 1.x library.
