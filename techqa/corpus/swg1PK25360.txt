      jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/
      tins_webplugins_mult_remotesa.html
   needs to be changed to include information about multiple
   installs of IHS on Windows servers. The technote
      http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21200915 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21200915]
   addresses installing multiple IHSs (that is needed when multiple
   IHSs of different versions are to be run).
   But some customers need to run multiple instances of IHS of the
   same version on one Windows server. This requires that only one
   IHS be installed, but that multiple services of IHS be
   installed.
   
   The the command ...
      apache -k install -n "MyServiceName" -f "c:\files\my.conf"
   can be used with unique "MyServiceName" and unique
   c:\files\my.conf to get multiple IHS services to run multiple
   instances of the same version.

   When you install IBM HTTP Server, you create one IBM HTTP
   Server as a Windows service with a default name. If you need to
   run with more than one IBM HTTP Server instance, you can
   manually create additional service names.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Creating multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server on Windows
   operating systems" topic has been added to the Information
   Center for WebSphere Application Server to describe how to
   create multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server as a Windows
   service. The following information has been added:
   
   On Windows operating systems, you can create multiple instances
   of IBM HTTP Server by manually creating additional service
   names.
   
   When you install IBM HTTP Server, you create one IBM HTTP
   Server as a Windows service with a default name. If you need
   to run with more than one IBM HTTP Server instance, you can
   manually create additional service names.
   
   1. Install a new service name. Use the apache.exe program,
   which is located in the /bin directory of the IBM HTTP Server
   installation. The command syntax for installing a new service
   name is:
   apache -k install -n <new_service_name> -f
   <path_to_new_configuration_file>
   This command allows you to associate a unique configuration
   file with each service name.
   2. Specify different IP addresses or ports in the Listen
   directives of each configuration file and specify different
   log file names.
   3. [Optional] Change settings of the new service using the
   Windows Services control panel. The new service name will have
   "Log On" set to "Local System Account" and will have "Startup
   Type" set to "Automatic." You can change these default settings
   using the Windows Services control panel. It might be necessary
   to change the "Log On" setting of the new service name to match
   the "Log On" of the main installation in order to ensure that
   file permissions will allow the new service name to run.
   4. Disable the Fast Response Cache Accelerator (FRCA). When
   running multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server, you must disable
   the FRCA (AFPA directives) in all configuration files.
   
   After creating a new service name, you can add it to the
   WebSphere Administration Server administrative console by
   creating a new Web server definition and specifying the new
   service name and the path to the new configuration file. The
   syntax for uninstalling an existing service name is:
    apache -k uninstall -n <service_name>
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the next
   update to the Information Center, which is scheduled to
   occur on or before September 30, 2006.
