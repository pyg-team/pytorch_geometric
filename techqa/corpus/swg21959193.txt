Modules impacted  * Pktcapd, SSL, Kernel, LACP, MSL, LMI, SiteProtector, java, openssl, tzdata


Known Issues  *  We are aware of issue 64948 - where if you disable any protected interfaces before enabling outbound SSL inspection it causes the SSL inspection to not work. As a work-around re-enable the protected interfaces, re-enable outbound SSL inspection and then disable your desired interface. This should allow the inspection to function correctly. A fix for this is planed for a future release. 

 * Fixpack does not allow for rollback. If rollback is done and appliance is, then rebooted then the appliance gets into an unconfigured state. There is no way to recover but to reimage the box or change to the secondary partition.
   
   Change to secondary partition:  *   1. reboot 
       2. choose none selected partition from the grub menu 
       3. press enter
      
      
   
   


Notes  * After applying fixpack, a reboot is required for the changes that are made by the fixpack to apply Clear the browser cache on any browsers that are used to manage the appliance. 
 * If the Event ID GLGSY0038W appears in your System Events Event Log, then the operating system is experiencing a temporary failure. However, the appliance is still protecting your network. Contact IBM Support for assistance.
