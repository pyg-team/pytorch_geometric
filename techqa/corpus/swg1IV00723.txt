ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ITNM-IP 3.9 Installation Guide contains:
   Network Availability Management > IBM Tivoli Network Manager IP
   Edition > Tivoli Network Manager IP Edition V3.9 > Installing >
   Preparing to install > Preinstallation tasks for AIX
   ----
   Configuring Secure Shell (SSH) for AIX
   If you are planning to install as a non-root user on AIX&#65449;, and
   use SSH to access your AIX server, you must perform extra
   configuration steps before you access the AIX server.
   Tip: If you use rlogin or telnet to access your AIX server, you
   do not need to perform the following steps.
   To ensure that the installation will work, perform the following
   steps:
      1. Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on the AIX server where
   you want to install Network Manager.
      2. Ensure that the file contains the following line:
         UseLogin yes
      3. Save and close the file.
      4. You can now use SSH to access the server and install
   Network Manager.
   ----
   After making this changes it was found that a remote user using
   ssh to ITNM servers, could no longer launch a X11 application
   like "xclock"
   
   UseLogin Specifies whether login(1) is used for interactive
   login ses- sions. The default is ``no''. Note that login(1) is
   never used for remote command execution. Note also, that if this
   is enabled, X11Forwarding will be disabled because login(1) does
   not know how to handle xauth(1) cookies. If
   UsePrivilegeSeparation is specified, it will be disabled after
   authentication.
   
   So it disables X11Forwarding and lowers security
   ----
   
   It was determined that the need for AIX sshd_config change was a
   carry out from an earlier release, and that it is no longer
   required for ITNM-IP 3.9
   
   This APAR is to document the need to remove this information
   from future updates to the Installation Guide.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ignore the information in Installation Guide
   Set UseLogin back to defaults
