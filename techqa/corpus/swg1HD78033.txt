APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Scenario :
   1/ Start CATIA without cache mode activated.
   2/ Open C000189058.CATProduct
   3/ Expand the tree of C000189060 until
   QREF_C000189060_PDB_E95.
   ==> As a result, you will see that this CATPart
   contains both "External references" and
   "References externes". This is not normal.
   ==> Some of them have synchronized external
   links, but also isolated geometries.
   There is no real scenario, just open the CATProduct
   to see the problems.
   The data is corrupted and cannot be cleaned by the
   CATDUA tool. The user does not know why his data
   is corrupted.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   Incident Diagnosis:
   External references are corrupted in a specific CATPart
   Restriction Explanation:
   There is no corruption in the data.You need to understand that
   an user is free to change the name of the geometrical sets and
   move some features from a set to another.
   It is easy to arrive to this configuration by using the
   menu "properties" and changing the name and also by moving
   the features with CCP. So unless you indicate a specific
   scenario, I cannot consider the model as corrupted.
   By-Pass:
   You can move the features as you wish and delete the extra
   sets.
