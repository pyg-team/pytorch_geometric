ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Notes client R5.0.9a
   Windows 2000 server (SP2) with Terminal service : Terminal
   server
   Window NT 4.0 workstation : Terminal client A, Terminal client
   B
   
   We installed Notes clients R5.0.9a in Terminal server to use it
   with Terminal
   service.
   And the clients were installed with Single Password Logon.
   At first, the terminal clients logged on to Terminal server, and
   they launched
   Notes clients(notes.exe) from their terminal.
   Since the Notes clients had Single Password Logon, the users did
   not need to
   enter the Notes passwords.(This is correct...)
   
   However, we found the steps Single password logon did not work
   correctly in the
   terminal clients.
   I wrote the following steps to reproduce.
   # <Step A> was correct, but <Step B> and <Step C> were
   incorrect.
   
   <Step A>
   # There is no problem for Single Password Logon in this step.
   
   1. ONLY Terminal client A logged on Terminal server, and
   launched Notes
   client(notes.exe) on Terminal server.
     (So at this time, Terminal client B has not logged on the
   server yet.)
      -> The users for Terminal client A did not need to enter the
   Notes
   passwords.(This is correct...)
   
   2. After step 1., Terminal client B logged on Terminal server,
   and launched
   Notes client(notes.exe) on Terminal server.
      -> The users for Terminal client B did not need to enter the
   Notes
   passwords.(This is correct...)
   
   <Step B>
   3. ONLY Terminal client A logged on Terminal server, and next
   Terminal client B
   logged on Terminal server before Terminal client A would launch
   Notes client.
   
   4. After step 3., Terminal client A launched Notes client.
      -> The user for Terminal client A NEEDED to enter the Notes
   password (This
   is incorrect...)
   
   5. After step 4., Terminal client B launched Notes client.
      -> The users for Terminal client B did not need to enter the
   Notes
   passwords.(This is correct...)
   
   <Step C>
   6. ONLY Terminal client A logged on Terminal server, and next
   Terminal client B
   logged on Terminal server before Terminal client A would launch
   Notes client.
   
   7. After step 6., Terminal client B launched Notes client.
      -> The users for Terminal client B did not need to enter the
   Notes
   passwords.(This is correct...)
   
   8. After step 7., Terminal client A launched Notes client.
      -> The user for Terminal client A NEEDED to enter the Notes
   password (This
   is incorrect...)
   
   
   Therefore, after two terminal clients logged on the terminal
   server at the same
   time, the first client NEED to enter the Notes password in spite
   of Single
   Password Logon.
