Manually Gathering General Information​​  * Screen shot of the TEPS or the error you encountered 
 * Operating System version number and patch level 
 * Database Vendor and full version information 
   for example, run "db2level" command to gather maintenance level information for DB2 
 * ITM Version and Maintenance Level and ITCAM Version and Maintenance Level


Manually Gathering ​​ITCAM Console Agent​​ Information​​ 1. Environment (AMC, TEMS, TEPS)

From a command prompt on a Unix/Linux environment collect this: 

On the AMC, TEMS and TEPS 

 # cd /$ITMHOME/bin
# ./cinfo -t > /tmp/itm6_install.out 

On the Hub-TEMS

# cd /$ITMHOME/bin 
# ./tacmd listSystems | grep \:T3


From a command prompt on a Windows environment collect this: 

On the AMC, TEMS and TEPS 

 cd $ITMHOME\InstallITM
kincinfo -t > itm6_install.txt or 
kincinfo -d > itm6_install.txt 
On the Hub-TEMS 

cd $ITMHOME\BIN
tacmd listsystems | find ":T3" 


2. Installation logs
* Pre-installation logs (prerequisite checking) if installation failed very early:
- Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<Current User's Home>\logs\ITM_Install.log
- Linux/AIX: <Current User's Home>/logs/ITM_Install.log

* After installation started: 
- Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<Current User's Home>\logs\ITM_Install.trc and $ITMHOME\InstallITM\
- Linux/AIX: <Current User's Home>/logs/ITM_Install.trc

3. ITCAM Console Agent Log File

Default tracing level is KBB_RAS1=ERROR, the suggested trace level for the T3 is:


 *  ERROR (UNIT:kt1 ALL) (UNIT:kt2 ALL) (UNIT:kt3 ALL) (UNIT:kra ALL)


How to set up tracing: 

You may be asked to provide additional trace data. To generate trace data, update the ITCAM Console configuration: 

On Windows:  * Open the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services panel. 
 * Select the ITCAM Console, Right Click 
 * Select Advanced -> Edit Trace Parms
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458427&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458427&aid=1]
   
 * Set the RAS1 Filter to be: ERROR (UNIT:kt1 ALL) (UNIT:kt2 ALL) (UNIT:kt3 ALL) (UNIT:kra ALL) 
 * Restart the T3




On UNIX:  * Edit $ITMHOME/config/t3.ini 
 * Replace the line: KBB_RAS1='ERROR‘ 
 * with the line: KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:kt1 ALL) (UNIT:kt2 ALL) (UNIT:kt3 ALL) (UNIT:kra ALL) 
 * Restart the T3


Where to locate the log files: 
Collect the logs listed below, if they exist. Note: these are default locations - check with system administrator if logs have been directed to a different location. 

For Windows: 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\logs\${HOSTNAME}_t3_*.log 
and ITCAM 7.3 and prior releases: 
\Program Files\IBM\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\* 
or ITCAM 7.3.0.1 and future releases: 
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\ibm\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\* 

For UNIX: 
$ITMHOME/logs/${HOSTNAME}_t3_*.log 
/var/ibm/tivoli/common/BWM/logs/* 

4. Messages and other information displayed on the screen 

5. Screen captures of incorrect workspaces 

6. ITCAM Console configuration files 

For Windows: 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\amc_config.properties 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\kt3env 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\kt3cma.ini 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\kt3_config.ini 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\logs\${HOSTNAME}_T3.LG* 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\t3.ini 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\t3-logging.properties 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\t3details.properties 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\t3_dd.properties 
$ITMHOME\tmaitm6\${HOSTNAME}_t3.cfg 

For UNIX: 
$ITMHOME/config/kt3.ini 
$ITMHOME/config/${HOSTNAME}_t3.cfg 
$ITMHOME/config/t3-logging.properties 
$ITMHOME/logs/${HOSTNAME}_T3.LG* 
Note: The agent names assigned to the ITCAM T3 agent are: 

 * ITCAMfTransactions T3 Agent AMC 
 * AMC - Application Management Console 
 * ITCAM Console 
 * and also contains the Application Management Configuration (AMC) Editor
