Title: IBM "Unable to convert string" error in the Rule Execution Server console - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am getting this error when I establish the connection to the Rule Execution Server console: "Unable to convert string 'ilog.rules.res.console.jsf.OnlineHelp' to class javax.el.ValueExpression for attribute basename: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Property Editor not registered with the PropertyEditorManager" 

SYMPTOM
When you try to connect to the Rule Execution Server console, you get the following error in the browser instead of the login page: 


Error 500: com.ibm.ws.jsp.JspCoreException: Unable to convert string 'ilog.rules.res.console.jsf.OnlineHelp' to class javax.el.ValueExpression for attribute basename: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Property Editor not registered with the PropertyEditorManager 

And the server log shows this message: 

Caused by: com.ibm.ws.jsp.JspCoreException: Unable to convert string 
'ilog.rules.res.console.jsf.OnlineHelp' to class javax.el.ValueExpression for attribute basename: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Property Editor not registered with the PropertyEditorManager 
at org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspRuntimeLibrary.getValueFromPropertyEditorManager(JspRuntimeLibrary.java:939)

at _ibmjsp._70_rotected._installer._jspService(_installer.java:162)

CAUSE
The error is caused by an incompatibility between the versions of Java Server Faces (JSF) that are supplied with WebSphere Application Server (WAS) and the JSF version that Rule Execution Server provides. 

Usually, you can resolve this issue by ensuring that the class loading policy of the EAR is parent last. In this case, however, it does not seem to help if the "Precompile jsp option" is enabled while the EAR file is deployed for the Rule Execution Server console. 

As a consequence, the EAR file uses the JSF version that WAS supplies, and not the Rule Execution Server one. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue: 

 1. Uninstall the EAR file of the existing Rule Execution Server console application. 
 2. Clear the cache: delete <WASInstallDir>\profiles\<WASProfileName>\temp\<nodeName>\<serverName>\<ApplicationName>.
    By default, the application name is "ILOG_Rule_Execution_Server". 
 3. Redeploy the Rule Execution Server console application: make sure that the "Precompile jsp option" is not activated.
