APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  EF OpenPGP List command can not display a certificate already
   imported when UserID, email, and comment have same values with
   other imported certificates at same keyring.
   
   This problem can be avoided if the creator of the certificates
   would be able to include any distinguishing information between
   the either UserID, email, or comment.
   
   Problem detected using Encryption Facility for z/OS 740 and Java
   1.7.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Once the PTF has been applied, the following procedure can be
   performed to retroactively display existing hidden keys:
   
   First, run the list -pP command to get a baseline view of your
   keys.
   
   Next, run the -rebuild-key-index command to allow the hidden
   keys to be displayed properly.
   
   Finally, run the list -pP command again to ensure that the
   "hidden" keys now appear.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Encryption Facility Users importing public   *
   *                 key certificates.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Public key certificates might not       *
   *                      be listed by the userID list command    *
   *                      -pP after a successful import if the    *
   *                      UserID of the certificate already       *
   *                      exists in the keyring.                  *

   Problem Summary:
   ----------------
   Encryption Facility's import processing does not store incoming
   UserIDs that are already present on other OpenPGP certificates.
   While the public key material is properly imported and usable
   for encryption, certificates associated with duplicate UserIDs
   are not listed in the output of the list by UserID command -pP.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds processing for storing duplicate UserIDs that
   are associated with unique certificates. When Encryption
   Facility lists all certificates in the keyring by UserID, all
   certificates will be output, including certificates with
   duplicate UserIDs.
