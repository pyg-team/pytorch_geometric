For ClearQuest Web version 2003.06.13 and higher and 7.0.x on Linux or UNIX:
 1. Open a terminal session to the machine where ClearQuest Web is installed 
 2. Run the following commands to restart the ClearQuest Registry Service, the ClearQuest Request Manager, and the Rational Web Platform:  * /opt/rational/clearquest/cqweb/cqserver_restart

This especially applies for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where the $TZ variable is not set by default.
