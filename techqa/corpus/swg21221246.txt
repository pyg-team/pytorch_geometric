QUESTION
A user logged into Lotus NotesÂ® instant messaging and selected the option to save the instant messaging password. Now, when this user logs in to instant messaging, the following message displays: 

The encrypted data has been modified or the wrong key was used to decrypt it. 

After clearing this message, all instant messaging functionality works properly.


ANSWER
This issue has been reported to Quality Engineering as SPR #TGUZ6G3JQE and has been fixed in Lotus Notes version 8.0.1 and Lotus Notes version 7.0.4. 

 

This message can display when a Notes ID file is using 1024 bit public/private key pairs and the instant messaging password is saved. The issue does not occur with standard keysize of 630 bit public/private keys.

You can determine key strength two ways: 

 1. Look at the "Current key strength' in the Certificates -> Notes Certificates tab of the Person document. 
 2. Select File -> Security -> User Security -> "ID File encryption strength" field. If the value of the field is 128 Bits, you are using the 1024 bit public/private key pairs. If the value is 64 Bits, you are using the 630 bit public/private key pairs.

Workarounds:
1. Do not save the instant messaging password. Select File -> User Preferences -> Instant Messaging -> General -> Clear Instant Messaging Password.


2. Configure Single Sign-on (SSO) for the Sametime and mail server, and have the user enable SSO through File -> Preferences -> User Preferences -> Instant Messaging -> Log onto instant messaging using single sign-on. 

3. Changing the Admin client Administration preferences to generate the shorter, compatible, key length when creating IDs will prevent the problem from occurring for new IDs.
