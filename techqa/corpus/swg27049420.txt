compare application PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 Comparing two copies of an application located in different environments. 

CONTENT
There is no automatic Datacap utility to compare rules and configuration for different environments. So a manual compare of the application/configuration is needed. 

The customizability of Datacap also makes it difficult to write a general utility that would work for any customer, as configuration settings will be different locations for each install. In general, a Datacap application consists of the following. 

Databases - The Admin database is the primary one, but a given application may use fingerprint, lookup, or other databases as well. 

In addition to application settings, there can be client configuration settings. The locations of these settings will be dependent on the Datacap clients being used and how Datacap was installed. 

Businesses document and track changes to their various systems so that when a question arises as to differences, they can get that information from their documentation. Businesses may supplement this documentation with commercially available software or write their own scripts to assist with comparisons and migrations. 

When manually comparing Datacap applications, compare these folder locations and settings. 

 * C:\Datacap\rrs - There are also rules in specific directories in the application which need to be compared. 
 * \\Server \Datacap\(application)\(dco_application)\rules - Each application has its own rules directory. 
 * C:\Datacap\dcshared â€“ compiled dlls stored in this location and associated subfolders 
 * C:\Datacap\(application)\(dco_application) - Check the set.xml files to compare configuration settings.
