QUESTION
How do you verify that your certificate has the appropriate entitlement to sign a form using the IBM Forms API?

ANSWER
Certificates have different levels of usage. You can define scopes where a certificate can be applied or not. 

To ensure that your certificate can be used to sign forms programmatically using the API, you need to make sure your certificate has the "Email Protection" entitlement. Below are screen captures to show you how to identify this entitlement for MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer or Firefox. 

Firefox:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21306313&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21306313&aid=1] 

When you import a certificate into Internet Explorer, you see the following result when you select Key Usage on the Details tab:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21306313&amp;aid=2]

View the certificate details. If your certificate in Firefox shows other entitlements but not "Email Protection" explicitly, then you will not be able to use the certificate to sign forms with the API. If this is the case, request that your certificate authority generate you a new certificate with "Email Protection" entitlement.
