PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your WebSphere MQ (WMQ) channel fails to start.

You receive the following errors on the z/OS sending side: 

CSQX630E CSQXRESP Channel ???? requires SSL
CSQX642E =MQX8 CSQXRCTL No SSL certificate for channel ....
CSQX620E =MQX8 CSQXRESP System SSL error, channel ????, function 'gsk_secure_soc_init' RC=-2 

The following messages were seen on the AIX receiving side:

AMQ9637: Channel is lacking a certificate. 
AMQ9665:SSL connection closed by remote end of channel ....
AMQ9209: Connection to host 'mqx8chin (123.45.67.89)' closed. 

CAUSE
When importing a certificate the case of the label name does not matter. The imported certificate from AIX with an all lower case name (ibmwebspheremq) to z/OS, works fine on z/OS. However, the certificate was created on z/OS. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must adhere to the case required for the z/OS label ibmWebSphereMQ 

The label-name [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fsy12570_.htm]must be in the correct WebSphere MQ format for a WMQ on z/OS queue manager: ibmWebSphereMQ followed by the name of your queue manager. 

Example: ibmWebSphereMQCSQ1.
