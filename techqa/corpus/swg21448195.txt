PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Get error message CYNVE0181E when trying to configure a Data Collector. 

SYMPTOM
Cannot configure the DC in the "Unconfigured Data Collectors" in the MS GUI.


CAUSE
Database connections run out during the configuration time and the default settings of maximum number of connections in the DB2 or Oracle databases are not sufficient enough to handle all the database connections/activities involved.

ENVIRONMENT
ITCAM for WAS 6.1.x / ITCAM for AD 7.1.x with DB2 or Oracle as back-end databases.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, increase the MAX_CONNECTIONS on the DB2 / Oracle databases.




For DB2, consider increasing the MAX_CONNECTIONS to be greater than the MAX_COORDAGENTS parm. 

See this link for more information on increasing the parameter:
