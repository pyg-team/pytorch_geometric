Title: IBM Adding new anonymous values for EMAIL and PHONE does not seem to work - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After adding new anonymous values for the EMAIL or PHONE algorithm functions, for example USER@HOST.COM (email) or 902122222222 (phone), and deploying configuration, these values are still considered for bucketing and matching and are not being treated as anonymous. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are certain steps that occur with standardization, and the user must calculate the correct value to insert into the anonymous values string file. Simply adding USER@HOST.COM as an anon value will not work. For example, the standardization process for EMAIL will (among other things) convert all applicable characters via CMAP conversion, then remove all spaces, @ symbols and truncates the entire address after the last dot (period). So, USER@HOST.COM will become USERHOST after this phase, and USERHOST must therefore be the final anonymous value added to the string file for this function. Similarly, actions are performed on phone numbers such as stripping the country code prefix, and therefore phone numbers should not be added in the PHONE anon values file without also stripping the country code. 

Please ensure that the correct formatting is used when incorporating anonymous values, in particular for EMAIL and PHONE, or the system will not recognize them and will not ignore them as a result.

Consult the documentation for the function you are using in order to discover the processing steps that will help you to build your final anonymous entries.
