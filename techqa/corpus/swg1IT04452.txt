APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an WSMAgent is enabled on a Multi-Protocol Gateway and
   this service contains an asynchronous transform action, the
   appliance might experience an unexpected restart.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Turn off WSMAgent flag on Multi-Protocol Gateway.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are all customers on release 6.0.0 and later using the
   Multi-Protocol Gateway service with enabled "Monitor via Web
   Services Management Agent" and a processing policy rule having
   an asynchronous transform action that in its stylesheet
   retrieves the value of the 'var://service/wsm/service-port'
   variable. During execution of the stylesheet the appliance might
   restart.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.10, 6.0.1.6 and 7.0.0.3.

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Set the transform action to be synchronous.
