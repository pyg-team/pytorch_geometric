   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   TEP Client support for Oracle Java 7 u51.
   Oracle Java 7 u51 provides additional security updates
   that require that all JAR files used in applet or Java Web
   Start deployments have the permissions attribute set in
   the JAR manifest file. This requirement will affect the
   TEP client, both browser and Java Web Start modes. Without
   compliance with this requirement, the TEP client may not
   start after downloading. This issue does not affect other
   releases or levels of Java.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   The supplied application support for OMEGAMON XE for DB2
   PE/PM has been rebuilt to comply with the new security
   requirements of Oracle Java 7 u51.
