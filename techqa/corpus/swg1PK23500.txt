ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  customer has a simple report that's based on SQL Server
   Database's Table that has one column as "TEXT" and contains
   large amounts of data ( like 2-3 pages each in one column)
   When she displays this report at runtime , the data starts
   showing up from the 2nd page instead of 1st page (1st page of
   the report is blank). The same behaviour occurs when this report
   is run in Crystal Reports XI standalone product. Customer
   figured (hit and trial) by right clicking on the specific column
   in the report details section > format field > Uncheck "Keep
   Object Together" > Save the changes.
   Next time the report is run on the server, the Data starts
   showing up from the first page , But this workaround only works
   in the standalone CR XI product. This design time feature ("Keep
   object together")is available in RAD CR design time as well, and
   is checked ON by default(same as CR XI standalone product) but
   the workaround ( Unchecking this checkbox) does not work for RAD
   .
   AT runtime, the data starts displaying from the 2nd page only
   and not from the 1st page , whether the checkbox is selected or
   not.. I think there's some patch in CR XI runtime that's missing
   RAD CR XI runtime, which is causing this issue.
   I worked with BusinessObjects support and we were able to
   reproduce this issue (*even after applying the latest embedded
   designer and JRC XI runtime patches applied on RAD)
   The BusinessObjects CASE # for this issue is # 302655585
   The defect number from BusinessObjects side for this issue is
   ADAPT00585858
   
   
   BusinessObjects support provided me instructions to force RAD
   Crystal reports tooling to use the latest XI Jars (*which were
   not getting picked otherwise) and also the instructions to use
   XI R2 jars. Reports that are made from scratch in the ActiveX
   designer work fine now (*aftera applying XI latest patches or
   while using XI R2 jars) . But the issue still occurs when the
   reports are designed from scratch in the external XI or XI R2
   designer and then made to run in RAD web projects. So Changing
   the heading of this RATLC to
   "XI or XI R2 External Designer's reports (with TEXT field) start
   from the second page . Embedded Designer reports work fine"

COMMENTS
 *  No appropriate documentation was available from
   BusinessObjects about this specific case.. which could have
   avoided this CR and/or this lengthy CritSit. Will soon put
   up a technote on RAD/RSA product support site for this issue
   for other customers.
