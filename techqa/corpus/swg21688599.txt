Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM® Endpoint Manager for Remote Control (CVE-2014-3566) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 SSLv3 contains a vulnerability that has been referred to as the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) attack. SSLv3 is enabled in IBM® Endpoint Manager for Remote Control. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]

DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control versions 9.1.0 and 9.0.1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None. 


SSLv3 will be disabled by default on all IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control components in the next interim fixpack cycle that is expected Q1 2015.
IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation such as disabling SSLv3 and remediation actions. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
SSLv3 is only supported in connections from the target, CLI, controller, broker and gateway components to the remote control server component. Disabling SSLv3 connections on the remote control server disables the use of SSLv3 throughout an IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control infrastructure. 

Use the following instructions to disable SSLv3 on a component by component basis where applicable 

Version 9.1.0 

Server component
1. Open a command prompt 
2. Go to the [TRCINSTALLDIR]\wlp\usr\servers\trcserver directory
3. Open the ssl.xml file in a text editor. For example, Notepad. Edit the defaultSSLConfig line and change the sslProtocol value to TLS

<server>
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" sslProtocol="TLS" />
</server>

4. Save the file and restart the server service. 

Windows operating system: 
restart IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - Server service within Control Panel > Administrative tools > Services.

Linux operating system: 
restart the server service, within a terminal as root, by using the following command 

/etc/init.d/trcserver restart 

 

 

Controller component 

In the 9.1.0 controller, only TLSv1 or higher is used for HTTPS connections, so SSLv3 is already not supported. 

 

 

Target and CLI components
The target and cli components have SSLv3 enabled by default for HTTPS connections to the remote control server. For all other types of connection, SSLv3 is disabled by default. To disable SSLv3 for HTTPS connections to the remote control server, use the instructions relevant to your operating system:

Windows operating system:
1. Use regedit.exe and navigate to the target configuration stored in the following registry key:

32-bit systems: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBM\Tivoli\Remote Control\Target
64-bit systems: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\IBM\Tivoli\Remote Control\Target

2. Add a new String Value (REG_SZ) with the name UseSSLv3 and a value of No
3. Restart the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - Target service within Control Panel > Administrative tools > Services.


Linux operating system:
1. Edit the /etc/ibmtrct.conf file.
2. Add a new line:
UseSSLv3 = No
3. Restart the ibmtrct service 




Broker component
The broker component has SSLv3 enabled by default for HTTPS connections to the remote control server. For all other types of connections, including HTTPS connections from endpoint browsers to the reverse proxy, SSLv3 is disabled by default. 
To disable SSLv3 for HTTPS connections to the remote control server, add the following line to the trc_broker.properties file and restart the broker service:

ServerSSLv3 = false




Gateway component
The gateway component only uses SSL/TLS connections when NIST SP800-131a support is enabled. However, SP800-131a does not allow the use of SSL/TLS protocol lower than version 1.2. Therefore, SSLv3 is not supported by the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control gateway and does not need to be disabled. 




Version 9.0.1 

Server component
1. Open a command prompt 
2. Go to the [TRCINSTALLDIR]\wlp\usr\servers\trcserver directory
3. Open the ssl.xml file in a an editor ( see note * below). For example, Notepad. Edit the line defaultSSLConfig and change the sslProtocol value to TLS

<server>
<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" sslProtocol="TLS" />
</server>

4. Save the file and restart the server service.

Windows operating system: 
restart IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control - Server service within Control Panel > Administrative tools > Services.

Linux operating system: 
restart the server service, within a terminal as root, by using the following command 

/etc/init.d/trcserver restart

*Note: If there is no ssl.xml file, edit the memory.xml file. 
After the <keystore line, add the following line

<ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" sslProtocol="TLS" />




Controller component 
Controller connections to the broker, target, CLI and gateway components do not use SSLv3.
For HTTPS connections to the remote control server SSLv3 cannot be disabled fully on the controller, therefore you must disable it on the server component. 




Target, CLI and Broker component
For HTTPS connections to the remote control server SSLv3 cannot be disabled on the target, CLI or broker, therefore, you must disable it on the server component. 

 

 

 

Gateway component
The 9.0.1 gateway does not use SSL/TLS connections.
