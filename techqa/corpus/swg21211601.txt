Title: IBM Changing the plugin-cfg.xml file dynamically without having to restart the 
Web server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the Web server and plug-in are on a UNIX system and you change the log level (for example, change the log level from Error to Trace or from Trace to Error) in the plugin-cfg.xml file, this change is not picked up dynamically. You must restart the Web server to pick up the changes. 

The following errors are in the <Plugin_Home>/logs/http_plugin.log file:

If you restart the Web server, the changes are picked up. 

SYMPTOM
ERROR: ws_config_parser:handleLogEnd: Failed to open log file 
'/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugin/logs/sunwebserver/http_plugin.log', OS Err:13


CAUSE
When the Web server restarts, the parent process has the root access and it can load the plug-in configuration file. The child process, started with user ID nobody, does not have enough authority to the log file.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Give permission to the http_plugin.log file; for example: 

# chmod 766 http_plugin.log

Or, give the chown to the same user as a child process of httpd; for example: 

# chown myuser http_plugin.log
