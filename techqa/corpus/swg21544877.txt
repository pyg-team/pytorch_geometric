PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error: getreply Received From Remote <550 SSL Fail (SSLTCP:553:SSL_do_handshake:timeout) (SCI81254) 

SYMPTOM
Primary Socket connection:207.241.10.136 [52815] <-> 207.241.10.136 [990] 
getreply: received from remote <550 SSL Fail (SSLTCP:553:SSL_do_handshake:timeout <br/> tcp:-1001:SSL Handshake did not comp>ete. (SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ):) 
Error in processing <OPEN 990 ftp.financialgo.net>command Code = -1


CAUSE
Listening on port 990. This port 990 is a well known port for implicit mode FTP/SSL which C:E UNIX does not support. This connection will not work. If the remote must configure to do Explicit mode FTP/SSL then C:E should be configured to connect to it. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Connect:Enterprise UNIX only operates in explicit mode.



Configure the Server to listen on a port greater than 1024 (above the well know "Preassigned" Port range)



The difference between implicit and explicit is that the server expects:



 1. 
 2. 
 3. 
    
    Implicitly to go directly into an SSL connection 
 4. 
 5. 
 6. 
    
    Explicitly sending a banner getting an AUTH command and responding with a 234. 



i.e. Implicit mode works just like HTTP(S) where a browser goes directly into SSL handshake with a webserver. In this case, a client goes directly into SSL handshake with an FTP server. 990 is a well known port for this just like 21 is for FTP. 



NOTE:
Although there is nothing special about these ports you can do FTP on 10021 for example, but the idea behind the well known port concept is that you would expect a certain protocol (response) on a certain port. Not always true, but it is the expectation.
