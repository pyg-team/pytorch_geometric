   Customer input into problems with the Agent:
   
   The agent is not well integrated into ITM6. It is not just
   the work with the SPA. Also real time data are partially not
   proper presented because of the mismatch of historical and
   real time (last interval) data.
   
   All you read below is already a part of the product but does
   not work as expected. So there is really nothing new.
   
   1. Event Throughput
   
   a) I want to collect how many events are received, queued
   and in waiting state in a short interval, e.g. 120 seconds
   and store this data 3 days. In case we had some problems at
   night or at the weekend this would be a good indicator
   before dive deep.
   - > This works right now.
   
   b) I want to aggregate this data using the SPA to obtain
   daily or weekly data. This information is useful to create
   trends or to compare the current load with the load one year
   ago and so on.
   - > This does not work right now.
   
   2. Event Activity
   
   a) I wonna see how much a class cost. Because it is known
   which rules are fired by which event classes this is an
   indicator of which rules need to be improved to increase the
   performance for the top ten classes.  A nice thing.
   The agent measure the required parameters like how many
   events per class are received and how much time the rule
   processing takes but the output is almost useless. In case
   events of a specific class are received in the last interval
   than I expect one line for that class in the real time view
   not more. This should work like the performance measurement
   for processes. If a process is up and running than I want to
   measure the CPU time and so on.
   This data would be useful in an interval of 1 hour.
   - > The agent provides more than one entry in real time view
   
   b) Aggregated data
   - > If you aggregate this data you get 100% mindless data
   because of 2a)
   
   3 Event Distribution
   
   a) I like to measure this each 10 minutes to detect event
   storms from a host or of a specific class. I like to use
   this information to automated switch off the monitoring of a
   host that produces e.g. 100 tickets in 10 minutes. This
   helps to keep the monitoring system alive in case one
   monitor runs amok. We had this last weekend. One monitor
   produced 74.000 different events before it switched of by an
   operator.
   - > The agent can provide real time data
   
   b) To have aggregated data would be nice to see, which host
   had the most events
   - > This does not work right now.
   
   This is how we intend to use this agent.

   Recreate Steps:
   .
   TEC Health Agent is running currently on lab machine minbari
   and has been successfully recreated by L3 as well.
   
   Run some events into TEC and let them be captured by the
   Health Agent.
   
   Have a look at the views, and it appears that events are not
   displayed correctly.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Tivoli Enterprise Console 3.9.0 users
   running the IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Enterprise Console
   Agent version 3.9.0
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The summarized data for the event
   throughput monitored by the TEC Health and Performance Agent
   does not contain useful information.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply maintenance vehicle listed below

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Gauge attributes are averaged and summed across sample periods,
   and counter attributes increase over time, and the last reported
   value is used for the summary.
   
   The new ITM for TEC Agent version 3.9.1 is available in the Bill
   of Materials for TEC on Passport Advantage.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
