Title: IBM Find the version of JRules/WODM components - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I determine the version and fix pack level of the JRules/WebSphere Operational Decision Management (WODM) components and libraries I am using? 

CAUSE
It is important to know the version of all JRules or WODM/ODM components you use to ensure they are of the same version and all up-to-date with the latest fix pack. The same goes for the product libraries used by your client applications.


Versions of modules are given in the standard IBM format V.R.M.F which stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.



Not using the exact same version is not supported as it can cause unexpected behaviors.

This means that support will assist with problems on such non-supported configurations by testing with all modules at the same version/fix pack:


 * If the issue happens to be caused by the mix of versions/fix packs, the solution will be to put all modules at the same version/fix pack. 
 * If the issue is fixed in a latest fix pack, the solution will be to apply it on all your modules.

ANSWER
JRules or ODM are made of several modules which components versions can be obtained in different ways. The below tables explain how to get the version information of each deployed product components, depending on whether you are using JRules or ODM. 

 

 

You will also need to consider any of your applications using the JRules/ODM libraries, including any Monitored Transparent Decision Service (MTDS) or web service generated through the Rule Studio or Rule Designer "Client for RuleApp" wizards. 

For those, you will need to find the product JARs you packaged in your WARs and/or EARs deployed to the server, or present in the classpath of your stand-alone Java applications. Those JARs are typically named jrules-xyz.jar. 

The product version information of those libraries is specified at the "Implementation-Version: ..." line of the MANIFEST.MFfile found under theMETA-INF folder of each JARs.

 * 
 * 
 * 40
 * 
 * .NET framework 4.0

 * 3.5.
 * So, for example, RSO "V7.5.40.2152" is "V7.5.0.2 for .NET 4.0".
