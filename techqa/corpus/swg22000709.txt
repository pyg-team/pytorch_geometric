QUESTION
 Why am I seeing a "BLU failed at this line, Detected in file:sqlrl_table.C [file:sqlrl_table.C]" message in the db2diag.log? 

CAUSE
For example:
FUNCTION: DB2 UDB, database utilities, sqluReportErrToDiag, probe:0
MESSAGE : BLU failed at this line , 2892, ffffffff801a006d, Detected in
file:sqlrl_table.C [file://sqlrl_table.C], Line:2892



ANSWER
This is a defect first reported in v10.5 FP6 when attempting to complete a CREATE TABLE statement, which should be successful. 

APAR IT19793 has been opened to address this cosmetic defect and will be corrected in a future fixpack yet to be determined at this time. 

The MESSAGE above is a cosmetic in nature and can be ignored too.
