ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Summary: when a project state changes from Pending to Active on
   the syndicator, the change is not refrected on the subscriber.
   Repo Steps:
   
   0. Create a library with default items.
   1. Set up syndication between a 7002 and an 8001 server with
   7002 being the syndicator to syndicate the library.
   2. On the syndicator, create a Project with Publish Option being
   Manual and with a Text Component using the 3 stage workflow in
   the library
   3. Approve the text component and observe that the project's
   state changes from Active to Syndicating to Pending.
   4. Wait for syndication to complete and check that the Project
   is also in Pending state on the subscriber.
   5. On the syndicator, reject the project item and observe that
   the project's state changes back to Pending.
   6. Wait for syndication to complete and check the project state
   on the subscriber => still in Pending state.

LOCAL FIX
 *  When project was set to Active state, the lastModified date
   wasn't changed, so project on syndicator and project on
   subscriber has the same last modified date. The subscriber won't
   update project when the last modifed date is the same.
   Making sure lastModified date of the project is updated fix this
   issue.

   won't
   update project when the last modifed date is the same.
   Making sure lastModified date of the project is updated fix
   this
