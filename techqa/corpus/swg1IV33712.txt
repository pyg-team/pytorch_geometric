APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   When running multiple TEPS connected to the same HUB and
   importing the TEPS database from a primary TEPS to a "read only"
   TEPS appears to cause duplicate UADVISOR situations on the HUB.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   1.  With 2 TEPS connected to the same HUB.
   2.  Run migrate-export to backup the primary TEPS that has no
   KFWHISTDATA table.
   3.  Take the saveexport.sql output from that and use it as input
   to a migrate-import on a secondary "read only" TEPS.
   4.  After completion of the migrate-import, the TEPS database on
   the "read only" TEPS will have an empty KFWHISTDATA table.
   
   It is still unclear how this causes duplicate UADVISOR
   situations, but customer insists this is the result.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update export.parms to remove the KFWHISDATA table definition.
   
   
   Under the TEPS sqllib directory:
   1) Edit the export.parms file and change all references for
   KFWHISTDATA to KFWHISTDATABAK.
   
   2) Edit the export.parms file changing the two KFWHISTDATA
   entries to KFWHISTDATABAK,
   
   3) Edit the seed-4.sql file changing the one table name entry
   for KFWHISTDATA to KFWHISTDATABAK.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After running migrate-import, the KFWHISTDATA table is
   recreated.  This table in most environments, is not needed and
   its recreation can cause confusion since at some previous point,
   the information in that table has been migrated to the
   WAREHOUSESUMPRUNE table of the WAREHOUSE database.
   
   
   Starting in IBM Tivoli Monitoring version 6.22 FP2, the
   KFWHISTDATA table is no longer used to maintain summarization
   and pruning settings for application attribute groups.  The
   summarization and pruning setting are maintained in the
   WAREHOUSESUMPRUNE table of the WAREHOUSE database.
   Unfortunately, the KFWHISTDATA can still get recreated during
   migrate-export processing and even when maintenance has been
   applied.  This is source of confusion for the customer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The migrate-export scripts have been modified to NOT generate a
   CREATE KFWHISTDATA SQL statement in the saveexport.sql file
   which would cause the KFWHISTDATA to be recreated.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle:
     | fix pack | 6.2.3-TIV-ITM-FP0004
     | fix pack | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Manually drop the KFWHISTDATA table after maintenance has been
   applied or remove the CREATE KFWHISTDATA SQL staement from
   saveexport.sql before running the migrate-import script.
