APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Calls to getgrent() on NonStop are very inefficient -
   especially in environments with large number of groups defined.
   There is an acknowledged problem with the HP implementation
   which is under consideration by HP for a fix.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Usually not feasible, but reducing the number of user groups
   is effective at reducing the startup time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   strmqm is slow when a customers environment
   contains many groups. The OAM is making calls to getgrent
   that are not required.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *   Modify the MQ code to remove redundant
   callfor group checking. The call was checking every group on
   the system.
   The HP OSS/Safeguard implementation and audit logging is also
   inefficient which HP are reviewing for future change.
