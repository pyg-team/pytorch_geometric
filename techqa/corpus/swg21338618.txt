Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tables in an Oracle Database Content Store are not created when the Cognos BI Service is started. 

SYMPTOM
CM-SYS-5124 Content Manager cannot start because the content store database character set is not supported.
CM-SYS-5129 The content store database server uses the character set US7ASCII.
CM-SYS-5128 The content store database client uses the character set US7ASCII.

Another error that may be thrown is:

1. [ ERROR ] The database connection failed.
2. [ ERROR ] Content Manager cannot start because the database character set for the content store is not supported. Before you restart Content Manager, you may need to recreate the content store database or clean it using dbClean_*.sql.


CAUSE
Content store database is not using the correct character set.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In SQL Plus, determine if the database is unicode by typing the following Select statement: select * from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS

The result should return NLS_CHARACTERSET and NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET of UTF-8 or UTF-16, or AL32UTF8 or ALI6UTF16, or not unicode. If this is not the case, recreate the Oracle database with one of these character sets as follows:

1. Open SQL Plus

2. Issue the following command: select * from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS;

3. Make sure the NLS_CHARACTERSET and NLS_NCHAR_CHARACTERSET is one of the following: {UTF-8 or UTF-16, or AL32UTF8 or ALI6UTF16, or not unicode}

4. If the character set is different, create a new Oracle instance with the correct character set.
