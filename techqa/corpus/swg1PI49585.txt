APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you have IBM Rational Developer z (RDz) V9.1, IBM Rational
   Team Concert (RTC) V5.0.1 and IBM Rational Software Architect
   (RSA) V9.1 installed in a shell-shared environment using
   floating licensing and you open RDz while there is a repository
   connection to RTC, a RSA license will be checked-out from the
   license server, even though RSA itself is not opened.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Install RSA, RDz, RTC into a shell shared environment
   
   2. Apply floating licenses
   
   3. Open RDz
   
   4. Establish a connection to RTC
   
   5. Close & reopen RDz
   
   6. Examine the "lmgrd.log" file to review the license check outs
   
   Expected Result: No license for RSA is checked out, as RSA was
   not opened.
   
   Actual Result: A license for RSA is checked out, despite not
   having opened RSA.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no workaround.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The license check is initiated while loading a few of the IBM
   Rational Software Architect (RSA) plugins. During RTC repository
   connection creation or reopen operations, these plugins are
   loaded, which resulted in RSA licenses to be checked out. Now,
   the license check behavior is adjusted such that the license
   checks will not be conducted at the start of these plugins so
   that there will not be any unnecessary checkout of RSA license
   during the RTC operations.
