APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Open button is disabled (greyed out) after one or more
   documents are added to the case.  This issue is only
   reproducible when the "Select the first document in the list by
   default" is selected/set via the Case Information widget.  The
   Open button is not disabled when "Select the first document in
   the list by default" is not selected/set.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Create a new solution (or use an existing solution)
   2. Open the Work Details Page, click on Edit Setting from the
   Case Information Widget
   3. Expand the Documents twistee, select/set "Select the first
   document in the list by default"
   4. For a new solution, create a case type, add a task, edit the
   task to add a role lane, and step
   5. Save and deploy the solution
   6. Create a new case
   7. Add a document to the case
   
   Expected behavior:
   Document is added to the case with the Open button enabled
   allowing the user to open the newly attached document
   
   Actual result:
   Document is added to the case, however the Open button is
   disabled thus user is not able to open the newly attached
   document
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  When there is only 1 document attached to the case, the user is
   required to either refresh the page, or close/reopen the item in
   order to enable the Open button.  When there are multiple
   documents attached to the case, the user can click on a
   different attached document to enable the Open button.

   * It is recommended to apply 5.2.1.5-ICM-FP005 or a later      *
   * release.                                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been corrected to enable the open button after a
   document is added to the case in 5.2.1.5-ICM-FP005 GA Release.
