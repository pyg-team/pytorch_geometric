   How to enable/disable secure option through properties.
   
   Problem description
   NSN wants to support https with confidential by default, for
   which no
   special work to be done on client machines.  As of now the UI is
   coming
   with both options selected (and this options are hidden by
   default, and
   all login attempts will fail), and we need to manually deselect
   the
   secure option to support confidential mode
   
   Is there are way to change these setting by default, either
   through
   properties of some other means, so that we can set those
   parameters as
   per our requirement?

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new property has been added to rseries.properties to resolve
   this issue i.e.
   
   WAS/confidentialOnly
   
   if this is set to true and WAS/protocol is set to https only the
   confidential flag will now be ticked in the UI. If it is set to
   false only the secure flag will be ticked with WAS/protocol set
   to https. If WAS/protocol is set to http the confidentialOnly
   flag wont be taken into consideration.
