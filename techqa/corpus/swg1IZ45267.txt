ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: Agent Builder 6.2.1 IF0001 and prior, running AIX
   systems with only a 64-bit TEMA
   
   
   Problem Description:
   - - - - - - - - - -
   Agent Builder log parsing does not return any data in the test
   dialog, on AIX systems with only a 64-bit TEMA install or no
   TEMA at all. The problem does not occur on Linux or Windows.
   
   It also works if the 32-bit TEMA libraries exist in
   /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/links/aix52/lib.
   
   There are 5 libraries (lib*32.a), which will not load from the
   temporary directory.  When it works,  these libs get loaded from
   /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/links/aix52/lib which is a link to a 32-bit
   TEMA, if you have one installed.
   
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   1. Create a Log File monitor agent.
   2. On the Data Sources tab, select the log file being monitored.
   3. Select the 'Test Log File Settings' button.
   4. In the Parse Log window,  select the Log file name Browse
   button for the log file to monitor.
   
   No data appears in the Parse Log Results portion of the
   window.

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Copy the 5 libraries (lib*32.a) from the
   <Builder_Install>/plugins/com.ibm.tivoli.montitoring.AgentGenera
   tor_6.2.1/lib/aix526
   directory to the  /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/links/aix52/lib
   
   2. Rename the lib*32.a libraries to lib*.a. (Removing the '32'
   notation.)
