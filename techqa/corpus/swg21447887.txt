PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive message CNX0106E Connect failed with error 'Forbidden'. This occurs when you are trying to establish a connection between your CICS Transaction Sever for z/OS (CICS TS) region and IBM CICS Explorer. You are specifying a connection type of "CICS management interface" for a single CICS region. 

CAUSE
You attempted to connect to a CICS region that is already a CICSPlex SM managed system (MAS). However, the connection type you selected, CICS Management Interface, is for a "stand-alone" CICS region, that is not being managed by CICSPlex SM. 

The Connection Type is documented under Configuring a system connection [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/explorer_configure_connection.html] in the CICS TS information center. However, it is not clear that the single CICS region must be a stand alone region.


 * If you are connecting to a CICS TS version 3 system, you must connect to a CICSPlexÂ® SM WUI server using the "
 * CICSPlex SM Data Interface
 * " read-only connection.
 * 
 * 
 * If you are connecting to a CICS version 4 or later system you can connect either to a CICSPlex SM WUI server using the "
 * CICSPlex SM Data Interface
 * " read-only connection, or, if you want update capability, you can use the 
 * CICS management client interface (CMCI)
 *  connection.
 * 
 * 
 * If you are connecting to a CICS TS for VSE/ESA 1.1.1 system, you can use the
 *  CICS management client interface (CMCI)
 *  read-only connection.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If your CICS region is managed by CPSM and is a MAS, then you should use the Explorer connection type, CICS Management Interface, with the appropriate location for the CPSM WUI ( Host name and port ). Refer to Setting up CMCI with CICSPlex SM [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_setupcpsm.html] in the CICS TS information center.

If your CICS region is not managed by CPSM and is "stand-alone" , use the Explorer connection type CICS Management Interface with the appropriate location for this CICS region ( Host name and port). Refer to Setting up CMCI in a stand-alone CICS region [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_setupcics.html] in the CICS TS information center.
