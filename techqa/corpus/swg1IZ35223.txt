APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Find in Network View" both from the Hop View and from
   Webtop may fail when using the Oracle database.  This is due to
   Oracle's inability to handle lists larger than 1000 elements.
   
   You may also find a similar issue when performing some other
   actions in the Topoviz and Monitor Config GUIs.  The action may
   fail to complete and the log file will contain an error message
   of the form "java.lang.RuntimeException: <ERROR MESSAGE>",
   followed by a stack trace containing the following:
   
   "Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01795: maximum number of
   expressions in a list is 1000"

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: ITNM users with an Oracle database.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The "Find in Network View" both from    *
   *                      the Hop View and from Webtop may fail   *
   *                      when using an Oracle database.  This is *
   *                      only likely to happen for networks with *
   *                      a large number of entities or views,    *
   *                      and is due to Oracle's inability to     *
   *                      handle lists larger than 1000 elements. *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The "Find in Network View" both from the Hop View and from
   Webtop may fail when using an Oracle database.  This is only
   likely to happen for networks with a large number of entities
   or views, and is due to Oracle's inability to handle lists
   larger than 1000 elements.
   
   You may also find a similar issue when performing some other
   actions in the Topoviz and Monitor Config GUIs.  The action may
   fail to complete and the log file will contain an error message
   of the form "java.lang.RuntimeException: <ERROR MESSAGE>",
   followed by a stack trace containing the following:
   
   "Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01795: maximum number of
   expressions in a list is 1000"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Statements that used to use the "IN" clause have been replaced
   with alternative statements that achieve the same result.  The
   limiting factor of list size has thus been removed.
