QUESTION
 What could cause the Dynamic Workload Console (DWC) plan tasks to hang and never return with either results or an error? 

ANSWER
The probable causes for DWC performance issues after the Master has been rebooted include: 

1. A failure to start WebSphere applications after the reboot 

 * 
 * 


2. A failure by WebSphere to connect to its datasource object  * 
 * 


b. Inspect WebSphere's logs for connection failures and for ThreadMonitor entries showing hangs.  

NOTE: It has been observed that if DB2 has the HADR feature enabled and a controlled start of DB2 and its HADR feature has not been performed then the Tivoli Workload Scheduler (TWS) database cannot accept connection attempts. The HADR startup procedure follows:

On the standby node:
db2 start hadr on db TWS as standby

On the primary node:
db2 start hadr on db TWS as primary

Confirm HADR's status:
db2pd -db TWS â€“hadr
- or -
db2 get snapshot for db on TWS"
