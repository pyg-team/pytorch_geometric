QUESTION
 What is the recommended approach to establish connections with different JDBC driver versions on the same database vendor through WebSphere Adapter for JDBC in an application? Note these specific database versions from the same database vendor may be the same or different. For example, both Oracle 9 and Oracle 11 JDBC driver versions coexists and are also used to connect to either Oracle 9i database or Oracle 11g in an application with a WebSphere Adapter for JDBC. 

ANSWER
There are two recommendations to use WebSphere Adapter for JDBC in above scenario. 

1. In WebSphere Process Server version 6.2 and prior version, you can not use different JDBC drivers in one application. You have to define an application by using "databaseURL" mode with embedded adapter to connect to one database such as Oracle 9i. And define the other application by using "databaseURL" mode with embedded adapter to connect to the other database such as Oracle 11g to use different JDBC driver. 

2. In WebSphere Process Server version 7.0 and later version, you can achieve the requirement in one application by using standalone adapter and two data sources with different database version (JDBC drivers). The property "Isolate this resource provider" of data source must be enabled when defining the JDBC providers. You can refer to the attached document to implement the solution.
