Microsoft describes Internet Explorer update KB912945 in the following article:

 * http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945


The update changes Internet Explorer behavior to require extra end user actions to use certain Java applets and ActiveX controls in Web pages. If these applets and controls are loaded directly in the page, user actions in them do not work until they are "activated" by an extra click or keystroke. The message to do that is temporary hover text which may be overlooked or not understood by the end user. 

The change affects a number of widely used products, including various IBM Lotus products, that surface content through Internet Explorer. The common symptom is to see messages "Click to activate and use this control" or "Press SPACEBAR or ENTER to activate and use this control" when the cursor is moved into the area of the Web page managed by the affected applets and controls. 

Microsoft has included update KB912945 in a recommended security update on April 11th, 2006. referenced as KB912812. Users may install it without realizing they have changed the behavior of their applications. Refer to "MS06-013: Cumulative security update for Internet Explorer" (KB912812) at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912812 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912812] 
Update KB912945 is a non-security update for Windows, and Microsoft has also released a patch that restores previous Internet Explorer behavior until the next cumulative security update in June, 2006. Refer to "Internet Explorer ActiveX compatibility patch for Mshtml.dll" at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917425 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917425]

The following options are available to avoid the impact on IBM Lotus products from Microsoft Internet Explorer Update KB912945 or KB912812:


 * Remove update KB912945, using the "Add/Remove Programs" option in the Windows Control Panel, remembering to check the "Show updates" box. 
 * Prevent application of optional update KB912945, if you have control over desktop software installations. 
 * After application of the April cumulative security update MS06-013 (KB912812), apply the Microsoft Compatibility Patch for Mshtml.dll to Internet Explorer (KB917425). 
 * Research and modify your own applications that may also be affected by the change to Internet Explorer. Details on how to rewrite your HTML to load the control or applet to be initially active are in the following Microsoft document:
