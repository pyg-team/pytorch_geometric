APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Case Manager Client creates a 550 event when user goes to
   the "add task" page.  On that page, the user has option to
   cancel out of that page.  If that is done, that means the 550
   event will have been created, but since the workflow was not
   actually launched (because of the Cancel), no corresponding
   165 (completion) event will have been created.
   This keeps vwlog from cleaning up the 550 event log records.
   
   Since the 165 event is never created for these items, the
   550 event items will remain in the system indefinitely.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually delete the 550 events from the
   database that are over a few days old.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Customers using 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-IF006 or 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002   *
   * and prior trying to prune PE logs records.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Case Manager Client creates a 550 event (advanced            *
   * reservation event) when a user goes to the "add task" page.  *
   * On that page, a user has option to cancel out of the task    *
   * later.  If that is done, the 550 event has been logged, and  *
   * since the workflow was not actually launched (because of the *
   * Cancel), no corresponding 165 (completion) event will be     *
   * logged.                                                      *
   *                                                              *
   * pelog was designed to allow clean up of log events           *
   * associated with a completed workflow (165 event) and as      *
   * such, events associated with  cancelled workflow will remain *
   * in the system indefinitely.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 or 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 and    *
   * higher                                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and 5.2.1.2-P8CPE-FP002 and higher.
   This problem was resolved by allowing pelog to clean up 'old'
   500 events. pelog will NOT delete 550 events that are within
   2hrs from the current time. 550 events are reservation events to
   ensure that NO duplicate reservations are made. These events can
   be safely deleted when the reservations are abandoned after 2
   hrs.
