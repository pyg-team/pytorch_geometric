   ****************************************************************
   When using node based ARFM and application edition roll-out that
   involves a hard-reset, group roll-out may result in subsequent
   application requests failing with a 503 from the ODR. Restarting
   the ODR corrects the issue so that application requests will
   once again be routed successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The On Demand Router (ODR) code was changed to ensure that the
   new application edition is used when managing and collecting
   node based ARFM statistics.  Prior to this change the node based
   ARFM objects were keeping a reference to the previous
   application edition which caused the ODR logic to incorrectly
   reference this old edition when attempting to route requests.
   Because the old edition had quiesced the servers it still
   thought the servers were unavailable for routing and this caused
   the ODR routing logic to return the 503s.  This code has been
   updated to remove references to the old edition from the node
   based ARFM objects which allows the routing logic to work with
   the new, correct edition and successfully route the request to
   available servers.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 8.5.5.10.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Do not use application edition roll-out that involves a hard-
   reset, group roll-out while using node based ARFM.  If the
   problem is encountered as a result of such an application
   edition roll-out then restart the On Demand Router to allow
   requests to flow normally again.
