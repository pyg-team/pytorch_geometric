PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Rational® Application Developer (RAD) version 7.0 readme and installation guide did not document the minimum JDK™/J2SE/JRE software requirements for installing over an existing Eclipse® 3.2.1+ instance till RAD v7.0.0.2. This technote, which applies to RAD and other IBM® Rational Software Delivery Platform (SDP) version 7.0 desktop products, provides that information and elaborates further on extending a supported version of an Eclipse instance. 

CAUSE
The RAD v7.0 software requirements did not document the minimum required JDK/J2SE/JRE version or release when installing over an existing Eclipse 3.2.1+ installation until RAD v7.0.0.2.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you install Rational Software Delivery Platform version 7.0 products, you can choose to extend an Eclipse v3.2.1+ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) already installed on your computer.

Note: RAD v9.1 is the last version to support Extending an existing Eclipse IDE [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRTLW_9.1.0/com.ibm.rad.install.doc/topics/c_plan_consider_eclipse.html]. It is strongly recommended to use the supported IBM Eclipse SDK that RAD installs with by default.
