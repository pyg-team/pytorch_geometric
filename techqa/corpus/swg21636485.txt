Title: IBM Configuring the Session timeout with CLM applications - United States

Text:
RTC; session timeout; WAS; CCM TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you configure the session timeout when deploying CLM Applications on WebSphere? 

CAUSE
Administrators prefer to have their users timed out after certain periods of time for security purposes.

ANSWER
The current session timeout is hardcoded into the application for 6 hours. Due to a defect APAR PM88221, the session timeout cannot be changed when deploying the applications on WebSphere. 


For more information on this defect, planned to be resolved in 4.0.4, see jazz.net Defect 263315: Excessive use of HttpServletRequest.getSession() causes expired sessions to be ignored render WAS session configuration useless [https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Jazz%20Foundation#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=263315]
