Title: IBM ING008I INGSTX SERVICE FAILED, RC=2 - REASON=N/A - United States

Text:
ING008I INGRAHCP ING096I KAHSITEM TIMEOUT INGSTX TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 INGRAHCP: ING096I KAHSITEM: Netview RC 3 from: INGRSTX0 QUERY * SCOPE=SYSPLEX WAIT=YES 

SYMPTOM
After the PAM switched, noticed a flood of ING008I message in the netlog and a flood of ING096I messages in the RKLVLOG for CANSAH.


CAUSE
Investigation showed that this issue was caused by removing the following statement from the POSTSTART command for CANSAH: 

INGSTX SET PROD STITRTXT=PROD STIDESCR=PROD

this resulted in a QUERY not finding any status items in the repository


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The system was shutdown and the PAM switch explain the following messages around that time: 

ING008I INGSTX SERVICE FAILED, RC=3 - REASON=N/A 
INGRAHCP: ING096I KAHSITEM: Netview RC 3 from: INGRSTX0 QUERY * 
SCOPE=SYSPLEX WAIT=YES 
ING008I INGSTX SERVICE FAILED, RC=3 - REASON=N/A 
INGRAHCP: ING096I KAHSITEM: TIMEOUT occurred in call to AM, Reason: 
ING008I RC=2 

A RC=3 for INGSTX means: 
The request could not be processed successfully by the automation
manager. And obviously, INGRAHCP (the TEP Command Processor which 
handles the TEP data collection request) didn't get a response from 
the AM for the KAHSITEM (KAH_STATUS_ITEMS) queries. These are basically
calls to 'INGSTX QUERY * SCOPE=SYSPLEX WAIT=YES'. 

But after that, they received truck loads of these messages 
ING008I INGSTX SERVICE FAILED, RC=2 - REASON=N/A 

Obviously, as response to 'INGSTX QUERY * SCOPE=SYSPLEX WAIT=YES' 
calls. RC=2 means, Function QUERY was specified but no status item was 
found in the status item repository that matches the given namespec. 

The AM takeover was successful.
The way they issued the INGSTX command prior to removing it, prevented the status items from being stored in the repository.

PERSISTENT 
A status item can be defined as persistent to live across SA z/OS 
sessions or IPLs. Non-persistent status items are implicitly removed
from the status item repository in the SA z/OS automation manager 
upon disconnecting a system from the sysplex XCF group. 
PERSISTENT=NO - Status item is non-persistent. This is the default. 
PERSISTENT=YES - Status item is persistent. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Investigation showed that this issue was caused by removing the following statement from the POSTSTART command for CANSAH: 


INGSTX SET PROD STITRTXT=PROD STIDESCR=PROD
