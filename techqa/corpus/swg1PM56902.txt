PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The
   following Version 6.1 modifications will be available in the
   March, 2012 update to the Information Centers. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The following Version 6.1 issues will be addressed:
   
   ID: PM56902
   Problem: The descriptions of the com.ibm.websphere.security
   ldap.retryBind and
   com.ibm.websphere.security.registry.ldap.singleLDAP properties
   in the information center are incomplete.
   Resolution: The following information will be added to the
   topics " Updating LDAP binding information" and "Security
   failover among multiple LDAP servers":
   
   When LDAP failover is configured by associating a single
   hostname to multiple IP addresses, entering an invalid
   password can cause multiple LDAP bind retries. With the
   default settings, the number of LDAP bind retries is equal to
   one more than the number of associated IP addresses. This
   means a single invalid login attempt can cause
   the LDAP account to be locked. If the
   com.ibm.websphere.security.registry.ldap.singleLDAP custom
   property is set to false, LDAP bind calls are not retried.
   
   When LDAP failover is configured by registering backend LDAP
   server  hostnames using wsadmin command, set the
   com.ibm.websphere.security.ldap.retryBind property to false.
   
   This information will also be added to the same topics in the
   Version 7.0 and 8.0 Information Centers.
   
   ----------
   ID: 729181
   
   Problem:
   A server might not start correctly after you run the
   osgiCfgInit script.
   
   Resolution:
   Running the osgiCfginit script clears the cache, and if the
   server is running when you run the script, there can be
   problems when the server tries to read or update the cache. To
   avoid these problems, stop the server before
   you run this script.
   
   The "osgiCfgInit script" topic in the WebSphere Application
   Server Version 6.1 Information Center will be updated. The
   following note will be added:
   
   Avoid trouble: Before you run the osgiCfgInit script, stop the
   server on which the script will be run. If you run this script
   on a server that is active, the server might have problems
   trying to read or update the cache after the script is finished.
   
   This update will also be applied to the Information Centers for
   Version 7.0 and Version 8.0.
