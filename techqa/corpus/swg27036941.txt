Version: 8.0.1
The SystemOut.log file might contain database errors and warnings when, after the server has started for the first time, the first user logs on.



IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) database deadlocks can result in failed business process definition instances (1571422)
Versions: 8.0, 7.5.1
In IBM Business Process Manager, you might experience database deadlocks with business process definition (BPD) processes. These deadlocks result in failed process instances.

Versions: 8.0, 7.5.1, 7.5
When starting a server, the system inserts the LSW_EM_INSTANCE row to register an event manager instance. In a clustered environment, more than one cluster member attempts to create a row with this name, which causes a violation of the database unique constraint named LSWC_EM_INST_UQ.



When using IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) with Microsoft SQLServer, deadlocks can occur if process applications, toolkits, and tracks are created concurrently (1593430) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593430&acss=dakc]
