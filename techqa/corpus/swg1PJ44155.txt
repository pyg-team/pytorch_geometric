APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Long strings with no spaces do not wrap in textarea controls
   inside multiple column layout on Microsoft Internet Explorer 11
   (MSIE11).  The text continues on horizontally and a horizontal
   scrollbar appears to allow the whole value to be seen.  But this
   is not the correct behavior, as seen in Firefox and Chrome,
   where the value wraps.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no workaround for this issue in MSIE11.  So the only
   workaround is to use a different supported browser type such as
   Firefox or Chrome.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.5-ICM-FP005 and higher.  This fix also requires
   2.0.3.8-ICN-FP008. The fix for this problem is provided in and
   resolved by IBM Case Manager 5.2.1.5-ICM-FP005 or later
   releases.
   
   With this fix, Case Manager Client users using long strings with
   no spaces inside textarea controls inside multiple column layout
   on Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 (MSIE11) will see the text
