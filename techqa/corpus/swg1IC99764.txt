APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ V7.5 ships with a component called Advanced Message
   Security (AMS).
   
   Typically the originator of the message will encrypt it as the
   signer and for particular recipient(s) to receive. There is also
   a feature called Message Channel Agent (MCA) Interception, which
   allows for the message encryption of messages sent by remote
   clients to take place at the QMgr. The encryption takes place
   within the SVRCONN channel program that serves the client.
   
   The steps needed to completely configure MCA Interception are
   missing some key points.

   An example configuration is described, specifically including:
   
   1. How to setup the security policy on for the protected
   queue(s)
   2. How to ensure client side AMS is disabled, which is a
   pre-requisite for the MCA Interception feature to work.
