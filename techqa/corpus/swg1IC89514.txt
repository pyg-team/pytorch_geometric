LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   User using XMS application in managed connection mode having
   installed only Java and Dot NET messaging and web services and
   without windows client
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   MQ incorrectly loads the managed common services even if Windows
   client is not installed. Hence the customer experienced
   targetinvocationexception while running the XMS sample
   application without windows client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is modified such that XMS common services are loaded
   if XMS is in use instead of MQ Managed common services.
