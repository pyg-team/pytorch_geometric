ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Reproduced locally using the following scenario:

   2 Logon as SYSADMIN
   3 Add a bookmark to the resulting page to IE favorites
   4 Exit browser
   5 Restart browser and select bookmark

   default

   Analysis shows that a message can be presented that will make it
   easier to diagnose this problem should it happen to others.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem happened because the customer had added a bookmark
   "Favorites" to the IE browser to start the Portal browser
   session.  The bookmark contained the full path to the current
   screen,  like the following:
   http://srvmon:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/cnp.html?-12000=SYSADMIN&-5001=
   MOPHYSICAL&-1021A=REPORT&-1020=db2prod:acsdbp1.ncfb.org@zkud.KUD [http://srvmon:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/cnp.html?-12000=SYSADMIN&-5001=MOPHYSICAL&-1021A=REPORT&-1020=db2prod:acsdbp1.ncfb.org@zkud.KUD]
   DB2APPLGROUP00&-2400=p@db2prod:acsdbp1.ncfb.org&-10105=1055ea5c7
   57&-1022=Application%20SQL%20Statement%20Text%20w%20Agent%20ID
   
   In the bookmark, it sets SYSADMIN and PHYSICAL as the user and
   the Navigator view.
   Change the bookmark to just be:
   http://srvmon:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/cnp.html and when the signon
   screen comes up, it will then drive the browser to the default
   Navigator view with the current userid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a user uses a saved bookmark in the Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal browser
       client to navigate to a specific view that does not contain
   the user's
       default navigator, the client session will fail to
   initialize.

 *  The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance
   vehicle(s): interim fix pack 1.9.6-TIV-MgtPortal-IF0004
