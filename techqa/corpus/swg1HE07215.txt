APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment -
   Windows XP
   SmarTeam - MS Office Integration
   PDF Complete Installed
   with PLM DB
   Scenario -
   1. Launch MS Word. Do Login to SmarTeam.
   2. Exit from Word.
   3. Check the Normal.dot file. ("%USERPROFILE%\Application
   Data\Microsoft\Templates")
   Current Result - Normal.dot File size is getting increased.
   It increased upto the level so that Word Application Crashes.
   Expected - Normal.dot file size should not increase and Word
   application will not crash.
   Following are my observations ?
   1.It is not occurring with MS Word in my environment. But it
   can occur I read the Microsoft Support document for this. You
   can see my MS Word related video.
   2.It is occurring with MS Outlook at my end. I observed 2
   things in it ?
   a.When I start Outlook, it creates a new $Normal.dot file in
   Templates folder.
   b.When I exit, SmarTeam.exe doesn?t stop. So I re-start the
   Outlook, this time it doesn?t ask me for login. While exiting
   from Outlook my SmarTeam.exe stops. This time the file size
   increases. You can see my Video for Outlook.
   As per my understanding about this behavior, it is not the
   SmarTeam bug but it is MS Office behavior with third party
   integration.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
       I-PLM Collaborative Innovation VERSION V5R19.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   I-PLM Collaborative Innovation VERSION V5R21 SP2.
   Additional Closure Information:
   It is not reproducible with Word Integration.
   Officially SmarTeam doesn't support Outlook Integration.
   This problem occurs when SmarTeam.exe is not closed properly
   by the user. If the SmarTeam.exe is closed properly then such
   issue doesn't occur.
