IMF50 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you uninstall and reinstall IBM Worklight, the Worklight Console and the Application Center display the contents that you had before the uninstall process. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To clear the Worklight Console and Application Center, you must delete the database contents between the uninstall and the reinstall processes for IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation. Complete the following steps: 

 1. On the file system, remove the Derby databases that are used by IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation. These databases are in the following directories:
    
     * UNIX-based operating systems: /opt/ibm/Worklight/derby/
       
       
     * Microsoft Windows 7 operating system: C:\ProgramData\IBM\Worklight\derby\
       
       
     * Microsoft Windows XP operating system: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\Worklight\derby\
       
       
    
    
 2. If you have chosen a database type other than Derby for IBM Worklight or IBM Mobile Foundation, erase the contents of the database instances WRKLGHT and WLREPORT.
