Title: IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) Eclipse Help Server (EHS) will not start - United States

Text:
EHS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ITM Eclipse Help Server component will not start by itself or when starting the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server 

SYMPTOM
When starting the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, the Eclipse Help Server (EHS) is started at the same time automatically. If the EHS cannot be started you will see an error pop up stating that it could not be started and to look at the event log. 

Also, if you right click the Eclipse Help Server in the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) GUI and select start, it will not start.


CAUSE
The EHS by default uses port 9999. If port 9999 is in use by any other process then the EHS will not start and any attempt to try to start it will display an error saying it cannot be started.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If the EHS cannot be started, check to see if any other processes are using port 9999: 

On Windows: 

a) Bring up a command prompt 

b) Run the following command: 

netstat -an | findstr 9999 

c) If this returns a line then it means that something is using port 9999 

d) To see what is using port 9999 you can use this command: 

netstat -abon > netstat.out 

Then check the netstat.out file to see what program is using port 9999. 

 

On UNIX: 

a) Run the following command: 

netstat -an | grep 9999 

b) If this returns a line then it means that something is using port 9999 

c) To see what is using port 9999 you can use this command: 

netstat -pvan > netstat.out 

Then check the netstat.out file to see what program is using port 9999. 

 

Additionally you can check if the help server is already running which could possibly cause it to try to start twice. 

On Windows: 

Check for the process kkfhelpsvr.exe 

Click Start -> Click Run -> type in taskmgr and hit the Enter key 

Click the processes tab and look for the process kkfhelpsvr.exe 

If it is running, highlight it and click "End Process" 

 

On UNIX: 

Run the command: 

ps -ef | grep kf 

And look for an entry similar to this:
root 31601 31587 0 2012 ? 00:00:05 /opt/IBM/ITM/li6263/iw/java/jre/bin/java -Dserver_port=9999 -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -nosplash -application org.eclipse.help.base.infocenterApplication -data /opt/IBM/ITM/li6263/kf/eclipse/workspace -plugincustomization plugins/com.ibm.fw.doc/plugin_customization.in

If it is running then do a kill on the Process ID, in the case above it is 31601
kill -9 31601


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem you can either change the port that EHS uses, or kill the process that is using port 9999 and then start the help server. 

To change the port that EHS uses: 

Right click the Eclipse Help Server in the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) GUI and select Reconfigure, then change the port to something other than 9999.
