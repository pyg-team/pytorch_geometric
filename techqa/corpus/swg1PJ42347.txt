ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With 5.1.0.3-P8CPE-FP003, Audit Events are being captured for
   the "GetContent" event irrespective of the Filter Expression
   value . Tracing has shown that when the filter expressions are
   working correctly, there are entries like these:
   
   2014-06-12T15:08:18.200Z 08710871 EVNT FNRCE0000D - DEBUG
   Handling filter, property is null, expression is : kenString='1'
   2014-06-12T15:08:18.200Z 08710871 EVNT FNRCE0000D - DEBUG
   Skipping filtered expression: kenString='1'
   
   While testing by auditing the "Checkin" and "Get Content"
   events.  The "Checkin" event would correctly use the filter and
   the above entries would be shown, but no such entry exists for
   "Get Content" event.
