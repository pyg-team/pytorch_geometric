     Note: If space in the /tmp directory is limited, copy the fix pack to another location that has sufficient space. 
     
     
 5.  To create the /updates directory, type the following command: mkdir -p /updates
     
     
 6.  Change to the directory where you copied the patch file. For example, cd /tmp
