ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SMARTEAM INVENTOR INTEGRATION: Properties Not Mapped
   Correctly
   
   Scenario:
   1. MappingTest.gdb, create BDE alias, set as default DB
   connection using DB connection manager.
   2. Open Inventor 6, log in to SmarTeam as 'Joe' and navigate
   to SmartInventor->Tools->Property Management.  'Drawing
   Properties' and 'Revision' are the only default mapping
   groups that are created.
   However, on page A-6 of the Inventor integration documents
   their property structure, are automatically written to the
   SMARTEAM database. The System Administrator can now use the
   Integration Tools Setup utility to map these properties
   direct to attributes in the Profile Card."  I'm not sure why
   there are not created but I will create them manually for
   this example.
   3. Create and save an Inventor part to test the default
   functionality.
   Create a new part and save locally.  Save the part to
   SmarTeam.  An individual profile card appears and I can
   modify the information.
   Click "OK" and the part is saved.  There is no problem with
   this.
   4. Now create mapping attribute for the Inventor Part
   Description field.  Open Integration Tools Setup and
   navigate to the Inventor section.  Under "Mapping Group
   Types" create a "File Properties" type.
   Open the groups tree and create groups for "Custom,"
   "Project," "Status," and "Summary."  Add a new mapping
   property under the "Project" category and call it
   "Description."  This corresponds to the iProperties
   "Project" tab and the field labeled "Description."  Add
   a mapping attribute to the Description and map it to
   Inventor Part and the field Description.  We now have the
   Description of the Inventor part mapped to the SmarTeam
   Inventor part class and the description attribute.
   5. Create a new Inventor part, add a description to the
   Project tab, and save locally.  Then save to SmarTeam.  The
   part should save correctly and the field should be mapped.
   6a. Now create a new assembly and then create a new part in
   that assembly.  Be sure to fill in a description for the
   part as you did in step 5.  Save the assembly to SmarTeam.
   This is where the odd behavior occurs.  when I save the
   assembly a profile card for the Inventor part comes up,
   however the description is not mapped.  There are two
   options now.  I can hit cancel or hit OK.  If I hit OK
   the part is saved to SmarTeam and the description is filled
   in with the part number (which is the file name).  SmarTeam
   then asks me where to save my assembly so I pick a project.
   The assembly profile card appears and I hit OK.  Now the
   assembly and part are saved into SmarTeam but the mapping
   was ignored.
   6b. I add a new part to the assembly and save to SmarTeam
   again.  This time when the first profile card appears
   without the mapping I hit Cancel.  Another profile card for
   the new part appears and also does not have the mapping.  I
   hit cancel again.  Now a profile card appears for the part
   but the description is filled in with the file name again.
   BUT it is the file name of the part that was already saved
   (so now the file name and description do not match).  If I
   hit cancel then the part is saved but again with the wrong
   description.
   6c. Now I will create a new assembly and create a new part
   in that assembly.  Again, add a description to the part so
   we can see if the mapping is working correctly.  Now do a
   SmarTeam save.  A profile card appears but there is no
   description mapping. I hit cancel. SmarTeam asks me where I
   want to save the assembly.  I pick a project and hit Save.
   The assy profile card appears and I hit OK.  Another Inv
   Part profile card appears again without the description
   mapped.  I hit cancel again.  And now a third Inventor Part
   profile card appears and the mapping is correct.  I will hit
   OK this time.  The assembly and part are now save correctly.
   7. I have also tried mapping other properties and have
   experienced similar results.  I mapped the Inventor title
   property to the Inventor Drawing class description and
   noticed that the assembly title was mapped to the assembly
   description when I did a SmarTeam save.
   Also, if you go through a couple of examples you will see
   that there are problems with the mapping.
   8. Since the mapping appeard to work when I save the parts
   individually I also tried this approach.  The parts are
   saved fine but when I try to save the assembly SmarTeam
   wants to recognize the parts as new objects. So this
   approach is not an option.
