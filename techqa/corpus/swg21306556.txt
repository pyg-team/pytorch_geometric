QUESTION
You double- click setup.msi to install Lotus® Sametime® and the following error displays during the InstallShield Wizard process:

The wizard was interrupted before IBM Lotus Sametime 8.0 could be completely installed. Your system has not been modified. To complete the installation at another time, please run setup again.

ANSWER
While the provided .MSI version of the Sametime 8.0 client installer can be double-clicked to launch an interactive install, this is not the recommended method for performing an end-user interactive installation. In particular, the MSI version is not ideal for interactive non-English installations. The primary intent of the MSI version is for use in silent or automated deployments. 

The provided .EXE version is recommended for end-user interactive install. The EXE version wraps the MSI in an executable which provides a language-selection dialog box.
