QUESTION
 When you already have an account in windows called "ABC" and in Linux called "abc". You think the account should match in LSF because windows account is case insensitive. However, the job will fail after SBD try to match the account because Linux is case sensitive. How to resolve this issue? 

ANSWER
 

Add "LSF_ACCOUNT_MAP=lower" as windows environment valuable will resolve the issue. 

 

Here is the detail steps.
-1) add "LSF_ACCOUNT_MAP=lower" in environment (Windows system variable, see screen below) at Windows client side.

In Windows, open "start" -> search "environment" -> click "Edit environment variables for your account" -> add " LSF_ACCOUNT_MAP=lower"

This is one time setting and not in user profile. Admin could set this environment
variable in global policy and affect every account. In the other words,
Network Admin could create the policy script which could be deployed
on all windows hosts at once.
