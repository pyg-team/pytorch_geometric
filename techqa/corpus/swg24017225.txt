ABSTRACT
 WebSphere Message Broker – Job Execution Node 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
You might need to invoke operating system commands, windows batch files, or Unix shell scripts (henceforth referred to as jobs) from within the message flow. You might also want to schedule jobs at a specific time/interval/frequency.


The JobExecutionNode, a Java-based plugin, allows you to execute operating system commands, and invoke jobs in the form of batch/shell scripts from within the message flow. The jobs can be specified on the node property or as a part of the input message. 

Possible Uses 

 * You can execute operating system commands, and invoke jobs in the form of batch/shell scripts from within the message flow. 
 * You can schedule the tasks at a specific time (using Timer nodes) and execute them from the Message flows. 
 * You can enrich the message by using the result/output of the job execution.
