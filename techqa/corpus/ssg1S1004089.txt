Title: IBM Some Errors Will No Longer Automatically Raise A PMR - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error conditions which do not require IBM support to resolve the problem will no longer automatically raise a PMR when they occur. The events which have been excluded from call home are problems that exist in the customer environment rather than a problem with the product itself.

This affects SAN Volume Controller, Storwize V7000 and Storwize V7000 Unified block systems 

SYMPTOM
This is the list of event IDs which will no longer automatically raise a PMR as of May 2012 

Event ID Event ID Description Error Code 010011 Remote Port excluded for a specific Managed Disk and Node 1220 010013 Login Excluded 1230 010033 Controller configuration has unsupported RDAC mode 1624 010040 A disk controller is only accessible from a single node port 1627 010041 A disk controller is only accessible through a single port on the disk controller 1627 010042 Only a single port on a disk controller is accessible from every node in the cluster 1627 010043 A disk controller is accessible through only half its previously configured ports 1627 010044 A disk controller is not accessible from a node 1627 010060 Solid state drive exceeded warning temperature threshold 1217 010061 Solid state drive exceeded offline temperature threshold 1218 010094 Login Excluded 1231 070588 2145 UPS-1U is not cabled correctly 1151 070589 2145 UPS-1U ambient temperature limit exceeded 1136 070724 Fewer ethernet ports operational 1400 071724 Fewer ethernet ports operational 1401 076403 Power Supply Unit - no a/c 1097 076514 SAS controller requires PCI card bus reset 1034 077011 Node Service Processor indicated Ambient Temperature Threshold exceeded 1075 077012 Node Service Processor indicated Temperature Warning Threshold exceeded 1076 077013 Node Service Processor indicated Soft or Hard Shutdown Temperature Threshold exceeded 1077 077111 Node Service Processor indicated Ambient Temperature Threshold exceeded 1094 077112 Node Service Processor indicated System Processor temperature warning 1093 077113 Node Service Processor indicated Soft or Hard Shutdown Temperature Threshold exceeded 1092 077161 Node ambient temperature threshold exceeded 1094 077162 Node Processor temperature warning 1093 077163 Node Processor or ambient critical Temperature Threshold exceeded 1092 077165 Node ambient temperature threshold exceeded 1094 077166 Node Processor temperature warning 1093 077167 Node Processor or ambient critical Temperature Threshold exceeded 1092 077185 Node ambient temperature threshold exceeded 1094 078001 Power Domain error. Both nodes in the I/O group are powered by the same UPS 1155 081001 Failure to bring up Ethernet interface 1400 081002 Failure to bring up Ethernet interface 1401 082001 Software Service error 2100 083009 The UPS detected an input power fault 1140 083010 UPS Configuration error (Cabling error) 1150 083011 UPS Ambient temperature threshold exceeded 1135 083012 UPS Ambient temperature high 3000 083109 The UPS detected an input power fault 1141 083110 UPS Configuration error (Cabling error) 1151 083111 UPS Ambient temperature threshold exceeded 1136 083112 UPS Ambient temperature high 3001  

As part of this change, some call home events will now create Software PMRs instead of Hardware PMRs to allow call homes to be processed more efficiently. 


The relevant changes have now been made to the product publications as of Jun 13
