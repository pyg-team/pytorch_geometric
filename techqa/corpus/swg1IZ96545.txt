APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During startup, the portal server is observed to use high CPU,
   and memory usage increases continuously until all available
   memory is consumed.  The portal server then crashes.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   
   1) Create a managed system list with the same name as an
   existing
   managed system.
   2) Add the managed system to the new MSL with the same name.
   3) Try to start TEPS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the tacmd CLI to delete the MSL that has the same name as a
   managed  system and contains that managed system.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The portal server crashes with out of memory and high cpu at
   startup or while in the situation editor due to the use of a
   duplicate name for a managed system list and a managed system.
   
   It is expected that a managed system name and managed system
   list name will be unique in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring
   environment. This is enforced in the portal client, but not in
   tacmd. Since the portal server did not check that the invalid
   condition had occurred, it would allow a circular reference
   which caused the loop.
   
   In testing, it was found that if a situation was not associated
   to a windows agent, that the loop did not occur immediately at
   startup, but it could happen when the situation editor was
   brought up from a Windows agent navigator node and then
   selecting situations eligible for association.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The portal server now checks when a managed system list is
   created and will not allow a duplicate managed system list to be
   incorporated into the portal server and will generate an error
   message when that occurs.
   
   The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Delete the managed system list of the same name as an existing
   managed system.
