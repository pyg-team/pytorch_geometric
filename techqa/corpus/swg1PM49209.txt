   See the Problem Conclusion section for a description of the
   issues, which are described in customer PMRs, and the
   documentation change or changes that will address these issues.
   Problem Conclusion: Note: We update our information centers
   monthly. The following
   Version 7.0 modifications will be available in September,
   2011 update to the Information Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   The following Version 7.0 issues continue the problem
   descriptions documented in APAR PM47070 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM47070] for WebSphere
   Application Server Version 7.0:
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ID: 716550
   
   Problem: When using the administrative console to configure
   SPNEGO web authentication, you only need to specify the
   "LTPA" option and not the "LTPA and Kerberos" option on the
   administrative console.   Also, after a realm change in
   federated repositories, the administrative console
   administrative users and group need to re-map existing
   user/role assignments using the configuration panel of the
   administrative console.  The WebSphere Application Server
   information center Version 7 does not describe this process.
   Mistakes in configuring SPNEGO web authentication can result.
   
   
   Resolution: Topic,  &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;SPNEGO troubleshooting tips &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189; is
   adding a new section,  &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172; &#147;Correcting realm change issues and
   subsequent SPNEGO logon failures &#162;&#226;&#130;&#172;  &#189;, which reads as follows
   
   Correcting realm change issues and subsequent SPNEGO logon
   failures In a SPNEGO web authentication environment in which a
   realm change is to occur, errors can occur in making the realm
   change, which then can lead to subsequent SPNEGO logon
   failures. Here are the steps to correct these errors.
   
   Realm Change: The realm can consist of identities in the
   file-based repository that is built into the system, in one or
   more external repositories, or in both the built-in,
   file-based repository and one or more external repositories.
   You can change realms in a SPNEGO environment by changing the
   name as follows:
   1. In the administrative console, click Security > Global
   security > Kerberos configuration > SPNEGO Web authentication
   and uncheck the Enable SPNEGO checkbox.
   2 .In the administrative console, click Security > Global
   security.
   3. Under User account repository, select Federated
   repositories from the Available realm definitions field and
   click Configure.
   4. When you finish adding or updating your federated
   repository configuration, go to the Security > Global security
   panel and click Apply to validate the changes.
   5. If you have removed a user/role identity and want it to
   function successfully under the new realm, you must add it
   back to the new realm after the realm name change.
   6. Restart the deployment manager to ensure that these the
   user/role identity can function under the new realm.
   SPNEGO Web authentication: To ensure that the user/role
   changes can successfully logon under this new realm, perform
   the following:
   1 .Ensure that the application server is running.
   2 .In the administrative console, click Security > Global
   security
   3. Under Authentication, highlight the radio button for LTPA.
   Note: The Kerberos and LTPA option is not be selectable unless
   you have configured Kerberos prior to this step. For SPNEGO,
   you ONLY need to use the LTPA option.
   4. Click Apply. Users under the new realm can now SPNEGO logon.
   
   This same information will be added to the Version 8
   Information Center.
