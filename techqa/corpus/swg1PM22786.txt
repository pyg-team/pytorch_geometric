   TEXT READS:
   Preparing the user populations for your virtual portals
   If you plan to use realms for your virtual portals, you need to
   configure Virtual Member Manager and the realms before creating
   your virtual portals. Each realm must specify the repository
   nodes (base entries) that belong to the user population
   represented by this realm.
   In addition to the realms that you create to define the user
   populations of the individual virtual portals, you must create a
   super realm. This super realm spans all other realms and
   contains all the users of those other realms; it is also known
   as the default realm.
   By default WebSphere Portal is configured with Federated
   Repositories as User Registry provider. By default only the
   super realm, or default realm, is configured. After you have
   configured your portal instance against your user backend
   repositories you can use tasks provided by the portal to
   configure the realms that the Virtual Member Manager provides.
   For the task that describes how to add a realm and modify the
   base entries or nodes inside that realm refer to the topics
   about adding realm support.

   While the realm for the base portal installation can be
   reconfigured to a non-default realm, such a configuration should
   be avoided if Web Content Management (WCM) is being used due to
   WCM's lack of virtual portal awareness.  For the task that
   describes how to add a realm and modify the base entries or
   nodes inside that realm refer to the topics about adding realm
   support.
