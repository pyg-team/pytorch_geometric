ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When submitting a job using WebSphere Compute Grid, the
   following exception is logged:
   
   Error: SQLCODE=-302, SQLSTATE=22001, SQLERRMC=null,
   DRIVER=3.58.81
   Login failure during job submission: java.lang.RuntimeException:
   JobSchedulerMDB.SecureSubmitter: caught exception
   com.ibm.websphere.
   longrun.JobSubmissionException: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-302,
   SQLSTATE=22001, SQLERRMC=null, DRIVER=3.58.81
   DEBUG: JobMessenger: error= Login failure during job submission:
   java.
   lang.RuntimeException: JobSchedulerMDB.SecureSubmitter: caught
   exception com.ibm.websphere.longrun.JobSubmissionException: DB2
   SQL
   Error: SQLCODE=-302, SQLSTATE=22001, SQLERRMC=null,
   DRIVER=3.58.81
   
   The cause is that when attempting to add a character into
   the LRSCHED database that is created using codeset UTF-8 and the
   character is outside the standard ascii set.  These
   characters end up occupying two character spaces.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Until this fix is applied, We recommend increasing the size of
   the "TXT" column in the XJCLREPOSITORY table from 250 to 300 as
   a resolution.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere Compute Grid 6.1     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: SQL Exception occurs when submitting    *
   *                      a job whose xJCL contains characters    *
   *                      outside of the standard ascii set.      *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the LRSCHED database is created using codeset UTF-8, and
   an insert is performed using characters outside of the
   standard ascii set, those characters end up occupying two
   characters spaces.  This causes the actual insert to be
   larger than the specified column size, resulting in the
   failure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An update has been made to the DDL which generates the tables
   for the LRSCHED database.  The column sizes have been increased
   for those columns that can potentially hold characters of the
   aforementioned type.
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   WebSphere Compute Grid fixpack 6.1.1.5.  Please refer to the
