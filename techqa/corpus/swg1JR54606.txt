APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After you apply an IBM Business Process Manager fix pack and
   then log in to the Process Admin Console, you might see an ?IBM
   BPM Error? error message with the text ?500 The call failed on
   the server; see server log for details.? or the Process Admin
   Console will show a blank page.
   
   The server log shows a
   com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.SerializationException message,
   like the following exception:
   [10/16/15 17:20:34:444 CST] 00000178 webapp        I
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp log SRVE0296E:

LOCAL FIX
 *  Clear the cache of your browser and reload the Process Admin
   Console.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Process Admin Console uses remote procedure calls (RPC) to
   communicate with the IBM BPM server. To ensure that the client
   part and the server part of the Process Admin Console are at the
   same level, a unique version number is transmitted when remote
   procedures are called, as part of the call. If the version
   number on the server differs from version number of the incoming
   procedure call, the server denies this call and issues the
   com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.SerializationException message.
   
   When the fix pack was installed, the server part of the Process
   Admin Console and version numbers were changed. Because the
   Process Admin Console used a wrong caching algorithm, the
   browser is not aware of this change and uses the old version
   numbers, leading to the mismatch and the exception message.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that corrects the caching algorithm so that changes done
   to the RPC server parts and version numbers are immediately
   visible to the browser is planned
   - to be included in a future fix pack for IBM BPM V8.5.0
   - to be included in an IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 cumulative fix
   
   To determine whether the fix pack is available and download it
   if it is, on Fix Central select IBM Business Process Manager
   with your edition from the product selector, the installed
   version to the fix pack level, and your platform, and then click
   Continue.
