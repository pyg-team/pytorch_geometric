QUESTION
 How do you rename a dbset/connection using a Linux® or UNIX® version of IBM® Rational® ClearQuest®? 

ANSWER
There is no rename option available in the Linux or UNIX based versions of ClearQuest when using the command cqreg. To workaround this, you can add a new dbset with a new name and same database information, and then drop the old dbset. This can be done using the cqreg options of add_dbset and drop_dbset. For more information regarding this commands, refer to technote 1320850 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=988&uid=swg21320850]. 




Starting with version 7.0.0, ClearQuest uses an Eclipse RCP client. This client allows for the creation and managing of database connections with a GUI interface, which is a more flexible and easy to use method than using cqreg. This screen can be accessed through via File --> Database --> Manage Connections. 

This client is launched by running ./clearquest in opt/rational/clearquest/bin, the default installation directory.
