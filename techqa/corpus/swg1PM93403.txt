APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the TEP for Web Applications workspace/view there is a
   request count
   attribute/column.  When the customer executes some test soap
   requests we
   sees a count of 5. Then customer goes to the MS/VE and views the
   group
   activity and is looking at the # of Requests and the value
   doesn't match
   what he sees in the TEP.  And the total # of requests last hour
   is small.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * Potentially all ITCAM users who use the Managing server
   * to monitor their applications.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * When the publish server component of the managing server
   * disconnects from the ITCAM Data Collector, a few monitoring
   * events that were in the process of transmission used to be
   * discarded.  This caused some missed events when monitoring
   * individual transactions.
   *
   * This was done by design, as normally in a production
   * environment a very small number of dropped transaction
   * will not have a considerable effect on hundreds of
   * transactions during the infrequent cases of socket
   * connection drops.  However, when only a few transactions are
   * being monitored, this will be noticed.  A small penalty was
   * being avoided to buffer these events with this design.
   *

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR optimzes the storage penalty and sends them when
   the Data Collector reconnects back to the Managing server.
