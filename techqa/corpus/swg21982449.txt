QUESTION
 I would like to perform a upgrade on my Netezza Appliance. How long does it normally take to complete? 

ANSWER
If the system meets the minimum HPF and FDT requirements for the desired NPS release, then we can perform an NPS only upgrade which takes approximately 1 hour to complete. If it does not meet the minimum requirements for that release of NPS then we will have to perform a full upgrade(NPS, HPF, FDT) which takes roughly 8 -12 hours to complete. 
On average a 8 hours outage window is needed.. Systems with 48 SPUs or higher, an outage window of at least 12 hours is required.

The rough time estimates on these are

The time frame provided above are approximates based on a typical upgrade. There is no guarantee that the upgrade will not take longer than anticipated. If any components fail or firmware upgrades do not take, the support engineer needs to perform active troubleshooting which includes restarts and this adds time to upgrade and hence the outage.
