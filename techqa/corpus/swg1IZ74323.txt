ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:   TPM 7.1.1 IF00002 on AIX 5.3.
   
   
   Hi All,  customer has discovered the following problem when
   performing the Compliance Scan & Check task against a group of
   TCAs. Here are the details:
   
   
   1) Created a dynamic group includes AIX servers with TCA
   running.
   
   2) Created a compliance checks against that group.
   
   click the Run -> Scan and Check
   
   3) The task will kick off and run against the members of the
   group.  The workflows include first Discovery.
   OnDevice and then Compliance_Validation.
   
   4) If one of the target is offline i.e. TCA is not running or
   server is not on the network, the first task will not be
   completed and wait on the one that cannot be started (it will be
   in Submitted status)
   
   5) While the rest of TCAs may have succeeded already from the
   Discovery.OnDevice task , the Compliance_Validation task will
   not start for those TCAs which already had the
   Discovery.OnDevice in Succeed status.
   
   6) This means that the whole Compliance task will put on hold
   until the TCA is back online or timeout expired.
   
   
   It seems that there is a dependency set for the
   Compliance_Validation task in order for its to execute, the
   Discovery.OnDevice task needs to be 100% completed. Is there
   a way to break this dependency?
   
   This also happens to static group as well.
   
   
   I have recreated similar problem as with two TCAs in a static
   group where the first TCA is offline, the Discovery.OnDevice
   task would continue to show "In-progress" for both TCAs and the
   Compliance_Validation is stuck in either submitted or scheduled
   status.    Until I have to cancel out the whole task or set TCA
   back online again.
   
   I found a similar problem described in defect tiou00095480 for
   TPM 7.2 and it is fixed in 7.2.
   
   
   This APAR is created to back-ported 7.1.1.
