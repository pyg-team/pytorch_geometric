APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 FP1 installed with network
   license on Desktop computer.
   The License Manager version 8.2.3.400 is installed on three
   Linux RedHat Enterprise servers as you work with redundant
   licensing for the network license of release SPSS 22.
   The same issue happens if you have installed Sentinel license
   Manager version 8.5.0.0021 on Windows server using redundant
   network licenses for release SPSS 22.ok
   
   On the clients you verified that the file spssprod.inf on SPSS
   22 installation directory is correctly set by commenting out the
   DaemonHost row and entering a parameter as the below instead
   with the IP addresses of the license servers separated by
   colons:
   
   RedundantServers=RedundantServer1:RedundantServer2:RedundantServ
   er3
   
   This is also documented on the Concurrent License Administrators
   Guide.pdf for release 22.
   
   However, if release 22 is launched on one of the Clients you may
   receive the below warning:
   
   ----------
   Error # 2070
   The application is unable to communicate properly with the
   license server.
   The license server may be down, or there may be other
   network-related
   communication or DNS issues interfering.  This command is not
   executed.
   Execution of this command stops.
   Specific symptom number: 5
   ---------
   
   However, if you create an environment variable LSHOST on the
   Client computers with the IP addresses of the license servers
   separated by a colon and launch SPSS 22 again a license can be
   retrieved and no error is displayed on the Client computer.
   Set this variable to include all redundant servers, with the
   server names or IP addresses separated by a colon (for example,
   server1:server2:server3).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Please use the simple workaround to create an LSHOST environment
   variable on the Client computer additionally to the other
   redundant settings as described above.
   This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs.
