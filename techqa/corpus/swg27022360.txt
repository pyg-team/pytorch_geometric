 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 getFolder, getChildren, and query with IN_FOLDER or IN_TREE return a document's latest major version instead of a later minor version. The CMIS specification says that a repository that does not support version-specific filing must return the latest version. 

CONTENT
IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine updates dynamic folder containment relationships so that a document's latest major version appears in a folder where it has been filed. The creation of new minor versions does not update this dynamic relationship. For example, if there is a document with versions 1.0, 2,0, 2.1, and 2.2, only the 2.0 version appears in the folder. 

The same major-version rule applies to IBM Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) when browsing or navigating folders and running queries with the IN_FOLDER() and IN_TREE() functions. If you use CMIS (or another Content Engine application) to check in a document to a folder with versioningState=minor, you see only the latest major version filed in the folder.
