Title: IBM How do I change the timeout period of the IBM® WebSphere® Product Center client browser? - United States

Text:
timeout; inactivity TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If the timeout period is set too low, your work may be frequently interrupted by a dialog box. In this case, you can increase the timeout value.

If the timeout period is set too high, an unattended session could pose a security risk. In this case, you can decrease the timeout period. 

ANSWER
 

IBM WebSphere Product Center enables you to modify the timeout period of the client browser.

To change the timeout period on the application server running the IBM WebSphere Product Center instance, complete the following steps. This procedure changes the timeout period.

1. Check the timeout period of the load balancer (if applicable).

Attention
Inconsistencies between the load balancer and IBM WebSphere Product Center timeout settings may cause timeout issues. Load balancers commonly have an inactive session timeout period of 60 minutes. Therefore it is recommended to set the WebSphere Product Center timeout period at least 5 minutes less than the timeout period of the load balancer. 

Example
If the timeout value of the load balancer is set to 90 minutes, the maximum timeout value for WebSphere Product Center is 85 minutes.

2. Locate the common.properties configuration file.
The file can be found in the $TOP/etc/default directory.

3. Edit the properties configuration file to set the max_inactive_interval parameter to the desired value.

Example
# max inactive interval (seconds)
max_inactive_interval=1800

In this example the parameter is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes). While there is no hard limit for this value, it is not recommended to exceed 14400 seconds (4 hours). 

4. Save the common.properties configuration file.

5. Restart the IBM WebSphere Product Center application.
Changes to the configuration file do not take effect until the WebSphere Product Center application is restarted.
