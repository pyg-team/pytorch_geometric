Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Storwize V7000 Unified (CVE-2015-1794, CVE-2015-3194, CVE-2015-3195, and CVE-2015-3196) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed in December 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Storwize V7000 Unified. IBM Storwize V7000 Unified has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
OpenSSL is used in IBM Storwize V7000 Unified for providing communication security by encrypting data being transmitted.


CVEID: CVE-2015-1794 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1794]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when a client receives a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a segfault and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108539] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)


CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)


CVEID: CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition in one of its functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505] for the current score
