PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 and IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 have the following shell sharing limitations: 

- When attempting to shell share Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 with Rational Software Architect v9.5, there is a conflict with the RSA feature UML Profiles for COBOL Development. 
- When attempting to shell share Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 with Rational Developer for i v9.5, there is a conflict between the two products.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Workarounds: 

When installing Rational Developer for z Systems or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 and Rational Software Architect v9.5, do one of the following: 

 * Install Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 and Rational Software Architect v9.5 with out the Rational Software Architect feature UML Profiles for COBOL Development 
 * Install Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 and Rational Software Architect v9.5 in separate install packages 
 * Install Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5 instead of v9.5.1 and Rational Software Architect v9.5 until a Rational Software Architect fixpack is available that resolves the conflict with Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1


When installing Rational Developer for z Systems or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 and Rational Developer for i v9.5: 

 * Install Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1 or IBM Developer for z Systems v14.0 and Rational Developer for i v9.5 in separate install packages 
 * Install Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5 instead of v9.5.1 and Rational Developer for i v9.5 until a Rational Developer for i fixpack is available that resolves the conflict with Rational Developer for z Systems v9.5.1



Or, the following fixpacks Rational Software Architect and Rational Developer for i resolve the issue 
RSA 9.5.0.2 ifix1 or later 
RDi 9.5.1
