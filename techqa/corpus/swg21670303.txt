Title: IBM Security Bulletin: AppScan Source is affected by a vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix AppScan Source 9.0.0.0 None AppScanSource-9.0-HeartBleed-Fix [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Rational/AppScan+Source+Edition&release=9.0&platform=All&function=all] AppScan Source 8.8.0.0 None Upgrade to 9.0.1 or later AppScan Source 8.7.0.1 None Upgrade to 9.0.1 or later AppScan Source 8.7 None Upgrade to 9.0.1 or later 
After applying the fix, perform the following steps to fully resolve the security vulnerability: 

 

 1. Replace your SSL Certificates:
    
    You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (i.e. using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 
    
    
 2. Reset User Credentials:
    
    Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.



Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
