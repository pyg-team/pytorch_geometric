APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  MQ agent does not get added to the list of deployable agents in
   the
   Tivoli Enterprise Portal physical navigator deployment option.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   Install a MQ 6.1 fp2 agent, then load the ITM depot with agent
   bundle MQ
   v7.1 Fp1. The 7.1 agent will not show in the list of deployable
   agents
   when trying to deploy the V7 agent to a machine where the V6.1
   Fp2 agent
   is installed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Work around is to deploy the agent using the tacmd command line
   interface.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  MQ Agent not listed as deployable agent in portal.
   
   
   Agent Deploy in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal client will not
   list deployable agents if their fixpack level is less than what
   shows in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring depot has already installed.
   This happens even if the agent version in the depot is greater
   than the installed version.
   
   If you have an agent with the version of 6.1.2.0 installed and
   you try to deploy an agent with version 7.0.1.0 the version 7
   agent will not show in the list of deployable agents.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Tivoli Enterprise Portal client was comparing the fixpack
   levels of agents without taking into consideration the version
   of the agent.  So a version 6 fixpack 2 agent was thought to be
   a higher version than a version 7 fixpack 1 agent.  The fix
   added a check for the version of the agent after it determined
   the installed fixpack version was higher than the fixpack
   version in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring depot.
