Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache Tomcat 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2013-4286, CVE-2013-4322, & CVE-2014-0033 

DESCRIPTION: FlashSystem V840-AE1 uses Apache Tomcat. 

FlashSystem V840-AE1 runs an Apache Tomcat web server which enables the systemsâ€™ browser-based administrative GUI. The version of Tomcat that runs in product code levels prior to 1.1.2.0 have the following vulnerabilities: 

 

CVE-2013-4286 (Apache Tomcat HTTP request smuggling) 

Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, caused by an incomplete fix related to the handling of malicious request. By sending a specially-crafted request in a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header and a Content-length header to the Apache HTTP server that will be reassembled with the original Content-Length header value, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91426]
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) 

 

CVE-2013-4322 (Apache Tomcat chunked transfer coding denial of service) 

Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an incomplete fix related to the processing of chunked transfer coding without properly handling a large total amount of chunked data or whitespace characters in an HTTP header value. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/91625]
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

 

CVE-2014-0033 (Apache Tomcat disableURLRewriting session hijacking) 

Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to hijack a valid user's session, caused by an error even when disableURLRewriting is enabled. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted link and log into the application, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account and possibly launch further attacks on the system. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/ [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/] 91423
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
