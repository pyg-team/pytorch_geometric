Title: IBM Improve Rule Analysis performance in Rule Designer (ODM) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running Rule Analysis on Rule Designer with a lot of options enabled takes a long time. Sometimes I have to interrupt the process and I get no results. 

CAUSE
Rule Analysis is a very resource intensive process. 

The rule analyzer has been designed to analyze rule sets containing rules of very diverse form, with the assumption that the rulesets are of a reasonable size. 

There are many factors that influence the running time of rule analysis:
- The number of rules
- The number of distinct expressions in rules
- The number of objects matched by a rule
- The domain size in the BOM 


All of the above impact the size of the constraint model that is built and thus influence running time and memory consumption. 

The number of rules is one of the dominant factors. 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Start by applying the recommendations to improve performance of Rule Designer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589514], especially increasing the initial and maximum heap size, and the suggestions to improve Build performance.

In order to learn about the limits of the rule analyzer for your project, create copies of the project, and reduce them gradually in size, and measure the performance of the analyzer after each step.
This will help determine the number of rules in the project that are manageable by the analyzer. 
You can then divide the rule sets into meaningful chunks in order to limit the analysis to 
those chunks (using Filters.)
