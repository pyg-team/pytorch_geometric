Title: IBM Wire for opening a new page, does open the same page in DASH - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Wire definition does not behave as expected, opening always the same instance of a page, instead of another instance of a page when a different node in a table is selected. 

SYMPTOM
A wire is defined between a HUB page and a target page. When a node is selected from a table widget on the HUB page, the target page will opened due to the wire definition. 
The target page has been defined as " Allow users to open multiple instances of this page", but if a second node is selected on the HUB page, the wire reloads the same/initially opened target page and only updates the content based on the new payload. It behaves like the target page had been defined as " Allow users to open only a single instance of this page", which is not the case. 


CAUSE
DASH is not honoring the switchPage flag in NewPortletEvents

ENVIRONMENT
DASH 3.1.2 and 3.1.2.1

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
See symptom section. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply cumulative patch 4 to DASH 3.1.2.1
