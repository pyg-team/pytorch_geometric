   This fix adds support to CICS Batch Application Control
   to run with CICS TS V5.1
   
   A documentation change is made to the CICS Batch Application
   Control User's Guide (SC34-6321-06).  The change on page 13 is
   to note 1 below figure 4 "CEDA commands to define the CBK
   programs and mapset in your CSD", as decribed below:
   
   Additional text is added to Note 1 at the end of the second
   sentence, the text is "; or 68 if you are installing CICS BAC in
   a CICS TS 5.1 region."
   
   The note should now read:
   
   1. In the CEDA commands shown in Figure 4, replace cbkgroup with
   any character string allowed by the CEDA transaction that meets
   your installation standards. Replace the nn in the program names
   CBKFSXnn and CBKSPXnn with 53 if you are installing CICS BAC in
   a CICS TS 1.3 region; 62 if you are installing CICS BAC in a
   CICS TS 2.2 region; 63 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS
   TS 2.3 region; 64 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS
   3.1 region; 65 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 3.2
   region; 66 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.1
   region; 67 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.2
   region; or 68 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.1
   region.  You can also define the programs for all these CICS
   releases if you want to.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS Batch Application Control base code has been enhanced to
   run with CICS TS V5.1
