APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When processing system dumps that are either damaged or that
   contain data in an inconsistent state (which happens as part of
   the normal operation of the runtime), jextract may print
   thousands of error messages to the screen.
   
   The nature of the error messages varies depending on the
   inconsistencies printed in the dump, the problem is that the
   same message may be printed again and again.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Normally the vast number of messages are an annoyance, rather
   than a functional problem. The jextract XML file should still be
   able to be used by dump tooling.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Jextract did not manage its output messages. If the same problem
   was encountered 10000 times, a warning message was printed to
   the screen 10000 times.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A verbose mode was added to jextract. By default warning
   messages caused by the contents of the dump are now only written
   to the jextract XML file. If a user wants to see all the
   messages, they can run with jextract -v.
   .
   The fix for this issue is available in Java 5.0 SR9
