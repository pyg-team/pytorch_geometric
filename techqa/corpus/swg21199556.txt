PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When an EJB project containing beans with remote interfaces is compiled, the following compilation error occurs on the generated _HomeHandle_Stub class:

This compilation unit indirectly references the missing type org.omg.CORBA.ImplementationDef (typically some required class file is referencing a type outside the classpath) 

CAUSE
Certain releases of the LotusÂ® Domino Toolkit for Java/CORBA (NCSO.jar) contain CORBA classes that allow it to do IIOP communication. If this JAR file is on the 'Java Build Path' of the EJB project, then this problem will occur if it is before (above) the JRE System Library entry (the WebSphere JRE) on the 'Order and Export' tab located on the EJB projects 'Java Build Path'.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order for the EJB project to compile against the correct ORB libraries the JRE System library for the EJB project must be before (above) the NCSO.jar on the 'Order/Export' tab located on the EJB projects 'Java Build Path'.
