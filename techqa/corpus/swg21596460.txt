 How do I get MS Office macros to be accessible via FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Instructions on how to "plug in" new mime types for FIMO: 

 

 1.  Login into WorkplaceXT as an administrator 
     
     
 2.  Click Tools
     
     
 3.  Administration
     
     
 4.  Site Preferences
     
     
 5.  Select "File Type Categories" from the left pane 
     
     
 6.  Under the "Word" section, click on "Add new MIME type" 
     
     
 7.  Enter in "application/vnd.ms-word.document.macroEnabled.12" > 
     "accept" 
     
     
 8.  Under the "Excel" section, click on "Add new MIME type"

     "accept" 
     
     
 10. Save the site preferences 
     
     
 11. Restart FIMO to load the WorkplaceXT site preferences 
     
     
 12. Browse and search for your .xlsm and .docm files 
     
     To determine the mime_type to enter, Add the macro to FileNet Content Engine and then 
     use FEM to look at the P8 properties associated with the mime_type
