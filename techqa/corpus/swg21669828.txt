PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are unable to shutdown Xpediter/CICS in you CICS region and you receive an abend0C4 in DBUGDBXX. 

SYMPTOM
DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'00002200' in module DBUGDBXX.

The symptoms of the problem are similar to the one described in APAR OA42454 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1OA42454]. However, the problem occurs with or without OMEGAMON active in the region.


CAUSE
You are missing a CA-ENF fix. Your current level of CA-ENF is making a similar mistake that the pre OA42454 version of OMEGAMON made. This causes the problem when CA-ENF intercepts control.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
From the dump, the 0C4 is at offset x'00002200' in program DBUGDBXX. The failing instruction is BF6F 2074 and register 2 (R2) has an address that is not valid: 0000000_40C55368. R2 is supposed to address DBUG's CPE at address 00000048_40C55368 (64bit).

Prior to the 0C4, DBUGDBXX loaded R2 with the CPE address 00000048_40C55368 and then issued an EXEC CICS RELEASE command to release program DBUG. On completion of the RELEASE command, DBUGDBXX was attempting to reference CPE field CPE_CURRENT_USERS (R2+74), but the top half of R2 was cleared, causing the 0C4.

It appears that R2 was updated during the RELEASE command processing.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply CA-ENF fix RO66173. Contact [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21669828&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies [http://www.ca.com/] if you need further assistance.
