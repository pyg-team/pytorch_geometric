   Title: Un-installing LDAPX and WinAD agent on W2K3 Server gives
   a memory
   error.
   Problem Desc: Cust has installed the LDAPX agent and the WinAD
   (see
   exact versions in the Environment section below) on Win2K3
   Server.  When
   trying to uninstall he gets this error:
    "The instruction at "0x77f4831d" referenced memory at
   "0x00421384".
     The memory could not be "written".  Click on OK to terminate
   the
     program."
   Cust able to reproduce problem? : Yes
   Desired Behavior:  No error messages should appear.  Cust should
   be
   able to install, un-install and re-install agents (both LDAPX
   and WinAD)
   with absolutely no problems.
   Steps to Duplicate :
   * Install the LDAPX agent - installs fine, no problems
   * Trying to install WinAD agent - click on "setup.exe" under the
   WinAD
     extracted directory and get this error:
     "The instruction at "0x77f4831d" referenced memory at
   "0x00421384".
      The memory could not be "written".  Click on OK to terminate
   the
      program."
   * Next, tried to un-install the "TivoliXldapAgent" agent - click
   on
     "uninstaller.exe" under the "_uninst" dir and get this same
   error:
     "The instruction at "0x77f4831d" referenced memory at
   "0x00421384".
      The memory could not be "written".  Click on OK to terminate
   the
