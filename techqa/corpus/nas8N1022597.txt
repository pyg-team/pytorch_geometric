Title: IBM Why Am I Not Able to Export Spooled Files via Navigator for i? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When I try to export a spooled file in any format from Navigator for i, nothing happens after I select the file I want to export. Why can't I export a spooled file? 

CAUSE
The browser is not allowing the redirect or download function.

ANSWER
As designed, the Export function Navigator for i uses the browser's redirect and download functions. The browser may be posting a message at the top of the session to allow for the redirect, for which you need to click on Allow to continue: 

Print screen of message at top of browser session prompting to allow for an automatic redirect [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022597&amp;aid=1]Print screen of message at top of browser session prompting to allow for an automatic redirect [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022597&amp;aid=2] 

If you do not see the message, check your browser settings for a setting to allow for the redirect, such as:
Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page 

More recently for security reasons, browsers have removed the options for redirect and download. If unable to find a redirect or download browser option, contact the browser support group to see how their browser can be configured or changed to allow for redirect and downloads. 

 

You could choose to download the spooled file in either text or PDF format using Access Client Solutions Printer Output.
Print screen of IBM i Access Client Solutions Welcome window highlighting Printer Output [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022597&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022597&aid=3] 

After selecting Printer Output from the IBM i Access Client Solutions Welcome window, a box showing your spooled files will appear. 

The default is to download the spooled files in PDF format using IBM i Transform Services (product 5770TS1), however, can be changed to text format by setting the Preferences (EDIT / PREFERENCES):
Print screen of IBM i Access Client Solutions Printer Output Preferences where the location of the file can be specified as well as the check box to Use PDF format if available [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1022597&amp;aid=4]
If the box for Use PDF format if available is not checked, the file will be downloaded in text format. 

Spooled files owned by others can also be found by changing the Filter (EDIT / FILTER).
