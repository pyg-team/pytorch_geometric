PROBLEM
Messages in HTML format are sent from a third-party application to your Inbox. The text in the body of the message does not render correctly when viewed in Lotus Domino Web Access (DWA) or Lotus notes. Attachments are rendered correctly. However, the body of the message appears empty.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue was reported to Quality Engineering as SPR# NKEY7HRERW.

As a workaround, set the "Format preference for incoming mail" in the Person document to "Notes rich text" for the text to display correctly.
