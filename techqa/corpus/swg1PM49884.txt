APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The statechart of class A generates wrong code.
   There is a condition connector. One transition goes to a
   junction connector and from there to state S1, the other
   transition goes to state S2 (with 'else' trigger).
   When generating code the action on the 'else' transition is
   generated for both branches.
   This is caused by a corrupted statechart.
   Workaround:
   Delete and redraw the transition from the condition connector to
   the junction connector.

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   In cases where a junction connector follows a condition that
   exits a condition connector, the code that is generated for
   the else part of the condition also includes the action that
   follows the junction connector.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in version 8.0. To preserve the previous code
   generation behavior for pre-8.0 models, a property called
   CG::Statechart::UsePre80StatechartCG was added to the
   backward compatibility settings for C, C++, and Java with a
   value of True.
