Title: IBM spsscommute.jar utility missing on 'pushed' network install. Error 75 appears on a silent installation for Mac - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have followed the instructions in the Network Administrator's Guide for doing a silent 'push' of a network installation. It appears that my network installation has been done correctly. However, I am missing the utility for checking out a commuter license (spsscommute.jar). Instead, I get the License Authorization Wizard, the same as if I had done a single or site license installation. 

Additionally, using silent installation for Mac generates Error 75 when using Commute Utility. Installation via Interactive wizard (GUI) does not have this problem. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available

In the interim, perform a network licensed installation one time. Find the spsscommute.jar and spsscommute.bat files in the resulting SPSS Statistics installation directory. Perform your pushed installs and copy these two files to the SPSS Statistics installation directory on the clients. Create a shortcut to the 'spsscommute.bat' file.

For Mac:
The file structure required for the commute utility to hold licences does not get created. As a work-around, you can manually generate the file structure: /var/.slm and give permissions of 777.

The following script will be able to achieve this work-around:

#!/bin/sh

if [ ! -d /var/.slm ]; then
mkdir -p /var/.slm
chmod 777 /var/.slm
mkdir -p /var/.slmbackup
fi

exit
