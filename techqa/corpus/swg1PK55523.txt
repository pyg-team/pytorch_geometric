ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When working with multiple projects in RSA, which includes a U
   ML model project with a large fragmented model, having the Java
   project open while working on different files with multiple edit
   ors open slows down the switching between editors. There is a pa
   use that lasts approximately 30 - 40 seconds where the user cann
   ot do anything. But seems to be alright switching between two di
   fferent models
   Inputs:
   1. A UML model project with a model that is made up of many frag
   ments (the model used in production contains 4000+ fragments.
   2. Two or more projects with other file types (E.g., java, xml,
   text files).
   Steps to reproduce:
   Import Project Interchange file TestLargeModel_ProjInt.zip.
   Import a sample project to the workspace.  Go to Help ? Samples
   Gallery ? Technology samples ? Java ? Hello World sample
   Switch to the Modeling Perspective
   Open the Claims model
   The Rational Model Editor is now open for Claims.emx
   Keep the editor open and open another file, this time open a jav
   a file (HelloWorld.java) under the SimpleHelloWorld example:
   You will notice that I turned on the Heap monitor, to show that
   I have set the heap size to use 1200MB.
   Immediately after double-clicking HelloWorld.java, slowness is a
   lready experienced.
   Switch between the two editors open back and forth. There is a l
   ong pause and nothing can be done during that pause.
   When the Rational Model Editor is open, working on RSA is extrem
   ely slow, especially when switching between the open editors.
   The slowness is also experienced when you have more than 2 edito
   rs open (as long as the Rational Model Editor is open). For exam
   ple, when you open another java file and switch between the java
    files.
   Try closing the Rational Model Editor (Claims.emx), then switch
   between the two open java files (the pause is no longer experien
   ced).
    Open the Rational Model Editor again (double-click Model0819).
    Try switching between the files again and the slowness is exper
   ienced again.
   Does the customer have a workaround?
   No
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  It is very slow to open a Java editor after a UML model with
   a large number of fragments has been opened (4000+
   fragments).  This defect makes it impractical to do any Java
   development while such a model is open.
   When a new file is opened, Eclipse consults the open editors
   to ask whether or not they match the new editor input. The
   matching strategy for the UML model editor was very
   expensive (consuming both memory and time) when there are a
   lot of fragments in the model.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is to not run the UML model editor's matching
   strategy when a new file is opened whose content types are
   irrelevant to the model editor.
   Now, opening Java (and other) files when a UML model editor
   is open has no delay, and switching between editors is not
   slow.
