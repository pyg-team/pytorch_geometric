APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the active PureSystems Manager node is powered off by
   holding in the power button, an IBM Support Representative uses
   the shell to poweroff the node instead of a shutting the
   operating system down gracefully, or has a hardware failure;
   the PureSystems Manager High Availability component sometimes
   takes longer than normal to start all of the services on the
   other PureSystems Manager node.  In some cases, the High
   Availability health status might change to 'Error' after a
   failure has occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Always use the System console to power off compute nodes or
   management nodes.
   After a forceful power down or a hardware failure on the active
   management node, if the services take over 30 minutes start on
   the remaining node, observe the High Availability status on the
   System Console > Troubleshooting page. If the overall status is
   'Error' and one or more of the services listed are marked as
   'Failed offline' or 'Stuck online', then reboot or apply an
   intentional failover to fully recover the management software.
   If the PureSystems Manager node that had the failure can be
   powered back on and is healthy, do this first so that node can
   become the active node again.
   After the other manager node is powered back on, power off the
   active node on the System Console > Hardware > Management Nodes
   page. If the other PureSystems Manager node cannot be powered
   back on, contact IBM Support to determine the best course of
   action, which will depend on which High Availability services
   are marked as 'Error'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The database manager on the PureSystems manager will attempt to
   recover and activate any management database that was active at
   the time of the database failure due to unexpected power off.
   If the database attempts to recover the databases before the
   database volumes are mounted the database will crash again
   during failover.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The management database auto restart feature is disabled and
   each management database is explicitly restarted after its
   volumes are mounted, allowing crash recovery if needed, then
   activated.
