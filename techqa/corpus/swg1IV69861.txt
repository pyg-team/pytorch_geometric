ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Severity:         2
   Approver:         MK
   Reported Release: 630 FP4
   Compid:           5724C040W  Windows OS Agent
   
   Environment:      ITM 630
   
   Problem Description:   On some Windows systems running on
   Citrix, the Monitoring Agent for Windows OS cannot be stopped
   due to the executable kcasc.exe hanging periodically.  This
   executable is called when Watchdog is being disarmed which
   needs to occur before the OS Agent can be stopped.
   
   When the problem occurs, the following command will
   hang periodically:
   %CANDLE_HOME%\TMAITM6<_x64>\kcasc query KNTCMA_Primary
