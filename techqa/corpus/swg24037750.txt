Extract files with the GNU TAR utility 

The installation package contains files with long file names. When you use the native TAR utility in Solaris to extract files from the installation package, the native TAR utility truncates the long file names. The launchpad therefore cannot find files with the original file names. Download the GNU TAR utility and use GNU TAR to extract files from the installation packages. 

You can find the GNU TAR utility here:
