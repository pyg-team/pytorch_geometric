ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   Description of Problem (full details)
   Same as Defect 664387
   After configuring a Get Content Failure Audit event it is not
   recorded when the event happens through Workplace.  If we use a
   user that fails trying to get the content through FEM the Audit
   log reflects the failure but when the same user tries to access
   the same file through Workplace the  Audit History does not
   reflect the failed event.
   CE version and patch level? P8CE-4.0.1-005
   AE version and patch level? P8AE-4.0.1-004
   WAS (Websphere, Weblogic, etc)? Websphere 6.1.0.9 ND
   
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? : Not
   sure
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   Is there a workaround? :
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Due to the fact that we are needing to store very sensitive
   documents
   in the FileNet system and Workplace is the primary interface
   for the
   end-user, the business impact of this issue is a show-stopper.
    Since
   the Get Content event is, in our opinion, the most important
   event we
   need a solution to this problem ASAP.
   
   Thanks
   
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   From Defect 664387
   Steps to Reproduce: - Create a userA with only View Properties
   access
   - Enable audit for your ObjStore on CE server(use properties
   page)
   - Under Document class, enable getContent, getObject, Delete
   audit events, catch both Sucess and Failed events, apply to
   subclasses
   - Logon to WP, add a document, on the security page, pick
   userA and be sure he only has View Prop access
   - Declare that document in RM (optional step that is RM
   related)
   - Logon to WP as userA, and try to delete or view the
   document, a valid error returned: indicating user has no
   permission to do so.
   - Go to EM on CEMP, look at Audit History of that document
   just added.
   Notice Audit list doesn't show the failed audit event just
   occured above.
   See also parent dtses and CE child dts.
   CE child dts was closed, because the audit failed event was
   caught when tested from CE side. But, the audit failed event
   never occured when the error was triggered from AE side. All
   success events were caught properly

   Expected Results:
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s
   What logs were collected and where are they located?
