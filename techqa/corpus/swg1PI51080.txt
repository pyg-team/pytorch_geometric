APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the UCD-IBMPureApplicationServer (IPAS) Integration, the
   generated agent name for the agent being deployed via IPAS is
   based on the Application name, the Environment name, and the
   virtual resource node name in the resource template. The
   resulting Agent name is assumed to be alphanumeric, and any
   non-alphanumeric characters are converted to underscore ('_').
   However, the generated environment expects an agent with a
   broader character set.
   
   You will be unable to use the integration if you Application,
   Environment, or virtual resource node
   have non-alphanumeric or underscore characters.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use only alphanumeric characters for application, environment,
   and resource names.
