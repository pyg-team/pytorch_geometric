APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Syndication does not work when a new syndication pair is created
   on 8001 CF06 or CF07 and the subscriber is a virtual portal with
   a different hostname. Even though the syndicator and subscriber
   is created successfully, all syndicate updates will fail.
   
   Note: Any existing syndication pair created before applying
   CF06 or CF07 will continue to work as expected.
   
   The following errors will be seen in the SystemOut log:
   AbstractConne W Syndication exception occurred during response:
   com.aptrix.syndication.SyndicationException: Message:
   IWKWC0004I: Code #405, phrase: Unrecognized sender, detail:

LOCAL FIX
 *  After the new syndicator pair is created, manually edit the
   syndicator object and correct the Subscriber URL field using the
   hostname of the subscriber virtual portal. eg:
   http://subscriber_vp_hostname:10039/wps/wcm/connect/?MOD=Subs [http://subscriber_vp_hostname:10039/wps/wcm/connect/?MOD=Subs]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Syndication does not work when a new syndication pair is created
   on 8001 CF06 or CF07 and the subscriber is a virtual portal with
   a different hostname. Even though the syndicator and subscriber
   is created successfully, all syndicate updates will fail.
   
   Note: Any existing syndication pair created before applying
   CF06 or CF07 will continue to work as expected.

   payload error, detail: Response code was not OK: 500
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The generated subscriber URL that is stored on the syndicator
   object incorrectly uses the hostname of the base Portal instance
   of the subscriber server instead of the subscriber virtual
   portal hostname.
