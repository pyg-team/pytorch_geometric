ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description/Reason for Collaboration:
   
   Thumbnail control in Datacap navigator to batch tree not

   Push a batch greater than 35 pages to navigator verify task.
   Launch batch in verify
   In the image viewer, double click to get thumnail control open.
   Scroll to page 35.  Click on thumbnail for imge 35.  You can see
   in the
   batch tree that the focus is highlighted on TM000035
   
   However, if you double click on thumbnail 35 it jump to the
   image on
   page 3 and the batch tree will jump to tm000003.
   
   Some thing in the thumbnail control where it does not understand
   the
   the double digit of the page count.

   Click on thumbnail 58 it jump to page 5.
   Same for 68 it jump to page 6
   79 jump to page 7
