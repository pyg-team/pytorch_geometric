APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Macro Manager supplied with HOD and the HACP and
   going to Serialize the parsed macro, one gets the exception:
   java.io.NotSerializableException:
   com.ibm.eNetwork.HOD.common.Environment
   
   DETAILS:
   Files made available included a zip file that contains the
   source files, class files and an output file containing the
   exception our Customer are experiencing.  MacroDemo is the name
   of the example application and contains the main () to start
   running the application.
   
   TO RECREATE THE EXCEPTION:
   
   1. At prompt type "java MacroDemo"
   2. Once the GUI is displayed, press the "Record Macro" button.
   3. Interact with the Library of Congress copyright search host
      application.
   
   The required input in the LOCIS host application are as follows:
   
           A. 1[enter]
           B. 1[enter]
           C. browse hobbit[enter]
           D. exit[enter]
           E. (If Scorpio Screen appears, hit [enter] key one time
              before proceeding to steps F ang G)
           F. 12[enter]
           G. 12[enter]
   4. Press the "Stop Macro" button. At this point a dump of the
      recorded Macro will be dumped to standard output.
   5. Press the "Save Macro" button. A Save dialog will be
      displayed.
   6. Enter name to save the Macro as and press the "Save" button.
   
   
   7. At this point the application will try to serialize the macro
      and the "java.io.NotSerializableException:
      com.ibm.eNetwork.HOD.common.Environment "  -- exception is
   sent to standard output.
   
   Our Customer indicated that they want to be able to Serialize
   and save the Macro so they may use the recorded macro in the
   future.
   
   - Our Customer run MacroDemo under JDK 1.3.1_07 and JDK
     1.4.1_02, but both JVM's produced the same results.
   - The application is NOT running in a browser, and is not using
     a plugin to run the application.
   This APAR is being opened upon assent granted by the relevant
   HOD Macro Component Owner at Development (Robin Y.).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Beans programmers who want to serialize a    *
   *                 macro bean.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Programmers are unable to serialize a   *
   *                      macro bean using HOD V7.                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Changes were made in HOD 7 to enhance the macro language. The
   macro bean was changed to include members that were not
   serializable so the macro itself could not be serialized as
   desired.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified the classes in  com.ibm.eNetwork.ELC.macrovariable
   serializable.
