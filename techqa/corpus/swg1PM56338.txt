ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Is it possible to prevent the NLI option when truncating DB2?
   When running a truncate method in build the 'NOT LOGGED
   INITIALLY' statement is issued as part of the ALTER command that
   drops the table. We want to know if we can add an option to
   prevent this functionality. Can this be considered a defect
   since this unwanted behavior causes a larger problem with a
   customers warehouse.  Please see the following:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/index.jsp?top
   ic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/admin/c0006079.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/admin/c0006079.htm]
    Our customer has concerns in regards to their staging tables
   not being available after using a ROLLFORWARD. From the above
   documentation:  You cannot recover these tables when rolling
   forward. If the rollforward operation encounters a table that
   was created or altered with the NOT LOGGED INITIALLY option, the
   table is marked as unavailable. After the database is recovered,
   any attempt to access the table returns SQL1477N.
