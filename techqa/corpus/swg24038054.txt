Impact 7.1.0.0 IF0001 Instructions.


This fix resolves the following items:
1) Fixes the missing Seasonality files for the Impact GUI Server in a Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) split install (GUI Server only). It is not required for a combined GUI Server and Impact server install.(IBM Internal defect 46214)
2) Fixes the deploy policy function. (IBM Internal defect 46216)


Notes and Limitations

- When installing iFix0001 on a Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) Combined installation (GUI Server, Impact Server and Extensions existing under the same install directory), ensure that only the Impact Server component (iFix 0001 for Impact Server 7.1.0.0) is selected. For this case, all the Seasonality files for Event Analytics are already installed on the machine. In this scenario only, if you install this fix with the GUI Server component selected, the update installer will fail with "duplicate files" errors.

- After applying the iFix0001 to an Impact GUI Server, the Impact Extensions for Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) cannot be installed in the same directory where the Impact GUI Server is installed. You must install Impact Extensions for NOI in a different directory.
