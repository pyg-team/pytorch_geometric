Title: IBM Content Collector mark for archiving fails with internal processing error. - United States

Text:
ICC; archive TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I select an email for archiving using Content Collector for Email, it fails with an internal processing error. 

SYMPTOM
After selecting an email for archiving using the Lotus Notes Client, the pop-up error message "Internal processing error" appears.


CAUSE
An unexpected error has occurred when Content Collector sends an archiving request to the trigger mailbox.

ENVIRONMENT
Content Collector for Email with Lotus Domino

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To troubleshoot further, perform the following to collect additional information:




 * Ensure that the Configuration Web Service validation is successful:  * From the Content Collector Configuration Manager, select Email Services > Configuration Web Service. 
    * Click on the Validate button. 
    * If validation fails, you must correct the problem with Configuration Web Service before proceeding to the next step. See Related URL below.
   
   
 * From the Lotus Notes Client menu, select Actions > IBM Content Collector > Enable or Disable Tracing. 
 * From the Lotus Notes Client menu, select Tools > Show Java Debug Console. 
 * Select a different email for archiving from the Lotus Notes Client to capture additional information.
   Important: Once an email is selected for archiving, you cannot mark it for archiving again. You must select a different email to ensure a new archiving request will be sent.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Check the following two places for errors:  * ICCNotesClientInfo.log under the Notes installation directory on the workstation. 
    * Java Console of the Lotus Notes Client
   
   
   If there is an error, you should resolve that error before proceeding to the next step. Consult with IBM support if you need further assistance. 
 * Check to ensure that the trigger mailbox address defined in the Configuration Manager > Email Services > Client Application > Trigger Mailbox is a valid email address, and that you are able to send an email to this address directly in Lotus Notes. Note: Do not specify the name of the trigger mailbox database in this field. 
 * After you correct the trigger mailbox value, go to the Email Services > Configuration Web Service panel and save the configuration. Make sure that the configuration web service is restarted. You may need to wait for a short period of time before the Notes Client will obtain the new value from the ICC Configuration Web Service. 
 * When there are no longer errors in both the ICCNotesClientInfo.log and the Java Console, you can try to select a different email for archiving again.
