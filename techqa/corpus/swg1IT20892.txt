ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM MQ was upgraded from a 32-bit (prior to v8) to a 64-bit
   MQ version on a Windows server.  Attempts to start and migrate a
   clustered queue manger fails.  A summary of the FDCs after the
   queue manager fails to start are as follows:
   Probe Id          :- ZF228010
   Component         :- zfuHealthCheckECThread
   Major Errorcode   :- xecP_E_INVALID_PID
   MQM Function Stack
   zfuHealthCheckECThread
   xcsFFST
   *
   Probe Id          :- ZX152010
   Component         :- zmuHealthCheckECThread
   Major Errorcode   :- xecP_E_INVALID_PID
   MQM Function Stack
   zmuHealthCheckECThread
   xcsFFST
   *
   Probe Id          :- ZX165061
   Component         :- zmuUtilityManager
   Major Errorcode   :- xecP_E_INVALID_PID
   MQM Function Stack
   amqzmuc0
   zmuUtilityManager
   xcsFFST
   *
   Probe Id          :- ZX165131
   Component         :- zmuUtilityManager
   Major Errorcode   :- zrcE_UNEXPECTED_ERROR
   MQM Function Stack
   amqzmuc0
   zmuUtilityManager
   xcsFFST
   *
   Further examination of the FDCs shows that the invalid PID is
   reported for the Execution controller process (amqzxma0.exe).
   MQ trace of the amqzxma0.exe process ends with:
   
   ----------}  zxcRestoreObjectClqMgrExtractInf (rc=OK)
   ----------{  zxcRestoreObjectClqMgrMigration
   -----------{  xcsGetMemFn
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   32bit WebSphere  MQ server clustered queue managers migrating to
   a 64bit version of MQ, for example , WebSphere MQ prior to
   version 8 migrating to a later IBM MQ version, on Windows
   platforms.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Due to a programming error in the 32 to 64 bit migration code,
   the execution controller process (amqzxma0.exe) may terminate
   with an unhandled memory access violation during the cluster
   migration process when the queue manager cluster list contains
   more than 6 entries.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MQ 32 to 64bit cluster migration code within the MQ queue
   manager has been updated to allocate sufficient memory to
   migrate the entire cluster list.
