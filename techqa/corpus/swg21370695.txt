Title: IBM Which languages can be used / applied in Controller? - United States

Text:
supported regional settings for IBM Cognos Controller supported languages for Cognos Controller TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Which languages can be user/applied inside Controller?

In addition, which Windows Regional Settings are supported by Controller? 

SYMPTOM
TIP: For a full list of things to consider (when changing the Controller language) see separate IBM Technote #1688028.


CAUSE
There are two types of language settings inside Controller: 

 * 
 * (1) Application Language
 *  This refers to the language of the words seen inside all the menu items (for example 'Company', 'Group', 'Maintain', 'Help' etc.) This is restricted to 12 languages 
 * 
 * (2) Code language 
 *  This refers to items such as 'descriptions' (or 'names') This can be any one of 29 languages. NOTE: There are some extra restrictions when using Controller with an Oracle database. 


In addition, there are also country-specific settings that are configured outside of Controller, specifically: 
 * (3) Regional Settings
 *  These are configured inside the Windows 'Control Panel' 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following list of languages are available inside the application (correct as of Controller 10.1.1): 

 * IMPORTANT: Older versions of Controller support fewer languages.


(1) Application language - used for the translation of the menu items, or Data Marts. 

The end user can configure this to be one of the following 12:  1.  English 
 2.  Swedish 
 3.  German 
 4.  Spanish 
 5.  French 
 6.  Portuguese 
 7.  Russian 
 8.  Korean 
 9.  Chinese (Traditional) 
 10. Chinese (Simplified) 
 11. Italian 
 12. Japanese.


(2) Code language - used for any account description, company name and so on 

This can be:  1.  Afrikaans 
 2.  Albanian 
 3.  Arabic 
 4.  Basque 
 5.  Bulgarian 
 6.  Catalan 
 7.  Chinese 
 8.  Croatian 
 9.  Czech 
 10. Danish 
 11. Dutch 
 12. English 
 13. Estonian 
 14. German 
 15. Greek 
 16. Finnish 
 17. French 
 18. Hebrew 
 19. Hindi 
 20. Hungarian 
 21. Icelandic 
 22. Indonesian 
 23. Italian 
 24. Japanese 
 25. Korean 
 26. Latvian 
 27. Lithuanian 
 28. Macedonian 
 29. Malay 
 30. Norwegian 
 31. Polish 
 32. Portuguese 
 33. Raeto-Romance 
 34. Romanian 
 35. Russian 
 36. Serbian 
 37. Slovak 
 38. Slovenian 
 39. Spanish 
 40. Swedish 
 41. Thai 
 42. Turkish 
 43. Vietnamese. 


Special notes if using an Oracle database 
If using an Oracle database, please refer to statements on the official 'Cognos Controller Software Environments' web page (see link below).  * For example, at the time of writing this Technote, all Controller 8.x versions (currently Controller 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 10.1) do not support Traditional and Simplified Chinese locales when using Oracle databases


Therefore, if using Oracle, you can use Traditional Chinese for 'application language' only.  * You will not be able to store any Traditional Chinese characters in the database 
 * For example it will not be possible to use Traditional Chinese characters in account names, company names etc. 


As a consequence of the above:  * If the client PC (running the Controller client) is running a Chinese version of the Windows OS, then it must have its Windows regional settings (Start/Control Panel/'Regional and language options') configured correctly  * Configure the Regional Settings to be English (or any of our supported non-double byte languages) 
    * Specifically, the regional settings must *not* be "Traditional Chinese".
   
   


(3) Regional Settings 

There are two different parts (of the architecture) which need to be using supported Regional Settings: 
 * Controller application server (COM+/system-account Windows user profile)  * The Controller server supports using the same regional settings as the 'Application Language' 
    * In other words, currently it supports 12 regions (see above for list).
   
   

 * Client device (end user's Windows user profile)  * The Controller client supports using the same regional settings as the 'Code language' 
    * In other words, currently it supports 43 regions (see above for list).
   
   


These are configured inside the Windows Control Panel, for example:
