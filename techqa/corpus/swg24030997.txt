HELPFUL HINTS FOR OBTAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:
Before you contact IBM Rational Software Support, gather the background information that you need to describe the problem. When you describe a problem to an IBM software support specialist, be as specific as possible and include all relevant background information so that the specialist can help you solve the problem efficiently. To save time, know the answers to these questions: 

 * What software versions were you running when the problem occurred? 
 * Do you have logs, traces, or messages that are related to the problem? 
 * Can you reproduce the problem? If so, what steps do you take to reproduce it? 
 * Is there a workaround for the problem? If so, be prepared to describe the workaround. 

If you have helpful information to diagnose or identify the problem on your system, you can provide this data by following the instructions to exchange information with IBM Technical Support [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html].
