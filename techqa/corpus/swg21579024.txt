Title: IBM ITCAM for Transactions - AMC - Agent Status - United States

Text:
AMC; configuration; "agent status"; 71AMCON-RPTG; 71AMCON-WV; 71AMCON-TS; 71GEN-TS TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the AMC Configuration workspace contain information in the Agent Status view for a product we haven't installed? 

ANSWER
The Agent Status view lists the status of the following ITCAM for Transaction agents based on the Product Codes found in the Managed System List:

Client Response Time - T4
Web Response Time - T5
Robotic Response Time - T6
Transaction Collector - TU
Transaction Reporter - TO
Internet Service Monitoring - IS

If any of these product codes are present in the Managed System List they will be displayed in the Agent Status view.

Product Codes are created for Universal Agent Managed Systems based the first 2 characters after the ":" in the Full Managed System name.

For example:
"ISISLOGS00" is the Managed System name for a set of log files being monitored by the UA FileDP. 

"listsystems" output shows:

Managed System Name Product Code Version Status
AUAHOST:ISISLOGS00 IS 06.00.00.00 Y 

However, "cinfo" output for the same host doesn't have anything for Product Code IS.

The presence of this entry as a Managed System causes the entry to appear in the AMC Agent Status view.

If the full UA Managed System Name includes ":T3xxxxx", with a status of "Y", this will be treated as an active "T3" agent that can result in AMC/AMCE problems as described in this blog:

To avoid this conflict you should try to use Universal Agent Managed System names where the first 2 characters are not "T3" or the same as the Product Codes listed above.
