Title: IBM Security Bulletin: TLS padding vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere MQ (CVE-2014-8730) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Transport Layer Security (TLS) padding vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack affects IBM WebSphere MQ. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8730 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8730]


DESCRIPTION: 

Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to check the contents of the padding bytes when using CBC cipher suites of some TLS implementations. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) like attack to decrypt sensitive information and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.


CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99216] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
All versions of IBM WebSphere MQ on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris & Windows platforms. 

All versions of IBM WebSphere MQ Hypervisor Edition. 

 

Note that IBM WebSphere MQ for IBM i is not affected by this vulnerability. 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
IBM WebSphere MQ Version 8 

Apply fixpack 8.0.0.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg24039436] 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.5 

Apply fixpack 7.5.0.5 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883670] 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 

Apply fixpack 7.1.0.7 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030911] 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.0.1 

Apply fixpack 7.0.1.13 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960691]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.0.1 and earlier 

Users should move to a Fix Pack level of 7.0.1.10 or later and ensure that GSKit 8 is enabled using the following instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzas.doc/sy13880_.htm]. The environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE must also be set at a system wide level to ensure that channels using the TLS protocol adhere to strict compliance of the TLS RFC. 

Note that it is not necessary to set this environment variable in fixpack 7.0.1.13 or later maintenance levels. 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 

Users should move to a Fix Pack level of 7.1.0.3 or later. The environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE must be set at a system wide level to ensure that channels using the TLS protocol adhere to strict compliance of the TLS RFC. 

Note that it is not necessary to set this environment variable in fixpack 7.1.0.7 or later maintenance levels. 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7.5 

Users should move to a Fix Pack level of 7.5.0.1 or later. The environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE must be set at a system wide level to ensure that channels using the TLS protocol adhere to strict compliance of the TLS RFC. 

Note that it is not necessary to set this environment variable in fixpack 7.5.0.5 or later maintenance levels. 

IBM WebSphere MQ Version 8 

The environment variable GSK_STRICTCHECK_CBCPADBYTES=GSK_TRUE must be set at a system wide level to ensure that channels using the TLS protocol adhere to strict compliance of the TLS RFC. 

Note that it is not necessary to set this environment variable in fixpack 8.0.0.2 or later maintenance levels.


A restart of queue managers, listeners and applications is required to ensure the environment variable changes are effective. 


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues.
