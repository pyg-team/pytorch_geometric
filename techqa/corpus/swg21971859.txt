AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.9
Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.2.0 through 5.2.7
Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.0 through 5.1.1.9

Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 4.x and 3.x are not affected.
IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.8 is not affected.

* Important: Although IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.8 is not affected by this vulnerability, if you have applied version 5.2.9, the vulnerability has been re-introduced and must be remediated.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to apply an appropriate IBM Spectrum Control or Tivoli Storage Productivity Center fix maintenance for each named product and execute the manual steps listed below.

If you cannot upgrade to a fixed level of IBM Spectrum Control or Tivoli Storage Productivity Center, you can follow a procedure to apply an IBM WebSphere Application Server interim fix to your existing server as a mitigation noted here. 

Note: It is always recommended to have a current backup before applying any update procedure. 




IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.x and Tivoli Storage Productivity Center V5.2.x



Affected Version APAR Fixed Version Availability 5.2.0 - 5.2.7 IT14418 5.2.8 * December 2015 5.2.9 * IT15009 5.2.10 May 2016 * Important: This vulnerability is not resolved in IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.9, even if you previously applied IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.8. 

Apply fix maintenance as soon as practicable. (See Latest Downloads [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21320822]) 



Tivoli Storage Productivity Center V5.1.x



Affected Version APAR Fixed Version Availability 5.1.x IT14418 5.1.1.10

Manual update steps are required in addition to applying 5.1.1.10. See steps below this table. April 2016 Apply fix maintenance as soon as practicable. (See Latest Downloads [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21320822]) 

These manual steps are required in addition to applying the V5.1.1.10 fixpack. 

Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.x embeds Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2 which embeds Websphere Application Server 7.0 and requires the corresponding fix below. Follow these steps to apply the fix:

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
 Applying IBM WebSphere Application Server interim fix PI52103 is an alternate option to mitigate the vulnerability if you cannot move up to a fixed level as noted in the table above. For more information, review the Websphere Application Server security bulletin: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970575 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970575] 

Note: Prior to applying the WebSphere Application Server interim fix, ensure Tivoli Storage Productivity Center is at the latest maintenance level -- 5.1.1.9, 5.2.7 or 5.2.9. If you later upgrade to a version of Tivoli Storage Productivity Center that does not contain a fix, you will need to perform this mitigation again. (See Latest Downloads [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21320822]) 

Note: It is always recommended to have a current backup before applying any update procedure. 

 

Procedure for mitigation of IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.9 and Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.2.x and 5.1.1.x: 

1. Download Websphere iFix PI52103 for Websphere Application Server 8.0.0.0 (8.0.0.0-WS-WAS-IFPI52103) from this location: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041257 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041257] 

2. If IBM Installation Manager is not yet installed on the IBM Spectrum Control or Tivoli Storage Productivity server system, download and install IBM Installation Manager. It is recommended to use the latest version -- currently 1.8.3, available here: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039631 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039631] 

3. Launch IBM Installation Manager from the command line, specifying the IMData directory. The following is an example for Windows:


 * 
 * 
 * where TPC_dir might be \Program Files\IBM\TPC 
 * 


4. From the IBM Installation Manager UI:  * 
 * 
 * b. Click on 'Add repository' 
 * c. Select the directory containing the WAS iFix. Press 'OK' 
 * d. Choose the 'Update' icon 
 * e. Select WAS iFix PI52103 and press 'Next' 
 * f. Verify the pre-installation summary is correct and select 'Update'



Additional procedure for mitigation of Tivoli Integrated Portal used by Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.1.x only: 

Tivoli Storage Productivity Center 5.1.x embeds Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.2 which embeds Websphere Application Server 7.0 and requires the corresponding fix below. Follow these steps to apply the fix: 

1. Download Websphere iFix PI52103 for WAS 7.0.0.0 (7.0.0.0-WS-WAS-IFPI52103) 
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041257 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041257] 

2. Apply the WebSphere Application Server 7.0 ifix PI52103 to Tivoli Integrated Portal using the preinstalled WAS Update Installer 

On Windows, the default location for WAS Update Installer is: 
[TPC_Install_Location]\IBM\tipv2\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\
