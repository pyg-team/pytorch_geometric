    WITH LARGE CLAUSE IS NOT PERMITTED. SQLCODE=-109,
   SQLSTATE=42601, DRIVER=4.18.60

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of DB2 10 for z/OS and DB2 11 for  *
   *                 z/OS who use the stored procedure            *
   *                 SYSPROC.ADMIN_INFO_SQL or the batch program  *
   *                 DSNADMSB.                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CREATE TABLESPACE statements generated  *
   *                      by ADMIN_INFO_SQL and DSNADMSB fail     *
   *                      with SQLCODE -109, ERROR:  CREATE LARGE *
   *                      TABLESPACE run failed because DSSIZE IS *
   *                      NOT ALLOWED WITH LARGE CLAUSE  IS NOT   *
   *                      PERMITTED.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the fixing PTF for this APAR.          *
   ****************************************************************
   Currently, ADMIN_INFO_SQL and DSNADMSB generate CREATE LARGE
   TABLESPACE statements that specify the DSSIZE clause.  DSSIZE
   with LARGE clause is not permitted so statements cannot be
   processed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ADMIN_INFO_SQL and DSNADMSB are modified to omit the DSSIZE
   for LARGE TABLESPACE.
