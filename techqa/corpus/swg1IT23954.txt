APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The memory assigned to DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE db2 registry is being
   allocated from dbheap during database activation/connection.
   Any changed to this registry become effective after db2 restart.
   
   This defect causes re-allocation of DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE memory
   during standby db re-connect after communication failure when
   there is no change to the setting. This causes double allocation
   of memory from dbheap.
   
   And since some customers set the value of this DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE
   registry to a higher number than the default of 2Xlogbufsz, it
   may cause out of dbheap memory errors on Standby causing db2 to
   go down.
   
   the messages in db2diag.log may look like this:

   DATA #1 : <preformatted>
   Out of memory failure for Database Heap (DBHEAP) on node 0.
   Requested block size           : 4295032808 bytes.
   Physical heap size             : 5139988480 bytes.
   Configured heap size           : 9320792064 bytes.
   Unreserved memory used by heap : 0 bytes.
   Unreserved memory left in set  : 470089728 bytes.
   
   This is most likely to occur when using a very large
   DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE up to the 4GB recommended limit, in
   conjunction with low db memory.
   
   With this fix, we will not re-allocate memory if no change to
   the setting.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a temporary workaround, please apply one of the following:
   
   1. Increase database memory
   
   or
   
   2. Use log spooling instead of using larg DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE
