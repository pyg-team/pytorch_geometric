QUESTION
 I tried to run the following REVOKE statement, where SYSIBM.SQTCOLPRIVILEGES is a created temporary table:

REVOKE ALTER ,DELETE , INSERT , SELECT
ON TABLE SYSIBM.SQTCOLPRIVILEGES
FROM PUBLIC BY UTRAR01

The preceding statement returned the following error:
DSNT408I SQLCODE = -526, ERROR: ?THE REQUESTED OPERATION OR USAGE DOES NOT APPLY TO CREATED TEMPORARY TABLE SYSIBM.SQTCOLPRIVILEGES 
DSNT418I SQLSTATE = 42995 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE 
DSNT415I SQLERRP = DSNXA09 SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR 
DSNT416I SQLERRD = -250 ?0?0 ?0 ?0 ?0 SQL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION 
DSNT416I SQLERRD = X'FFFFFF06' X'00000000' X'00000000' X'00000000' 
X'00000000' ?X'00000000'SQL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION 

CAUSE
For a created temporary table or view of a created temporary table, you can revoke 
only ALL or ALL PRIVILEGES. You cannot revoke specific table or view privileges.

ANSWER
Change your REVOKE statement to: 

 
REVOKE ALL 
ON TABLE SYSIBM.SQTCOLPRIVILEGES
FROM PUBLIC BY UTRAR01;
