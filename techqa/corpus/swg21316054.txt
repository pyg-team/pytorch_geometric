PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you upgrade your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS region from V2.2 to V3.2, you receive message DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C1/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'FFFFFFFF' in module DFHMCP1$. You are using PIE/CICS from UNICOM Systems. 

CAUSE
Fix CS360020 needed for PIE/CICS. [http://unicomglobal.com/]

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Reviewing the dump, the kernel will indicate something like the following:


Program DFHMCP1$ was in control, but the PSW was elsewhere. 
Error happened under the CICS RB.
CICS Registers and PSW.
PSW: 078D0000 96248D24 Instruction Length: 2 Interrupt Code: 01
Exception Address: 57CCF001 
Execution key at Program Check/Abend: 8 

If you go to where the PSW points, you will see the binary zeros that are causing the abend 0C1.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply fix CS360020 for PIE/CICS from [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21316054&amp;aid=1]UNICOM Systems [http://www.unicomsi.com/].
