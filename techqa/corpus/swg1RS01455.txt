APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is reproducible on Decision Center 8.1 and 8.0.
   When re-deploying a ruleapp which contains at least two
   rulesets, after a successful first deployment and baseline
   creation, the redeployment fails and shows that one or both of
   the rulesets have errors, preventing the deployment.
   No error or exception can be found in the console or in the
   server's log.
   Disabling ruleset checks on both projects has no effect on this
   outcome.
   
   This does not happen when the ruelapp only contains a single
   ruleset.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  use single RuleApp
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The deployment of a baseline does not use the proper reference
   when multiple projects are included in the baseline
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The search for the projects in the deployment baseline is fixed.
