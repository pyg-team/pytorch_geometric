Text:
impala TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The above error is thrown when trying to create a new FM model based on a Cloudera Impala datasource. 

SYMPTOM
Datasource connection test successful in Cognos Administration, but error is thrown in Framework Manager:
BMT-IMP-0002 Failed to execute metadata request. HIVE_CLI_SERVICE_PROTOCOL_V6


CAUSE
Multiple Hive/Impala driver versions within the same Dispatcher. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Stop IBM Cognos Service.
2. Go to <cognos_install_location>\webapps\p2pd\WEB-INF\lib 
3. Make sure to delete all Hive or Impala drivers that have been placed there before (check the list of the drivers from your Impala/Hive source directories).
4. Place only the new Impala drivers. The Impala driver list looks like this (driver versions will vary):
