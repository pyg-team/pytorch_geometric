QUESTION
 Why does db2adutil verify option return a "Error migrating media header (sqlcode -2514)? 

CAUSE
For example:
==>db2adutl verify full taken at '20161007021403' database 'SAMPLE'

Query for database SAMPLE
Retrieving FULL DATABASE BACKUP information. Please wait.
Error migrating media header (sqlcode = -2514). 



ANSWER
The most common explanation why the above error is being returned is that there is likely a mis-match between the version of Db2 running the >db2adutl verify option against a "different" version of Db2 backup image. 

For example: If the current instance is V10.5, then the db2adult verify will generate the above error if the version of Db2 backup image is any of the following: v9.5, v9.7, v10 and v11.
