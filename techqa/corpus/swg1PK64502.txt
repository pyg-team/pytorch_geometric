APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have a CMAS and WUI server at CICS release 3.2.  It is
   managing MAS's that are CICS 3.1.  You try to install a PIPELINE
   definition into the CICS 3.1 MAS, and receive the following
   error message:
   .
   DFHCA5204 E mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss applid ???????? COIE Command not
   executed. 'RESPWAIT' keyword is not valid.
   .
   The problem is that BAS isn't checking the release of CICS where
   the definition is being installed to make sure that RESPWAIT is
   valid.  It was added as a new paramenter in CICS 3.2 and is not
   valid in a CICS 3.1 region.

   ****************************************************************
   RESPWAIT and POLICYDIR are new PIPEDEF Resource Table attributes
   that were added to CPSM V3R2.
   
   Note: POLICYDIR is a CPSM reserved attribute that is not valid
   in CICS. It can be set through a batch API program, but CICS
   will fail the install request with the DFHCA5402 message if it
   is set.
   
   BAS method BNCF (EYU0BNCF - BAS MAS Support Program - 15) is not
   checking the release of CICS where the definition is being
   installed to make sure that RESPWAIT is valid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed EYU0BNCF to check the release of CICS when a pipeline
   definition is being installed to make sure that attribute
   RESPWAIT is valid.  Additionally, branched around the code that
   checks POLICYDIR since it is not a valid CICS field.
