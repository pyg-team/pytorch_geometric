PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational AppScan Standard Edition scan takes a very long time to scan. 

SYMPTOM
Looking in the traffic log, AppScan continually asks the server for the same specific file, for example "products.aspx". 

One of the AppScan database files (BASE.FPT) grew up to 3 GB size.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following two settings resolved the problem: 

 1. Go to "Scan Configuration -> Parameters and Cookies -> Redundancy Tuning Defaults (at the bottom)" and unselect "Explore the URL again whenever the value of this parameter/cookies is added or removed" 
    
 2. Set "Scan Configuration -> Advanced Configuration -> Test: Automatic links to ignore" to "products.aspx".
