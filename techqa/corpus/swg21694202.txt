QUESTION
 Using ACCE, how do I change a default value for a Property Definition? 

CAUSE
With the release of IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine version 5.2.1, FileNet Enterprise Manager is deprecated and is replaced with ACCE.

ANSWER
Via ACCE, select the document class that the Property Definition is assigned to: 

 1. Select "Properties" 
 2. Locate the "Property Definitions" drop down and select the respective property definition to be updated. (A new tab will open) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=1] 
 3. On the new tab, scroll down and locate "Property Default String" 
 4. Update the default value 
 5. There is no "save" button on this screen. Switch back to the calling tab that will display an "*" and press "save" 
 6. After updating the "Property Default String", select the Document tab now marked as "Document *" [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=2] 
 7. Select "Save" to save the updated "Property Default String" followed by "Close" to close the Document class and Property Template tabs [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694202&aid=3]
