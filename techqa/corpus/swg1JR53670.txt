APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  on BPM v8.5.0, the BPMConfig -stop will stop the entire DE,
   including dmgr, node agent and all cluster JVMs.
   
   on BPM v8.5.5, the BPMConfig -stop will only stop the cluster
   JVMs. It does not stop dmgr, node agent.
   
   The above behavior is consistent with the redbooks:
   http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/SG248175.html?Open [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/SG248175.html?Open]
   
   page 180/362.
   
   But when I check the BPM KC 8.5.0, it said that the BPMConfig
   -stop cannot stop the Cluster JVM, which is obviously wrong
   statement:

   bm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rbpmconfig.html?cp=SSFTN5_8.5.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTN5_8.5.0/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rbpmconfig.html?cp=SSFTN5_8.5.0]
   
   ++++ Begin of BPMAdv 8.5.0 KC +++
   -stop [-profile PROFILE_NAME -de DE_name -username user_name
   -password password] or properties_file
       Stops the deployment environment using the specified
   deployment manager profile. The command must be run on the
   deployment manager machine, but it does not need to be run on
   any remote nodes. You can run the command with a properties
   file or you can specify the profile, deployment environment
   name, user name and password. If you choose to run the command
   with a properties file, you can use the properties file that
   you used when you created your deployment environment using the
   BPMConfig command. The user name and password that are used can
   be the cell administrator or the deployment environment manager
   administrator user name and password.
   
   Important: The stop option does not stop the deployment manager
   and the node agents. If necessary, you must stop them manually.
   +++ End of BPMAdv 8.5.0 KC +++
   
   The sentence "Important: The stop option does not stop the
   deployment manager and the node agents. If necessary, you must
   stop them manually."
   
   said wrong. I just checked, the 8.5.0 BPMConfig -stop will also
   stop the dmgr and node agent.
   
   
   For BPMConfig -start, I also noticed the difference v850x: the
   BPMConfig -start will start the dmgr first, then node agent,
   then perform a cluster start. The status for cluster members
   needs some time to finish, async process
   
   v855: the BPMConfig -start will directly start the cluster
   members, also async process
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  none available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In "BPMConfig command-line utility"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFTN5_8.5.0/com.ibm
   .wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rbpmconfig.html?cp=SSFTN5_8.5.0),
   "Important: The stop option does not stop the deployment manager
    and the node agents. If necessary, you must stop them manually"
    is incorrect. The statement should be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The content will be updated the next time the documentation is
   refreshed.
