LOCAL FIX
 *  Modify the qmproc.ini Pathway stanza Hometerm attribute to use
   a device without .# for example Hometerm=$ZHOME.
   Alternately delete  amgr and crtmqm using the device without the
   .#.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   The # used in a terminal name of the qmproc.ini
   Pathway stanza Hometerm= attribute was not validated correctly.
   The data after the # was treated as a comment.
       Hometerm=$KHT2.#MQC6
   When the Pathmon process was starting it was attempting to open
   a output device as $KHT2. which does not exist and produced the
   FDC from strmqm with Component zslHPNSSCrtQMPathwayConfig
   Comment1 Home Terminal file error
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WMQ will no longer assume '#' is a comment character in the
   qmproc.ini file,but will verify that a '.' (dot) does not
   precede it. If the string does contain '.#' then it will be
   regarded as a valid attribute.
   (eg. in qmproc.ini file where Pathway stanza contains
   Hometerm=$ztn0.#ptbwsv6
   "$ztn0.#ptbwsv6 " will be regarded as valid string, not a
   comment.
   Released in WMQ V53 HP NonStop V5313 fix pack.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *   Use a process that does not contain .# such as
   $ZHOME or $VHS. The qmproc.ini Pathway stanza Hometerm attribute
   can be modified to use $VHS for example until this APAR
   correction is applied which will accept a device containing .#
   in it.
