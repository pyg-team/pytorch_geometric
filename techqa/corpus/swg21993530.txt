Title: IBM "[INS-10102] Installer initialization failed ... An unexpected error occured while initializing the Installer" when installing Oracle 12c 32-bit client on Controller application server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Because the Controller application server contains a small portion of 32-bit code (in addition to the vast majority of 64-bit code) it is necessary to install both the Oracle 64-bit and 32-bit clients (on the application server).

Administrator therefore installs the Oracle 12c 64-bit client first. This is successful.

Afterwards, the administrator attempts to launch the Oracle 12c 32-bit client installer (setup.exe). An error appears. 

SYMPTOM
The error message/symptom will vary depending on environment. 

 

Example: Windows 2016

[INS-10102] Installer initialization failed.

Cause - An unexpected error occured while initializing the Installer. Action - Contact Oracle Support Services or refer logs Summary - [INS-10002] Inventory initialization failed


CAUSE
Limitation (see link at the end of this Technote) of Oracle client software, when installing two copies of the Oracle client on the same Windows device.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After installing the 64-bit Oracle client, rename an Oracle registry key. Then install the Oracle 32-bit client. Finally, rename the Oracle registry key back to its original name. 

 

Steps: 

The following is based on Oracle 12c, and was correct at the time of writing. The steps may differ slightly for future patch versions of Oracle. 

1. Download the latest patchset version of the Oracle 12C release 1 64-bit client. 

 * At the time of writing, this is the file “winx64_12102_client.zip”.


2. Extract this file (“winx64_12102_client.zip”) onto the Controller application server, and run 'setup.exe' 

 * VITAL: During the client installation wizard, select a full 'Administrator' install option:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993530&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993530&aid=2]  * Typically choose all the default options for the other wizard choices.


TIP: After the install has finished, check that it has installed all the expected components, by looking at the size of the "C:\app" folder (or wherever you have installed it to). The total size should be approximately 1.41Gb. 

 

3. Now create/edit your TNSNAMES.ORA file. 

 * By default, this is located here: C:\app\client\Administrator\product\12.1.0\client_1\network\admin 
 * Ensure that it contains entries on how to connect to your Oracle database server(s)


4. Create a ‘System Variable’ (on your Controller application server) called ‘TNS_ADMIN’ to point to the location of your TNSNAMES.ORA file. 

 * By default, the value would be: C:\app\client\Administrator\product\12.1.0\client_1\network\admin

5. Rename the registry key “HKLM\Software\Oracle” to “HKLM\Software\Oracle.OLD”:

6. Download the latest patchset version of the Oracle 12C release 1 32-bit client. 

 * Specifically, you need to download “winnt_12102_client32.zip”.


7. Extract this file (“winnt_12102_client32.zip”) onto the Controller application server, and run 'setup.exe' 

 * VITAL: During the client installation wizard, select a full 'Administrator' install option:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993530&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993530&aid=5] 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT
 * 
 *  For example, install it into the folder: C:\app_32\Administrator 

8. After the install has finished, check that it has installed all the expected components, by looking at the size of the "C:\app_32" folder (or wherever you have installed it to). 

 * The total size should be approximately 1.41Gb.


9. IMPORTANT: Finally, undo the registry key renaming that you did earlier. 

 * In other words, rename the registry key “HKLM\Software\Oracle.OLD” to “HKLM\Software\Oracle”.
