ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ISC login and password are required to uninstall the
   Administration Center 6.1. The uninstallation fails if the user
   name and password are invalid. This design leaves no option for
   users who forget the ISC login or password.
   
   TSM Versions Affected:
   TSM server 6.1 on all supported platforms
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium
   Additional Keywords:

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following steps can be used to uninstall without providing
   the ISC login and password for UNIX/Linux:
   
   1) Use OS software installer  to remove TSM components except
   Administration Center,
   2) Delete the folder /opt/tivoli/tsm/AC :
   rm -r     /opt/tivoli/tsm/AC
   3) Remove the Deployment Engine:
   
   /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/si_inst.sh -r -f
   cd /usr/ibm/common
   rm -r acsi
   cd /var/ibm/common
   rm -r acsi
   
   4) remove Deployment Engine entry from  /etc/inittab and
   /etc/services:
   
   in /etc/inittab remove:
   :Begin AC Deployment Engine block
   :Start the Cloudscape database server
   si:23456789:wait:/usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/acsisrv.sh -start
   :End AC Deployment Engine block
   
   in /etc/services remove:
   acsisrv   4130/tcp    # IBM ADE Service
   
   5) reextract the TSM6.1 download package and redo the install.
