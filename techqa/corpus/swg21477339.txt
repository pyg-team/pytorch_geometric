Title: IBM Duplicate Id values found. Import Aborted. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm trying to import a SPSS data file into Text Analytics for Surveys, but I get the following error message:

"Duplicate Id values found. Import Aborted."

The Ids are unique, so why am I getting this message? 

CAUSE
SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys requires that each record to be imported is identified by a single unique identifier field.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are two situations that will cause the import to fail. Either there are duplicate ID values in the data to be imported, or there are multiple records with blank or missing ID values. The latter is actually a special case of the former. 


If you have either situation, you will need to resolve it in the application that built the data file to be imported.
