APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you upgrade an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)
   deployment environment with a customized context root prefix
   from IBM BPM V8.5.0 to IBM BPM V8.5.5.0, the context root
   prefix is not set for the new web modules that were added in
   IBM BPM V8.5.5.0:
   - cews.war in IBM_BPM_DocumentStore
   - acce_navigator.war in IBM_BPM_DocStoreAdmin
   - web-pd.war in IBM_BPM_WebPD
   - bpm.coachflow.war in IBM_BPM_Teamworks
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Once upgraded to 8.5.5.0, the following command needs to run to
   update/refresh the context root prefix for all applications.
   
   ${BPM_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/BPMConfig.sh -update -profile
   ${DMGR_PROFILE_NAME} -de ${DE_NAME} -contextRootPrefix
   ${CONTEXT_ROOT_PREFIX}
   
   After running this command, restart the Dmgr, Managed Nodes and
   their servers to properly pick up the synched changes.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that correctly sets
   the customized context root prefix for new web modules when
   the fix is applied before starting the deployment manager (IBM
   BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced) or stand-alone server (IBM
   BPM Express) for the first time after you apply the IBM BPM
   V8.5.5.0 refresh pack.
   
   On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
   for JR50580:
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager and then Advanced from
   the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
   level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR50580, and click Continue.
   
   When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
   the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
   additional installation instructions and information about the
   fix.
   
   If you install the fix after starting the IBM BPM V8.5.5.0
   server,  run the following commands to update or add the
   context root prefix for all applications:
   
   1. Stop all the servers, including the deployment manager and
   the node agents (for IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced)
   2. On Windows, run <install_root>\bin\BPMConfig -update
   -profile <profileName> -de <deName> -contextRootPrefix
   <contextRootPrefix>
       On Unix, run <install_root>/bin/BPMConfig.sh -update
   -profile <profileName> -de <deName> -contextRootPrefix
   <contextRootPrefix>
       where <profileName> is the name of the deployment manager
   (for IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced) or stand-alone
   server (for IBM BPM Express) profile, <deName> is the name of
   the deployment environment, and <contextRootPrefix> is the
   custom context root prefix for the DE.
   3. Restart the deployment manager (IBM BPM Standard and IBM
   BPM Advanced) or stand-alone server (IBM BPM Express)
   4. On IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced, restart the node
   agents and wait for node synchronization to finish.
   5. On IBM BPM Standard and IBM BPM Advanced,restart the
   clusters.
