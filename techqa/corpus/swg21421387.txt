Title: IBM WebSphere Application Server intermittently hangs when processing DataStage web service requests. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When processing DataStage web service requests (RTI / WISD), the WebSphere Application Server intermittently hangs after reporting a hung thread:
0000000f ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread "WebContainer : 2" (00000035) has been active for 624048 milliseconds and may be hung. There are 1 threads in total in the server that may be hung.

The RTI log shows the following error as a symptom of the first problem: 
[1256524385024_PRC] ERROR com.ascentialsoftware.rti.agent.handler.datastage.PipeReceiver - 
[1256524385024_PRC]error during call to init: dspipe_init(278812): open(/tmp/ade.MRCH_MGMT_PRD.ds_get_product.1256524385024.product_out)
- No such file or directory 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In most cases, restarting DataStage and the WebSphere Application Server will allow the job to resume working. However, to prevent the error from recurring may require some configuration changes to the job and service. 

The above errors have a variety of possible causes:


 * System load. In this situation the instance is not starting up within 30 seconds causing a timeout. Increase the timeout to 120 seconds and increase if necessary. 
 * For Server jobs on the Performance tab of job properties set to Inter Process with an increased timeout. 
 * Check to see if the /tmp directory is full or if the userid running job/service does not have permission to read/write to /tmp. 
 * Any change to a job design while it is deployed can result in a named pipe communication problem between the agent and job. This would include any job change that requires the job to be recompiled. These pipes are stored in /tmp and have unique ids. The service will need to be redeployed (disable/enable is not enough).
