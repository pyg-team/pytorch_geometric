APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The content of summary field in OMNIbus is very poor for RMF
   events and it does not allow the operator looking at the OMNIbus
   console to quickly understand what is the information carried by
   event and what is the problem behind the event. It is very
   difficult, from the text, to understand what was happen.
   
   This APAR is intended to provide better mapping of RMF events at
   the distributed side.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All Tivoli Event Pump users using RMF feed.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The content of the RMF event summary    *
   *                      field in OMNIbus can be cryptic. In     *
   *                      most cases the operator is unable to    *
   *                      understand what is really happen on     *
   *                      the z/OS side.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The content of summary field in OMNIbus is very poor for RMF
   events and it does not allow the operator looking at the OMNIbus
   console to quickly understand what is the information carried by
   event and what is the problem behind the event. It is very
   difficult, from the text, to understand what was happen.
   
   For example, customer may receive an event with the following
   content in the summary field:
   
   Exception = ;SYSPLEX(PLEXAT) TIME(20101130121040)
   RESOURCE(DSMF,*,PROCESSOR);% workflow Metric Value = 4.0
   
   The definition of this exception in Event Pump configuration
   member is:
   
   DEFAULT LMVWFLW,NULL,%name%,MVS_IMAGE,NULL,NULL,G,8D055
           LT,50,Low workflow %,100,0
   
   The summary field for LMVWFLW exception contains a lot of
   technical information. For the most cases, operator is unable to
   read it. The following text describes the summary of the same
   exception is much better:
   
   Low workflow with resource 'DSMF,*,PROCESSOR' in sysplex PLEXAT,
   4.0 workflow
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The mapping of supported RMF exceptions was added to the Tivoli
   EIF Probe on the distributed side. Now the EIF Probe transforms
   incoming RMF events into the human readable form. The
   transformation process based on the RMF exception name which
   users specify during RMF customization in Event Pump. The RMF
   exception name is used to map incoming events into meaningful
   description in summary field on OMNIbus consle. The probe rules
   files and Netcool/OMNIbus schema of RMF feed were updated.
   
   There is an associated distributed platform update for Tivoli
   EIF Probe. This update is in MDV 4.2.2.2-TIV-EP-FP0002,
   and can be located on the IBM Tivoli Event Pump support site
   under Downloads.
