QUESTION
 What license is needed to import DoDAF data from IBM Rational System Architect to IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

ANSWER
The license feature that is used by the integration is "Rhapsody_SA_Addon", which is part of the "IBM Rational Rhapsody Interfaces Add On" license. 

If you attempt to run the interface from IBM Rational Rhapsody using the "Tools\Import from System Architect" menu, and you get a license failure, make sure that your license file contains a feature for "Rhapsody_SA_Addon" and if not you can go to the License Key Center and download a new copy of your "Interfaces Add On" feature, which should contain the complete feature set.
