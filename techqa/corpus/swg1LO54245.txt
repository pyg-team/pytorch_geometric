ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  FTI Search incorrect results when searching for email address
   containing Separator with Underscore
   
   User in a Full Text Indexed database cannot find email address
   when the e-mail address contains as separator "underscore" "_"
   if the e-mail address contains as separator a "dot" "." the name
   can be found correctly
   
   For example consider the name
   
   john_doe@acme.com
   john.doe@acme.com
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Create in a mail file hosted on a 851 server the following
   documents
   
   Document 1. New mail addressed in To: john_doe@acme.com
   Document 2. New mail addressed in To: john.doe@acme.com
   Document 3. New mail addressed in cc: john_doe@acme.com
   Document 4. New mail addressed in cc: john.doe@acme.com
   Document 5. New mail addressed in cc: john_doe@acme.com
   Document 6. New mail addressed in cc: john.doe@acme.com
   
   2. In the Sent view of the mail file you can see this 6
   documents
   
   3. In the Sent vie open the Search. By going to view>search this
   view. "In search for" enter doe
   
   The result is that you find the 6 documents
   
   4. Now Create a Full Text Index for this database with the
   options
   Case sensitivity OFF
   Index Breaks= Words Only
   Index Attachments ON(filtered)
   Index Encyupted Fields ON
   
   Do a search in the view Sent for:  doe
   
   The result is you only find 3 documents in which the email
   address contains the separator "dot" as in
   
    john.doe@acme.com
   
   
   5. Clear the search results and perform a second query in the
   sent view for : *doe
   
   The result if now all 6 documents in which you can find the
   email address that contains the separator like a "dot" and also
   the documents that have a separator as "underscore"
   
   The search results finds documents that contains both bellow:
   
   john.doe@acme.com
   john_doe@acme.com
   
   
   Reviewed documentation for query operators
   
   - (hyphen) is a query operator but "_" underescore is not
   considered query operator
   
   
   - (hyphen) Finds documents with the hyphenated word pair.
    Example
    full-text
    Finds documents containing "full-text." Notes view - Yes
     Notes domain - Yes
     Web view/domain - Yes
   
   
   Unable to find explanation why searching without any query
   operator when full text indexed only able to find documents that
   contains the dot (.) as separator and (_) underscore is not
   found
   
   The same results are obtained if you seach for
   
   john  only find results with john.doe@acme.com
   
   but if you search for John* you can find both
   john.doe@acme.com
   john_doe@acme.com
   
   This is the description found regarding < *> wildcard
   
   Web query syntax
   
   
   An asterisk used as a wildcard can only be used at the end of a
   search
   term, not at the beginning or in the middle of the term.
   
   
   Notes query syntax
   
   * A wildcard that can represent any extension of letters. It
   does not
   work with dates or numbers.
    Examples
    *one
    Finds documents containing bone, cone, clone, crone, done,
   drone, gone,
   telephone (and any other words of any length that end with
   'one').
    Also,
    *one*
    Finds documents containing bone, cone, clone, lonely, phoned,
   stoned,
   pardoned. Notes view - Yes
     Notes domain - Yes
     Web view/domain - Yes
   
   5. Tried with Notes query syntax  and Web query syntax and I
   obtain the same results. Does not make any difference
