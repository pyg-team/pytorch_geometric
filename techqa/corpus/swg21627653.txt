Title: IBM The total space taken to store all the messages in the PST file is much higher than the original file size of the PST file - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The default configuration of Content Manager (CM) and Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) does not fit to store small email files 

SYMPTOM
The space taken to store all the messages in the PST file is doubled or even more than the original PST file size after PST archived to CM and migrated to TSM.


CAUSE
The space taken to store all the messages in the PST file file would be bigger than the original PST file size, since the the MSG format to persist Exchange items like email on disk is not very storage efficient. So after PST extracted to MSG files, it is normal to see the file size being bigger than the original PST file. 

 * In IBM Content Collector (ICC) v2.2, by default, some additional Microsoft API flags are not included yet. These flags could reduce the space taken to store the messages in PST when creating the MSG files. They can be enabled by manually setting up two environment variables. In ICC 3.0, those flags are enabled by default. 
 * Since email file size is small, it would cause space waste if using CM default device manager retention mode setting "retention" to store email files in CM or using TSM default DATAFormat option "NATive".


ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2008, Windows 2003



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check ICC environment variable setting if it is on ICC 2.2, CM retention mode setting and TSM DATAFormat configuration



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
On ICC 2.2, set the environment variables below 

AFU_DISABLE_EXTENDED_STGM_FLAGS=1
AFU_DISABLE_TEMP_MESSAGE_COPY=1 

If the ICC version is 3.0, the above two variables are automatically set as default. 

 * Change device manager retention mode to "retention_aggregate" by follow the instruction at http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.administeringcm.doc%2Fmos10074.htm&resultof=%22aggregate%22%20%22aggreg%22 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.administeringcm.doc%2Fmos10074.htm&resultof=%22aggregate%22%20%22aggreg%22]. 
 *  Change DATAFormat to "NATive" by following the instruction at http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/topic/com.ibm.itsm.srv.ref.doc/r_cmd_stgpool_psa_define.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tsminfo/v6r3/topic/com.ibm.itsm.srv.ref.doc/r_cmd_stgpool_psa_define.html]
