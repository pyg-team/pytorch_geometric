Title: IBM Login failure for the TIP primary admin user (usually "tipadmin") - United States

Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2AUTH; Tivoli Integrated Portal; login failure; tipadmin; primary administrative user; invalid username password TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After a new installation of Tivoli Integrated Portal or a fix pack is applied to an existing TIP installation, the primary admin user cannot log in. The login fails with "Invalid username or password" 

SYMPTOM
The login works fine when logging directly into the WebSphere Administration Console. 

The primary admin user credentials work fine with wsadmin commands, and the stopServer command. 

The login fails when logging in via the standard TIP login page.


CAUSE
The TIP application has become out of sync with the Argus authorization sub-component. This is believed to happen during .war deployment steps in an install or fix pack install. No root cause has been identified at the time this technical note was written.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In addition to the symptoms listed previously in this note, tracing the following objects can be used to verify an issue with the authorization sub component: 

*=info:com.ibm.ws.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.*=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:com.ibm.sec.*=all 

The following technical note can be used for instructions on enabling tracing in Tivoli Integrated Portal:

With tracing enabled for the objects listed above, the following messages will be written to the trace.log while attempting to log in:
