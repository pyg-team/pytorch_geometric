Title: IBM Intermittent deadlocks occur when using OSGi applications with Java 2 security enabled - United States

OSGIJPARnotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using OSGi applications with Java 2 security enabled, your system might experience intermittent deadlocks. 

SYMPTOM
When you are running in an environment with Java 2 security enabled and are deploying an OSGi application as a business-level application, the deadlocks most commonly occur at server startup. However, they can occur at other times. For example, these deadlocks can occur in the following instances: 

 * When you import the enterprise bundle archive (EBA) file as an asset 
 * When you add the EBA asset to a business-level application 
 * When you start the business-level application


As a result of the deadlock, the action does not complete. If you check the log files, you might see many instances of the following exception message: 

[3/2/10 18:12:54:103 CST] 00000009 prefs W 
Couldn't flush user prefs: java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException: 
Couldn't get file lock.
