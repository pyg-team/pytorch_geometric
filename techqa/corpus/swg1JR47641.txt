ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cross-Site Scripting ( 5649 ) - The Java Locale object that we
   get from the application server driven off the "Accept-Language"
    header requires simple validation to ensure that it's a valid
   locale and not a malicious script
   
   Cross-Frame Scripting ( 11293 ) - Per
   (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/03/30/combatin
   g-clickjacking-with-x-frame-options.aspx), the X-FRAME-OPTIONS
   header should be sent to limit the ability to include BG within
   an IFRAME to only the sites of the same origin.  I believe that
   we may want to offer clients the ability to configure this
   server-side with a list of "ALLOW-FROM" values as they may very
   well want to be able to include BG pages within an IFRAME on
   another internal site with a different same origin (e.g.
   embedding a BG result page preview within their enterprise
   search).  In the event that they do choose to "ALLOW-FROM" a
   specific list of internal websites, it's important to note that
   their automated security scan may still declare this as a
   vulnerability, even though they've considered this acceptable.
