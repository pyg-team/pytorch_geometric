PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rolling back Dashboard Application Services Hub Version 3.1.2, which is delivered in Jazz for Service Management Version 1.1.2, to Dashboard Application Services Hub Version 3.1.1 removes the Data Visualization widgets, also known as Rapidly Adaptive Visualization Engine (RAVE) widgets, instead of redeploying the previous version of the widgets. 

SYMPTOM
When you roll back, the RAVE widgets are no longer available in Dashboard Application Services Hub Version 3.1.1, which is delivered as part of Jazz for Service Management Version 1.1.1.


CAUSE
RAVE widgets were first made available in Dashboard Application Service Hub Version 3.1.1, so when users rolled back to the previous version, RAVE was correctly removed. This behavior was incorrectly maintained for the Version 3.1.2 rollback.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue will be resolved with the release of Dashboard Application Services Hub Version 3.1.2.1, which will be delivered in Jazz for Service Management 1.1.2.1.


Currently, if you roll back Version 3.1.2 to Version 3.1.1 and then upgrade to Version 3.1.2 again, the problem is resolved. 

Alternatively, if you do not want to upgrade to Version 3.1.2 after rolling back from Version 3.1.1, then to resolve the problem, do the following: 

 1. Extract the dash.ravewidget.war directory from JazzSM_HOME/ui/installableApps/iscapp.zip and place it in a temporary directory, for example, /tmp. 
 2. Stop the WebSphere Application Server instance associated with your Dashboard Application Services Hub environment:  * At the command line, change to JazzSM_HOME/profile/bin and run the following command:
       ./stopServer.sh|bat server1 -username was_admin_userID -password was_admin_password
    
    
 3. In the JazzSM_HOME/profile/bin directory, run the following command:
    ./wsadmin.sh|bat -conntype NONE -username was_admin_userID -password was_admin_password 
 4. At the wsadmin command line, use the following command to redeploy the RAVE component:
    $AdminApp update isc modulefile {-operation addupdate -contents /tmp/dash.ravewidget.war -contenturi dash.ravewidget.war -usedefaultbindings -contextroot /DASHRaveWidget -MapWebModToVH {{.* .* default_host}}} 
 5. Save your settings and quit from the wsadmin command line, as follows:  1.  $AdminApp save 
     2.  $AdminApp quit 
    
    
 6. Start the WebSphere Application Server instance associated with your Dashboard Application Services Hub environment:  * At the command line, change to JazzSM_HOME/profile/bin and run the following command:
       ./startServer.sh|bat server1
