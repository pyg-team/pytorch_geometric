APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM CONTENT COLLECTOR READS THE MAIL BOX SIZE INCORRECTLY FOR
   ABOVE THE MAIL BOX SIZE OF 4G.. ICC reads the mailbox property
   PR_MESSAGE_SIZE to identify the size of the mailbox. That
   property is of type PT_LONG (an unsigned long in C), which can
   have a maximum value of 4294967295 (hex FFFFFFFF). This is
   correct for mailboxes up to 4 GB. So mailboxes exceeding 4 GB
   always report a size of 4294967295.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NO WORK AROUND
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When IBM Content Collector is configured to process mailboxes
   from Microsoft Exchange server, setting the store constraints to
    4GB or higher  in the collection sources does not work. IBM
   Content Collector uses mailbox property PR_MESSAGES_SIZE to get
   mailbox's size, and the maximum value it can hold is 4294967295.
    If mailbox's size is larger than 4GB,  the property
   PR_MESSAGES_SIZE cannot reflect the correct mailbox size, and
   IBM Content Collector will not collect messages from the mailbox
    accordingly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, IBM Content Collector uses a combination
    logic of property PR_MESSAGE_SIZE_EXTENDED (introduced since
   Outlook 2003 SP1) and property PR_MESSAGE_SIZE to get mailbox's
   size. Thus the Store Constraints configuration  for 4GB or
   higher can take effective.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
