 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on June 11, 2015 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor. IBM FileNet System Monitor/IBM Enterprise Content Management System Monitor has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-1789 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1789]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted certificate or CRL to trigger a segmentation fault.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103779] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
CVEID: CVE-2015-1790 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1790]DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of missing inner EncryptedContent by the PKCS#7 parsing code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs with missing content to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103780 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103780] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1792 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1792]DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when verifying a signedData message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an unknown hash function OID to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103781 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103781] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
