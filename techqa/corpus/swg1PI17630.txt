APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Currently the documentation for format of the dbadmin command in
   "Configuring the Rational DOORS database server" has Quotation
   marks for all -dcnBrokerUri and -dcnChannelName parameters.

   Format specified in the above Link: dbadmin -dcnEnable -data
   port@DOORSserver -P server_password -dcnBrokerUri
   &#65411;  tcp://broker:61616&#65411;   -dcnChannelName &#65411;  dcn&#65411;   -dwaHost
   DWAserver &#65411;  dwaPort port &#65411;  dwaProtocol http or https
   
   However, an error "CRCRD7222E Unable to connect to broker" is
   displayed when accessing File > OSLC > Working Sets
   if the dbadmin command has been run with the value for
   -dcnBrokerUri parameter enclosed within double quotes.
   Hence, these double quotes need to be removed for the value of
   -dcnBrokerUri parameter.
   
   It has also been observed that if the value of -dcnChannelName
   which is dcn by default, is enclosed within double quotes,
   though the ETL job completes and says its successful, no data
   would have been transferred to the Data Warehouse.  Hence, the
   double quotes need to be removed for the value of
   -dcnChannelName parameter.
