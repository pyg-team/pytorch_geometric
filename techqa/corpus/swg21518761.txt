QUESTION
 When should I run startCluster.sh/cmd when using a GIS cluster? 

ANSWER


The startCluster.sh/cmd is to be run:

1. When installing a new version of GIS and after applying the first patch that the new GIS system will have. You may use the following command in this scenario for node 1 (you will use the numerical 2, 3, etc for the rest of the nodes in your cluster): startCluster.sh/cmd 1

2. After applying a patch in the cluster. You may use the following command in this scenario for node 1 (you will use the numerical 2, 3, etc for the rest of the nodes in your cluster): startCluster.sh/cmd 1 false

For item 1, this command will perform database updates that are meant to be run on a database that only has system BPs, Services and Adapters. Please note that the "false" flag needs to be run any other time you run this command on your already installed cluster for all your nodes.

This command is not required to be run everytime you start a node in the cluster.
