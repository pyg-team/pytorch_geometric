APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Windows Installation Guide states the following to
   start/stop the ISC in Chapter 2 Starting and Stopping the
   Console Server and Console Help:
   .
   To start Integrated Solutions Console system servers, enter:
   <isc_home>\PortalServer\bin\startISC.bat ISC_Portal <iscadmin>
   <iscpass>
   To stop Integrated Solutions Console system servers, enter:
   <isc_home>\PortalServer\bin\stopISC.bat ISC_Portal <iscadmin>
   <iscpass>
   .
   This method can be used to start/stop the ISC, however if
   Terminal Service (Remote Desktop) is being used to connect to
   the Windows machine, and if the ISC is started via the command
   line with the startISC.bat command, the ISC process will end
   when the Terminal Service session is logged off.
   .
   Initial Impact: Low
   TSM Versions Affected: All ISC/Admin Center users on Windows
   Additional Keywords: halts crashes stops stopped ends ended
                        not running

   menu (Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools >

   .
   IBM WebSphere Application Server V6 - ISC 6.0.1 Runtime Service
   ISC 6.0.1 Help Service

   Console server stops when you log off the Terminal Services
   session.
   
   To start or stop Integrated Solutions Console system servers
   using the Windows Services utility, go to Settings -->
