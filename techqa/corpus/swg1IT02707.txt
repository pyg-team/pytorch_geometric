APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Similar to APAR IC94205 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC94205], this APAR provides an option to disable
   Advanced Message Security (AMS) interception within the
   WebSphere MQ classes for JMS and classes for Java clients.
   
   Disabling AMS client side can be used to prevent attempts to
   open the AMS queue named SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE and
   causing back level (pre-V7.5) queue managers to report the
   MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME (2085) reason code.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of applications which are utilising the WebSphere MQ
   classes for Java/JMS APIs to communicate with WebSphere MQ.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform, AIX, HP-UX Itanium, Linux on Power, Linux on
   S390, Linux on x86, Linux on x86-64, Linux on zSeries, Solaris
   SPARC, Solaris x86-64, Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   APAR IC94205 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC94205] added an environment property which controlled the
   action of WebSphere MQ 7.5 and later client applications when
   using the MQ APIs to communicate with a queue manager, with
   respect to the looking up of policy queues to check for the use
   of Advanced Message Security (AMS).
   
   This environment property for the JMS environment is:
   
       com.ibm.mq.cfg.AMQ_DISABLE_CLIENT_AMS
   
   and could be set to the value "true" to prevent the client
   application from attempting to look up the:
   
     SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE
   
   on the queue manager, which would result in a MQRC 2085
   'MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME' if the queue manager was not AMS
   enabled.
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC94205 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC94205]
   
   
   For example, if you are using a JMS application, you can disable
   the AMS function from the application by using the syntax:
   
     java -Dcom.ibm.mq.cfg.AMQ_DISABLE_CLIENT_AMS=true
   <myapplication>
   
     where <myapplication> is the name of the application class.
   
   APAR IC94205 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC94205] did not permit the environment property to be
   configured within the mqclient.ini file.
   
   The code change associated with this APAR (IT02707) adds the
   ability to disable Java client side AMS interception within the
   mqclient.ini used by the WebSphere MQ classes for Java/JMS
   application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The AMS behaviour can now be controlled using the mqclient.ini
   file, using the property name "DisableClientAMS" under the
   "Security" stanza.
   
   For example, to disable the AMS behaviour (and prevent the
   client application attempting to open the
   "SYSTEM.PROTECTION.POLICY.QUEUE" queue), you could add the
   following text to the mqclient.ini file used by the Java
   application:
   
   
   Security:
     DisableClientAMS = No|Yes
