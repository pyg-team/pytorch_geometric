QUESTION
 Are there properties in Maximo that may affect how outgoing emails are displayed? 

ANSWER
If you experience unusual problems with the way emails are displaying after being sent from Maximo then you should check the value of the mxe.email.content.type property in your system properties.
For example some users find that emails sent from Communications and Communication Templates are removing carriage returns. 

The mxe.email.content.type property is the only property which is applicable to outgoing emails. If you have the property set to text/html and you experience problems try setting this property to text/plain.
Note this property is system wide. All emails sent will have this content type. It cannot be text/html for some emails and text/plain for others; it's one setting or the other.
