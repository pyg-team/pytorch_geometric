QUESTION
 For event logs, is there a limit to the size of a Syslog message that QRadar can accept? 

ANSWER
QRadar can receive Syslog event messages of various sizes, but all Appliances are configured with a default maximum event size. If the event is sent with the UDP protocol, the event size will be based on the maximum length of a UDP packet. Messages that are larger than the maximum size of the RFC specification for the TCP and UDP protocol have their event payloads truncated to ensure that QRadar can receive the event.
Maximum event size by protocol:


 * UDP syslog messages should not exceed 1024 bytes 
 * TCP syslog messages should not exceed 8192 bytes. 


To verify if an event is being truncated for packet length, Administrators can compare the results of a tcpdump with the event payload recorded for the Log Source in the Log Activity tab. 

To use tcpdump to view syslog events:  1. Using SSH, log in to the Console as the root user. 
 2. To view Syslog events, type the following command: tcpdump -A -s 0 host $IP and port 514 
    
    Replace $IP with the IP address of the device sending the Syslog events.
    
    

Note: If the device is sending events to a Managed Host in the network, you must SSH to the Managed Host from the Console, then open an SSH session to the Managed Host and run the tcpdump command. 

If you require the use of an expanded payload you can switch from UDP to TCP which allows 4096 bytes. If this payload length is not large enough there are ways you can increase the payload length. 


HOW TO ADJUST THE MAXIMUM TCP PAYLOAD SIZE FOR 7.2.6 AND ABOVE

 * Procedure
 *  Log into QRadar Web User Interface. Click on the Admin tab. Click on the System Settings icon. Click Advanced. From the list or parameters, adjust the Max TCP Syslog Payload Length field.
   
   NOTE: Do NOT increase this value above 8096 bytes without a recommendation from QRadar Customer Support.

   From theAdmintab, selectAdvanced > Deploy Full Configuration. After services restart, the Managed Hosts are updated to allow TCP packets that are up to 8192 bytes in length without truncation.
