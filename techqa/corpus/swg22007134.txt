ABSTRACT
 Some updates were made to the zSecure V2.3.0 documentation. 

CONTENT
zSecure CARLa Command Reference 

 * MEMBER: Library Change Detection 
   The following field description was added: 
   
   RMODE
   This field contains the residency mode of the load module. It is 24 or ANY for
   load modules, and 24, ANY or 64 for program objects. It is only available for
   load modules and program objects (LOADMOD=YES).
   
   
 * SMF: SMF records 
   The following field descriptions were added or updated: 
   
   ACF2_USER_ANY_UID_STRING
   This repeating field returns all the UID strings that the ACF2 logon ID
   specified in field USER has in the ACF2 LID database that is allocated for the
   system (SMF ID) in the SMF record. The default and maximum width is 24.
   See also field ANY_UID_STRING for the ACF2LID newlist.
   
   FIPS_MODE
   FIPS 140 mode enablement level. This field is found in TCP connection
   termination (119-2), FTP client transfer completion (119-3), CSSMTP connection
   (119-49), FTP server transfer completion (119-70), and FTP server logon failure
   (119-72) SMF records. The field also exists with zERT connection detail (119-11)
   SMF records that have TLS or SSH protocol attributes sections, reflecting the
   highest FIPS 140 mode enablement level found in these sections. See
   SSH_FIPS_MODE for the possible values of the FIPS_MODE field.
   
   FIPS140
   This flag field indicates whether the connection is compliant with FIPS 140. It
   is set for SMF 119 subtypes 2, 3, 49, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, and 76 if the transfer was
   done with FIPS 140 compliant encryption. It also exists with zERT connection
   detail records (SMF record type 119, subtype 11) that have TLS protocol, SSH
   protocol, or IPsec attributes sections, reflecting whether at least one of these
   sections indicates FIPS 140 mode enablement. This field is an alias name for
   CSSMTP_CN_FIPS140.
   
   IKE_VERSION replaces IKE_MAJOR_VERSION and IKE_MINOR_VERSION: 
   IKE_VERSION
   Major and minor version of the IKE protocol in use. This field is found in
   zERT connection detail records (SMF record type 119, subtype 11) that have an
   IPsec attributes section.
   The field is missing if the connection is protected by a manual tunnel, or if the
   distributor or target of the connection is a pre-V2R3 z/OS image and
   Sysplex-Wide Security Associations (SWSA) are used in a sysplex with
   mixed-level z/OS images.
   
   Table. SMF record type 119: Connectivity Statistics SUBTYPEs
   The following row was added: Subtype Meaning 11 zERT Connection Cetails 
   Table. Predefined SMF record types: fields available by record types 66-119, HSM Functions, and ACF2
   119 was added for FIPS_MODE and FIPS140.
   


zSecure Messages Guide 

The following messages were added or updated: 

C2P0145I Restart scheduled for data collection 
tasks 
Explanation: This message indicates that the Stage 1 
CARLa task and the Reporting task will be restarted at 
the end of the interval as the result of an operator 
REFRESH command. Messages C2P0509I indicates 
completion of the REFRESH request. 

CKF223I Skipping module name1 [ name2 ] at 
< address > ASID= asid tag= tag - no 
RMODE64 support yet. 
Explanation: This message can be issued in response 
to an INFO request. RMODE64 modules are not yet 
supported for CHECK=Y and SCAN=Y, as CKFCOLL is 
a 31-bit program. 
Severity: 00 

CKF512I SYMKEYTEST will not be performed. It 
requires CPACF. 
Explanation: The CKFCOLL program was not able to 
perform the symmetric key usability test for encrypted 
data sets. This function requires an IBM zEnterprise 
z196 or later system with both the CP Assist for 
Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) feature enabled and 
the Crypto Express3 Feature or later installed. 
Severity: 00 

CKF513I SYMKEYTEST will not be performed. 
CPACF misses support for AES XTS. 
Explanation: The CKFCOLL program was not able to 
perform the symmetric key usability test for encrypted 
data sets. CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions 
(CPACF) misses support for AES XTS. This function 
requires an IBM zEnterprise z196 or later system with 
both the CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions 
(CPACF) feature enabled and the Crypto Express3 
Feature or later installed. 
Severity: 00 

CKF514I Dataset: encryption cell misses 
verification code 
Explanation: The code found an empty encryption cell 
in the catalog, so it could not perform the symmetric 
key usability test for the respective data set. It is likely 
that this data set has not been opened yet, or it is not 
encrypted. 
Severity: 00 

CKF515I Unexpected CSNBKRR2 abend code 
Explanation: This message is issued if a failure occurs 
during a call to the CSNBKRR2 ICSF service routine in 
order to read a key token. 
User response: Inspect the abend code for indications 
about the cause of the error and refer to z/OS 
Cryptographic Services Integrated Cryptographic Service 
Facility Application Programmer's Guide. 
Severity: 08 

CKF516I Dataset: CSNBKRR2 failed on: key_label , 
RT: retcode , RS: reascode 
Explanation: The code could not perform the 
symmetric key usability test for the respective data set. 
A failure occurred during a call to the CSNBKRR2 ICSF 
service routine in order to read the token of key_label. 
Return and reason codes for the CSNBKRR2 routine are 
documented in z/OS Cryptographic Services Integrated 
Cryptographic Service Facility Application Programmer's 
Guide. 
User response: Inspect the abend code for indications 
about the cause of the error. 
Severity: 04 

CKF517I Number of encrypted data sets tested: 
number1 ( number2 can be decrypted on 
this system, number3 cannot, and 
number4 have empty encr. cells) 
Explanation: This message shows the number of 
encrypted data sets for which the symmetric key 
usability test was performed. It specifies how many 
data sets can or cannot be decrypted on this system, 
and how many have empty encryption cells. 

CKR2165 ISPF variable not allowed here 
Explanation: An ISPF variable is not allowed when 
defining quote triggers or replacement characters 
strings. 
Severity: 12 

CKR2166 String to be replaced cannot be empty 
Explanation: For the REPLACE_CHAR and 
QUOTE_REPLACE_CHAR print options, the string to 
be replaced (that is, the first in a replacement pair) 
must not be empty. 
Severity: 12
