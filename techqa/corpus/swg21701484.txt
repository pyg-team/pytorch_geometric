SUMMARY
 The RC4 "Bar Mitzvah" Attach for SSL/TLS affects IBM Rational Connector for SAP Solution Manager. You should configure the product to eliminate these weak ciphers. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
Description: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
Rational SAP Connector 4.0.0.x (4.0.0.1, 4.0.0.2, 4.0.0.3, 4.0.0.4, 4.0.0.5, 4.0.0.6)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Update to the latest fix pack: SAP Connector version 4.0.0.7 [https://jazz.net/downloads/sap-connector/releases/4.0.0.7] 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You can alter the server.xml to force Tomcat to use more secure Ciphers.


 1. Open the server.xml file located in Tomcat conf directory 
 2. Locate the <Connector port="9443" section 
 3. Remove "SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA" from the list of ciphers. Consult with your security team to determine if the cipher suites defined for the Rational SAP Connector are adequate for your individual situation.


You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
