APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When ITCAM for Transactions MQ agent coexists with Omegamon
   for Messaging, problems can occur if ITCAM for Transactions
   is started before the OMM MQ agent and the stopped before
   the OM MQ agent.  See related OMM APAR OA30995 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1OA30995].
   
   
   
   
   Problem symptoms may include:
   
   19.10.21 STC25138 +CSQX037E LTW1 CSQXSPRM Unable to get message
   from 523 SYSTEM.CHANNEL.INITQ, MQCC=2 MQRC=2195
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Ensure that the OMM MQ agent is started before ITCAM for
   Transactions MQ agent.
   Note: There may be other applications that can cause this
   issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All ITCAM for Transactions 7.2 Transaction   *
   *                 Tracking for MQ customers.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An ABEND can occur in the MQI or        *
   *                      WMQ address space if ITCAM for          *
   *                      Transactions is activated in            *
   *                      conjunction with another MQ             *
   *                      monitoring product (such as             *
   *                      Omegamon for Messaging) and             *
   *                      is subsequently stopped before          *
   *                      the other monitoring product.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   During termination (or when an MQ agent is deactivated)
   ITCAM for Transactions will clean up its exit environment an
   free modules and associated storage.  If another product
   has updated the RMFT table and stored the ITCAM for
   Transactions exit details then this clean up will cause MQI
   abends when ITCAM for Transactions is called.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ITCAM for Transactions will now set its exit environment to
   a dormant state when there is the possibility of being called
   from another RMRQ user.
