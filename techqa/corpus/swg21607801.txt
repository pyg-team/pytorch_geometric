PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you install IBM® WebSphere® Transformation Extender for Integration Servers and deploy integration elements into versions of WebSphere Application Server-based applications earlier than V8.0 (such as WebSphere Business Process Manager), the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender runtime integration elements do not display within the WebSphere Application Server plugin collection. 

SYMPTOM
After you install WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers and deploy integration elements into a WebSphere Application Server-based application, the OSGi command line console does not display the WebSphere Transformation Extender primitive as present or resolved.


CAUSE
The OGSi framework used by WebSphere Application Server-based applications varies across versions, and has different requirements for properly interpreting Eclipse link files.

ENVIRONMENT
WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers installed and deployed against versions of WebSphere Application Server-based applications earlier than version 8.0.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After you install WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers and deploy integration elements into a WebSphere Application Server-based application, the OSGi command line console does not display the WebSphere Transformation Extender primitive as present or resolved.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM






Before you use the following procedure to resolve the problem, ensure that you: 

 1. Installed WebSphere Transformation Extender for Integration Servers. 
 2. Deployed integration elements into the target WebSphere Application Server-based application. 
 3. Augmented the profile using the "WTX_template." 


To resolve the problem: 

1. Open a command window and navigate to the WAS_HOME/links directory. 

2. Confirm the presence of the wtx_wesb.link file. This Eclipse link file indicates that you successfully deployed WebSphere Transformation Extender runtime integration elements. 

3. Copy the Eclipse link file: 

 *  On Microsoft Windows systems: copy wtx_wesb.link wtx_wesb75.link 
   
   On UNIX® systems: cp wtx_wesb.link wtx_wesb75.link
   
   

4. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad or vi on UNIX) to edit the wtx_wesb75.link file. The link file contains a single line:  * 
 * 
 * WTX_install_directory
 * 


5. Remove the trailing " /eclipse" and save the modified link file. 6. Navigate to the binaries directory of the WebSphere Application Server-based application execution profile in use: 

 *  On Windows systems: WAS_HOME\profiles\execution_profile_name\bin 
   
   On UNIX systems: WAS_HOME/profiles/execution_profile_name/bin
   
   

7. Clear any previously cached application bundle information:  *  On Windows systems, run: osgiCfgInit.bat -all 
   
   On UNIX systems, run: osgiCfgInit.sh -all
   
   

8. Clear any prior cached class information:  *  On Windows systems, run: clearClassCache.bat 
   
   On UNIX systems, run: clearClassCache.sh
   
   

9. Start the OSGi console:  *  On Windows systems, run: osgiConsole.bat 
   
   On UNIX systems, run: osgiConsole.sh
   
   

10. Confirm the presence of the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender runtime primitive integration elements by running the "short status" display command:  osgi> ss 

 * 


The WebSphere Transformation Extender runtime primitive bundle information should be present in the status subcommand output, and the bundle state should display as resolved.
