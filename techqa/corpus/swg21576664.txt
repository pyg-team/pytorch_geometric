QUESTION
 How do I change alarm settings on the IBM Mantra appliance (internal notes)? 

ANSWER
For a description of paging and high CPU alarms, refer to the document referenced below, What do I do if I receive high CPU or paging activity alarms? In addition to viewing or changing thresholds, as discussed in that article, note the following: 

 * You can disable an alarm. For example: no stats alarm paging. 
 * You can use stats alarmâ€¦rate-limit to restrict the flow of alarm notifications. 
 * You can change the sampling interval with stats sample paging interval seconds.
