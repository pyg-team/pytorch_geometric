Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability (CVE-2015-0138) may affect some configurations of IBM WebSphere Partner Gateway Advanced/Enterprise. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
