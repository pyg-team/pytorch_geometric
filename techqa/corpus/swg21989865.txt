CAUSE
One of the following can be the cause: 

 
1. IMM cable
2. Routing
3. IMM configuration




ENVIRONMENT
IBM PureData System for Analytics N3001-001 (mako lite)




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM



The following can be done to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. 


1. Check the IMM ports if properly cabled
> try swapping the IMM cables of HA1 and HA2

2. Reset IMM of of the affected host
3. Try to reboot the affected host
4. Re-run /opt/nz-hwsupport/install_tools/nz-rmgt.pl on the affected host to reconfigure the IMM networks settings
5. Replace the systemboard of the affected host

If the ping is finally okay, you should clear the fencing route resource error. See TechNote 1691660
