RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Document: Openpages 5.1 Release Notes Topic: Known Issues Area: Workflow The "OR" Operator does not work in Spawn Job Nodes [2325] Description: When you are defining the filter criteria for a Spawn Job Node, the "OR" operator has no effect on the list of objects that satisfy the criteria for starting a Job. Workaround: Put the property check at the beginning of the child workflow. For example, if you want to spawn child jobs for any Control that has an Effective value of "Ineffective" or "Not Determined". Instead of putting this filter criteria in the Spawn Job Node, you would create the first node in the child Control workflow as a conditional node which checks for the condition. Job Templates cannot be "re-assigned" to a different Object Type after creation [2285] Description: After creating a Job Template, the assigned Object Type cannot be changed. Workaround: Even if you change the Object Type specified for the Job Template, the various sections of the template (conditional nodes, java actions, Spawn Job nodes, etc.) still refer to the original Object Type - they do not update to match the assigned Object Type referred in the Job Template. Removing attachments from Workflow Jobs [8631] Description: Attachments that are associated with workflow jobs cannot be removed. Workaround: None. 3.1 workflow templates can throw exception when loaded [12489] Description: The graphical UI will show a ClassNotFound exception when loading a 3.1 workflow template that uses the GetMetaData or AssignTask Java actions. Workaround: OpenPages 5.0 provides built-in support for this functionality, and the Java action should be replaced with the new functionality. See the OpenPages Governance Platform Administrator Guide for more information. Superfluous navigation arrows are displayed [12568] Description: If you view a page that lists Tasks or Jobs, the clickable arrows are displayed, even if there are not enough tasks or jobs listed to require a second page. Workaround: None. Extra button displayed for Voting Task with one path [13316] Description: If you include a Voting Task with only one exit path, the UI creates and displays two buttons with the same name when the task is assigned. Workaround: You can remove the un-necessary button by editing the job type and changing the outgoing arrow destination. You will see two choices in the Decision pane, one with the new destination and one with the old destination. Remove the one you don�t want and change the arrow back to the original destination if desired. Save your changes and exit the editor. Large groups may exceed the maximum length limit of the Assignee field [13321] Description: The workflow system has a 1000 character limit assigned to the value of the �Assignee� field. Assigning a Task to a very large group can potentially exceed this limit. Workaround: None. New Workflow job types can only be submitted after logging out and back in [1117] Description: If a Workflow job type is created while a user is logged in, the new job type cannot be submitted from an object until the user logs out of the application and back in again. Workaround: None. If a user name is too long (more than 64 characters), some actions will fail. [1612] Description: A message such as �The job could not be created� appears when a username exceeds the Workflow limit of 64 characters. Workaround: Limit user names to 64 characters.
