QUESTION
 What secure protocol versions of TLS and SSL are supported for use with the Security(Tivoli) Directory Server? 

ANSWER
 

 1. Security Directory Server in SDS VA 8.0.1 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3Q78_8.0.1/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc_8.0.1/ds_ag_srv_adm_nist_ds_tls_11_12.html], Security Directory Server V6.4 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVJJU_6.4.0/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc_6.4/ds_ag_srv_adm_nist_ds_tls_11_12.html] and V6.3.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVJJU_6.3.1.5/com.ibm.IBMDS.doc_6.3.1.5/ds_ag_srv_adm_nist_ds_tls_11_12.html] supports TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 as well as SSL v3. 
    
    
 2. Tivoli Directory Server V6.3 is enhanced to support TLS 1.2 (and also TLS 1.1) in 6.3.0.17 (and later 6.3.0.* fix levels, including the latest recommended fix level) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27009778#ver63] in addition to TLS 1.0 and SSL V3. Refer to the following documentation for additional details:
    IBM Tivoli Directory Server support for NIST SP 800-131A [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610440]
    
    
 3. Tivoli Directory Server V6.3 (levels below 6.3.0.17), V6.2 and V6.1 supports TLS 1.0 and SSL V3 with the list of ciphers in the table below:

 *  Encryption level Attribute Supported SSL / TLS Version AES 256-bit encryption ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: AES SSLV3/TLS1.0 Triple DES encryption with a 168-bit key and a SHA-1 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: TripleDES-168 SSLV3/TLS1.0 AES 128-bit encryption ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: AES-128 SSLV3/TLS1.0 RC4 encryption with a 128-bit key and a SHA-1 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: RC4-128-SHA SSLV3/TLS1.0 RC4 encryption with a 128-bit key and a MD5 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: RC4-128-MD5 SSLV3/TLS1.0 DES encryption with a 56-bit key and a SHA-1 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: DES-56 SSLV3/TLS1.0 RC2 encryption with a 40-bit key and a MD5 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: RC2-40-MD5 SSLV3/TLS1.0 RC4 encryption with a 40-bit key and a MD5 MAC ibm-slapdSslCipherSpec: RC4-40-MD5 SSLV3/TLS1.0
