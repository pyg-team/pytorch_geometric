APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem seems with the authority that the default userid
   IBMMON_AGENT has. An additional authority has to be added to the
   existing userid/profile to get the alerts in TEP.
   
   Please advise the customer to follow the below instructions with
   the help of SAP sysadmin and report us back the outcomes -
   
   The userid calling the CCMS monitor needs the following SAP
   authority to be able to receive this central CCMS data.
   
   Authority object = S_CCM_RECEIVE (Authorizations for
   Transferring Central SysRepos Data) , activity = P0 (Accept
   CCMS CSM data) and table = DUMMY (Table name) - we should used
   table = * just to be sure we have all authority covered.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Workaround -
   
   Modify ZITM_610AUTH profile to include the missing authority. We
   create the IBMMON_AGENT userid and assign it the ZITM_610AUTH
   profile (not the role)
   
   If the customer prefers to use maintain the ZITM_610AUTH role
   they can add the missing authority to our role but the
   ZITM_610AUTH role must then be added to the IBMMON_AGENT userid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The agent provided role and profile, ZITM_610AUTH, did not have
   the authorities required to obtain alerts from a Centralized
   CCMS system. This resulted in missing alerts in the Alets
   Workspace. The required authorities have been added to both the
   ZITM_610AUTH role and ZITM_610AUTH profile and thus the
   IBMMON_AGENT userid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR has been fixed and delivered in a limited availability
   fix 6.1.0-TIV-ITM_SAP-LA0009. This maintenance delivery vehicle
