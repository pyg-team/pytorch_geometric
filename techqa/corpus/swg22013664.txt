QUESTION
 When testing Automation Scripts on a clustered environment is there a delay for the scripts to cache? 

ANSWER
Some clients have noted a delay for script changes to take effect on a clustered environment. You may need to allow some time for the script to be cached and propagated to all Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instances in a clustered environment. Users may also experience a delay on non-clustered environments depending on how long it takes the environment to be refreshed.
Maximo implements a script cache that loads the Java byte code representation of a script into memory. This cache enables script execution to be more efficient. The script cache is refreshed under certain conditions. Caching was implemented to improve performance, so every time a script is executed you do not incur a database read. For a busy system it may take a few cycles for the cache to be updated. Please see the Developerworks blog for more details on script caching and propagation in a clustered environment.

The script caching can not be turned off. and you may need to wait for the cache to sync, this could be a few minutes.
