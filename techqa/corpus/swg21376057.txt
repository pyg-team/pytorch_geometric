Title: IBM Certificate chain fails WPG Console validation - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A certificate chain of Root, Intermediate and Leaf, is uploaded in WPG using the Community Console. The Root certificates passes the Console validation check, whereas the Intermediate and Leaf fail with error: "Certificate is not valid. Cert path validation failed". In spite of the above error, the Intermediate and Leaf certificates still show "This certificate is valid" status. 

The log shows the following errors:
- [8/20/08 22:43:25:921 UTCM 00000073 CertPathUtil E com.ibm.bcg.util.CertPathUtil validateCertPathWithReset CertPathValidatorException : 
- [8/20/08 22:43:26:062 UTCM 00000073 PKCS7Util E com.ibm.bcg.util.PKCS7Util checkCertificateValidity Got exception 
- [8/20/08 22:43:25:921 UTCM 00000073 SystemErr R java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: The revocation status of the certificate with subject (CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA, OU=Terms of use at https://www.verisign.com/rpa [https://www.verisign.com/rpa] (c)05, OU=VeriSign Trust Network, O="VeriSign, Inc.", C=US) could not be determined. 

SYMPTOM
Certificate chain fails WPG Console validation

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The validation error was issued because the revocation status of both certificates: Intermediate and Leaf, could not be determined. 

To resolve the problem one of the following 2 options are necessary:
1 - Both CRLDP files need to be placed in the local "common/security/crl" folder, then restart WPG.
2 - Enable remote CRLDP using the following command syntax: wsadmin.bat -conntype NONE -f <path>\bcghub-<mode>\scripts\bcgSetCRLDP.jacl install <nodename> <servername> CRLDP true

If the above do not resolve the error, then disable the revocation check setting property: "bcg.checkRevocationStatus=false" in the WPG Console, under the System Administration - > Common tab
