ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  It is not possible to open customer Access project in RSA
   Customer ReqPro version: 7.0.0.0
   RSA version: 6.0.1.1  ifix004 applied
   I am attaching to this escalation the customer db and model,
   siemens.zip.  Project opens fine in ReqPro, but when opening in
   RSA the error below appears (at about 22%)
   Opening project... (Error: An internal error occurred during:
   "Opening project...")
   After changing the database to SqlServer with
   datatransportWizard, it is then possible to open the project.
   Switching back to Access we get the original error.
   Can this be accepted as a defect?  I found defect RATLC00140029.
    This looks the same kind of thing, but this had been fixed in
   the RSA version the customer is using. We reproduced with the
   same version.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A customer was unable to open a Rational(R) RequisitePro(R)
   project based in Microsoft(R) Access(TM) in the integration
   with Rational Software Architect. This defect was caused by
   database tables that were not properly closed when loading
   the data from the database.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The tables are now properly closed while the loading the
   Rational RequisitePro project.
