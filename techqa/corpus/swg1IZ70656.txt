ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Native 711 implementation handles remote SSH login on Zone using
   VST
   parameter root.ssh_remote_login. If set to  yes , it configures
   remote
   SSH and creates SSH SAP for TPM s direct communication with
   zone. In
   our environment, we don t require this configuration so we set
   the
   parameter value to  no  as documented.
   However, workflow SolarisZone_Device_PowerOn checks whether zone
   is
   accessible or not by trying to execute a command on zone. If
   remote SSH
   is not configured, this will never work as there is no
   communication
   protocol configured for zone. This workflow unnecessarily waits
   for
   gracetime 20 minutes to check if zone is accessible.
   Suggestion:
   Instead of executing a command everytime, workflow should run
   the
   device execute command only if a default SAP is assigned to
   executecommand action. Essentially, it should not spend
   gracetime if
   remote SSH configuration is disabled.
   ..................................
   
   Looks like we need to modify SolarisZone_Device_PowerOn workflow
   to
   first check if a default SAP is assigned to executecommand
   action. And
   only then try to run the device execute command. I am going to
   send this
   PMR to L3 support and ask if we can make this change, or if
   there is
   some other solution. I will provide you an update.
   
   
   L3 created CQ94624 defect for this issue.
