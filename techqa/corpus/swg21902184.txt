QUESTION
 What's New in Framework Manager 10.2.2? 

ANSWER
New features in IBM Cognos 10.2.2 are mainly exclusive to Dynamic Query Mode (DQM) and include: 

 * Bridge Query Subjects – Now, obtaining correct results with bridge tables is simple. This can be achieved by setting the (DQM) Usage property of the query subject that represents the bridge to "Bridge". This will let the IBM Cognos BI server know that the associated table is a bridge table, not a fact table like the many side of a join normally implies, so that it can plan queries accordingly for correct results. This setting ensures no double counting and no missing entries. When a user applies a filter to a bridge in a multi-fact query, both fact tables will be filtered accordingly.

 * Filter Join Optimization – This feature is set with the (DQM) Filter Type setting in the properties of a relationship.

 *  The purpose of the filter join optimization is to improve performance by filtering the Many side of a join using the values retrieved on the One side of the join. This can minimize the amount of data retrieved by the Cognos BI server and local processing of that data, particularly when blending data from disparate data sources where the Many side has orders of magnitude more rows than the One side. 
 * Summary Query Subjects – A summary query subject, defined using the (DQM) Usage property of the query subject, allows you to specify grouping and aggregation of data in the metadata model in ways previously only possible in Report Studio and Cognos Workspace Advanced. This allows authors and self-service users to obtain the desired values that are aggregated on a specified grouping with drag-and-drop gestures instead of having to type explicit aggregate calculations. Now you can define complex aggregation once in the model and easily reuse it in as many reports as you want. Also, previously all filters defined in Framework Manager were detail filters. In other words, the filter was processed before any aggregation occurred. When a query subject is configured to be a Summary query subject, you can have an embedded filter applied before or after aggregation just like in the Cognos BI studios.

 * Parameter Map Freshness – Previously, parameter map values were cached for the duration of a user session, potentially resulting in stale results in the reports if the parameter map values on the underlying source had changed. Now it is possible to specify precisely (down to the second) how long parameter map values will be cached if at all. This feature is set on a new property for Parameter Maps called Freshness. See the documentation for settings. This feature applies to both Compatible Query Mode (CQM) and DQM.


The attached workshops and supporting files will focus on Bridge Tables, Filter Join Optimization, and Summary Query Subjects.
