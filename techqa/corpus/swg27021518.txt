Title: IBM OpenPages GRC Platform Version 6.0.1 Hardware Requirements for Database Server Systems - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document describes the hardware prerequisites for IBM® OpenPages® GRC Platform Version 6.0.1 database server systems. 

CONTENT
This document describes the recommended minimum hardware requirements for the 64-bit database server in a production environment, which requires the following: 

 * 64-bit operating system 
 * 64-bit Oracle® RDBMS 
 * Expandable RAM 
 * Expandable RAID data storage


When considering hardware requirements, we recommend that you plan for the future and purchase hardware that is expandable and can support future database growth. 

Although not required, OpenPages recommends a dedicated environment where the database server supports only the OpenPages application. 

Note: If the OpenPages database instance is running in a non-dedicated environment, the resources in the following tables must be allocated to the OpenPages database instance. 

Memory and Storage Requirements 

The following table shows the recommended minimum memory and storage requirements for a Microsoft® Windows®-based or IBM AIX®-based database server system, based on the size of the database. 

Memory and Storage Requirements: 64-bit Database Projected database size Memory (RAM) RAID data storage 1 to 50 GB 8GB 100GB 51 to 100 GB 16GB 200GB 101 to 200 GB 32GB 400GB 201 to 400 GB 64GB 800GB Greater than 400GB 16% of the maximum database size 2 times the database size 
Processor Requirements The hardware requirement tables below use the following conventions, in addition to any specific footnotes: 

 * Count infrequent users as 1/50 of a user. For example, for 20,000 licensed users assume 400 concurrent users (20,000/50). 
 * The number of concurrent users assumes 25% of the licensed users are using system concurrently. 
 * The minimum number of core processors is calculated using the higher end of the concurrent user range, assuming 8 cores for the first 400 users plus 2 cores for each 100 additional concurrent users.


The following table shows the minimum processor requirements for a Windows-based database server system.

The minimum core processor requirement is a dual-core Intel® Xeon® CPU 3.2 GHz. 

The following table shows the minimum processor requirements for an AIX-based database server system.

These calculations are based on P550 POWER6® TL4 system. 

Data Storage Requirements 

For data storage, we recommend a combination of RAID 1+0 (or 0+1) disks with at least 6 different drives. In typical RAID 1+0 or 0+1 configurations, approximately half (50%) of the drives would be used for mirroring the contents of the disks. 

A RAID 5 architecture can also be used with at least 4 different drives. In RAID 5, typically one drive would be used for parity data. 

Example 1: RAID 1+0 (or 0+1) 

If the projected database size is 54 GB, based on this hardware specification, approximately 108 GB (54 GB * 2) of usable storage space would be required. 

To achieve a usable storage capacity of approximately 108 GB, a total storage capacity of 216 GB (108 GB * 2) is needed as 50% of the available space would be used for mirroring. 

To determine the individual capacity of each drive, divide the total storage capacity by the number of hard drives to determine the individual capacity of each drive. In this example, it would be 6x36-GB RAID 1+0 (216 GB/6 hard drives=36 GB per drive). 

Example 2: RAID 5 or RAID 10 

Using the same projected database size of 54 GB as in the previous example but with a RAID 5 architecture, to achieve a usable storage capacity of approximately 108 GB, a total storage capacity of approximately 144 GB (108 + 36) is needed, one drive being used for parity data. 

In this example, it would be 4x36-GB RAID 5 drives (144 GB / 4 hard drives = 36 GB per drive). 

Network Bandwidth Requirements 

The following table shows the minimum bandwidth requirements for a Windows-based or AIX-based database server system.
