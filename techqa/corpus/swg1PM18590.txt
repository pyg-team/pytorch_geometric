ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Rhapsody 752(build 1471822) :
   If class 'Class1' is mapped to a source artifact 'File1.h' this
   works fine. If class 'Class2' has a usage-dependency to class 'C
   lass1' and 'Class2' is in the same Scope (generated by the same
   component) then the include statement in 'Class2' is generated p
   roperly. But if a 'Class4' that is outside the scope of 'Class1'
    wants to include 'Class1' (has a usage-dependency to it) then a
    wrong include statement is generated ( not 'File1.h' is include
   d but the standard name 'Class1.h').
   
   Here the incude is correct if both the packages are in scope. It
   s a regression from rhapsody version 7.5. Please find sample mod
   el attached
   
   Customer comment on including both the pakages in scope:
   1) There are about 100 existing components affected (all would h
   ave to be changed)
   2) Some of the packages that are marked as externals (and should
    not be generated at all) will be generated if I add them to the
    scope.
   3) If I use a source artifact in one package (for which code is
   generated) I definitely don't want all components (for which thi
   s source artifact is necessary) to add it to their scope. This w
   ould mean that all these components generate this package.
   
   The work around provided to have Source artifacts to be under th
   e class that they map. In the attached model, moving file 'File.
   h' under class class_2 will solve the problem.
   
   Customer comment on workaroud :
   Moving the files is not an option for me due to the fact that th
   en I will have the same files in many packages (all packages fro
   m which the 'ModelElement' that is mapped to the file is used).
   In the short example it would only be a move of File.h to class_
   2 but in our real project things are a little bit more compilcat
   ed.
   The only thing that helps is to get the fix as soon as possible.
