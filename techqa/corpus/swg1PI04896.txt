APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with Statistics 22 on Japanese locale and set unicode
   ON. You run a Propensity Score matching Python syntax. However,
   you notive that the Logistic Regression is not computed.
   Instead you receive this error on output viewer:
   
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<string>", line 21, in <module>
   ValueError: Logistic Regression step failed
   
   With Unicode set to OFF the same syntax runs fine on Japanese
   locale. Please aslo not this happens on Windows 7 64 bit
   operating system. With Windows 32 bit the same syntax works also
   for unicode ON.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS development. They revised PSM.spe
   (The custom dialog for Propensity Score Matching). They uploaded
   the revised Version to IBM DeveloperWorks Community. With
   Statistics 22 the installed version of PSM is 1.4.1. The new
   version they created is 1.4.2.
   
   PLEASE NOTE: you cannot use the old PSM syntax you used before.
   You need to install the new PSM bundle and then use the new
   dialog to paste new PSM syntax. This will work for Windows 64
   bit when Unicode is on.
   
   So please do the following:
   - Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and that
   you have an IBM web ID and password (the ID where you normally
   download Fixpacks from FixCentral or download from
   DeveloperWorks)
   - Delete your old PSM syntax file, it will no longer work
   - Launch Statistics 22 and click on Utilities > Extension
   Bundles > Download and Install Extension Bundles
   - A new dialog will occur called Download Extension bundles
   where you will see a list of downloadables
   - Locate PSM (Propensity Score Matching) and select to install
   it: latest version is 1.4.2 and the installed version is 1.4.1
   - Select Download and install selected extension bundles, click
   OK
   - Then you must enter your IBM ID and password and accept the
   Terms of Use, click OK
   - The bundle will be installed and you will be notified that the
   installation was successful. In Output Viewer you will see this
   log:
   
   PSM:Dialog installed to:
   C:\PROGRAM FILES\IBM\SPSS\STATISTICS\22\ext\lib\PSM.
   
   - Next, set locale to Japanese and Unicode ON.
   - Open the files you need for Propensity Score Matching
   - Click Data - Propensity Score Matching
   - Select the variables you used before and define the other
   necessary parameters on this dialog. Click OK and the analysis
   will be computed
   - You can then go back to the dialog and paste the new syntax
   for later usage.
