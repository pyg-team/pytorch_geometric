BIRT reports must be copied manually from the TCR 2.1.1 server to the JazzSM TCR server. To do that:  *  On the TCR 2.1.1 server tar/zip the <TIP Home>/../tipv2Components/TCRComponent/data directory. On the JazzSM/TCR server, make a backup of the <JazzSM Home>/reporting/data directory. Copy the tar/zip file from step 1 to the <JazzSM Home>/reporting/ and unpack it. Allow it to replace the contents of the existing data directory. 


No restart of JazzSM is required after the Cognos or BIRT procedures above.
