Title: IBM Unable to login to WebSphere Admin Console after wasadmin password change. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere is configured to use LDAP authentication. The WebSphere administrator's password was changed. The user ran the Information Server AppServerAdmin command to change the password to the new password but they still cannot get into WebSphere. The error is an LDAP error 49 data = 52e 

CAUSE
The AppServerAdmin command only changes the password for the WebSphere admin user. If the configuration uses the WebSphere admin user as the Bind DN user as well, you need to be sure to manually fix the password there as well.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Be sure to manually change the Bind password if the bind DN is the WAS admin user as well. It is a good practice to use a different bind DN than the wasadmin user so that if the password changes, you do not lock yourself out of WebSphere. If WAS has been restarted and you cannot get in do to this issue, you may need to stop WAS, turn security off, and restart and fix all the configuration.
