Title: IBM DASH component of Jazz SM startup failure - United States

Text:
TIPL2; TIPL2CONF; CAUGHT_EXCEPTION_WHILE; CONFIGURING_SSL_SERVER_SOCKET; UNABLE_TO_CREATE_SSL_SERVER_SOCKET; ORBX0390E TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Dashboard Application Service Hub(DASH) fails to start with the following error:

"ADMU7704E: ...the Windows Service...JazzSMProfileService failed to start. startServer return code = -1"

SystemOut: "CORBA.INTERNAL:UNABLE_TO_CREATE_SSL_SERVER_SOCKET" 

CAUSE
Port conflict. Another application is listening on one of the ports used by DASH

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the SystemOut log for the following exceptions corresponding to the startup attempt:

###

on port 16323 ]. 
###

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check to see what process is listening on port 16323 by opening the Windows Resource Monitor utility (Open Task Manager, and then on the Performance tab click the "Resource Monitor" button). If it's safe to do so, stop the process that is listening on that port. You'll want to update the corresponding application to use some other port range as DASH uses 163XX by default.
