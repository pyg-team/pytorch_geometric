 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Collaboration and deployment (CADS) server fails to start after a frech installation.


SYMPTOM
The configuration of a fresh CADS installation completes successfully but the CADS server fails to start. 

The CADS server fails to start with the message in the application server's server .log (jboss in this case) as illustrated in the example below:

10:16:44,471 INFO [org.apache.catalina.core] (MSC service thread 1-3) JBWEB001079: Container org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[jboss.web].[default-host].[/] has not been started
10:16:44,506 INFO [org.jboss.as] (MSC service thread 1-4) JBAS015950: JBoss EAP 6.1.0.GA (AS 7.2.0.Final-redhat-8) stopped in 85ms


CAUSE
Running a non-supported version of Java. for your application server. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

The application server's ( jboss-eap-6.1 in this case)' server. log contains a message showing which version of Java is used 
eg "java.runtime.version = 1.8.0_73-b02" . 

 

The CADS configuration log engine.log shows "All operations completed successfully" and contains no errors.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure you have a supported version of Java running for your application server. 

 
For example JBoss EAP 6.1.0 is not supported with Java 8. Jboss EAP 6.3.3 (supporting java 8) is not supported with CADS 6.0; CADS 6.0 only supports JBOSS eap 6.0 or JBOSS eap 6.1.
Consult the IBM product compatibility matrix to verify which application servers are supported for a specific version of CADS..


Once the proper supported version of Java has been installed, rerun the CADS configuration tool pointing to the new Java install
