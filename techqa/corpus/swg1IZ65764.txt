APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The NamingServiceHost in the props file is actually pointing to
   the CORBA's Naming Service Host, which sets up the connectivity
   to the CORBA server.
   
   
   
   To clarify this further the following actions are to be taken:-
   
   1. Update README to state that NamingServiceHost is the name of
   the machine where the CORBA Naming Service is running.
   
   2. Update the IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus Nokia NetAct 3GPP
   (CORBA):
   Reference Guide, under section 'Properties and command line
   options' to state that the NamingServiceHost is meant for CORBA.
   
   
   As for AlarmIrpName & NotificationIrpName, these 2 items in the
   props file can be different from system to system. For instance,
   they are configured as the following in our servers:-
   
   AlarmIrpName          :    'NokiaNetact3gppv6AlarmIRP'
   NotificationIrpName   :    'NokiaNetact3gppv6NotificationIRP'
