APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using CHLAUTH and WARN=YES is specified on a SVRCONN
   channel, a security violation may occur putting a message
   to SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT queue.
   
   When a second conversation using the same channel starts,
   and attempts to put an event message to
   SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT, because the XPWA now contains
   the channel's MCAUSER, this is used when opening the event
   queue, rather than the user the channel initiator is running
   under.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem can be avoided by setting SHARECNV(1) on the
   channel, so that no conversation sharing takes place.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere MQ for z/OS Version 7 *
   *                 Release 1 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ICH408I is issued when a CHLAUTH event  *
   *                      message is generated by a multiplexed   *
   *                      svrconn channel, and no event message   *
   *                      is put to SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT    *
   *                      The ICH408I shows the MCAUSER was       *
   *                      used when putting the event message.    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When generating an event message as the result of a CHLAUTH rule
   matching, the event message should be put to
   SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT using the channel initiator's user
   id, which should have sufficient authority to put to this queue.
   However, when multiple conversations share an instance of a
   svrconn channel (i.e. SHARECONV > 1), event messages generated
   by the second and subsequent conversations incorrectly use the
   channel MCAUSER when putting to the event queue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  rsiEvent is changed to put CHLAUTH event messages to
   SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT using the channel initiator's userid
   when multiple conversations are sharing a channel.
