APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Support Engineer:  GBH
   Change Team Eng:   EJ
   
   Environment:
   Reported against v2.2.0.8, but the problem would be possible in
   all versions/releases/fixpacks up to and including 3.1.0.4
   
   
   Problem:
   TSAMP does not start / stop the resource in automatic mode even
   though conditions are met.
   
   The problem is a result of a communication issue between
   RecoveryRM (that drives the automation decisions) and
   the GblResRM (that controls the Application and ServiceIP
   resources).
   
   From the trace we see, that the RecoveryRM cannot successfully
   verify the resources after startup, because it cannot talk to
   the GblResRM ... here is the message which is found for each
   individual constituent in the trace:
   
   [00] 07/07/09 15:08:45.903231 T(4149912800)
   _RCDQryClsPAttrResp::processResponse Error. error=0x4000a,
   msg=2610-422 Cannot execute the command on node
   node1.domain.com. The resource manager IBM.GblResRM
   is not available.
   
   IBM.GblResRM is running and tracing. In this situation, the
   resources can be listed using the commands 'lsrg' or 'lssam',
   but the resources are still 'invalid' from the point of view of
   the automation manager, and so the samdiag reports the resources
   are not loaded, and thus will not be automated.
   
   In this situation, it is best to restart the RecoveryRM, so that
   the communication can be established again from the beginning.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In this situation, it is best to restart the RecoveryRM, so that
   the communication can be established again from the beginning.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   * During startup of System Automation a communication problem
   * may happen in very rare cases between the IBM.RecoveryRM and
   * the IBM.GblResRM. As a result, the resources of System
   * Automation can be listed with 'lssam', but there will be no
   * automation (start), as the resources are still seen as invalid
   * internally.

   * RECOMMENDATION:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The internal communication between the System Automation daemons
   IBM.RecoveryRM and IBM.GblResRM has been modified to address
   this issue.
   .
   The official fix is included in fix pack 5 of System
   Automation for Multiplatforms 3.1.
