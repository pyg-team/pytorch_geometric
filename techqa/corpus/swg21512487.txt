Text:
RHEL5 RHEL6 ksh shell Tivoli Monitoring Agent for Linux TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which Shell is required to install the Linux OS agent on Red Hat Linux 5 or Red Hat Linux 6? 

CAUSE
Installation of the agent fails with the error message
[root@aw-mqha CZF7VEN-622fp2]# sh install.sh /opt/IBM/ITM
install.sh: line 327: syntax error in conditional expression:
unexpected token `('
install.sh: line 327: syntax error near `+(['
install.sh: line 327: ` [[ "$1" = +([0-9]) ]] && rc=$1'


ANSWER
The ksh package provided by Red Hat is required for installing the Linux OS agent on Red Hat Linux 6. This optional package (ksh-version.rpm Korn shell) which is available on Red Hat Linux 5 and 6 needs to be installed before attempting to install the Linux OS agent. pdksh will not work for installing IBM Tivoli Monitoring agents on Red Hat Linux 6. 

Even though pdksh will work with Red Hat Linux 5, the preferred ksh package is the Red Hat Linux 5 ksh rpm file
