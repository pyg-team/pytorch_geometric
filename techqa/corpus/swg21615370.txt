QUESTION
 In WebSphere Commerce Accelerator, when I go to Store -> Change Shipping, I do not see the tax jurisdiction, WORLD, What should I do to populate this jurisdiction? 

ANSWER
The WORLD jurisdiction is a default JURST, so it should not be deleted. If you are missing this jurisdiction, you can add the corresponding data to the database: 


1. Add to the JURST table.


You need two entries in the JURST table for both SUBCLASS = 1, which indicates that it is a "Shipping Jurisdiction" and SUBCLASS = 2, which means that it is a "Tax Jurisdiction". Enter the following SQL statements to add two entries for WORLD for the store:

insert into JURST (JURST_ID, STOREENT_ID, CODE, SUBCLASS, MARKFORDELETE) values ((select max(JURST_ID) + 1 from JURST),<store_id>, 'World', 1, 0)
insert into JURST (JURST_ID, STOREENT_ID, CODE, SUBCLASS, MARKFORDELETE) values ((select max(JURST_ID) + 1 from JURST),<store_id>, 'World', 2, 0) 

 

where <store_id> is the store you are working with.

2. Add entries to the JURSTGROUP table. Enter the following SQL statements:

insert into JURSTGROUP (JURSTGROUP_ID, SUBCLASS, STOREENT_ID, CODE, MARKFORDELETE) values ((select max(JURSTGROUP_ID) + 1 from JURST), 1,<store_id>, 'World', 0)
insert into JURSTGROUP (JURSTGROUP_ID, SUBCLASS, STOREENT_ID, CODE, MARKFORDELETE) values ((select max(JURSTGROUP_ID) + 1 from JURST), 2,<store_id>, 'World', 0)


3. Update the JURSTGPREL table, which relates the JURST and JURSTGROUP tables. Enter the following SQL statements to relate the new entries that you inserted in the previous steps.

insert into JURSTGPREL (JURST_ID, JURSTGROUP_ID, SUBCLASS) values ((select JURST_ID from JURST where STOREENT_ID = <store_id>and SUBCLASS = 1 and CODE = 'World'),(select JURSTGROUP_ID from JURSTGROUP where SUBCLASS= 1 and STOREENT_ID = <store_id>and CODE = 'World'), 1)
insert into JURSTGPREL (JURST_ID, JURSTGROUP_ID, SUBCLASS) values ((select JURST_ID from JURST where STOREENT_ID =<store_id>and SUBCLASS = 2 and CODE = 'World'),(select JURSTGROUP_ID from JURSTGROUP where SUBCLASS= 2 and STOREENT_ID = <store_id>and CODE = 'World'), 2)

After you insert these records, you might need to close and reopen Accelerator for the changes to get picked up.
