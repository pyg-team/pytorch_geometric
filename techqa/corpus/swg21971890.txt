Title: IBM Unable to obtain a license for RiskWatch - United States

Text:
riskwatch; license; 52003; invalid; RLM_LICENSE TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A customer has cloned their $ALGO_HOME from a development environment to a UAT environment, then used IIM to install three patches, now Riskwatch will not startup due to a license error.



The customer treied to uninstall the license packages in IIM and reinstalled them but it made no difference, the same error was generated.


SYMPTOM
Unable to obtain a license for RiskWatch,
ERROR: = -52003,
REASON: = LicenseMgr contains an invalid job handle.
INTERNAL LICENSE MANAGER ERROR (optional): = .


CAUSE
Riskwatch is unable to read the license file correctly, and therefore unable to obtain a license key to use the Riskwatch functionality, therefore Riskwatch is unable to start. The cause is normally that the path specified in $RLM_LICENSE is incorrect, e.g. the directory path does not exist.

ENVIRONMENT
test

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
All the Riskwatch licenses are stored in a file (obtained from IBM and downloaded with the AlgoOne product), that license file is referenced using the $RLM_LICENSE variable, which Riskwatch checks when it tries to start up. Normally the $RLM_LICENSE variable points to one license file but it can point to a directory that contains multiple Riskwatch license files. E.g:

RLM_LICENSE=$ALGO_HOMElicenses/rlm/license.lic
RLM_LICENSE=$ALGO_HOMElicenses/rlm

1) Ensure the license file is valid by contacting IBM Support
2) Check that the correct file is being referenced. Edit $ALGO_TOP/cfg/environment.properties and set it to your license file. e.g.
RLM_LICENSE=$ALGO_HOME/licenses/rlm/IBMAlgoOneFoundation.lic
3) Refresh CFG server so it knows about the above change: $ALGOSECURITY_HOME/bin/refresh-cfgserver
4) Try to run RW: $RW_HOME/bin/Gui
5) If it fails again, please send the Riskwatch console output and also the license files to IBM Support for analysis

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The customer tried all of the above steps and still had the same error. However, upon further investigation it was revealed the clone of $ALGO_HOME was incorrectly executed. The customer reinstalled AlgoOne using IIM, adding the patches with IIM and the problem disappeared.
