Title: IBM "Cannot form Object IOR string" error in TEP Client log - United States

Text:
objectIOR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After starting the TEP Java WebStart Client and trying to login, a KFWITM392E error occurs on the login window. In the TEP Client trace file, an exception appears showing "Cannot form Object IOR string". 

SYMPTOM
EXCEPTION: Cannot form Object IOR string from local host address 
(5023ee65.19a14780-(null)Thread-161:Workplace,0,"Workplace.authorize(Object,Component,boolean)") EXCEPTION: Unexpected Request Exception: KFWITM220E Request failed during execution. 
(5023ee65.19a14780-(null)Thread-161:Workplace,0,"Workplace.authorize(Object,Component,boolean)") EXCEPTION: User has been authorized 
(5023ee65.19a14780-(null)Thread-161:LogonDialog,0,"LogonDialog.processOK()") EXCEPTION: Unable to Authorize User: candle.fw.util.FailedOperationException 



CAUSE
The "Object IOR string" referenced by the error is actually built from the local hostname and address of the TEP client, not the TEPS. It is using getLocalHost(), getHostAddress(), and currentTimeMillis() functions to create a string that can uniquely identify the client for resource tracking purposes. If any of those functions fails, the "Cannot form Object IOR string" exception occurs. 

One possibility is that there's a failure in getLocalHost() or getHostAddress(). This can occur if the hostname of the local TEP Client system does not resolve correctly; for example, if it's not in /etc/hosts or DNS.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To ensure it can resolve the hostname, run "hostname" on the client system and confirm that the exact name is listed in /etc/hosts with the correct IP address, then retry the TEP client.

If the hostname appears fine and resolves correctly, but it continues to fail, then increase the tracing on the TEP Java WebStart Client to echo the real cause of the exception. That requires going to the TEPS server and editing the $CANDLEHOME/<architecture>/cw/tep.jnlp file to change the trace parameter. Find this line: 

<property name="kjr.trace.params" value="ERROR"/> 

And change it to the following: 

<property name="kjr.trace.params" value="ERROR (UNIT:DataBus Error,Detail)"/> 



The tracing units / text is case-sensitive, so enter the information exactly as written above. 


Then reproduce the problem by attempting the login. Afterwards, review the new TEP Client javaws*.trace file to determine what underlying exception was caught that caused the failure.
