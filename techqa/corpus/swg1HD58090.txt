ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PDG / RULES ARE RENAMED INSIDE UDF.
   Scenario.
   .
   1) Open the CATPart
   2) Create a geometrical set named TestUDF &
   instanciate the UDF in it
   (use the same names)
   Do not care about the message:
   Edit the UDF & display it s internal components:
   Some rules are renamed Rgle.1 even if in the
   definition they have a name.
   .
   Expected Result
   .
   The rules should keep their original names. Here
   only the first & the last rule keep their name.
   .

COMMENTS
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 17.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON :
   CATIA VERSION 5 RELEASE 18 GA level AND ON
   V5R17SP04.
   .
   The problem is also not reproducible on R17 SP02
   when recreate the rule and recreate the UDF.
   .
   Incident Diagnosis
   - names of udf internals are not following naming
   rules
   - in some cases, several features have same name
   Explanation
   Note that rules displayed are internal features.
   They are never shown to final users except in a
   debugging command available only with PKT license
   The technical reason of such behaviour was that
   objects inside udfs are instantiated and their names
   can were lost during instantiation in some cases
   which has old modelisation.
   However renaming the rules solves the problem
   .
   Method of recreation.
   Rename initial objects (rules used for udf creation)
   in R17 level, and recreate the udf reference. Now
   instantiate the UDF user will see that the names of
   rules is correct.
   1) Open the Part
   2) Go to the relations tree
   3) Rename all rules
   4) Recreate the UDF reference
   5) Now instantiate the UDF , rule names are correct
   one.
