Title: IBM How to delete a volume without the Library or TCDB - United States

Text:
RMMTIP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
If a tape is outside the library and the library is removed, RMM will still know about the tape. The tape record entry will manually need to be removed from the RMM CDS. 

SYMPTOM
 

Library was once defined in SMS, but was deleted when the SMS controlled tape unit was physically removed.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

In the case where the Library was once defined in SMS, but was deleted when the SMS controlled tape unit was physically removed, you must issue the following command in order to delete volume entries from the CDS:
RMM DV xxxxxx FORCE NOEJECT 

The use of the NOEJECT operand allows you to delete the volume record from the RMM CDS without having to acknowledge the Library or the TCDB.

Trying to delete volume entries with just the 'RMM DV FORCE' command will give the message that the VOLCAT could not get updated.
