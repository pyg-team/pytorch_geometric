Getting background information on ORB 

An Object Request Broker (ORB) manages the interaction between clients and servers, using the Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP). It enables clients to make requests and receive responses from servers in a network-distributed environment. This Knowledge Center article [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/welc6tech_orb.html] describes the ORB and its use in IBM® WebSphere® Application Server.

 

It may also be helpful to learn more about how to use ORB, what features are available, and what properties are available for tuning to obtain the desired behavior. This Knowledge Center article [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.aix.80.doc/diag/understanding/orb.html] describes how to learn more about these topics and others.
