   As part of upgrading the IBM BPM deployment environment to
   V8.5.6.0, a keystore and SSL configuration for Blueworks Live
   and a keystore to encrypt business objects are added to the
   configuration. Both keystores use the same password as the
   WebSphere CellDefaultKeyStore initially, and the SSL
   configuration refers to the NodeDefaultKeyStore. If the
   CellDefaultKeyStore or the NodeDefaultKeyStore were been
   deleted, you receive the error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.6.0 that allows the
   Blueworks Live keystore and SSL configuration and the keystore
   for business object encryption to be created successfully if
   when the CellDefaultKeyStore or the NodeDefaultKeyStore were
   deleted.
