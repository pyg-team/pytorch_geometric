QUESTION
 How do I change the GUI timeout value in Impact 5.1.1 ? 

ANSWER
The Impact 5.1.1 GUI time-out can be set by : 

 
Please change the web.xml stanza : 

<session-config> 
<session-timeout>5</session-timeout> 
</session-config> 

Where 5 is the number of minutes before your session times out. 

In the following 2 subdirectories : 

$WAS_HOME/profiles/ImpactProfile/config/cells/ImpactCell/applications/g 
uiserver.ear/deployments/guiserver/nci.war/WEB-INF/web.xml 

$WAS_HOME/profiles/ImpactProfile/installedApps/ImpactCell/guiserver.ear 
/nci.war/WEB-INF/web.xml 

Once this is done, and your server recycled, the new settings should 
take effect.
