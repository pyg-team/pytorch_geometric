ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cust is sending out messages which contain notes items (radio
   buttons, etc)
   which do not display when "from Notes to Plain Text and HTML" is
   selected
     in the Config doc. When "from Notes to Plain Text" is selected
   although the
   HTML portion is lost, the actual data is displayed.
   
     The customer understands all that is written above, although
   he would like an
   enhancement which would display the data even if only in plain
   text
      when "from Notes to Plain Text and HTML" is selected. His
   issue is not with
   loss of HTML Fidelity but with the loss of data, he feels it
   should in a way
   default
      back to plain text if the HTML portion cannot be created.
   
     Note: These messages all get sent from an agent which creates
   the message in
   Notes Rich Text. Although my testing was done with a client
   creating the
   message in Notes Rich Text so I could mimic the cust
   environment. Cust also did
   testing with his client just to make sure he saw the same
   behavior
   and he did.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In the Config doc use "from notes to Plain text" which will
   display the data.
