LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Some of the artifacts required for the successful update
   copy of 6.2.0.1.0 were not in the service delta repository
   containing the offering file
   (http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/webspher
   e/studiotools/widwps/62/repository/6.2.0.1/servicedelta/),
   but somewhere else in the composite repository update site
   of widwps
   (http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/webspher
   e/studiotools/widwps/62/updates/).
   
   Repository code looking for the repositories to get
   artifacts from were set to the repository that contained the
   offering instead of the highest level composite repository
   when using the "Check for Updates" method of copying an
   update repository in Packaging Utility.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A change in an unrelated defect allows Packaging Utility to
   correctly retrieve the highest level composite repository in
   its Repository Reference, which is used to determine where
   to find the artifacts to copy. Thus in 1.3.2, the Packaging
   Utility can find all the artifacts it needs without having
   to explicitly add the top level composite repository to the
   open set of repositories (via the workaround described).
