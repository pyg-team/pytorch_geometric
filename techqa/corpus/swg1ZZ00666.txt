APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In an ICO environment set to production mode using this
   procedure:
   --------------------------------------
   To configure production mode, IBM Cloud Orchestrator must be
   manually configured to activate a snapshot instead of using the
   latest version of code which is the case in Development Mode.
   1. Log in to the Business Process Manager user interface as an
   administrator user:
   https://ico_server_fqdn:9043/ibm/console [https://ico_server_fqdn:9043/ibm/console]
   where ico_server_fqdn is the fully qualified domain name of the
   IBM Cloud Orchestrator Server.
   2. In the console navigation tree, click Servers > Server Types
   > WebSphere application servers > server_name.
   3. In the Java and Process Management category in the Server
   Infrastructure section, click Process definition > Java Virtual
   Machine > Custom properties.
   4. Click New to create a new variable called
   ORCHESTRATOR_DEVELOPMENT_MODE.
   To specify production mode, set the value of the
   ORCHESTRATOR_DEVELOPMENT_MODE variable to false.
   5. Set the description of the ORCHESTRATOR_DEVELOPMENT_MODE
   variable to Activate Production Mode.
   6. Restart the Business Process Manager server.
   --------------------------------------
   In the Process Admin, Installed Apps, we see that out snapshot
   is activated and Default. No other snapshot versions are
   active.
   When we make a change to a coach and save, this change is
   immediately visible in the ICO UI thus not respecting the
   'production mode'.   We would expect that only active snapshots
   is used and that changes are only.
   Also when we activating+defaulting to an older snapshot and
   deactivate
   the current, still the new code is used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  revert the code change manually.
