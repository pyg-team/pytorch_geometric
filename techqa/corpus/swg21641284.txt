C:\temp\install-win2012 -h D:\images\ITCAMfFTE701\

Step 3. Run local install or remote deploy with the updated ITCAM Agent for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.1 image. The install process should not suspend anymore. 

Step 4. Install Monitoring Agent for Windows OS (version 6.3.0 or version 6.2.3 fix pack 3) on the same system which ITCAM Agent for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition is just installed.
