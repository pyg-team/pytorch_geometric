taskmaster web log logging TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I enable Taskmaster Web logging to troubleshoot Taskmaster Web operations? 

CAUSE
Taskmaster Web logging is used to troubleshoot specific web operations and is disabled by default.

ANSWER
To enable logging, do the following: 

 1. Edit the ini file.  * For Taskmaster 7.1 or later edit \Datacap\tmweb.net\server.ini 
     * For Taskmaster 6.5 or earlier edit \Datacap\tmweb\server.ini.
    
    
 2. Modify WriteLog=0 to WriteLog=1 as follows:
    [General]
    WriteLog=1 
 3. Change logging options as desired. Logging options are:  * [Log] 
     * Severity=0-9 - where 9 = maximum logging 
     * Path=file path - defaults to: \Datacap\TaskRun\tmweb.log (Taskmaster 7.1 or later)
       \Datacap\tmweb\Batch\Tmp\tmweb.log (Taskmaster 6.5 or earlier) 
     * Overwrite=0/1 - leave at 1 to overwrite log file upon IIS reset 
     * ShowTime=0/1 - leave at 1 to include log time stamp 
     * FlushBuffer=0/1 - set to 0 for periodic writes (helps performance when logging is enabled)
    
    
 4. Restart IIS once finished to enable Taskmaster Web logging.


Note: Restarting IIS is not required with version 8.1 of Datacap. Changes will take effect once browsing is started to Taskmaster Web using a new session (close all browser windows first to ensure new session).
