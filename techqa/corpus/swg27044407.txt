Text:
v2001rlsnotes RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 Some component attributes are not available to configure during pattern deployment 

CONTENT
Problem: If your virtual system pattern includes a component (such as an image, software component or script package) that has a data dependency on another component, but does not have any locked attributes, then the attributes for the component with the data dependency are not presented for configuration during pattern deployment.

Resolution: To show missing component attributes for configuration, lock any one of the attributes, such as the name attribute. This action causes the other component attributes to be displayed for configuration.
