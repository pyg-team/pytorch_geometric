Title: IBM SAP agent transport did not create IBMMON_AGENT - United States

Text:
5724B97SOTR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When importing SAP agent transport, the IBMMON_AGENT user did not get created. 

SYMPTOM
Imported transport ITMK711_00100U, which should have created IBMMON_AGENT user. However, no such user got created.


CAUSE
Agent transport tries to create SAP user IBMMON_AGENT with default password (ITMMYSAP). If the SAP system has a complex password policy in place, the default password does not meet the policy rule, and the transport fails to create the user.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if IBMMON_AGENT user is created after importing agent transport. If not, check the job log for ITM_CREATE_USERID_CLIENT_<clientnumber> job, and look for any password related messages, such as "The password must contain at least 1 digit (0-9)".

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Delete the transport if already imported. 

Use the steps below to specify a non-default password. 


1) Create a file named transport.prop under SAP DIR_TRANS/bin directory. 

The value of the 'DIR_TRANS' can be retrieved by 'RZ11' transaction code on SAP system, and enter 'DIR_TRANS' in the Param.Name input field. 

By default, the 'DIR_TRANS' value is /usr/sap/trans on UNIX/Linux platform, and C:/usr/sap/trans on Windows platform. 


2) Append a line as below into transport.prop to change the default password:
password=<YourPassword>


3) Save the changes. Grant read and write to access the file to the SAP admin user. 


4) Import the ABAP transport. 

 

The IBMMON_AGENT user should get created with password specified in the transport.prop file.
