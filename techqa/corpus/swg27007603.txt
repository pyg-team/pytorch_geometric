Fixes and Updates for WebSphere Portal, Lotus Web Content Management and Workplace Web Content Management are designated as "Recommended" to ensure that issues potentially affecting a majority of situations can be proactively prevented or avoided. Updates to these recommendations should be tested and verified in your staging or pre-production environment prior to installing into production.

4. Review and follow the recommendations for additional software in your environment: 
Avoid known problems in the underlying WebSphere Application Server and IBM-provided Java SDK used with WebSphere Portal by installing, testing and deploying the latest recommended levels documented in the technote, " Recommended fixes for WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]," for your specific version of WebSphere Application Server. 

Because WebSphere Application Server has a different release cycle for fix packs from WebSphere Portal, these later releases are not always fully tested with the portal. However, we expect full compatibility to remain with such service releases. Applying these recommendations reduces the risk of rediscovery of problems corrected in these subsequent service releases. Customers should ensure that the fixes required for the Application Server are either incorporated into the later service release or available for download. For a complete listing of fixes integrated for the Application Server, follow the link under the "Additional information" section in the Recommended fixes for WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980] technote for your version.
