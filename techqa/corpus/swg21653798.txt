ABSTRACT
 IBM Prerequisite Scanner is a prerequisite checking tool that analyzes system environments before the installation or upgrade of a TivoliÂ® product or IBM solution. 

CONTENT
When you run Prerequisite Scanner, it scans for the specified prerequisites and detects any missing ones before the actual product installation or upgrade takes place; thus, the scan can enable remediation without impacting the deployment schedule.

For further information on installing Prerequisite Scanner, see the Readme.html file in the PRS installation package

Download the PRS from http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Prerequisite+Scanner&release=All&platform=All&function=all [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Prerequisite+Scanner&release=All&platform=All&function=all]


Using PRS (Prerequisite Scanner) to perform a prerequisite check for TIP 2.2.0.13:

Extract the contents of zip/tar file.
Navigate to the extracted directory in a command prompt.
Issue the following command

Windows
prereq_checker.bat
"Product_Code [Product_Version][,Product_CodeN [Product_VerN]]..." 
detail
[outputDir="ips_output_dir"]
[xmlResult]

UNIX
./prereq_checker.sh 
"Product_Code [Product_Version][,Product_CodeN [Product_VerN]]..." 
detail
[outputDir="ips_output_dir"]
[xmlResult]

where, 

 * Product_Code - this is the code assigned to every product. For TIP, pass the string "TIP" and the TIP fix pack name in the form of: VVRRMMLL. For example, for TIP fix pack 2.2.0.11, the string would be "TIP 02020011". For 2.2.0.9 the string would be "TIP 02020009". 
 * detail - this gives a detailed description of each test on the console. 
 * outputDir - specifying this would write the output to ips_output_dir 
 * xmlResult - to be specified if one wants the results in xml format.




For example, to run the pre-requisite scanner for TIP 2.2.0.13, one should issue the below command 

Windows 
prereq_checker.bat "TIP 02020013" detail outputDir="%TEMP%\ips" 

UNIX 
./prereq_checker.sh "TIP 02020013" detail outputDir="/tmp/ips" 


Possible results from running Prerequisite Scanner in the target environment are as follows: 

FAIL 
If the target environment does not meet any of the prerequisite checks, Prerequisite Scanner returns an overall FAIL result for the environment. The tool displays the scan results for the individual prerequisite properties in the command window. 
If Prerequisite Scanner returns this result, take the appropriate actions; for example, install the missing operating system packages, increase disk space for the file systems, or modify the configuration settings of the target environment to match the expected values in the scan results. 

PASS 
If the target environment meets all prerequisite checks, Prerequisite Scanner returns an overall PASS result for the environment. 
If Prerequisite Scanner returns this result, you can install the product. 

The tool outputs the result.txt and precheck.log files to the following locations: 

On Windows systems: %TEMP%\ips where TEMP is environment variable for the temporary folder. 
On UNIX systems: /tmp/ips
