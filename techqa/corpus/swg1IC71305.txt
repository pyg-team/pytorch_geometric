APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the XMS client uses two separate threads to subscribe and
   unsubscribe to a subscription, an error is generated.  The error
   seen is 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object'
   and the stack trace of the XMS application shows:
   
   Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at IBM.WMQ.MQProxyQueue.ProxyMQCLOSE(Int32 closeOptions,
   Int32&
   compCode, Int32& reason)
   at IBM.WMQ.MQFAP.MQCLOSE(Int32 hConn, Int32 options, Int32
   hObj,
   Int32& compCode, Int32& reason)
   at IBM.WMQ.Nmqi.ManagedNmqiMQ.MQCLOSE(Hconn phConn, Phobj
   phobj,
   Int32 options, Int32& pCompCode, Int32& pReason)
   at IBM.XMS.Client.WMQ.WmqAsyncConsumerShadow.CloseInternal()

   at IBM.XMS.Client.Impl.XmsSessionImpl.Dispose(Boolean
   disposing)
   at IBM.XMS.Client.Impl.XmsSessionImpl.Close()
   
   Even though the error is generated, the unsubscribe completes
   successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This problem could affect the XMS / .NET client users who are
   using multi threaded applications.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   There is thread specific data stored in the thread context and
   when an exception occurs in the application, this information
   is getting cleared.  This subsequently causes the application
   failure.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere MQ .NET code has been modified with safer way to
   maintain thread specific data.
