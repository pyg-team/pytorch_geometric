Compilers [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006357&amp;aid=1]  * 32-bit applications  * IBM C for AIX, V5 or V6 
    * IBM VisualAge C++ Professional for AIX, V5.1 and VisualAge C/C++ Professional for AIX Version 6.0 and IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition V7.0 for AIX 
      (Use the VisualAge C/C++ v6.0 and IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition V7.0 for AIX compiler option "-q namemangling=v5" for C++ to get all the WebSphere MQ symbols resolved while linking the libraries.) 
    * Micro Focus Server Express, V2.0.10, V2.0.11, V2.2 & V4.0
      (Before compiling WebSphere MQ applications with Micro Focus Server Express V2.2, ensure that WebSphere MQ maintenance is applied to CSD04 level or later. See this page [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037] for more details). 
    * IBM COBOL Set for AIX V1.1 & V2.0 
   
   
 * 64-bit applications (see SupportPac entitled "MACS: WebSphere MQ Client Libraries for AIX (64-bit)", available from this page [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/integration/support/supportpacs/category.html])  * IBM C for AIX, V5 or V6 
    * IBM VisualAge C++ Professional for AIX, V5.1 and VisualAge C/C++ Professional for AIX Version 6.0 and IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition V7.0 for AIX 
      (Use the VisualAge C/C++ v6.0 and IBM XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition V7.0 for AIX compiler option "-q namemangling=v5" for C++ to get all the WebSphere MQ symbols resolved while linking the libraries.) 
    * Micro Focus Server Express, V2.0.11, V2.2 SP1 with FP10 & V4.0  * Before compiling 64-bit WebSphere MQ applications with Micro Focus Server Express, ensure that the latest client libraries and header files are downloaded. 
       * Before preparing your COBOL programs to run with WebSphere MQ, the path where your COBOL compiler is setup needs to added to your environment variables. 
       * MACS SupportPac should be installed over WebSphere MQ 5.3 CSD07 or above to work with 64-bit applications. 
      
      
   
   


WebSphere MQ for AIX, V5.3 supports applications using POSIX draft 4 and draft 10 threads, but not draft 7. Java [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006357&amp;aid=1]  * 32-bit  * IBM AIX Developer Kit, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.3.1, 32-bit version for POWER 
      (Provided that the IBM AIX Developer Kit, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.3.1, 32-bit plus the addition of IBM JSSE classfiles can be obtained as included within an alternate IBM product, this is also a suitable environment under which SSL support using Java can be run with the exception of certificate checking against Certificate Revocation Lists CRLs which requires full JDK implementation at V1.4.) 
    * IBM 32-bit SDK for AIX, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.4, 32-bit 
      (WebSphere MQ maintenance must be at least CSD04. IBM AIX Developer Kit, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.4, 32-bit is required for SSL support using Java as it provides the necessary IBM JSSE classfiles.) 
   
   
 * 64-bit  * IBM AIX Developer Kit, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.3.1, 64-bit version for POWER 
      (Restrictions: See note 1 below) 
   
   

Application Servers [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006357&amp;aid=1]  * IBM Websphere Application Server V5.1 
 * IBM Websphere Application Server V6.0.2 
 * IBM Websphere Application Server V6.1 (See this page [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=175&context=SSAL2T&q1=resiliency&uid=swg21307203&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for more details.) 
 * BEA WebLogic Server 8.1 + SP2 on WebSphere MQ V5.3 + FP7 on AIX 5.x and IBM JDK 1.4x to support EJB's (including MDB's) and JMS only. 
   (The above are the minimum required supported levels. See general notes below)

Transaction Managers [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006357&amp;aid=1] Where one of these transaction monitor products is acting as the transaction manager and IBM WebSphere MQ is acting as a resource manager, it's recommended that you contact the transaction monitor vendor in the first instance for support. 
 * TXSeries V4.3, V5.0 and V5.1(FP9 must be applied with V5.1)
   (Note: COBOL transactions are only supported with TXSeries 5.0 when the applied maintenance is CSD05 or later. See this page [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037] for more details.) 
 * BEA Tuxedo, V6.4 or V6.5 
 * BEA Tuxedo V8.0 & V8.1 (32bit only) on WebSphere MQ V5.3 + FP9 or later on AIX 5.x. At FP9 WebSphere MQ V5.3 APAR IY69467 is also required 

DCE [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006357&amp;aid=1]  * IBM DCE V3.1 & V3.2 


To enable users to run the WebSphere MQ supplied DCE send, receive or message exits, this must be the US domestic version supporting DES encryption. Notes: 

 1. The following restrictions apply when using IBM AIX Developer Kit, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 1.3.1, 64-bit version for POWER:  * AIX v5.2 64-bit OS patch level ML-01 must be applied. 
     * IBM AIX Developer Kit Service Release 6 must be applied. 
     * WebSphere MQ maintenance must be at least CSD05. 
     * Only client applications are supported. Server bindings mode is not supported. 
     * There is no support for SSL-encrypted MQI channels from the Java client to the WebSphere MQ server.
    
    
 2. TXSeries v5.1 with WebSphere MQ Extended Transaction Client (XAClient):  * WebSphere MQ V5.3 client + CSD03 + WebSphere MQ V5.3 XAClient +FP09 
     * If user exit 15 provided with WebSphere MQ V5.3 is to be used with the XAClient, APAR IY72218 needs to be applied.
    
    
 3. Where a patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. 
 4. For SSL function on AIX 5.1, 5.2 & 5.3 please use C Set ++ v 6.0.0.3 (Runtime).
