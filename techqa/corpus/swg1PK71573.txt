PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  APAR PK71573 provides a plug-in for customers to run WebSphere
   Application Server V7.0 for z/OS servers with the IBM
   HTTP Server for WebSphere. This provides a HTTP Server, which
   runs in 64-bit mode and is based on the open-source Apache
   server, with which many customers are already familiar.
   The plug-in is a separate module, essentially identical to the
   plug-in for IHS on WebSphere Distributed platforms, but adding
   support for EBCDIC and for RACF keyrings. Like the distributed
   systems, and unlike the older plug-in for z/OS, this new z/OS
   plug-in respects the keyring and stashfile options in
   plugin-cfg.xml. As on the distributed systems, the installation
   procedure can automatically update the HTTP server's httpd.conf
   for the WebSphere plug-in module.
