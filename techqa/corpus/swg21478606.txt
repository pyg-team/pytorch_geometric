Title: IBM Display commands in the log check box is greyed out under Edit->Options in SPSS Student Version - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working in the SPSS Student Version. When I go under Edit->Options and click the Viewer tab or Draft Viewer tab, I notice that the "Display commands in the log" checkbox is greyed out. What is this and how may I get this working? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This option is intended to log background SPSS Syntax Commands in the SPSS Output. However, the SPSS Student Version does not contain the capability of using syntax commands so the option has been greyed out. If you need to use syntax it is recommended that you upgrade to the SPSS Graduate Pack.
