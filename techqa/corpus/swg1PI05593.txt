PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The RDz server was fixed to initialize server response for
      the search command from RDz 7.6.2.x clients.
   02.Now, MVS miner can handle C_NOTIFICATION command even if its
      initialization is not completed.
   03.Now, MVS miner is changed to accept the results of the
      Cleanup command.
   04.Now, RDz server program keeps in mind the cases where the
      913-38 errors occurs. This causes a client not to bring
      about the same RACF error but the client can see the same
      913-38 dialog. This mechanism can decrease the number of
      913-38 errors. RDz server program introduces a new property
      of "enable.saf.check". If this property has true, then the
      913-38 errors are logged in safWarning file. Each line of
      the log has a userid and dataset name where 913-38 occurred.
   05.improve distributed Dynamic VIPA support, which can be
      enabled with the _RSE_JAVAOPTS -Denable.dDVIPA=true option
      in rsed.envvars
   06.Now, RDz is enhanced to logs the list of the active clients
      when there is a change in the active clients. A new
      property, "display.users", is introduced to enable this new
      capability.
   07.Now, MVSfileSystemMiner finish() will check the status so
      that it could not bring about NPE.
   08.There is a mechanism that DataStore client and server
      exchange their versions during the connection establishment
      phase. The DataStore server version is controlled by the
      property of DSTORE_VERSION. Now, RDz daemon picks up the
      server version from SMP information and sets the server
      version forcibly to the DSTORE_VERSION property.
   09.output of "id" command is trimmed to 2048 characters
   10.FEKLOGS enhancements to support new log location
      $daemon.log/server
   11.Show error message in TSO command server
