Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM Content Navigator (ICN) version 2.0.3 fix pack 8, a known defect can lead to hung threads when there is a certain volume of transactions in the environment. These hung threads can accumulate and finally cause the environment to become unresponsive. 

CAUSE
This is tracked as a software defect in APAR IO24865 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IO24865]. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The systemout.log file for ICN may show the following entries: 

[3/1/17 8:42:22:734 EET] 00000003 ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread "WebContainer : 16" (0000012d) has been active for 777604 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 5 thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.
at com.ibm.mm.sdk.server.DKDatastoreICM.getOption(DKDatastoreICM.java:5049)
at com.ibm.mm.sdk.server.PDatastoreDefCacheICM.cacheIsOn(PDatastoreDefCacheICM.java:329) 

Follow the MustGather documents describing information to collect to analyze hung threads for your operating system to generate javacore files. The javacore shows the following:
