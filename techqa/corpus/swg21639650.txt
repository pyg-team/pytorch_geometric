Title: IBM Missing Sites and content After IBM BigFix upgrade issue - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Content for all sites missing after upgrading BigFix, the log file contains the following error:

The site directory listing could not be verified: class NotASignedMessage 

SYMPTOM
No Fixlets or Tasks listed in the BigFix Console after upgrading.


CAUSE
Unknown, the specific error message is typically an indication of a Directory change. The error 'class NotASignedMessage' is seen after server migrations to new hardware or VM, where a directory change was made. 

For example, moving servers from a 32bit OS to a 64bit OS will change the installation path from
C:\Program Files to C:\Program Files (x86)

In this particular instance, no changes to the paths were made.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1.) Verify that the GatherState.xml, it is located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\Mirror Server\Inbox\ folder, path to the folder is correct.

2.) If the above is correct, you will need to Remove each site from the License Overview dashboard. 

 - The site will reappear in the list of sites that need to be Enabled.
- Click on the Enable <Site Name>; next to the site name as you would when first installing the site
- Subscribe Computers to the site, the default is No Computers.
