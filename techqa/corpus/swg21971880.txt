Title: IBM Daeja ViewONE is producing the error  message HPDIA0126W - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The error message is not a Daeja ViewONE error message but an authentication message from IBM Security Access Manager's WebSEAL component.
In the WebSEAL log you will find the error messages of
Rather than using a failover cookie, WebSEAL is recording the following messages, and returning the login page.

2015-11-24-12:06:02.523-04:00I----- 0x1321207E webseald WARNING ias general E:\build\am611\src\ivauthn\pdauthn.cpp 355 0x00001d3c
HPDIA0126W Authentication method (failover-ext-auth-interface) is not configured.
2015-11-24-12:06:02.523-04:00I----- 0x38CF0803 webseald ERROR wwa cdsso N:\amwebrte611\src\pdwebrte\authn\failover\AMWFailoverCookieCutter.cpp 1096 0x00001d3c
DPWWA2051E An authentication system failure has occurred: error: HPDIA0117E Can't select authentication mechanism. (pd / ias) (error code: 0x13212075). 

CAUSE
In this instance the IBM Security Access Manager component WebSEAL had not been configured to allow it's failover authentication for all authentication mechanisms which it uses. 

WebSEAL has the option to includes the authentication mechanism in it's failover cookies which WebSEAL generates. The message is returned when the authentication mechanism does not have a configured failover library. WebSEAL has the option to configure the authentication library from it own known list of authentication.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To address this issue modification is required on the WebSEAL server and not with Daeja ViewONE virtual . The WebSEAL failover-{mechanism} entries in in the webseald-instance-name.conf has the stanza [authentication-mechanisms] . This should be configured for all authentication mechanisms which are used. That is, if the extended authentication interface (ext-auth-interface) is configured, the failover library for that mechanism (failover-ext-auth-interface) should also be configured. 

The failover libraries for authentication mechanisms which are not used in the environment should not be configured, to further protect against unexpected failover authentication.
