APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Issue Scenario:- The Smarteam "Save As" function for a
   part/assembly is grayed out in Inventor when another
   assembly, which is composed of the first part/assembly, Is
   also opened in Inventor. If ONLY the part/assembly, which you
   need to save as, is opened, everything works. But as soon as
   another assembly (composed of the first part/assembly) is
   opened, the save as is grayed out. Even if you then close
   this other assembly, you still cannot perform a "save as".
   Everything needs to be closed again, and only the
   part/assembly which needs to be "saved as" must be reopened.
   This is also the case if structure is checked in/released,
   but a read-only copy is used in Inventor.
   Then it the same problem occurs, not possible to execute the
   save as...
   Scenario:-
   1. Start Inventor with Smarteam addin
   2. Create new part and Smarteam save
   3. Create new assembly, place component (the newly created
   part) and Smarteam save
   4. Go back to the part window, which is still open, and try
   to Smarteam Save As
   ==> Not possible, grayed out!
   5. Close the assembly, and go back to the part window, which
   is still open, and try to Smarteam Save As
   ==> Still not possible, grayed out!
   6. Close all windows in Inventor and reopen only the part.
   ==> Smarteam save as is possible.
   Remark from FE: - This problem did not occur in previous
   versions of Smarteam.
