APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users experience excessive delays during failure recovery of CE
   in a WebLogic managed node cluster
   
   2 Solaris Zones
   WebLogic 9.2 SP3
   8 managed WebLogic nodes (4 managed nodes on each Zone)
   1 cluster for the 8 managed nodes.
   1 Admin server on different server.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   Setup 1 - WcmApiConfig.properties has all the nodes defined:
   Scenarios:
   1.  All nodes running - System works as expected, all nodes are
   connected.
   2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is still available
   on the network - No slow down and system working as normal, only
   nodes on the running server is connected.
   3.  Disconnect one server from the network (it is hard to
   determine which node WL will go to next, but usually it follows
   the order specified in WcmApiConfig.properties)
    a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes 2-3 minutes to
   log on
    b.  next node WL will go to is on the disconnected server -
   takes 2-3 minutes and gets an error.
   
   Setup 2 - WcmApiConfig.properties has one node on each server
   defined:
   Scenarios:
   1.  All nodes running - System works as expected, all nodes are
   connected.
   2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is still available
   on the network - No slow down and system working as normal, only
   nodes on the running server is connected.
   3.  Disconnect one server from the network -
    a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes a little less
   than a minute to log on
    b.  next node WL will go to is on the disconnected server -
   takes 2-3 minutes and gets an error.
   4.  All nodes specified in WcmApiConfig.properties is down, the
   rest are up - Destination unreachable error
   
   Setup 3 - WcmApiConfig.properties has all nodes defined.  In
   addition, 4 more dummy nodes are defined (i.e. non-existing
   nodes but pointing to an existing machine)
   Scenarios:
   1.  All nodes running - System works as expected, all available
   nodes are connected.
   2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is still available
   on the network - No slow down and system working as normal, only
   nodes on the running server is connected.
   3.  Disconnect one server from the network -
    a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes 3-5 minutes to
   log on
    b.  next node WL will go to is on the disconnected server -
   takes 3-5 minutes and gets an error.
