Q&A from chat and Additional Resources Question 1: What is attribute guid and uid use for? What is the difference between them? 
I think that guid is used to map a user to his/ her content but there is no official information on the documentation. 

Answer 1: GUID is generated by machine from your LDAP server. It is 36 characters long. 
It is used to link profiles to other Connections Components by default. 
The default mapping is to an LDAP generated identifier. If the records are deleted and re-added to LDAP this value would changed. 
UID is the primary field which links the LDAP record to the Profiles database. It is a human assigned unique ID used for login purpose - typically a short name or a serial number. IBM Connections also used UID to identify who is the manager of particular user. 

See Knowledge Center topic "Mapping fields manually" at the following link 
https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYGQH_4.5.0/admin/install/t_prof_tdi_mapfields.dita [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYGQH_4.5.0/admin/install/t_prof_tdi_mapfields.dita] 


Question 2: If we need to change the default mapping for guid and uid, what is the requirement for them, for example : 
- Can they be filled with the same value (i.e. with employee number) for both guid and uid ? 
- Do they have to be in a specific format / length 
- I understand that they need to be unique, but do they need to be unique for all users (internal & external, assuming they have different LDAP) or only for internal users or only for user within an LDAP ? 

Answer 2: The GUID and UID field are configurable. If better options are available for your environment, you can change as follows: - 
Profiles <-> LDAP link: profiles_tdi.properties file 
sync_updates_hash_field=uid 

Profiles <-> other Connections components link: profiles_config.xml file 
<lconnUserIdField>guid</lconnUserIdField> 

Those fields need to be unique for the purpose mentioned on question 1. 
Also changing the GUID to use the same as UID can view as a security issue for some customers. 
As the 'uid' now is very visible in places like the URLs. 

See Knowledge Center topic "Mapping fields manually" at the following link

Question 3: We have a case with IBM Connections using Domino Directory where a user resign and then came back. Somehow even though he is registered again with the same name and attributes, he lost all of his old connections data. Somebody suggested that we change the guid attributes from it default mapping since the default mapping is generated using the person document's document ID and the document ID is different (old person document is deleted and then re-created). Is this really what cause this ? 


Answer 3: When previous deleted user is re-added to the LDAP, new GUID is assigned. When this user is re-added to the profiles database, the new GUID will not match with his other component data which is using the old GUID. Hence the user will not see his old Connections data in communities, files, etc. To resolve this you need to update your application member profile to use the new GUID: 

application_nameMemberService.syncMemberByExtId("currentExternalId"[, 
{"newExtId" : "id-string" [, "allowExtIdSwap" : ["true" | "false"] ] } 
] ) 

Example: 

CommunitiesMemberService.syncMemberByExtId("7d71d8b2-7de511df-80b6c81b-5 
330ca0e", 
{"newExtId": "7d71d8b3-7de511df-80b6c81b-5330ca0e", "allowExtIdSwap": 
"true"}) 


Question 4: Is there any link available can we download this presentation slide for future reference?
