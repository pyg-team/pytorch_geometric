Title: IBM udevd errors shown during the installation of DataPower firmware with the command sequence: configure terminal; flash; reinitialize - United States

udevd TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are these udev errors shown and is there any impact to the firmware installation or to the DataPower appliance? 

CAUSE
You could see several udevd errors in the serial console output when you run the configure terminal; flash; reinitialize command sequence to install a WebSphere DataPower Appliance firmware from 5.0.0 to any other release. The following message is a sample error: 

udevd[2957]: can not read '/lib/udev/rules.d/64-device-mapper.rules'


ANSWER
These messages are harmless. The new firmware installs successfully, and the appliance restarts successfully. There is no functional impact or data loss. 


To install a firmware image, use the boot image command in Flash mode. With this approach, use the following command sequence: 

 * configure terminal; flash; boot image


Do not use the reinitialize command in Flash mode unless you are installing the same firmware release as the currently running release. When you use the reinitialize command with a different firmware release, you cannot rollback to another release if there is a serious error. 

This udevd error is corrected in next major DataPower firmware release. You will not see these udevd error messages with the configure terminal; flash; reinitialize command sequence in this firmware release.
