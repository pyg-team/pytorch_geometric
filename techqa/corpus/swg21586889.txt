Title: IBM XMLAccess Unexpectedly Exports a Virtual Portal - United States

Text:
virtual portal; xmlaccess; hostname; host name TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
XMLAccess exports a virtual portal's configuration rather than the base portal's configuration due to a misconfiguration of the virtual portal.

SYMPTOM
XMLAccess output contents include objects from the virtual portal configuration.


CAUSE
The virtual portal was misconfigured to use the base portal's hostname.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Inspect the XMLAccess output for virtual portal contents, such as the URL mapping to the content root: 

<url-mapping-context ... label="vp5" ...>... 

<portal-url resourceref="Z6_000000000000000000000000A0" ... 

Compare the configuration URL used at the command line: 

xmlaccess.sh ... -url .../hostname1:port/wps/config 

to the hostnames configured for your various virtual portals. From the Administration page, go to Virtual Portals > Manage Virtual Portals and check the Hostname column. 

 

The Manage Virtual Portals administrative portlet prevents creation of virtual portals with the base portal's fully qualified hostname (EJPAH2025E). However, administrators can still inadvertently create virtual portals with either of these hostnames: 

 * localhost 
 * short hostname

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use WebSphere Portal's fully qualified host name in the configuration URL in the XMLAccess command line. 

Clean up any misconfigured virtual portals to avoid the problem in the future. 

Be especially careful not to import this virtual portal configuration into another base portal.
