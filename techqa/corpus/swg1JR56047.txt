LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The diagram viewer in Process Designer does not require the
   cacheBust Dojo property as part of the URL it generates to
   retrieve a diagram from the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)
   server, but it did not properly search for the property in the
   browser window object to ensure the property is not included in
   the URL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.06 that
   corrects the issue.
   
   To determine whether the cumulative fix is available and
   download it if it is, complete the following steps on Fix
   Central:
   
   1. On the Select product tab, select WebSphere as the product
   group, IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from the
   WebSphere options, All as the installed version, and All as the
   platform, and then click Continue.
   2. In the Text field, enter "cumulative fix?, and click
   Continue.
