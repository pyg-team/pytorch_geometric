Title: IBM ITM 6.22 - Can not uninstall IBM Tivoli Monitoring components on Windows - United States

Text:
uninstall remove deinstall component hang Windows programs ITM monitoring installer TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to uninstall several ITM components in Windows, using Start -> Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs, result in hanging uninstallation process 

SYMPTOM
One can not remove Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.2 components on Windows (like for example Warehouse Proxy 'HD' Agent, Summarization and Pruning 'SY' Agent, TEPS 'CQ', TEP Desktop Client 'CJ') while using: Start -> Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs > Select IBM Tivoli Monitoring and click Change/Remove. Select Remove and click Next. 

 

Installer hangs after un-checking components to be un-installed and clicking next button. 

A window pop-up states: Information is processed, please wait .... 

It makes no difference if you try to un-install just one component or multiple components at the same time.



ENVIRONMENT
ITM 6.2.2 on Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In IBM_Tivoli_Monitoring_Component_Update_*.log file, check if it loops until the end with entries like following (with KOQWIXEB as an example): 

--- Loop Begin --- 

Prerequisities for checking: 

KOQWIXEB 

FixPrereqResolver() - Components [KOQWIXEB] prepreq 

[KOQWIXEB] will be signed as [0]. 

 

FixPrereqResolver() - Entry - XEB\KOQWIXEB 

FixPrereqResolver() - MiscData 

[RqdFeatures=(KCWWIXEB,KOQWIXEB)] 

FixPrereqResolver() - Feature [KOQWIXEB] is already signed as [0] 

FixPrereqResolver() - Feature [KOQWIXEB] 

MiscDataField [RqdFeatures=(KCWWIXEB,KOQWIXEB)]. 

FixPrereqResolver() - Feature [KCWWIXEB] was checked before. No action will be performed. 

--- Loop End ---


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The possible culprits are corrupted 'ver' files for a certain agent. 

In our above example, the KOQWIXEB has to do with the 'OQ' agent: "OQ","Microsoft SQL Server Support","WINNT","062200000","01901","KOQWIXEB.ver" 

as taken from cinfo.info file 

The solution is as follows: 

- Stop all ITM components including failing agent, here for example the 'OQ' (Microsoft SQL Server) agent, using the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) utility 

- Go to the folder %CANDLE_HOME%\InstallITM\ver\ where the appropriate ".ver" files reside (for example here for the failing agent: 

KOQ*.ver like KOQWICNS.ver, KOQWIXEB.ver, KOQWIXEW.ver, KOQWIIEH.ver, KOQWICMS.ver) 

- Rename all these KOQ*.ver files to for example bckup_KOQ*.ver 

- Re-launch the un-installation process like previously done.
