APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 24 and execute a syntax file
   that imports an empty ext file. In this text file you have no
   cases but a lot of variable definition and you need to import it
   in order to merge it later with other files.
   This text file typically use comma as delimiter between the
   variables and the variable names use double quotes as text
   qualifier.
   The syntax for the text file executes without any problem in
   release 23 FixPack 3.
   When you run the same syntax for the same 'empty' file in
   release 24 it stops at the EXECUTE for the GET DATA file import
   syntax and it does not finish.
   You can only quit SPSS Statistics via task manager and the text
   file is not imported.
   This was reported to IBM SPSS development. This does only for
   empty text files. As soon as you have case data in the text file
   it will import properly. Another option s to use DATA LIST
   command instead of GET DATA.
