APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is not explained in the official documentation and should
   be added:
   .
   The relevence of "Type" within a custom server template,
   that is why a template would match if the type is e.g.
   appserver but not match if type is oracleinstance, it's
   the following:  if it's set to a "sensor" type then the
   custom server template is used to "enhance" an existing
   sensor.
   .
   If it's an L2 discovery the sensor doesn't even run, so
   the template won't run : the templates will only run if
   they are AppServer, WebServer, J2EEServer, or DatabaseServer,
   unless a real sensor runs first.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The TADDM 7.1 publications are not clear on the meaning of the
   field "Type" when creating custom servers.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following updates will be made to the TADDM 7.1.2
   publications;
   
   User's Guide Chapter 3 section "Creating and managing custom
   servers" Table 9, the definition of the field "Type" has been
   updated as follows;
   
   The type of custom server:
   
   - AppServer
   - J2EE Server
   - Web Server
   - Database Server
   
   Each of the four generic custom server types listed above can be
   used to create a template for the discovery of server types that
   TADDM does not automatically categorize. During discovery, any
   unknown server is identified as a custom server of this type if
   its runtime information matches the criteria you specified in
   the template, and no other existing enabled sensor matches this
   criteria. These types may also run if the matching TADDM sensor
   runs and fails.
   
   Sensor-type servers
   
   The remaining Types correspond to the sensors that run in the
   environment. These sensor-type custom server templates run only
   in conjunction with an existing successful sensor, and are
   intended to extend discovery of a server by customizing certain
   aspects of how the sensor discovers the server. See Chapter 15
   ?Custom servers extensions? for more information.
   
   Note: If a credentialed sensor and a custom server both run for
   the same target during the course of one or more discoveries,
   due to the different nature of the data discovered without
   credentials, objects created by the CST may not reconcile with
   sensor created artifacts.
   Note: The above information is pertinent to L3 Discovery run
   with com.collation.internalTemplatesEnabled=false. See TADDM
   Administrator?s Guide Chapter 7 ?Properties for sensors? for
   more information on enabling internal templates.
   
   
   
   Administrator's Guide Chapter 7 section "Properties for sensors"
   
   com.collation.internalTemplatesEnabled=false
   
   Valid values are true or false. The default is false. If you
   change the value to true, you enable shallow discovery of
   applications running on a target system using only the system
   credentials.
   
   If you have this property set to true, you receive a
   CustomAppServer object representing the application running on
   the target machine. You do not need to provide application
   credentials to enable this property. If you set this property to
   false, the custom application server seeds for internal
   templates will be created only when the deep sensor
   corresponding to the application fails.
   
   With this feature enabled, the internal templates TADDM uses to
   start sensors are used instead to launch CustomAppServerSensors
   which will create Objects in TADDM representing the application
   running on the target. These CustomAppServerSensors require no
   credentials. In this discovery mode, since template matching is
   only intended to launch a sensor with a high probability that
   the sensor being launched is the correct sensor for the running
   application, TADDM creates ?Generic? application server types,
   such as WebServer and J2EEServer, instead of the more specific
   types that a sensor would create, such as ApacheServer or
   WebSphereServer. The objectType attribute will be set to the
   ?best match? type of the running application software. Please
   note that if a credentialed sensor and a custom server both run
   for the same target during the course of one or more
   discoveries, the following limitations apply:
   
   1. Given the different nature of the data discovered without
   credentials, objects created by this feature may not reconcile
   with L3 sensor created artifacts. 2. Credential free discovery
   will not create specific classes. For example, httpd might be
   Apache or another web server, and hence, in credential-free
   mode, are only classified as HTTP Servers.
