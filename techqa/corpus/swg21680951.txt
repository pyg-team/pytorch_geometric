PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Potential reason why the BESRootServer.exe continues to crash on a RedHat Linux BigFix server 

SYMPTOM
An error similar to the following may be encountered:
Tue, 29 Jul 2014 16:41:05 -0300 - Main Thread (92526560) - Startup failed:
error testing database connection: Database Error: [IBM][CLI Driver] SQL1032N 
No start database manager command was issued. SQLSTATE=57019
(08001:4294966264)


CAUSE
Not enough space in the /var/opt/BESServer/wwwrootbes/bfmirror directory on the server machine.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM BigFix running on RedHat Linux

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
First check your file systems to ensure enough space is allocated to all file systems involved in running BigFix on the Linux server.




Move or mount any file systems that are out of space to new partitions that have the necessary storage to allow the database to continue mirroring to the filesystem and allow the BESRootServer process to continue running.
