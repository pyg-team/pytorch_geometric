QUESTION
 Connection between Sterling Control Center and Connect:Direct Windows 4.4.00 is failing after turning on FIPS 140-2 on Connect:Direct Windows. 

ANSWER


The current release of Sterling Certificate Wizard, 1.2.03, and prior releases, use a non-FIPS approved algorithm for encrypting private keys (PBE-MD5-DES). Until Sterling Certificate Wizard is updated to support encrypting private keys with a FIPS approved algorithm, Certificate Wizard generated private keys must be converted to use a FIPS approved encryption algorithm. 
The private key conversion can be performed with the OpenSSL command line utility, which is installed in the Server\Secure+ folder. The following is an example of converting the private key in the keycert file “keycert.pem”


>openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 aes256 -in keycert.pem -out prikey.pem 

Enter pass phrase for keycert.pem: 
Enter Encryption Password: 
Verifying - Enter Encryption Password: 
Loading 'screen' into random state – done 

The converted private key is written to prikey.pem. Before the converted private key can be used by Secure+, its certificate must be added to create a keycert file. This can be done by copying the certificate from keycert.pem and adding it to prikey.pem. 

Sterling Certificate Wizard 1.3 supports AES256 encryption of the private key.
