 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After granting a database login account with db_owner role for SCA database tem_analytics, customer used this account to login in the SCA web interface. But the following errors are showed in the import log when he run an import.

2014-12-16 12:50:52 (+0:00:00.063) INFO: ETL from Datasource - SCM::CheckResult (0x00000000000B9CA8 - 0x00000000000B9CA8): Failed
2014-12-16 12:50:52 (+0:00:00.145) ERROR: Sequel::DatabaseError: NativeException: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: User does not have permission to perform this action. 

CAUSE
For SCA import, the database login account should be granted sys_admin fixed
server role or have ownership of the database (dbo).

ANSWER
To solve the problem, there are two workarounds: 

1. Execute the sp_changedbowner stored procedure (for example: exec sp_changedbowner 'loginname') to change the database owner on the tem_analytics database to be the same user as the Tivoli Endpoint Manager Analytics service account user. 

The other way is to grant "sys_admin" the the service account user .
