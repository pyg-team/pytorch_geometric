APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is looking for a solution to allow him to have a
   version of the MQ files in USS which do not have the VRM
   number as part of the files names, so he does not need to
   change his JVMProfile files each time a new MQ fix pack
   is released.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of IBM MQ for z/OS Version 8       *
   *                 Release 0 Modification 0.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a fixpack is applied to the MQ for *
   *                      z/OS java component, an OSGi system     *
   *                      (for example CICS OSGi) configured to   *
   *                      reference the OSGi jar files may lose   *
   *                      access to the MQ jars and fail the next *
   *                      time they are needed.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   The jar files for OSGi are named with the current fixpack level
   as part of the filename. When applying maintenance to the Java
   component of MQ, the SMP/E install replaces the previous OSGi
   files with new ones which thus have new names. The JVM profile
   for an OSGi JVM server needs to be edited to refer to the new
   jar names otherwise it will fail to access them.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Symlinks have been added to the file system so that the JVM
   profile configuration only has to be performed once, persisting
   future fixpack installations.
