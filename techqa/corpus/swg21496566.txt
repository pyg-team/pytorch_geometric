 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How can I retrieve the business names of rules that were executed through Rule Execution Server? 

ANSWER
You can retrieve the business names of rules that were executed through Rule Execution Server by enabling the ruleset trace for the rule events and by using the ruleset trace API on the client side, as explained in sections Decision Server V8.0.1 > Decision Server Rules > Managing business rule execution in Rule Execution Server > Developing client applications > Ruleset execution trace [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/con_res_devclient_exec_trace.html] and Decision Server V8.0.1 > Decision Server Rules > Managing business rule execution in Rule Execution Server > Configuring a Rule Execution Server instance > Retrieving the ruleset execution trace [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_getting_trace.html] of the documentation.
The sample code below retrieves the business names of rules that were executed without a rule flow. 

This code works for BAL rules, decision tables, and decision trees, and returns the business name of the rule, as read in Rule Team Server or Rule Studio. 

Note: For a decision table, if the first rule of the decision table has been executed, the following code sample returns the name as "my dt 1".

// execution
IlrSessionResponse response;
IlrStatelessSession session = factory.createStatelessSession();
response = session.execute(request);

// get the business execution trace
IlrBusinessExecutionTrace execResult = new IlrBusinessExecutionTrace(response.getRulesetExecutionTrace());

// get the execution events in the business trace
for (IlrExecutionEvent event : execResult.getExecutionEvents())
{
// filter on rule execution events
if (event instanceof IlrRuleEvent)
{
IlrRuleEvent ruleEvent = (IlrRuleEvent)event;
IlrRuleInformation ruleInfo = ruleEvent.getRuleInformation();
// print the business name of the rule
System.out.println(ruleInfo.getBusinessName());
}
}


You can refer to the API documentation of ilog.rules.res.session.ruleset.IlrRuleEvent [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0m1/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.ref.res/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/session/ruleset/IlrRuleEvent.html] for another example, which deals with rules that were executed through a rule flow.
