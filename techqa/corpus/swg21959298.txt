Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Rational Test Control Panel component in Rational Test Workbench and Rational Test Virtualization Server uses an insecure hashing scheme for handling user passwords (CVE-2015-1913) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Rational Test Control Panel component stores MD5 hashes of user passwords, which has now proven to be insecure. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2015-1913 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1913]
Description: Rational Test Control Panel generates and stores an MD5 hash of users' passwords. The MD5 hash is persisted and used to authenticate the user the next time he/she logs into the server. The MD5 hash algorithm is understood to be vulnerable to an attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
