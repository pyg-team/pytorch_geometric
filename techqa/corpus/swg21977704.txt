PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A webservice calls a message flow, but the message flow is not showing up in the Transactions widget of the IBM Integration Bus (IIB) agent on APM dashboard. 

SYMPTOM
The IIB dashboard "All my applications > Appl_name > Components > IBM Integration Bus" lists transactions in "Transactions" widget. Some message flows are not showing up in "Transactions" list on the widget.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use following steps to determine if the missing message flows are indeed being called: 

1) Confirm with the developer or IIB administrator that the webservice is calling the specific message flows.

2) Confirm that Transactions tracking is enabled at the IIB agent.
The custom.properties file of the agent should have following setting: 

transaction_tracking=ENABLED 

The custom.properties file is located at <install_dir>/localconfig/qi/, and is named as follows: 

broker_host_KQIB_custom.properties 

3) Run mqsilist command for each execution group to find all the message flows - refer to IIB documentation for the command syntax.

When the message flows are identified, the broker can be queried to see if exits are enabled on that message flow:

mqsireportflowuserexits <broker> -e <execution_group> -k <application> -f <flow>

If it is determined that the message flow is being called, and it is still not showing up in the Transactions widget, contact IBM support.
