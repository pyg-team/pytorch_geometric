CAUSE
The IBM JDK release was found to be the cause of the starter reports failing to work in BIRT Eclipse.



ENVIRONMENT
Only occurs on OS AIX using IBM JDK. 

It does not occur using Sun (Oracle) Java JDK. 

An AIX environment can only use IBM JDK.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To reproduce the problem: 

Create a starter report in TRIRIGA, which runs fine in TRIRIGA. 

Export to BIRT Eclipse. 

When the report that ran properly in TRIRIGA runs, it fails with below exception: 

______________________________________________________________________________
Caused by: java.util.MissingResourceException:

Can't find bundle for base name tririgaconnect, locale en_AU

______________________________________________________________________________ 

Export a starter report from TRIRIGA. Attempt to run the report in Eclipse. 

The same report will run on other OS platforms without any issues.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Copy rowset.jar from the TRIRIGA directory <tririgaInstallPath>/tools/lib/rowset.jar. 

Into the IBM SDK Java home "endorsed" directory:


Example:
/exports/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer85/java/jre/lib/endorsed

Restart the application server include the new jar file in the classpath and resolve the problem. 

Run the report to test it.
