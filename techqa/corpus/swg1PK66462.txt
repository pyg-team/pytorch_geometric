APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Attempting to debug a failing CICS SSL Application using the SSL
   GSKSRVR Component Trace displays the following error:
   .
   CICS      MESSAGE   00000004  09:14:39.277108  SSL_ERROR
     Job CICSNAME  Process 00020136 Thread 00000001
                   default_setsocketoptions
     fcntl(F_GETFL) failed for socket 766487040:
     113 - EDC5113I Bad file descriptor.
   .
   System SSL will put out this message when the File Descriptor
   that was passed to us is not a valid file descriptor.  SSL will
   continue processing because it's not known if the application
   is sending us a pointer to a structure instead of the actual
   file descriptor.  Therefore, the SSL Handshake will continue
   despite the error shown above.
   .
   The message is issued due to CICS not supplying a callback
   routine for SETSOCKETOPTIONS.  This causes system SSL to use the
   native TCPIP routine which then fails with EBADF because the
   file desciptor passed to it is not a real file descriptor.  CICS
   should provide a callback for the setsocketoptions call.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An SSL component trace taken during a   *
   *                      CICS SSL handshake process contains     *
   *                      SSL_ERROR entries, but the handshake is *
   *                      successful.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   CICS has not provided an io_setsocketoptions() callback routine
   to be used during the SSL handshake process, so System SSL
   attempts to use the default routine.  However the socket
   descriptor passed to this routine is not a true socket
   descriptor, but is an internal token used by CICS.  The default
   routine attempts an fcntl(F_GETFL) function, which fails with an
   EBADF response because of the invalid socket descriptor.  The
   handshake is successful, but a SOCKET_ERROR condition is logged
   on the System SSL component trace.  This can lead to misleading
   diagnostics.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHSOSE has been changed to supply a dummy version of the
   io_setsocketoptions() callback routine.
