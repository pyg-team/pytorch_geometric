 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ have addressed multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL and GSKit.

OpenSSL is used by IBM MQ Advanced Message Security on the IBM i platform only. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-0705 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3732 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2018-1428 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1428]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139073 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139073] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2018-1427 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1427]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit contains several enviornment variables that a local attacker could overflow and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.2
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139072 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139072] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2018-1426 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1426]
DESCRIPTION: IBM GSKit duplicates the PRNG state across fork() system calls when multiple ICC instances are loaded which could result in duplicate Session IDs and a risk of duplicate key material.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139071 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139071] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2018-1447 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1447]
DESCRIPTION: The GSKit CMS KDB logic fails to salt the hash function resulting in weaker than expected protection of passwords. A weak password may be recovered. Note: After update the customer should change password to ensure the new password is stored more securely. Products should encourage customers to take this step as a high priority action.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139972 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139972] for the current score
