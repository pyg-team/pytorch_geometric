Downloading and assembling the product

 1. Download all parts below. The parts are described by platform in the tabbed sections of this document.
 2. Unpack each of the parts into the same temporary directory on the target system used to host the installation images. For all Unix™ variant platforms, the files must remain archived and compressed if downloaded to a Microsoft® Windows® environment to avoid file corruption when decompressing, and must be unpacked only on the target platform.
 3. Follow the instructions in the Quick Start Guide to install the product.
