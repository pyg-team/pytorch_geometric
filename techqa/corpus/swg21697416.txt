Title: IBM Stubbing fails when single item recovery is enabled for the mailbox - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Stubbing fails in IBM Content Collector (ICC) when single item recovery for a mailbox is enabled in Exchange. 

SYMPTOM
The ICC email connector log shows the following message: 

 * 
 * 2015-02-13T13:25:37.053Z FINEST [5296] msExchELCMailboxFlags: 50
   2015-02-13T13:25:37.053Z FINE [5301] Skipping stubbing task, because stubbing of this message is currently not possible due to settings on the document store


CAUSE
Single item recovery is enabled for the mailbox in Exchange

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector for Email with Microsoft Exchange



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The primary reason to stub documents is to save space on the mail server.
When single item recovery is enabled for the mailbox, the opposite is happening. Stubbing actually increases the storage space. 
If user stubs and restores the same email over and over again the mail server storage may unpredictably increase. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you do not need single item recovery, disable the feature in Microsoft Exchange. 

If single item recovery is required and you still wish to stub the email, implement the following workaround: 

 * In ICC version 3.0, set a system environment variable AFU_IGNORE_MAILBOX_FLAGS = 1.
   Restart task route services to take effect. 
 * In ICC version 4.0 or later, add a variable in ICC Configuration Manager > Connectors > Email > Variables tab: AFU_IGNORE_MAILBOX_FLAGS = 1
   Restart task route service to take effect.
