APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed IBM SPSS Statistics 24. In prior releases
   (for example release Statistics 23) you were used to see some
   executable files on program installation directory, for example
   on a Windows Computer these files were:
   
   lswhere.exe, lsmon.exe and lslic.exe
   
   However, for release 24 you do no longer see these executable
   files on the client installation path.
   To use lswhere.exe for example was useful for troubleshooting in
   the past when the client was installed with concurrent (network)
   license.
   When you run lswhere.exe on Client for example, you could see if
   the connection to license server was established or not, so you
   wonder why these files were removed from Client installation.
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The files were removed from Client installations by intention as
   they are normally only used on the Computer where the Concurrent
   license Manager is installed.
   However, for troubleshooting purposes it is considered to maybe
   put these files back to Client installations in a future
   release.
   Furthermore, these utilities have been discontinued by Sentinel
   and old utilities do not work properly with new versions.
