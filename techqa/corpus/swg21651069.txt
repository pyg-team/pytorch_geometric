QUESTION
 What SFTP servers does DataPower support? 

CAUSE
DataPower and SFTP Server compatibility.

ANSWER
DataPower supports the SFTP v3 protocol. An explanation of the supported servers can be found in DataPower's Release Notes and currently states as follows: 

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) Support 
The supported protocols are as follows: 

 * SSH-2 protocol defined by IETF RFC 4251 
 * SFTP Version 3 defined by the draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt Internet-Draft 

If an SFTP server supports Version 3 (the most commonly supported version), DataPower should be able to interoperate with it. 

Even if we interoperate with an SFTP server, we do not claim official support for it if we did not test it. Because we did not test with a wide variety of SFTP servers, we are not aware of any idiosyncrasies that a specific SFTP server may rely on which DataPower might not support. We simply support the SFTP v3 protocol according to the specification.
