PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When adding documents via IBM Content Navigator, if SSL is used and File Tracker is enabled, the operation fails. We are using WebSphere Application Server. 

SYMPTOM
The UI does not show any errors but the screen will refresh after clicking the button to add document.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server administrative console. 

2. Navigate to following pages and make sure 'Enable SSL ID tracking' is not enabled for the navigator application. By default, this is not checked.


 * Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > the server where you deployed IBM Content Navigator > Session management 
 * Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > navigator > Session management 
 * Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications > navigator > Manage Modules > navigator.war > Session management


3. Restart the web application server for your changes to take effect.
