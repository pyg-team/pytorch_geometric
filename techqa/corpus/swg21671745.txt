SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (i.e. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. 

CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

Note: Fixes for IBM Campaign and IBM Contact Optimization are included in the same package. After applying the fix, administrators are requested to execute the below additional steps for complete remediation of CVE-2014-0160. 1. Replace your SSL Certificates. 

You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (ie using "openssl genrsa") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 

2. Reset database and application user credentials. 

Passwords of IBM Campaign system database, User database and IBM Campaign and IBM Contact Optimization web application users should be reset after the upgrade.

Warning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment.
