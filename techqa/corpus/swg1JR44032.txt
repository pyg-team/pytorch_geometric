   Changes to database queries for APAR JR42220 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42220] were not
   specifically targeted at performance of My Team Performance,
   but rather a functional issue.  Additionally, the changes made
   were not ideal for all use cases of My Team Performance, so
   some customers may have noticed functional changes that
   were not desirable.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Interim fixes for Business Process Manager Version 7.5.1.0 and
   Version 8.0.0.0 have been been published to Fix Central.
   Please refer to the separate file that is automatically
   downloaded with each interim fix for prerequisite information
   and installation/uninstallation instructions.
   
   In the interim fixes, many database query optimizations have
   been applied that improve the performance of My Team
   Performance, including the enhancements made for JR42220 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42220].
   (The enhancements for JR42220 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42220] are now configurable, depending
   on the usage of My Team Performance; these options are
   described in detail in the readme files.)  Some of the
   enhancements are also applicable to My Performance.
