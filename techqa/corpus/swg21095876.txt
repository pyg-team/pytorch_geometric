PROBLEM
You have modified the SSL cipher restrictions for HTTP on your Lotus Domino server. Users with a Web browser that supports 40-bit or 56-bit encryption can no longer access the server and the following message appears on the server console: 

 * 
 * 


Does Domino support using SSL ciphers such as SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5? 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using export-grade ciphers with an RSA server key stronger than 512-bits is explicitly prohibited in the SSL v3 and TLS specifications. The Domino SSL server will refuse to use an EXPORT cipher with a server key larger than 512-bits or an EXPORT1024 cipher with a server key larger than 1024-bits. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the warning message shown above appears on the console and in the log. 

How to prevent the warning

You can prevent this warning message from appearing on the Domino server console and in the log by disabling the 40-bit and 56-bit ciphers as follows:


 * If using the Server document settings to configure your Web server, then in the Server document go to Ports -> Internet Ports tab, and in the SSL Security section, click Modify and clear the 40-bit and 56-bit ciphers.

 * If using the Internet Sites view to configure your Web server, then go to the Internet Site document, Security tab, to modify the ciphers.


Disabling this cipher has no effect on the Domino server because the ciphers are automatically disabled every time a client makes a connection. 

Web browsers and 128-bit encryption Domino follows the standard set by the RFC that states that if using 128-bit encryption, you should not allow lower level encryption. For SSL to work properly with Domino, Web browsers must be at 128-bit encryption.
