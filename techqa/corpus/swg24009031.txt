ABSTRACT
 This SupportPac contains the IBM WebSphere MQ clients for HP OpenVMS V6.0 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac provides WebSphere MQ client libraries for the HP OpenVMS operating system. It can be used to develop WebSphere MQ applications and communicate with any WebSphere MQ server which supports client connections.

A WebSphere MQ client is part of the product that can be installed on its own, on a separate machine from the base product and server. You can run a WebSphere MQ (MQSeries) application on a WebSphere MQ client and it can interact, by means of a communications protocol, with one or more WebSphere MQ servers and connect to their queue managers. The servers to which the client connects may or may not be part of a cluster. WebSphere MQ Family Platforms provides a list of which platforms are supported as WebSphere MQ Clients and/or Servers. 

An application that you want to run in the WebSphere MQ client environment must first be linked with the relevant client library. When the application issues an MQI call, the WebSphere MQ client code directs the request to a queue manager, where it is processed and from where a reply is sent back to the client. The link between the application and the client code is established dynamically at runtime. 

The MQI is available to applications running on the client platform; the queues and other WebSphere MQ (MQSeries) objects are held on a queue manager that you have installed on a server machine. 

This WebSphere MQ client for OpenVMS can be optionally used with the following SSL kit offerings from HP for additional security facilities:


WebSphere MQ for HP OpenVMS v6.0 – SSL 1.3
WebShere MQ for HP OpenVMS v6.0.2.10 – SSL 1.4-453

Possible Uses
Why use WebSphere MQ clients?

Using WebSphere MQ clients is an efficient way of implementing WebSphere MQ messaging and queuing. 

You can have an application that uses the MQI running on one machine and the queue manager running on a different machine, either physical or virtual. The benefits of doing this are: 
» There is no need for a full WebSphere MQ implementation on the client machine.
» Hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. 
» System administration requirements are reduced. 
» A WebSphere MQ application, running on a client can connect to multiple queue managers on different systems. 
» Alternative channels using different transmission protocols may be used. 

What applications run on a WebSphere MQ client?

The full MQI is supported in the client environment and this enables almost any WebSphere MQ application to be relinked to run on a WebSphere MQ client. Link the application on the WebSphere MQ client to the MQIC library, rather than to the MQI library. The exceptions are: 
» An application that needs syncpoint coordination with other resource managers. 
» Get(signal) on z/OS. 

Note: An application running on a WebSphere MQ client may connect to more than one queue manager concurrently, or use a queue manager name with an asterisk (*) on an MQCONN or MQCONNX call. 
The application will have to be changed if you want to link to the queue manager libraries instead of the client libraries, as this function will not be available.
