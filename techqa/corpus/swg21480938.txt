Title: IBM Summary statistic for CTables in SPSS not aligned properly - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am running SPSS Custom Tables syntax in SPSS/Statistics 14 or higher. I run the following command using the Employee.sav data file:

* Custom Tables.
CTABLES
/VLABELS VARIABLES=gender jobcat educ DISPLAY=DEFAULT
/TABLE jobcat [COUNT F40.0] + educ [COUNT F40.0, COLPCT.VALIDN PCT40.1, TOTALS[MEAN, COUNT F40.0, TABLEPCT.TOTALN
PCT40.1]] BY gender
/SLABELS POSITION=ROW
/CATEGORIES VARIABLES=gender jobcat ORDER=A KEY=VALUE EMPTY=INCLUDE
/CATEGORIES VARIABLES=educ ORDER=A KEY=VALUE EMPTY=INCLUDE TOTAL=YES POSITION=AFTER MISSING=EXCLUDE.

The table comes out as expected. But when I add VISIBLE=NO to the /SLABELS subcommand, the statistics appear in a different order. I requested the mean, count, and count percent to appear in that order for the Total. What I get is the count, mean, and count percent. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SPSS is ordering the statistics display in order of the default statistics labels. In the above example, the statistics, in alphabetical order, are COUNT, MEAN, and TABLE TOTAL PERCENT. You may put in some dummy statistics labels such as "a", "b", and "c" in the syntax so that your /TABLE subcommand may look like this:

/TABLE jobcat [COUNT F40.0] + educ [COUNT F40.0, COLPCT.COUNT PCT40.1, 
TOTALS[MEAN 'a', COUNT F40.0 'b', TABLEPCT.TOTALN PCT40.1 'c']] BY gender

This will force a "reorder" of the statistics by the dummy statistics labels. We may still use the VISIBLE=NO syntax in the /SLABELS subcommand so these dummy labels don't appear.

The decision to display the statistics this way was made by the SPSS Development department. They noted that if you select multiple custom total statistics that are also in the body of the table and you hide the statistics labels, then the totals are resorted into the same order as in the body of the table. -- and since the labels aren't displayed, you may not know what each total statistic actually represents. So it is possible to select selecting multiple statistics and hiding the statistics labels, but for clarity's sake it is perhaps best to display the statistics labels in such instances.
