ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description
   When adding a filter in a query some contributor attributes are
   in Japanese/German or any other language installed on the server
   but should be in English. The lower level attribute like
   archived, name and so on of the attribute 'Created By' or
   'Modified By' are in server language and not in English
   
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Make sure the CCM server has the language package installed,
   for example Japanese (any other language will be able to
   reproduce too)
   2. Create a new OOTB Scrum Project Area called JP_PA
   3. Prepare two browsers, one's locale set to Japanese, the other
   remains as English, for example IE (for Eng) and FF (for JP)
   4. go to JP_PA from JP locale Browser and create a query. Filter
   on 'Created By' and expand it to see the underlying attributes.
   
   Expected Behavior
   The underlying attribute names should be consistent with the
   client locale setting of the browser
   
   Actual Behavior:
   The underlying attribute names are in language that is different
   from client local. In the above example they show up in Japanese
   even in the Browser set to English.
