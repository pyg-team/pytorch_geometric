APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are migrating from CICS 3.1 to a new release of CICS and
   your application now gets a RESP2=200 on an EXEC CICS START
   TERMID command.
   CICS 3.2 introduced a change which disallowed a START
   TERMID(eibtrmid) from a DPL program in the environment where
   eibtrmid=termid of the inter-system session.
   The problem arises if an application is issuing EXEC CICS START
   for an APPC single session surrogate terminal id. In this case,
   CICS v3.1 uses the connection name instead of the session id
   but the check on EIBTRMID, which was introduced in CICS 3.2
   finds the session id and rejects the START as being invalid.

   ****************************************************************
   An EXEC CICS START TERMID request is not allowed to be issued
   from a DPL program if the TERMID is for the inter-system
   session. A RESP of INVREQ with RESP2=200 is returned in this
   case.
   When an EXEC CICS START TERMID request is issued for an
   APPC single session surrogate TERMID, CICS uses the
   connection name instead of the session. Although a connection
   is being used, rather than a session, the request fails
   when issued from a DPL program.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS is changed to allow an EXEC CICS START TERMID command from
   a DPL program when the TERMID is an APPC single session
   surrogate.
