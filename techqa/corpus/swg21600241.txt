Title: IBM Impact 6.1 installation does not complete - United States

Text:
Impact 6.1; installation; Netcool/Impact; IMPACT6.1.0.0_install-00.log; failed; javasharedresources TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IMPACT6.1.0.0_install-00.log shows the installer doesn't make it past step_00009, and will not properly start WAS server, which is needed to continue the installation process. 

SYMPTOM
Installation log doesn't get past this step: 

 "step_00009_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_StartWAS_ImpactProfile_eWAS_NameServer", and WAS will not start. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The /tmp/javasharedresources/ directory had these permissions "drwxrwxr-x", but those needed be changed to "drwxrwxrwx", so that their non-root, which they're attempting to install Impact as, has proper access to write to this directory.
