Title: IBM How to enable database trace with Cognos Impromptu - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Want to trace the SQL being sent to the database by Cognos Impromptu. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Trace can be enabled in the <install_path>/bin/cogdm*.ini files. Open these files and refer to the header information to information on what type of database they are used for. 

The trace should only be enabled for troubleshooting a single query issue and not appropriate for use in a scenario with multiple reports or queries are being executed or for an extended period of time.

Example of setting up a trace for a native Oracle connection.

Steps:
1. In the <install_path>/bin directory, create a backup of the cogdmor.ini file.
2. In the <install_path>/bin directory, open the cogdmor.ini file in a text editor
3. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

[Trace]
Output=c:\temp\oracle_trace.txt
Flags=1111111111

For performance issues you can also add the timer=yes option. 

4. Save the file.
5. Perform the test and review the file.
6. Disable the trace by removing the entries or commenting the lines with a semi-colon, and saving the file.
