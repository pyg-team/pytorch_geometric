SUMMARY
 ISC BIND is vulnerable to several security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-1286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1286]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when parsing signature records for DNAME resource records. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion failure in resolver.c or db.c and cause the named process to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111390 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111390] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2088 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2088]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in servers with cookie support enabled. By sending a response containing multiple DNS cookie options, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111391 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111391] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-1285 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1285]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of control channel input. By sending a specially crafted packet, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an assertion failure in sexpr.c or alist.c and cause the named process to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111389 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111389] for the current score
