ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The entry/exit connectors on statecharts will not show properly
   when added to a state within the sub-statechart. Specifically, i
   f I add an entry/exit connector to the substate, it will appear
   as an exit connector. Even after I hook up arrows to it showing
   that an event is going into the substate, the
   connector appears as an exit connector rather than an entry conn
   ector.
   Note that the model does generate code and that code compiles ok
   .
   
   To reproduce:
   1. Create a statechart and add a state.
   2. Select a state within the statechart and create a 'Sub-Statec
   hart'
   3. In the top statechart add two EnterExit Points.
   4. Draw a transition into one of the EnterExit Points and draw a
    transition from the other EnterExit Point.
   5. On the substate diagram select Update EnterExit Points.
   
   Both will appear as Exits
