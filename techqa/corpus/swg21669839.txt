Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere MQ (Paho MQTT and HP-NSS clients) are affected by a vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160]
DESCRIPTION:
OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability.

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92322] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability is known to affect the following offerings; 

 * Support Pac MAT1 - WebSphere MQ client for HP Integrity NonStop Server 
 * Support Pac MA9B - IBM Mobile Messaging and M2M Client Pack - Eclipse Paho MQTT C Client libraries for Linux & Windows platforms only


Note that the Paho MQTT C client libraries provided for Linux and Windows platforms in IBM WebSphere MQ 7.1 and IBM WebSphere MQ 7.5 are also affected. 

This vulnerability does NOT affect any version or release of the following on any other platforms:  * IBM WebSphere MQ Client 
 * IBM WebSphere MQ Server 
 * IBM WebSphere MQ Managed File Transfer 
 * IBM WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Security


Note that IBM Java JSSE does not use OpenSSL and so it is NOT affected by this vulnerability. REMEDIATION/FIXES
Both the HP Integrity NonStop Server MQ client and Paho MQTT C clients for Linux and Windows platforms have been updated to use OpenSSL 1.0.1g, which contains a fix for the heartbleed vulnerability. 

 * A refreshed install image for the HP Integrity NonStop Server MQ client can be downloaded from Fix Central here [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+MQ&release=7.1&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=MQ-7100-hpns-ia64-OpenSSL101g&includeSupersedes=0]. 
 * A refreshed zip file containg the Paho MQTT C client can be downloaded from Fix Central here [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+MQ&release=7.5&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=1.0.0.3-WS-MQCP-MA9B-OpenSSL101g&includeSupersedes=0].
