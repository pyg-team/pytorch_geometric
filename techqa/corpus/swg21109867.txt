AMQ6174 MQRC 2119 putting message remote queue MQMINFO TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are putting a message on a remote queue on AIX using WebSphere MQ (V5.3, V6 or V7). The channel is defined as CONVERT(YES). A message is put to the dead letter queue (DLQ) with RC 2119. The message uses the default CCSID of 819 and encoding 273, and the MD.FORMAT = MQSTR. 

The error message in the error log is:

AMQ6174 "The library /var/mqm/exits//MQSTR_r was not found." 
WebSphere MQ should not be looking for a user exit. 
A trace shows that MQ fails in 'vxtConvertCharsFn', 'vwb_string', 'vwaConvert' all with rc=00000847. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You are most likely missing your conversion tables in AIX. Make sure all conversion tables exist and if not you will need to add them. For more details consult: 

 * AMQ6047 conversion not supported on AIX CCSID 1208 273 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg21222078]
