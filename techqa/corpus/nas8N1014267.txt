PERFM; WAS; WSAS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM® i5/OS® Collection Services use IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.x. logs for performance and tuning. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collection Services collects PMI Data at specific time intervals, which provide a snapshot of activity during the time interval. Clients want this because of the following reasons: 

o Analyze IBM WebSphere performance problems and bottlenecks o System capacity planning o Performance comparison of user applications from one WebSphere Application Server release to another o Performance comparison of user applications from one IBM i5/OS release to another 
This is supported in Websphere 6.1, 7.0, 8.0 and 8.5. 

WebSphere Application Server V8.5 documentation has been updated with the information on how to collect performance data. Collection Service documentation can be found at the following Websphere Information Center Web site:
