ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Covered in JIRA WLE-7951
   
   
   The use case is we have a nested process implemented as a
   multi-instance loop. Inside that sub-process, different
   instances might be sitting at different steps of the
   sub-process. This looks fine in the inspector, but in the portal
   flash diagram, only one box is highlighted. I have included a
   screenshot of the flash diagram next to the Process Designer
   inspector to show the problem more clearly
   (https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/pmr/9/4/94715,004,000/
   2011-12-16/94715.004.000.repro-screenshot.png).
   
   This is not likely to be experienced by a large number of users,
   but it is a bug nonetheless. I am also including a simplified
   twx file from what Joe gave me to make it fairly easy to
   reproduce

   004%2C000%2F2011-12-15%2F94715.004.000.AZ_Demo_-_Repro.twx).
   
   1. Import the above file.
   
   2. Open the Request for Service Process BPD.
   
   3. Press play.
   
   4. Run the first step of the process.
   
   5. Add two items to the List of Requirements and click GO!
   
   6. Refresh the Inspector.
   
   7. Run the second task.
   
   8. Select one of the Requirements and click Set
   
   requirements to vendor.
   
   9. Select the other Requirement and click Set requirements
   
   to vendor.
   
   10. Click Done.
   
   11. Open the portal as tw_user (password is "admin").
   
   12. Select the Task: Review of Requirements task, and click
   
   on the process diagram link above.
