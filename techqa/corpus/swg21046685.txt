QUESTION
 How do I edit the FRNOLINT.TBL file? 

ANSWER
Use the Notepad to edit the FRNOLINT.TBL file. 

 1. Open a command prompt. 
 2. Change directory to the directory where you installed the Content Manager for AS/400 client (FRNROOT by default). 
 3. Enter: NOTEPAD FRNOLINT.TBL 
 4. When editing the file:  * Do not press the Enter key. 
     * You can type over the incorrect or changed information, such as the TCP/IP address. 
     * You can copy an existing table entry by using the copy and paste functions. This way, you can add a second server, such as a test Content Manager for AS/400Â® server. Make sure that there is a blank line between server entries. Reminder: If you copy the example server entries, make sure that you remove the comment markers at the beginning /* and the end */ of the line.
