APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An unexpected restart might occur when using NFS and it might
   report a "Fatal Exception" IPMI event.
   
   If running DataPower Firmware prior 5.0.0.4, the IPMISelEvents
   section might report a 'watchdog2HardReset' event.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are DataPower appliances running firmware
    5.0.0.0-5.0.0.9 or 6.0.0.0-6.0.0.1 in configurations using
   NFS for any purpose.
   
   The appliance might randomly restart, with no backtrace, logging
   an IPMI SEL event.  The likelihood of the restart increases
   with the number of application domains using NFS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.10 and 6.0.0.2.
