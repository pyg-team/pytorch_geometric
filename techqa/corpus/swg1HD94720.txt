PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THE PROBLEM WAS SUBMITTED ON :VERSION V5R19.
   THIS PROBLEM IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE ON VERSION V5R21 GA level
   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis:
   IR reported that results should be same for "*_" and "_*".
   Technical Reason:
   Regarding the question "Can you please explain why names
   without '_' are returned by query?":
   Because '_' is a wildcard.
   Available wildcards are '*' and '_'.
    '*' means "any number of any character"
    '_' means "one occurrence of any character"
   The underscore is a special character, meaning "one
   occurrence of any character".
   For example, querying "*_AA" may return "Part-AAAAA":
   1. "Part-AA" matches "*" (any number of any character)
   2. "A" matches "_" (one occurrence of any character)
   3. "AA" matches "AA"-> all put together: "Part-AAAAA" matches
   "*_AA"
