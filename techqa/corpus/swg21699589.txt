Text:
FREAK; PSIRT; SSL; TLS; security; vulnerability SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys ("FREAK"), TLS/SSL client and server security vulnerability affects IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Version 1.6.0 SR16 FP3 and earlier. TLS/SSL is a configurable option in IBM FileNet Content Manager and IBM FileNet BPM products to provide secure connections for server to server commnication, such as servers in a cluster, as well as for server to client communication. If using SSL/TLS with these server products, please refer to the sections below to remediate the FREAK security vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: 
A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
