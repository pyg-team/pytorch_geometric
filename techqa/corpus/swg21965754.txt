QUESTION
 How do I configure Internet Explorer Enterprise Edition for Maximo and third party tools? 

ANSWER
This document details how to configure enterprise mode for Internet Explorer (IE). Enterprise Mode enables content to be viewed in the web browser in a lower version of IE. 
Maximo supports IE browsers in Standard mode. However, you may be using 3rd party products which support IE versions 10/11 in compatibility mode only. Because of these product support variations, you may want to evaluate using enterprise mode for IE 10/11. 

An example of this scenario is Cognos 10.2.1 which supports IE 10/11 in compatibility mode only.
