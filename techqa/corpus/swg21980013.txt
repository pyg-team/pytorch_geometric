Title: IBM How can I see the number of Real-Time Scoring Requests - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I want to evaluate the utilization of Real-Time Scoring requests in our C&DS environment. How can I do this? 

CAUSE
C&DS no longer logs each scoring request with the Audit tables because 
of volume and performance. Scores are aggregated when the Scoring 
Configuration is paused or restarted.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
SELECT SUM(CAST(B.Value AS INT)) 
FROM [CnDS7].[dbo].[SPSSAUDIT_EVENTS] A, [CnDS7].[dbo].[SPSSAUDIT_PARAMETERS] B 
where A.SERIAL = B.SERIAL and TITLE ='Scoring Test' and NAME = 'Total Score Change'

Change both [CnDS7] values to the name of your C&DS repository database. 
Change 'Scoring Test' to the name of your scoring config. 



This query can be modified/iterated for each scoring config you have or want to see.
