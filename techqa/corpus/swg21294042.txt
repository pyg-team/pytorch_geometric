Title: IBM SQL-IM002 error reported by the Build Forge Engine in foreground - United States

Text:
SQL-IM002; (SQL-IM002); SQLIM002; SQL IM002; Trying again.DBI connect('buildforge'; 'user'; ...) failed: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (SQL-IM002)(DBD: db_login/SQLConnect err=-1) at /PerlApp/BuildForge/DB/Handle.pm line 101; 1294042 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing IBM® Rational® Build Forge®, starting the engine in the foreground fails with, ...[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (SQL-IM002).... 

SYMPTOM
 

Problem Scenario:


 1. Build Forge is installed on a new machine with the ODBC driver specified properly as a System DSN. 
    
    
 2. The database name is the same as the System DSN name, which is required for connection. 
    
    
 3. Running the engine in the foreground results in a number of these type of error messages:

CAUSE
 

The ODBC driver was not entered in the 64-bit ODBC applet.


ENVIRONMENT
 

The Windows system is a 64-bit machine.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 


The ODBC driver must be entered in the 64-bit ODBC applet, which is located in a different place than the 32-bit applet.

These steps must be completed in order:


 1. This will open an ODBC window that may or may not have the System DSN for the Build Forge database. If it does not, then create a System DSN for the Build Forge database here. 
    
    If it does, then proceed with the next step. Do not proceed to the next step unless the System DSN does exist. You must create it if it does not exist, then continue with step #2.
    
    Start > Run > C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe
    
    
 2. This will bring up the 32-bit driver list for the databases. If the Build Forge System DSN does not exist here, you must create it.
    
    Important Note: Only complete this step if the previous step contained the Build Forge database System DSN. If not, then you need to complete step #1 by creating a System DSN for the Build Forge database in the 64-bit ODBC applet first.
