APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The output of script operation getDateField() is incorrect when
   getting the month.
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   In script sandbox, while running a script using the script
   operation getDateField(), it can be found that the output of
   getDateField is incorrect when month value is retrieved.
   
   Following is a sample code using the script operation
   getDateField("MONTH"):
   
   out.writeln(today());
   out.writeln("YEAR="+today().getDateField("YEAR"));
   out.writeln("MONTH="+today().getDateField("MONTH")); //This
   prints incorrect month.
   out.writeln("DATE="+today().getDateField("DATE"));
   out.writeln("HOUR_OF_DAY="+today().getDateField("HOUR_OF_DAY"));
   out.writeln("MINUTE="+today().getDateField("MINUTE"));
   out.writeln("SECOND="+today().getDateField("SECOND"));
   
   A sample outcome of the script is as below:
   
   Mon Sep 28 17:05:15 PDT 2009
   YEAR=2009
   MONTH=8
   DATE=28
   HOUR_OF_DAY=17
   MINUTE=5
   SECOND=15
   
   Obviously MONTH=8 is not correct as its September. The correct
   output should be MONTH=9.
