ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description: After open the workspace with Query
   Transaction
   Performance (620) query, the task type for each transaction code
   will be
   always with same value. It is wrong, a transaction workload
   statistical
   data sometimes includes some task types. You also can verify if
   workspace data matches the ST03N data on the SAPGUI
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1. Logon TEP, open transaction performance workspace,
   2. Assign the transport performance (620) query to this
   workspace
   3. Logon SAP Gui, open the ST03N
   4. compare the data of ST03N with TEP
   5. On TEP, for a transaction code, the task type (for example
   SE37)
   column is dialog and on ST03N, there are some RFC and other task
   type
   related with SE37 Transaction code.
   
   Related Files and Output:
   1. Open the TEP, and assign the transport performance (620)
   query to
   this workspace
   2. Open the SAPGUi, run ST03N transaction code, open the
   transaction
   profile
   3. select one transaction on the ST03N, then compare with TEP.

   SAPGUI(ST03N)
