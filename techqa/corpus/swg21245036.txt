was app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You notice the following messages are logged if the Java Message Service (JMS) is unable to find the queue manager. The queue manager name is based on the QueueManagerHost name. In general, the reason code 2085 means that the referenced queue could not be found on the Queue Manager. This specific issue, however, is caused by the configured QueueManagerHost.

CAUSE
In Message Queueing, the server was defined in lower-case. The queueManagerHost is case sensitive. For example: MYHOSTSRV was defined as myhostsrv.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure the definition matches case.
