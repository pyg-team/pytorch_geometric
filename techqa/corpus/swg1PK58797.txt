APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Filename(s) to modify:  /com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/wpf/inst_req60.html
   Section Name: Supported operating systems (required on portal
   machine)
   
   Release affected :  Portal 60
   
   
   Text reads:
   
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Enterprise Server (ES), Advanced
   Server (AS), Workstation (WS), and Desktop for x86-32, V3.0
   Update 6 & V4.0
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   
   WebSphere Portal supported in 32-bit mode only.
   
   WS & Desktop are only supported as developer platforms.
   
   For any Linux operating system, the libstdc++-3.3.3-41 shared
   object library is required prior to installation of WebSphere
   Portal.
   Refer to these Tech Notes before installation:
   
       * 1201306
   
   Set the system-wide maximum open files number to 10240 before
   running the WebSphere Portal installation program. This may be
   accomplished by root invoking ulimit -n 10240. Some systems may
   require a reboot before this value takes effect. Consult your
   operating system manual.
   
   
   
   Text SHOULD read:
   
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Enterprise Server (ES), Advanced
   Server (AS), Workstation (WS), and Desktop for x86-32, V3.0
   Update 6 & V4.0
   
   WebSphere Portal supported in 32-bit mode only.
   
   WS & Desktop are only supported as developer platforms.
   
   Productivity Components requires X11 R6 libraries in addition to
   the following libraries:
   
       * openmotif
       * openmotif21-libs
       * openmotif-devel
       * openmotif-libs
   
   For any Linux operating system, the libstdc++-3.3.3-41 shared
   object library is required prior to installation of WebSphere
   Portal.
   
   Refer to the Preparing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 for
   installation section of the WAS InfoCenter:
   
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?
   topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_linuxsetup_rhel4 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_linuxsetup_rhel4]
   .html
   
   Set the system-wide maximum open files number to 10240 before
   running the WebSphere Portal installation program. This may be
   accomplished by root invoking ulimit -n 10240. Some systems may
   require a reboot before this value takes effect. Consult your
   operating system manual.
   
   
   Brief Summary of Change:
   
   The technote that was originally reference needs to be a direct
   link to the WAS IC.  Currently it is confusing and customers are
   not referring to the link.  Also, RHEL 4 requires the X11 R6
   libraries so I have added it as well.  Essentially the "Red Hat
   Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Enterprise Server (ES), Advanced Server
   (AS), Workstation (WS), and Desktop for x86-32, V3.0 Update 6 &
   V4.0" section needs to contain the same requirements as "Red Hat
   Enterprise Linux AS for System z V3.0 Update 6 (31-bit OS
   only)".
