PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to upgrade IBM WebSphere Cast Iron from v6.0.x to v7.x fails 

CAUSE
The underlying OS versions used in Cast Iron v6.0.x and Cast Iron v7.x are different. Therefore, a direct upgrade from Cast Iron v6.0.x to Cast Iron v7.x is not supported. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are using a 9004 (physical appliance), then: 

- Upgrade from Cast Iron v6.0.x to v6.4.x and then from v6.4.x to v7.x.

If you are using HVE (virtual appliance), then: 

 1. Save your Projects and User Settings from the v6.0.x appliance using Repository > Import/Export in Web Management Console (WMC). 
 2. Install a fresh instance of Cast Iron v7.0 on the appliance and restore the Projects and User Settings. 
 3. Upload the vendor libraries (required by your projects) to WMC. 



Important note: Attempting an upgrade to Cast Iron v7.0 on HVE running Cast Iron v6.0.x directly or indirectly will lead to an unusable system. This MUST NOT be attempted. This also applies to Cast Iron v6.1.x/6.3.x/6.4.x HVE, which was not installed freshly but upgraded from v6.0.x. All such users also must NOT attempt an upgrade to Cast Iron v7.0. 

If you must upgrade HVE from Cast Iron v6.0.x (or any of the intermediate versions) to Cast Iron v7.0, without a fresh install of Cast Iron v7.0, it is recommended that you contact IBM support for an iFix (if any available) for this issue.
