LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM Installation Manager (IIM) executable code had to
   be modified to make changes after update as it is impossible
   to do this inside IIM offering code. That said, on my
   VirtualBox image of Windows 2008 64bit (SP1), in some cases
   the new registry entry did not make effect for some time. I
   noticed that even system reboot did no help in some cases.
   The most reliable way to make things work is to:
   0. Click on Windows ?Start? button.
   1. Navigate to IBM Installation Manager shortcut.
   2. Right-click on the shortcut
   3.  Select ?Properties?.
   4.  Select ?Compatibility? tab.
   5. Press ?Show settings for all users?
   6. Ensure that the ?Run this program as an administrator?
   check box is checked.
   (The check will be there due to the registry entry IIM
   enters.)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IIM code was updated to add the entry on the first run after
   update.
