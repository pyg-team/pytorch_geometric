 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I can see that IBM has released patches for the IBM Security Access Manager for Web and Mobile appliances, but I currently have multiple versions of Tivoli Access Manager for e-business and/or IBM Security Access Manager deployed in my enterprise. 

Which versions of IBM Security Access Manager are vulnerable to GNU C library (glibc) vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-7424, CVE-2014-8121) and which versions are not? 

CAUSE
The following statement is the official Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) description for these vulnerabilities:- 
CVEID: CVE-2013-7424 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7424]
DESCRIPTION: The GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an invalid free error in the getaddrinfo() function when used with the AI_IDN flag. An attacker able to make an application call this function could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system. 
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101073 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101073] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-8121 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8121]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly check if a file is open by DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS). By performing a look-up on a database while iterating over it, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102652 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102652] for the current score

This IBM technote has been put together to provide clarification in regards to which versions of IBM Security Access Manager/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business are vulnerable and which versions are not. 


ANSWER
It is important to note that only IBM Security Access Manager appliances are exposed to this vulnerability. This is due to the fact that customers are unable to upgrade the underlying operating system provided with these appliances. The IBM Security Access Manager development/support teams have provided fixes to overcome this exposure on our appliances. 


The following security bulletin provides more information about these fixes: 

IBM Security Access Manager for Web

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968821 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968821] 

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969017 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969017]

The following software versions of IBM Security Access Manager are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities:

IBM Security Access Manager for Web version 7.0.0 (software-based)
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1.1
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1
IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.0

This is due to the fact that these software releases do not package any part of the GNU C Library. 

It is however important to note that the underlying Operating System, which hosts these software versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Web/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business, might be vulnerable.

Therefore, IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.
