APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a  Published Manual Preservation Plan having all
   the existing custodians on Hold, there is no ability to add new
   custodians to the plan without suspending the Plan
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Click on Plan Details tab for the Preservation Plan > Click
   Request
   Suspend. This suspends the Plan
   
   Click on Custodians tab,  the Add Custodians button is
   enabled. The custodians can be added to the Plan
   
   Click on Plan Details tab > Click Publish/Resume Button.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Custodians cannot be added to a published preservation plan
   when all existing custodians are on hold.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A new configuration parameter is added to control whether new
   custodians can be added to a preservation plan that is on hold.
   The component parameter is LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_CONFIGURATION.
   ALLOW_CUSTODIANS_ADDED_TO_ONHOLD_PRESERVATION_PLAN. If the
   parameter is set to YES, new custodians can be added to
   preservation plans that are on hold. If the parameter is set to
   NO, new custodians cannot be added to preservation plans that
   are on hold. The default is NO.
   This fix is available now from FixCentral in fixpack 6.0.1.7.
