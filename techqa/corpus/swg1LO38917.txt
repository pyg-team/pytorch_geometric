ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is NOT a bug report SPR, it is an enhancement request by a
   customer to have IBM Lotus work with Nokia to provide a solution
   to synchronising Calendar Custom Repeating Meetings using the
   Nokia PC Suite and Notes 8.0.1/6.5.1.
   
   Calendar synchronisation works using E65/E71 phones with the
   Nokia PC Suite and Notes 8.0.1 and 6.5.1 with the exception of
   Calendar Custom Repeating Meetings. In this case, they only
   synchronise their first instance. Mail, Contacts, Calendar all
   sync correctly.
   
   The customer would like IBM to work with Nokia to help them
   provide the functionality for this to work with Nokia PC Suite.
   
   
   This issue does not occur with Windows Mobile devices.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create the custom repeating meetings on the phone and not Notes.
