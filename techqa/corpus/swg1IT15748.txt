ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DB2 Versions 10.1 Fix Pack 5 (APAR IT05851 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT05851]), 10.5 Fix Pack 7
   (IT06005 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06005]), and 11.1 GA introduced a behavior change in the way
   asynchronous write time is accumulated.  Asynchronous writes are
   submitted in large batches using asynchronous I/O services/APIs
   provided by an operating system.  The approximate previous
   behavior apportioned a pagecleaner EDU's I/O wait time evenly
   across all pages in a batch.  For example, if a batch of 10 I/O
   requests took 10ms to complete, each I/O request/page write
   would be assigned 1ms of the overall 10ms time.
   
   In many cases the apportionment approach masks underlying
   response time issues, and a change was made in the
   above-mentioned DB2 levels to stop splitting a pagecleaner's
   wait time across all pages written, and instead assign the
   entire batch time to each page write request.  In the case where
   a batch of 10 I/O requests took 10ms to complete each "page
   write" would be assigned the full 10ms.  While there is some
   value in providing this information, as it may more accurately
   reflect I/O response time in some storage configurations, it can
   also cause unnecessary concern.  This is due to the much higher
   calculated average asynchronous page write time, which bubbles
   up to overall average page write time.  It is reasonable that a
   large batch of I/Os may incur some overhead and take longer than
   a single I/O, thus the higher reported time may not be a good
   indicator of underlying I/O performance.  In addition, the wait
   time for pagecleaner write activity does not typically impact
   the time a db2agent EDU spends servicing application requests.
   As such, this APAR fix will revert to the former behaviour of
   splitting pagecleaner I/O wait time across the pages involved in
   a batch of asynchronous I/O requests.
