PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When "Step Into" or "Step Over" Java servlet or EJB code that runs on IBM WebSphere Application Server Test Environment (WTE) 5.1 provided by IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) or IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA) version 7, the debugger hangs sometimes at a particular line. 

CAUSE
These kinds of issues are likely caused by the IBM Java SDK that is used to run the WebSphere Application Server Test Environment 5.1 provided by Rational Application Developer and Rational Software Architect v 7.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply the WebSphere Application Server Java SDK latest Interim Fix for v5.1.1. 

The following instructions are documented here for quick reference, and are based on the assumption that you have installed RAD7 or RSA7 in the default location (which is:
C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\) and that the WebSphere Test Environment 5.1 is installed in C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v51.

If not, adapt the paths to reflect those appropriate for your installation in the instructions below.


 1. From the Interim Fix document linked above, click on "Update Installer for V5.1":
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&amp;aid=1]
    
    
 2. Download the "Update Installer - Windows":
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=2]
    
    
 3. Go back to the V5.1.1 Java SDK 1.4.2 Interim Fix page, and download the latest interim fix. (The current latest interim fix for Windows Base/ND/Express is SR9.)
    
 4. Unzip the updateInstaller.zip to a temp folder.
    
 5. From a command prompt, cd C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v51\bin, and run setupCmdLine.bat.
    
 6. From the same command prompt, cd to the temp folder where you have updateInstaller.zip extracted, and run updateWizard.bat.
    
 7. From the Update Installation Wizard - v5.1, specify the WTE 5.1 installation directory (for example, C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\runtimes\base_v51):
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=3]
    
 8. Select Install fixes, and click Next:
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&amp;aid=4]
    
 9. Specify the directory where you have interim fix JAR saved (the interim fix JAR for SR9 is PK50014_Windows_i386.jar), and then install the fix:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267313&aid=5]
    




WORKAROUND: 

 1. Double-click on the WebSphere v5.1 Test Environment in the Servers view.
    
    
 2. From the Server Overview page, uncheck the Enable hot method replace in debug mode checkbox.
    
    
 3. Save your changes to the Server Overview, and restart the WTE 5.1 in debug mode.
    


If the workaround resolves the issue, this will ensure that the hang was caused by the IBM Java SDK that was used to run the WTE 5.1.
