QUESTION
 What are the before and after views of a configured WebLogic server? Is there a way to see what parameters does ITCAM add into the startWebLogic.sh file? 

ANSWER
The files "startWebLogic.sh.original" and "startWeblogic.sh" attached here show the before and after views of a configured WebLogic DC respectively. This is on a WebLogic 10.3.5 server running on an AIX 6.1 64-bit system. 

The "startWebLogic.sh.original" file is the WebLogic server file before the DC is installed and configured. 

The "startWebLogic.sh" file is the WebLogic server file after the DC has been configured on it. 

To see what ITCAM updates are made in the startWebLogic.sh file, detach both these files attached here. Then just compare them in any editor or Notepad++ or run the Unix 'diff' command to see the lines ITCAM inserts into the startWebLogic.sh file.
