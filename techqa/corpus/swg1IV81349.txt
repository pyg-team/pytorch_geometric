APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract: Kinconfg.exe loops reading file dummy_files_list.txt
   from HOME\InstallITM\tmp\ directory. The Microsoft code does not
   recognize end of file so the code loops.
   
   Environment:
   Windows only INSTALL component. This is an OS bug we must code
   around.
   
   Problem Description:
   Code is reading the above file and never finds end of file so it
   loops.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   I doubt it can be recreated locally.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On some Windows machines, the installer goes into an endless
   loop reading dummy_files_list.txt.  The operating system fails
   to signal end of file while the installer is reading
   dummy_files_list.txt.  This causes the installer to continually
   read without ever stopping.  Eventually, the install log is
   filled to capacity and the install process is aborted, or the
   customer cancels the install.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added read loop counter that terminates the code if 10
   successive reads are performed without finding a dll to delete.
   The counter prevents the code from looping infinitely.
