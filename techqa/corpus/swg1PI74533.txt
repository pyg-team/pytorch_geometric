APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If an agedTimeout value of 0 is set on a connection manager
   a J2CA8011E error is output.  Setting an agedTimeout value
   of 0 is valid (it forces the connections to time out
   immediately as they are returned to the pool effectively
   turning off connection pooling) and the error should not be
   output.

   If an agedTimeout value of zero is set on a connection manager a
   J2CA8011E error is output.  Setting an agedTimeout value of zero
   is valid (it forces the connections to time out immediately as
   they are returned to the pool, which effectively turns off
   connection pooling) and the error should not be output.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was fixed so that the error message is no longer output
   for an agedTimeout value of zero.
