   .
   Stack Trace: 1.java.io.IOException: Too many open files
   at java.io.File.createNewFile(File.java:894)

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Problem is caused as
   com.sun.imageio.plugins.jpeg.JPEGImageReader objects are being
   refered through JNI code as JNI global references, causing delay
   in garbage collection of JPEGImageReader objects and hence
   leaking of resources(Memory/File descriptors).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR will be fixed in the following Java Releases:
      6 R1 SR8       (6.1.8.0)
      6    SR16      (6.0.16.0)
   .
   To resolve this issue JVM is updated to use weak references to
   JPEGImageReader objects in JNI code.
