ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The "Generic server cluster route action settings" topic in
   the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 7.0 needs to be updated. Within that topic, the
   description of the Active affinity property needs to be
   updated to include the following information:
   
   A cookie is used to maintain affinity and ensure that a request
   is returned to the correct server within the configured time.
   The Default expiration field specifies the amount of time, in
   seconds, that the active affinity set by the proxy server is
   valid. The cookie is automatically set to expire 24 hours
   after the affinity is no longer valid.
   
   Notes need to be added to the appropriate proxy cluster topics
   that clearly state that a proxy cluster does not have some of
   the same functionality as an application server cluster. For
   example, a proxy cluster does not provide failover and high
   availability support. The note also needs to stress that the
   main reason for creating a proxy cluster is to make it easier
   to administer multiple proxy servers. For example, if you set
   up a proxy cluster, you can complete an administrative action,
   such as starting or stopping all of the proxy servers in a
   cluster, by starting or stopping that proxy cluster. Also, you
   can set configuration settings for the proxy cluster that are
   automatically applied to all of the proxy servers in that
   cluster.

   ****************************************************************
   The "Creating a proxy server cluster," "Creating a proxy
   server cluster using the wsadmin command," and "Managing
   a proxy server cluster," topics in the Version 7.0 Information
   Center do not document that a proxy server cluster does not
   have all of the functionality of an application server
   cluster. For example, a proxy server cluster does not provide
   failover or high availability support. Also, the description
   of the Active affinity property, which is included in the
   "Generic server cluster route action settings" topic, does not
   mention that the cookie that gets created is set to expire 24
   hours after the affinity is no longer valid.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following note will be added to the "Creating a proxy
   server cluster," "Creating a proxy server cluster using the
   wsadmin command," and "Managing a proxy server cluster" topics
   in the Version 7.0 Information Center:
   
   Avoid Trouble: A proxy server cluster does not have some of
   the same functionality that an application server cluster has.
   For example, a proxy cluster does not provide failover, or
   high availability support. The main reason for creating a
   proxy cluster is to make it easier to administer multiple
   proxy servers. For example, if your proxy servers are members
   of a proxy server cluster, you can specify configuration
   settings for that proxy server cluster, and the settings are
   automatically applied to all of the proxy servers in that
   cluster. Creating a proxy server cluster also enables you to
   simultaneously start and stop all of the proxy servers in that
   cluster.
   
   Also, the description of the Active affinity
   property, that is included in the topic "Generic server
   cluster route action settings," will be updated to read:
   
   Active affinity
   
   Specifies whether the proxy server manages the application
   affinity to the target generic server. Active affinity is used
   when a generic server application cannot manage active affinity.
   
   A cookie is used to maintain affinity and ensure that a
   request is returned to the correct server within the
   configured time. The Default expiration field specifies the
   amount of time, in seconds, that the active affinity set by
   the proxy server is valid. The cookie is automatically set to
   expire 24 hours after the affinity is no longer valid.
   
   Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the
   current documentation before you read this text. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the May 2009
   update to the Information Centers.
