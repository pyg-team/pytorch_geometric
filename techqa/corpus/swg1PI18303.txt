APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  There are scenarios where the usage of the browser back button
   recreates a former shared render parameter state and therefore
   recreates a dialog instance identifier that was already removed
   by UXFM. This recreated dialog instance identifier is stale
   since there is no associated dialog instance context available.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Log out of your current session and log in again.
