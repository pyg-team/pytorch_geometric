ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT: Sametime 8.5.1
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Not getting intial bot message in STProxy web client
   
   Customer has sametime proxy server 8.5.1.1 on windows 2003
   enterprise edition. They have sametime bots (application). On
   initiating chat with this bot from browser client, users are not
   getting initial message. If they input anything then they are
   getting the response message from the bot.
   
   TROUBLESHOOTING:
   
   - Customer provided and tested the sameple BOT in lab ST
   8.5.1 env. Managed to reproduce the issue.
   
   When logged in using ST 8.5.1 connect client, I initiated chat
   session with the BOT, I was able to receive the initial welcome
   message from the BOT. But if I logged in from STProxy web
   client, I was not able to receive the initial message. When I
   input anything and send, I was able to receive response message
   from the BOT.
   
   These are some configuration info of my lab env:
   +++++++++++++++++++++++
   In lab env, I can reproduce the issue on my ST 8.5.1.1 env. This
   is the details of my lab env:
   ST SSC and ST Proxy are running on same server
   ST Community Server on another server
   OS: Windows 2003 Std Server
   
   LDAP - Active Directory - on another server
   Client Browser - IE7
   +++++++++++++++++++++++
   
   To reproduce this issue using the sample bot customer provided,
   1) just extract the zip file to a folder, and edit "run.bat"
   file to specify Sametime server, userid, and password
   information.
   2) run the run.bat to let the bot login to the Sametime server
   3) then login from a stproxy web client in browser, add the id
   used by the bot
   4) start a chat session with the bot from stproxy web client.
   Without entering anything, the user should receive an initial
   welcome message from the bot, but it doesn't happen in stproxy
   web client.
   If you repeat step 3) to 4) by using UIM client to initiate a
   chat session with the bot, you will receive the welcome message
   from the bot as expected.
   
   Please also note, all ST Proxy web client testing done in lab
   was through HTTP (no SSL).
   
   Per Customer's attached files:
   1) 05960.999.744.bot_initiat.doc - screenshots
   2) SampleFirstMessageBot-1.0.0.zip - sameple BOT. When testing,
   please edit run.bat to replace community server ip, login id,
   and password.
