ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Apparently when we installed the v8.1 instances of Datastage on
   zulu1, jazz1, and charger1 using the non-standard port numbers,
   it made FastTrack think that no one was credentialed to create a
   datastage job from a mapping specification. The bug is outlined
   in the following link:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=14&uid=swg1JR34893 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=14&uid=swg1JR34893]
    the thing is, this patch (JR34893 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR34893]) is no longer available for
   download because it was supposed to be included with the
   FastTrack 8.1.2 update (reference:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410979), [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410979),]
   which we have installed. Yet, the problem still exists. We have
   made the configuration changes that the above link requires on
   nova1 but to no avail. The problem exists on both hosts, zed1
   and nova1, and occurs no matter who the user is (myself,
   Geoffrey, and dsadm all get the same error).

   Customer update received:
   
   
   We transferred over the DStagewrapper.sh script and executed it
   against XMETA on test... querying XMETA not only showed KARMA3
   still registered, but we were also able to run the
   -deleteproject command to purge it from the database.
   
   After doing this, we were able to log on to FastTrack and
   generate a job successfully. So the root issue of this PMR is
   now solved. The cause all along was the incomplete unregistering
   of KARMA3, and the resolution was to delete the corresponding
   entries from XMETA.
   
   If you have no follow-up questions I believe you can close this
   PMR!
   
   Thank you for the hint about the projects not being cleared from
   the repository during the unregister node (didn't know that)...
   
   You may close the CRM.
   
   Thank you,
   Diane
