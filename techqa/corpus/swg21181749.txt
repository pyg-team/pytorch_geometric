Title: IBM How to restrict access to File Manager functions - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Client is concerned that users may alter or delete production tapes and/or VTOC information when using the File Manager 3.5 VTOC utility under ISPF. 

CAUSE
Client was concerned about end users having access to VTOCs, and tapes. They coded RACF rules with access of none to profiles: FILEM.DISK.FULLPACK and FILEM.TAPE.UPDATE. 

They do not want their users to be able to initialize or erase tapes outside of their tape manager system, but they do want them to have access to other functions controlled by FILEM.TAPE.UPDATE. They want to know if they have to code an FMNSECUR security user exit?

Should they be concerned about what users can do to the VTOC? Does this give them access to stuff only systems programmers should do?

Will the RACF dataset name rules protect me? 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can restrict access to specific functions by coding RACF profiles for FILEM.FUNCTION.fc (where 'fc' is the specific function you wish to restrict). For example, you could restrict access to the WTM (write tape mark) function by coding a profile for FILEM.FUNCTION.WTM. 

 

File Manager does not run APF Authorized under ISPF, so RACF rules take precedence. You do not need to be concerned that users will be able to corrupt VTOCs provided there are RACF rules to prevent access.
