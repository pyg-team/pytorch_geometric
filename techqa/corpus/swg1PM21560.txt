APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere Application Server V7.0 uses the IBM Installation
   Manager to install and update Feature Packs for the product.
   The Installation Manager utility is capable of connecting to
   repositories available on ibm.com to look for product updates.
   Installation Manager will connect to ibm.com if its list of
   repositories contains a URL pointing to ibm.com.
   
   When Installation Manager connects to the repositories on
   ibm.com, it may report that it is unable to connect to certain
   online repositories.  For example, it may show a message such as
   the following:
   
   Update Packages
   The following repositories are not connected:
   http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/resositories/ [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/resositories/]
   was/service/repository.config
   http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/service/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/service/]
   com.ibm.websphere.ND.v70/7.0.0.11
   
   Note that there are 2 example URLs displayed above.  The URLs
   may be may be displayed on multiple lines due to word-wrapping.
   Also note that the message may list other URLs.
   
   This APAR addresses an issue where Installation Manager reports
   that it is unable to connect to the repository, but yet it is
   still able to connect to the repository and apply product
   updates anyway.  The message is misleading, but it does not
   impact Installation Manager's ability to update the product.
   
   The most apparent impact of the message is that Installation
   Manager will not report that the product is completely
   "up-to-date" with the latest available updates after pressing
   the "Update" button.  Normally, if a product is completely
   updated, then Installation Message will display a message
   clearly indicating this.  But, due to this problem, if the
   product is up to date, Installation Manager will report that it
   is not able to find any updates to install, but that it had a
   problem connecting to the repositories.  It recommends
   correcting the repository connection problem.
   
   This message can cause confusion, because it is not completely
   apparent if the product is completely updated, or if there was a
   legitimate issue connecting to the online repositories.
   
   Explanation:
   The root cause of the problem is that a property named
   "offering.service.repositories" is not defined in the WAS
   Import Repository for most versions of WAS.  (The WAS Import
   repository for V7.0.0.7 is correct, but the others through
   V7.0.0.11 are incorrect.)
   
   The WebSphere Application Server  Import Repository is
   responsible for synchronizing data between Installation
   Manager and the currently-installed WebSphere Application
   Server products.  Installation Manager uses the location
   defined in the offering.service.repositories property for
   finding product updates.  If that property is not defined,
   then Installation Manager will use a default value for the
   location.  The default value does not work for the WebSphere
   Application Server Import Repository.  So, without the
   offering.service.repositories property defined, Installation
   Manager will always check an incorrect location for product
   updates, and report an error about it.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This condition does not prevent Installation Manager from
   properly updating WebSphere Application Server V7 feature packs
   using web repositories.  So, if Installation Manager is able to
   connect to ibm.com successfully, then it will still find updates
   to install if they are available.

   ****************************************************************
   The offering service repository property is missing from
   certain WebSphere Application Server fix pack offerings
   meta-data.  WebSphere Install Manager may report an error when
   trying to access these repositories during an update.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The property has been added to the fix pack meta-data.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 1.0.0.7.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
