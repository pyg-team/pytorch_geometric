APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  XMLAccess export of url-mappings inside a virtual portal
   produces output that cannot be imported as-is in another
   virtual portal because the virtual portal url-mapping, parent
   of the exported url-mapping, is exported as a "locate"
   without a label attribute.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Add label attribute manually.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  XMLAccess export of url-mappings inside a virtual portal
   produces output that cannot be imported as-is in another virtual
   portal because the virtual portal url-mapping, parent of the
   exported url-mapping is exported as a "locate" without a label
   attribute.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds the "label" attribute to the "locate" action as
   required.
