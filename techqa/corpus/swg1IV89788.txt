PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No data is displayed for the Application Health Status data
   set attributes.
   
   
   The data collection for table Application Health Status is
   disabled by default. In ITM v6, user can "Take Action" through
   TEP to enable the data collection, while in v8, there is no such
    feature.

   UI or Take Action for this data set. And there is no base line
   data for it either.
