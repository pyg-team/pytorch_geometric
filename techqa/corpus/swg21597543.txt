 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using InstallSheild MultiPlatform to install IBM Security Identity Manager might cause configuration errors on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5.0 

CAUSE
Middleware configuration errors occur if you use InstallShield MultiPlatform to install IBM Security Identity Manager on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5.0, which provides a 64-bit JVM. For example, an error message might be:
- The installer is unable to run in graphical mode.
- Try running the installer with the -console or -silent flag.
- Additionally, some X display programs might not work.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
During installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5.0, the InstallShield MultiPlatform middleware configuration tool requires a 32-bit JVM, including the 32-bit version of libXmu.so.6, which must reside in the /usr/lib directory. These 32-bit libraries are not installed by default. Before installing IBM Security Identity Manager, obtain the following files and write them to the /usr/lib directory: 

– 64-bit zLinux systems
libXmu-1.0.2-5.s390.rpm
– 64-bit X86 systems
libXmu-1.0.2-5.i386.rpm
