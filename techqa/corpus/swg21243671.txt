PROBLEM
You click a URL included in a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet that redirects you to a Lotus® QuickPlace® site. When you do this, you receive an error message from your SiteMinder Policy Server indicating that there is a problem with setting cookies in your browser. as follows: 

 * 
 * 
 *  your Web browser is configured to accept cookies. you are using a fully qualified domain name in your URL. http://server.example.com/index.html is CORRECT http://server/index.html is INCORRECT http://127.0.0.1/index.html is INCORRECT." 
 * 
 * 
 * 

However, if you copy the URL specified in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and paste that URL into the Web browser directly, you can access the QuickPlace site without any error. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error occurs due to how URLs are handled by Microsoft Excel and is not a Lotus software problem. When you click a URL in Excel, the Excel program establishes a new session without creating a cookie that the SiteMinder server can use. So, when you link from the Excel page, SiteMinder sees this connection as coming from a source that does not accept or create cookies and returns an error message. You can review the following Microsoft Support article for more information and workarounds:

One way to avoid the error is to establish a cookie first, such as by linking to a Web page where a cookie can be established, instead of trying to link directly to a QuickPlace page. For example, you could link to a server home page, or set up a redirect to a login page.
