ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We need to update the info about SSL config in TPM 7.1 and
   7.1.1 IC.
   
   
   I talked to developer Lewis about SSL config and I think we need
   to update this
   statement in TPM 7.1 infocenter:
   ..............................................
   After Tivoli Provisioning Manager installation, IBM HTTP Server
   SSL is
   not configured, and on UNIX installations, the root user runs
   the HTTP
   server. You can optionally configure the server to run as
   tioadmin on
   UNIX and configure SSL communication with IBM HTTP Server.
   .............................................
   
   The customer might think that there is no SSL config at all
   after you
   install TPM, which is not correct. We have SSL on port 9045
   using WAS by
   default. But if the customer wants extra layer of security then
   they can
   add HTTP server in front of WAS with SSL communication. I think
   we need
   to add this statement in front of the above statement.
   
   Also from the existing statement in IC looks like only on Unix
   you can configure additional SSL config. We need to say that
   these instructions also
   
   Here is more info on this topic I got from L3. We can also add
   this to IC:
   
   1. IBM http server is installed during Middle ware install.
   
   2. TPM installer ONLY configures SSL for application server, so
   https
   will hit application server directly through 9045 port.
   
   3. The SSL communication between IBM HTTP server and WebSphere
   is NOT
   configured during TPM installation.
   
   4. After the installation,  if the customer does not want to use
   IBM
   HTTP server,  then he does not need to do anything, just access
   maximo
   url from 9045.
   But if the customer wants to use IBM HTTP server (if later on
   the
   cusotmer wants to use WebSphere cluster, IBM HTTP server must be
   used),
   then the customer MUST follow the instructions in IC to
   configure SSL
   communication between IBM HTTP Server and WebSphere.
   
   5. The SSL configuration steps for UNIX and windows are the
   same. For
   Unix platform, we are configuring WebSphere to run as tioadmin,
   so we
   need additional step to configure IBM HTTP Server to run as
   tioadmin.
   That is only difference between WIN and UNIX.
