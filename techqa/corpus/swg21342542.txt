PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 We have a chart in our report that has many formatting settings, including a baseline. When we run the report as Excel, some of these settings are not appearing. 

CAUSE
IN PDF or HTML reports, Cognos generates the chart as a graphic image that is then embedded into the report. But in Excel format, Cognos attempts to leverage the native Charting functionality of Excel. This allows the chart to be further manipulated by the user in Excel, something that wouldn't be possible if it was an embedded image. However, there are many functional differences between Cognos' charting engine and Excel's, so not all the formatting options that are available in Cognos will be preserved when exporting to Excel

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a list of known limitations when exporting to the Excel format in the Cognos 8 Report Studio Users Guide; design the chart to avoid these limitations. Conditional formatting can be used to implement specific formatting workarounds for Excel reports if the report needs to be rendered in more then one format.
