QUESTION
 Files like T3SNAPPL, T3SNTRANS, etc keep growing continuously. Can you explain why? 

CAUSE
Possible cause is that TDW and warehousing is not in place yet. But History Collection is turned on for Application Management Console product attribute groups.

ANSWER
All history T3SN* files, located under, for example : 

ITM/aix523/t3/hist/
or under
ITM/TMAITM6/logs/
will continue to grow continuously until :
a) you stopped the History Collection for each attribute groups of Application Management Console product (accessible from the TEP GUI -> History Collection Configuration)
or
b) you setup TDW and warehousing database, and turn on "warehouse proxy" agent and "warehouse summarization and pruning" agent, so the history files are collected from the TEMA agent, stored in the 'WAREHOUS' database, and purged automatically from the agent, so they don't grow continuously anymore.
