Title: IBM Increasing size of heap memory allocated to Cast Iron Studio - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I increase the size of the heap memory allocated to the Cast Iron Studio? 

ANSWER
Start the Studio through the command line interface using the following command: 


CastIronStudio.exe -J-Xmx1024m 


In this command, "1024" is the new memory size that will be allocated to the Studio instead of the default value of 512. This numeric value is in MB. 

Note: There are no benchmark figures on the max value for a given machine configuration that is supported as max memory by Studio. Use garbage collection from Studio to free up unused space, Also, try XML Schema preference settings and see if the use of memory is within the default value of 520 MB or a permissible increased value.
