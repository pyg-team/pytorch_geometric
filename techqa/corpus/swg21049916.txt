Title: IBM CSLD task does not start properly on AIX® - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Under AIX the CSLD task does not properly start up. Instead it displays only the startup window and then returns to the command prompt without any further error message. 

ANSWER
The Lotus Notes run-time environment is not configured correctly, therefore CSLD is not able to initialize a session with Lotus Notes® and exit routines. 

To get CSLD to work properly on AIX®, make sure that: 

 * The location of the notes.ini file is included in the PATH environment variable. Restriction: On AIX, passing an alternate .ini file on CSLD task startup is not supported. Unfortunately, this restriction is not documented. 
 * The location of the names.nsf file is in NOTES_DATA_DIR


To simplify this setup, CSLD provides the shell script notesenv.sh, which you can adapt to your environment as follows. For each CSLD instance:  * Make sure that the following files are located in an extra directory (in the following referenced as directory A): names.nsf, .ID file, and notes.ini. 
 * Set the NOTES_DATA_DIR environment variable to point to directory A. 
 * Add directory A to the PATH environment variable.
