QUESTION
 How do I troubleshoot an issue involving failure to open a GML file from within a mail application or the Windows file system? 

ANSWER
When a GML file is double-clicked, DB2Â® Document Manager launches DdmMDBlk.exe, which will check if DB2 Document Manager Desktop is started. If it is started, the user will be prompted to login to the repository. If it is not started, then the user will be prompted to start DB2 Document Manager Desktop. DdmMDBlk.exe obtains the DB2 Document Manager URL from the DefaultPage parameter in the DdmDsktp.ini file, located in the DB2 Document Manager root installation directory.. 

In case of a failure to open a GML file, please check the following: 

 * Ensure that DMROOT points to the DB2 Document Manager root installation directory 
 * Ensure that this file is present in the DMROOT location. 
 * Ensure that the GML file extension is associated with DdmMDBlk.exe in the DMROOT location. To verify this, open Windows Explorer, click Tools, click Folder Options, go to the File Types tab, select GML extension and then click Advanced. In the Edit File Type dialog, click on Edit to view the 'Application used to perform action' field. 
 * Ensure that the DefaultPage parameter refers to the correct URL for DB2 Document Manager Desktop. 
 * Either Internet Explorer must be the default browser or Internet Explorer must be already running when the GML file is opened. 
 * Failure to launch Internet Explorer, could point to an operating system issue, such as too many IEXPLORE.exe processes or a unresponsive IEXPLORE.exe process. In this case, try closing all IEXPLORE.exe processes and launching Internet Explorer again.
