PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM HTTP Server is shipped as a component of IBM Security Identity Manager (ISIM). Information about a security vulnerability affecting IBM HTTP Server has been published in a security bulletin. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Please consult the security bulletin TLS padding vulnerability affects IBM HTTP Server (CVE-2014-8730) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502] for vulnerability details.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
ISIM 6.0, 7.0

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For all versions and releases of Apache based IBM HTTP server, IBM recommends enabling strict CBC padding enforcement. Add the following directive to the httpd.conf file, for each context that contains "SSLEnable", to enable strict CBC padding enforcement. 

# Enable strict CBC padding 
SSLAttributeSet 471 1 
NOTE: Enabling strict CBC padding enforcement has the following prerequisites: 

* Maintenance levels: 7.0.0.33, 8.0.0.9, 8.5.5.2 or later 
-- OR 
* Any older fixpack/release with any one of the following interim fixes applied: PI17025, PI05309, PI08502, PI09443, PI13422, PI19700, PI26894 

Stop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect. 

Note: 
If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the "Include" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable. 
If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLAttributeSet
