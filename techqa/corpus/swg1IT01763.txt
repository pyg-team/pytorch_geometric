APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For the HTTPRequest method GET or HEAD, currently it is not
   possible to suppress the "Content-Length" in HTTP Request
   Header when 'Generate Default HTTP headers from input' option
   is not selected. It is desired that the "Content-Length" is
   allowed to be suppressed for the GET or HEAD method when the
   request is empty.
   
   If a "Content-Length: 0" header is required then it can be
   explicitly requested by using ESQL in a Compute node before the
   HTTPRequest node to SET
   OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
   
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s): HTTPRequest Header,
   GET or HEAD, Content-Length=0

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V7.0, V8.0 and IBM
   Integration Bus V9.0 using HttpRequest nodes.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   With HttpRequest methods GET or HEAD it is not possible to
   suppress the "Content-Length" field in the HTTP Request Header
   when 'Generate Default HTTP headers from input' option is not
   selected. It is expected that the "Content-Length" can be
   suppressed for the GET or HEAD method when the request is empty,
   i.e. has a length zero.
   
   If "Content-Length: 0" header is required in the HTTP Request
   then it can be explicitly requested by using ESQL in a Compute
   node before the HTTPRequest node. The ESQL could be written as :
      SET OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now allows suppression of the Content-Length field
   in the HTTP Request header for GET or HEAD verbs.
