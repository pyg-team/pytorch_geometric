Title: IBM StoredIQ Exchange Permission Requirements - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The following describes how to set Exchange permissions for the StoredIQ service account 

SYMPTOM
If the service account being used in the StoredIQ volume details doesn't have the proper permissions, then an error similar to this will be seen in the /deepfs/config/trace_current.log of the DataServer. 

Exception - SOAP Status (ErrorAccessDenied):(Access is denied. Check credentials and try again.)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Exchange Administrator will need to set full control on the mailbox object for the StoredIQ server account with the following command in the powershell of the exchange server. 


Get-Mailbox -OrganizationlUnit "MyOU" | Add-MailboxPermssion -User "UserOrGroup" -AccessRights FullAccess

This gives access by the OU. In the command above, "UserOrGroup" is the StoredIQ service account in the volume details
