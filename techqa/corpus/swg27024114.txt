ABSTRACT
 On 14 March 2012, IBM and SHARE presented this complimentary webcast on optimizing the performance of CICS systems and applications. If you use CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS), especially if you use it with IMS Database Manager, listen to this webcast to learn how new features in these products can significantly reduce your CPU usage and improve response times. 

CONTENT
With CICS TS V4.2, even more optimization opportunities are now available. But with the growing complexity of systems, it can be difficult to take full advantage of them - without the support of powerful monitoring, tuning and reporting utilities. 

In this webcast, you will learn how CICS TS not only releases capacity to support new or growing workloads, but also helps to improve response times and increase customer satisfaction. You will learn about a powerful set of IBM tools that can work together to support a wide range of performance scenarios, not just threadsafe analysis, but capacity planning, application-level analysis, monitoring and alerting, problem determination, and many others. The webcast features extensive demonstrations of key scenarios.

Topics include: 

 * Where to focus performance tuning efforts that also meet demanding SLAs 
 * Automate monitoring of CICS applications and know when they exceed performance thresholds 
 * Quickly identify and dynamically respond to out-of-line business situations 
 * Ensure the scalability of your application portfolio 
 * Take better advantage of the specialty engines
