ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The operator "contains" has issues with wildcard characters
   while searching in text values. When using wildcard characters
   * or ?, the text string is getting ignored completely. The
   condition neither hits its original value nor its wildcard
   search string counterpart. When using a list with multiple
   search strings, only those with wildcard characters are
   getting ignored. Others will hit normally. This affects all
   kind conditions in the software. Rule conditions, mandator
   conditions, case conditions and other conditions. Other
   operators are not affected.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use other operators
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A condition with text input attribute, wildcard expression
   (containing characters '* ?') and operator other than '[not]
   equal to' like 'text attribute -> contains -> wildcard' always
   returned false. This has been fixed, so wildcard characters in
   combination with operators other than '[not] equal to' will just
    be considered a standard character.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
