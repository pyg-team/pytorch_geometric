ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Description:
   
   The customer is using timers in their Simulink integration, but
   the times are a mismatch to the Rhapsody timer. Here is their
   description:
   ----
   "In the attached model I am exporting a class with a
   statemachine as an s-function, and execute it in Simulink. The
   statemachine is triggered by a 20 ms timer, and it runs in
   Simulink with a sample time of 10 ms. The statemachine is simply
   flipping a variable from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 every 20 ms. I
   am tracing the value of the variable in Simulink. The
   expectation would be to have a periodic signal, having 2 '1' and
   2 '0' . Unfortunately, it seems that there are some anomalies in
   the sequence, and this suggests a problem in the way rhapsody
   timers are managed in the S-Function.
   
   Could you look at the model and clarify why the output does not
   match
   my expectations?
   
   The attached model shows an issue we have noticed in a
   production
   model, and it is impacting the completion of the SQA phase."
   ----
   
   They were asked to try to do a test using just Rhapsody, but
   could not find a way to accurately judge.
   
   ---
   "I don't know how to do a meaningful test in Rhapsody. In
   Simulink I notice the issue because I am comparing the Simulink
   time with the Rhapsody timer, and I can notice that there is a
   mismatch. If I just run it in Rhapsody, it is like trying to
   catch a time mismatch without having another time source to
   compare with.  "

   Environment:
   
   Rhapsody 8.1.3
   Simulink 2013B
   
   
   Attachment:
   
   
   
   Model attached
   
   Simulink model is in DefaultComponent/Default Config
   
   It is a very simple model; there is a S-Function with 1 output,
   sent to a block that logs the output. The output is the variable
   flipping between 0 and 1 every 20 ms.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * S-function scheduling issue with rhapsody timers.            *
   * Timer inaccuracy is caused by casting from double to integer *
   * value.                                                       *
