AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase, versions 8.0 and 9.0 in the following components:


 * CCRC WAN server/CM Server component, when configured to use SSL 
 * ClearCase remote client: CCRC/CTE GUI, rcleartool, and CMAPI clients, when using SSL to access a CCRC WAN Server/CM Server

ClearCase version Status 9.0.1, 9.0.1.1 Affected 9.0 through 9.0.0.5 Affected 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.15 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
The solution is to install a fix that includes an updated Java™ Virtual Machine with fixes for the issues, and to apply fixes for WebSphere Application Server (WAS).

CCRC Client fixes 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Affected Versions Applying the fix 9.0.1 through 9.0.1.1 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 2 (9.0.1.2) for 9.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044303] 9.0 through 9.0.0.5 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 6 (9.0.0.6) for 9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044302] 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.15 
   8.0 through 8.0.0.21 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 16 (8.0.1.16) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044304] 
 * For 7.0, 7.1, and earlier releases, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.
 * 
 * Notes:
 *  If you use CCRC as an extension offering installed into an Eclipse shell (one not provided as part of a ClearCase release), or you use rcleartool or CMAPI using a Java™ Virtual Machine not supplied by IBM as part of Rational ClearCase, you should update the Java™ Virtual Machine that you use to include a fix for the above issues. Contact the supplier of your Java™ Virtual Machine and/or the supplier of your Eclipse shell. 

CCRC WAN server fixes  *  Determine the WAS version used by your CCRC WAN server. Navigate to the CCRC profile directory (either the profile you specified when installing ClearCase, or <ccase-home>/common/ccrcprofile), then execute the script: bin/versionInfo.sh (UNIX) or bin\versionInfo.bat (Windows). The output includes a section "IBM WebSphere Application Server". Make note of the version listed in this section. Review the following WAS security bulletin:

   [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982223]and apply the latest available fix for the version of WAS used for CCRC WAN server. 
 *  Note: there may be newer security fixes for WebSphere Application Server. Follow the link below (in the section "Get Notified about Future Security Bulletins") to subscribe to WebSphere product support alerts for additional Java SDK fixes. 
 *  Affected Versions Applying the fix 8.0.0.x
   8.0.1.x
   9.0.0.x
   9.0.1.x Apply the appropriate WebSphere Application Server fix directly to your CCRC WAN server host. No ClearCase-specific steps are necessary.
