PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I preserve all the queued jobs? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
We are currently planning on upgrading from 6.0 to 6.2. I am reading allthe literature and pdf manuals but am not able to find a way to preserveall the queued jobs (non running jobs). How do I do this?To preserve jobs while upgrading, inactivate all queues and wait while running jobs are finished. Back up lsb.events and configuration files

To upgrade to LSF 6.2 and preserve all the queued jobs you need to take the following steps:

1. First inactivate all the queues so that no more jobs can be dispatched. To do this run 'badmin qinact all' .
2. Wait until the running jobs are finished
3. Back up lsb.events located under the 'work directory' and configuration files located under the 'conf' directory (This is done in case any of the files are lost after the upgrade)
4. Once you have made the upgrade activate all the queues again by running 'badmin qact all'

You can suspend the running jobs, but once you move these jobs to your new cluster and resume them, they will start from scratch unless those jobs were checkpointable.
