 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If CSRF Filter is enabled and a user navigates from the Dashboard (/dashboard) to the Mailbox application (/mailbox), the user has to log in to the Mailbox application. Once this problem occurs, users will need to log in to the Mailbox application every time they browse from the Dashboard to the Mailbox application until they start a new browser session. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Start a new browser session when the problem occurs or log in to the Mailbox application.
