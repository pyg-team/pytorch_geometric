ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem details:
   =================
   For problems of performance, the property
   mxe.db.fetchResultStopLimit=5000. When the table BBOARDMSGSTATUS
   reaches more than 5000 recordings I have error messages in
   SystemOut.log and memory problems.
   
   I set the property PMBBISTRACKED to 0, not to manage any more
   the display of messages in the bulletin board. If I consult
   messages since the Start Center, the table BBOARDMSGSTATUS
   is not any more updated : OK
   
   If I consult messages since the Self-service Center the table
   BBOARDMSGSTATUS is always updated : NOT OK
   
   Later, I am going to have 5000 recordings in BBOARDMSGSTATUS and
   my initial problem will return.
   
   
   Why the table continues to fill when messages are consulted from
   Self-service Center?
   
   STEP BY STEP to Reproduce the problem in SCCD 7511 + TPAE
   7505.
   
   1. Go to System Properties --> PMBBISTRACKED  --. Set the global
   value to 0
   
   
   2. Save changes and LIVE REFRESH
   
   3. Go to Bulletin Board and create a new message and "Approve"
   the status.
   
   
   4. Go back to start center and read the message by clicking on
   it and you will notice the message remains N as status which is
   good because  PMBBISTRACKED   = 0
   
   5. Now Go to Self Service center and read the message from "My
   News" section by clicking in the message.
   
   
   6. Now go back to Start center--> You will notice the message is
   setup as Y despite having PMBBISTRACKED = 0
   
   So the issue is that When I set the property PMBBISTRACKED to 0,
   not to manage any more the display of messages in the bulletin
   board. If I consult messages since the Start Center, the table
   BBOARDMSGSTATUS is not any more updated which is OK.
   
   If I consult messages from the Self-service Center the table
   BBOARDMSGSTATUS is always updated which is NOT OK
   
   Hence Later, I am going to have 5000 recordings in
   BBOARDMSGSTATUS and my initial problem will return.
