QUESTION
 7.6 libraries do not seem to work when the application was migrated to 8.0.1. How do I update custom Datacap 7.6 RRX libraries so they will work with 8.0.1? 

CAUSE
RRX extensions in custom scripts cause issues in 8.0.1

ANSWER
In old customized scripts, the include tags at the top of the file specifies an extension for the RRX libraries that you want to pre-load. For example, <i=validaions.rrx/> would be in the 7.6 RRX files.

In 8.0.1, many rrx files have been updated to a DLL.


To resolve this issue, simply change old scripts from using the rrx extension to a dll extension in the 8.0.1/8.1.0 application (e.g. validations.rrx to validations.dll) . Or remove the extention completely. If there is no extension, it will look for a .dll first, and if it doesn't find it, it will look for the rrx file. Therefore, changing the include tag to <i=validations/> will resolve the issue as well.


 1. Search for custom actions put into your /dco_appname/rules folder. 
 2. Examine all of the RRX files there for the <i> tags, typically on the second or third line, and remove any extensions from file names.
