ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While using IBM Business Process Manager (BPM), you see several
   operations to start failing with an error containing the
   SECURITY_ANONYMOUS_DISALLOWED error code. The server
   SystemOut.log file contains exceptions, for example
   
    3/25/15 9:22:50:222 CET  000001c2 wle           E   CWLLG2229E:
   An exception occurred in an EJB call.  Error: CWTDS0000E: An
   unexpected failure occurred. Details: 'FNRCS0001:
   SECURITY_ANONYMOUS_DISALLOWED: Access to Content Engine was not
   allowed because the request was made anonymously instead of by
   an authenticated user. The application server reported that the
   user was anonymous.'
   
   Explanation: An exception was thrown.
   
   Action: Check the server log files.

   Note that the call stack you see might be different because the
   error happens at several different operations.
   
   Restarting the server resolves the issue until it reappears
   after some time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When accessing the IBM BPM document store, a technical user who
   is defined as the IBM BPM EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser role type is
   used for various operations. The javax.security.auth.Subject
   object for this user is cached with a renewal mechanism before
   it expires.
   
   This issue happens when the credentials within the subject are
   invalidated by another thread, for example an asynchronous SCA
   operation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM that changes the subject caching
   logic to always validate the subject before using it. If
   invalidated, a new subject is created.
