PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: ALL EPDM R1M1 INSTALLATIONS.                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The variable prompting on the Report    *
   *                      Data Selection panel for DATE-type      *
   *                      variables (such as FROM_DATE and        *
   *                      TO_DATE) can not handle expressions     *
   *                      with 'CURRENT DATE'.                    *
   *                      If entered with enclosing quotes, the   *
   *                      quotes are passed to DB2 which fails.   *
   *                      If entered without enclosing quotes,    *
   *                      the EPDM dialog complains that only     *
   *                      one value must be entered.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Date-type variables can now be substituted with an expression
   containing the string 'CURRENT DATE'. When promted for such
   variables, the user may for example enter this expression on
   the data selection panel:
            CURRENT DATE - 7 DAYS
   The expression is not case sensitive. Enclosing quotes are
   allowed but not required. CURRENT DATE expressions are also
   supported for BATCH reports; however, when used in DRLEBATR
   calls, the expression must be enclosed in quotes:
            &FROM_DATE='CURRENT DATE - 7 DAYS'
              &TO_DATE='CURRENT DATE'
