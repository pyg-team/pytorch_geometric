ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Websphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware 3.7.2
   
   Steps to recreate:
   1. Open a domain in the WebGUI with several WSP services, WSDL
   files and Policy Attachments
   2. Navigate to a WSP via the Objects menu and open it
   3. Click on the WSDL File tab
   4. Click on the pencil icon to edit existing WSDL file config
   5. Select "(none)" from the Policy Attachments dropdown list
   6. Click OK and Apply as needed; Save Config
   7. From the Control Panel, click Export Config
   8. Select only the single WSP with Policy Attachments = none to
   export; take other defaults
   9. Click on the "Show Contents" button; Scroll through the
   Objects Selected for Export text area and note that all of the
   Policy Attachments for the entire domain have been added.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  During manual export / import, policy attachment files can be
   unchecked at import time.
   During automated export / import, no workaround is known.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The export of a Web Service Proxy inappropriately included
   policy attachments it did not reference.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Exports of a Web Service Proxy will no longer include
   unreferenced policy attachments.
