QUESTION
 How to configure and troubleshoot connection issues when using ISIS with VRS. 

ANSWER
Configuration 

 * When connecting to a supported version of VRS, a PixKofax driver must be used to connect to the scanner. Implement steps by the scanner vendor on installing correct PixKofax drivers and ISIS drivers and in the correct order. 
 * Run TestAppn.exe found in the \Windows\Pixtran directory to verify scanning can be done in both the ISIS and PixKofax interfaces. If there are issues scanning to the ISIS interface or the PixKofax interface, please open a ticket with the scanner vendor to resolve it. 
 * For version 8.0.1 only, scanner settings updated to the task .bpp file is from the configuration file created by using the scanner vendor's scanning application or VRS scanning application outside of Datacap software. A common place to locate the PixKofax drivers is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Kofax\Imgctls\bin. 
 * If unable to find the scanner configuration file on the scanning station, please contact the scanner vendor for further guidance. 
 * Assign full permissions to the following scan driver folders (both Kofax and ISIS):  * C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\EMC 
    * C:\Program Files (x86)\Kofax\Imgctls\bin 
    * C:\Windows\Pixtran folders
   
   
 * Verify that the environment variables path calls the Kofax paths first.


Troubleshooting 

 * Replicate the issue using any of the standard applications (APT, TravelDocs, etc.) if possible. 
 * If the Datacap application will be residing on a shared network, then verify if the application on a local system reproduces the same issue first. 
 * Collect Windows Process Monitor (PROCMON) logs and review the output for clues on the issue. Download Windows Process Monitor onto the Datacap client station to log what is occurring on the system when the issue is reproduced.  1. After downloading start Procmon.exe. 
    2. Click OK for the Process Monitor Filter dialog box. 
    3. Click the magnifying glass icon (or File->Capture Events) to stop it from recording. This icon/step both starts and stops recording. 
    4. The message "Disconnecting from the Event Tracing for Windows...." will appear. This may take a while. 
    5. Once this is done, do Edit->Clear display. 
    6. When ready to start scanning and reproduce the issue, repeat step #3 to start recording. 
    7. Once the issue is reproduced, repeat step #3 to stop recording. 
    8. Save the file to any directory using File->Save. Save with All events and as a Native Process Monitor Format (PML) file type.
   
   

As this log can grow extremely large and very quickly, be sure to only be running the Datacap software before starting the log. Also, only start the log right before reproducing the scenario, and stop right after reproducing the issue.
