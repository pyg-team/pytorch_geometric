 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 The IBM Content Manager OnDemand (CMOD) V9.5 Knowledge Center states the following:

"You need to activate the client data distribution for the CD-ROM mastering option to be available in the Content Manager OnDemand client"

What are the steps required to enable the CD-ROM mastering option? 

CAUSE
In CMOD V9.0, the CD-ROM mastering option was activated by selecting the "Ad Hoc CDROM Mastering" option in the Windows Client installation wizard.

In the CMOD V9.5 installer, the option to enable CD-ROM mastering was removed. The reason for this was to enable writing directly to the registry. This ensures that there is extra control regarding user access to this feature.


ANSWER
To enable CD-ROM mastering, add a new string value "VERSION" = 3 to the registry. Depending on the requirements, this key can be added to either of the following locations: 

1) HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IBM\OnDemand32\Client\CDROM. 

This will mean only the CURRENT_USER will have access to the CD-ROM mastering menu items in the CMOD Client. 

2) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\IBM\OnDemand32\Client\CDROM. 

This will allow all users of the current Windows workstation access to the CD-ROM mastering menu items.
