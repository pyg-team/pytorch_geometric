LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The test:
   tests.com.ibm.jtc.misc.jse9585.PackagedSourceVerificationTest.te
   stMain will check each source file in src.zip which jar in
   jre/lib contains the corresponding class file.
   And then from the collection of jars got above, and for each
   jar, examine every class in that jar if the corresponding source
   file is in src.zip. If not the test case will throw exception.
   I found the root cause of the missing source file against these
   java.util classes: they are not public classes and declared in
   other source files:
   ./src/share/classes/java/util/Timer.java:        class
   TimerThread extends Thread
   ./src/share/classes/java/util/AbstractList.java: class
   RandomAccessSubList<E> extends SubList<E> implements
   RandomAccess
   ./src/share/classes/java/util/AbstractList.java: class
   SubList<E> extends AbstractList<E>
   ./src/share/classes/java/util/Timer.java:        class TaskQueue
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   7.0.0 SR6
   .
   Modify the test case to add the java.util classes into the
   exception list.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  N/A
