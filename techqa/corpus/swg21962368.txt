Title: IBM Content Navigator connection to multiple P8 repositories fails - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An IBM Content Navigator (ICN) instance configured for connection to P8 Content Platform Engine (CPE) 5.2.1, fails to connect to a CPE 5.2.0 external repository. The result is a CORBA MARSHAL error. 

SYMPTOM
SystemOut.log of the ICN deployment returns the following error when a connection is attempted : 

CIWEB Error: com.ibm.ecm.struts.actions.p8.P8LogonAction.createP8Connection()
com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCE0065E: E_UNEXPECTED: 

An unexpected error occurred. Message was: CORBA MARSHAL 0x4942f89a No; nested exception is: 
org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL: 


CAUSE
The exception results from a mismatch in CPE server and ICN client jar file versions. 
A single ICN instance can connect to multiple P8 repositories, but these repositories must all have the same version, which in turn has to match the client jar file version.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In a web browser, display the startup context pages of CPE and ICN. Enter the following URLs: 

http://<cpe_server>:<port>/FileNet/Engine
http://<host_name>:<port>/context_root/Ping

Compare the CPE "Build Version", for exampledap521.000.001.002 
with the ICN "CE Client Build". The two must match.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use identical versions of CPE for all repositories, or implement an additional instance of ICN.
