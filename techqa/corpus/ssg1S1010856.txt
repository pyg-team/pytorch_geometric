 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are security vulnerabilities in versions of Mozilla Firefox that are shipped with versions 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7 of IBM SONAS 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
IBM SONAS is shipped with Mozilla Firefox. There are vulnerabilities in certain versions of Mozilla Firefox shipped in certain versions of IBM SONAS. These vulnerabilities concern the potential ability of a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVEID: CVE-2017-7810 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7810]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in TLS 1.2 generating handshake hashes. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVEID: CVE-2017-7793 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7793]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in the Fetch API. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7823 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7823]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the content security policy (CSP) sandbox directive. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim''s Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim''s cookie-based authentication credentials.
CVSS Base Score: 6.1

CVEID: CVE-2017-7819 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7819]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free while resizing images in design mode. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7818 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7818]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free during ARIA array manipulation. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7814 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7814]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in file downloads encoded with blob: and data: URL elements. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass normal file download checks and download suspicious executables.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SONAS 

The product is affected when running code releases 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7

REMEDIATION/FIXES
A fix for these issues is in version 1.5.2.8 of IBM SONAS. Customers running an affected version of IBM SONAS should upgrade to 1.5.2.8 or a later version, so that the fix gets applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Workaround(s) : 

Normal operation of IBM SONAS does not require or call for customers to use Firefox to access the Internet. Although IBM recommends that you install a level of IBM SONAS code with a fix, you can avoid these vulnerabilities by not using Mozilla Firefox within your IBM SONAS system to access the Internet.

Mitigation: None
