PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to drop openpages user without using the Oracle system password 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Attached is the script that you can execute as "openpages" and delete all the objects created by it. To use the script do the following sqlplus openpages/openpages@SOX9I sql>@DeleteAll-user-object.txt C:\temp; This will identify all the objects created by openpages and clean it up. To confirm that all the objects has been deleted you can run sqlplus openpages/openpages@SOX9I sql>select count(*) from user_objects; This should return 0. The only minor glitch with systems where the DB was loaded as "system" user (imp system/oracle file= ... touser =... fromuser=...) is that the Cleanup JOB and Types gets created under "system" user and openpages does not have permissions to drop them. To get around it the DBA can execute the dbms_job.remove(jobid) and remove the job using the system login. Again if the DBA does not cooperate on this either then we can make a minor tweak to AuroraProcCreate.sql to comment out dbms_job.submit(retcode,'JOBS_aurora.Search_cleanUP(5);',sysdate,'sysdate+1/24/60*5'); . This will prevent the job from being created twice. Please use this script with system on 302 Update 4 and under only.
