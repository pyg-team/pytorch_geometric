PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The DataPower ODR feature does not function when interoperating with Liberty Collective back end. 

CAUSE
The original scheme that the DataPower ODR feature uses to connect to WebSphere Application Server back end does not apply to Liberty Collective.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Any HTTP or HTTPS request through the ODR feature to the Liberty Collective back end fails. When you turn on the DataPower debug logging for the odrlib component, you see a message similar to the following example. 

ODR connector group libertyC-Test state change from STARTING to FAILED, reason: failure on all connectors.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the DataPower GUI define a custom property to specify the Liberty Collective as the profile type. 

 1. Access the configuration of the ODR Connector Group. 
 2. Click the Custom Properties tab. 
 3. Add the custom property.  * In the Name field, enter profileType. 
     * In the Value field, enter Liberty.
    
    
 4. Apply the change.
