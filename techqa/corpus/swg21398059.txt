Title: IBM Lost packet trace records using external writer - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The z/OS CTRACE Writer component might return message ITT10016I or, when formatting the SYSTCPDA packet trace messages, PTRPT14I or PTRPT15I might be returned. These messages indicate that SYSTCPDA packet trace records have been lost. 

CAUSE
The above mentioned messages normally occur when SYSTCPDA packet tracing is set up with no capture filters, causing ALL protocols for ALL IP addresses to be captured. The result is that some trace buffers passed to the CTRACE writer component are unable to be processed and are flagged as lost. The packet trace records are arriving and being passed to the CTRACE writer at a very fast rate. Because of this high rate of processing, the amount of data that is being traced is overrunning the CTRACE writer, causing records to be lost. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Setting packet trace capture filters [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/f1a1c280/1.8.2.5?ACTION=MATCHES&REQUEST=pkttrace&TYPE=FUZZY&SHELF=EZ2ZBK0H.bks&DT=20090330171037&CASE=&searchTopic=TOPIC&searchText=TEXT&searchIndex=INDEX&rank=RANK&ScrollTOP=FIRSTHIT#FIRSTHIT], for example, IPADDR or PORTNUM, will help eliminate lost records.
