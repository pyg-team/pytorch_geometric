QUESTION
 The purpose of this document is to provide information to filter an out of the box lookup in Maximo 

ANSWER
In Maximo there are some lookups that work out of the box.
When associating a lookup to a field that did not have a lookup out of the box you need to create a Table Domain.
You then need to associate that domain to the attribute for that field in Database Configuration. See the linked DCF for details on this process.
These same steps can be used to filter an out of the box lookup.
Part of the Table Domain is a List Where Clause. The List Where Clause allows you to set a where clause to filter the values a lookup will display and return.
You can create a Table Domain and use the list where clause to filter the values of an out of the box lookup.
Once your Table Domain is created you would need to associate the domain to the attribute having the out of the box lookup in Database Configuration.
Once the Table Domain you created with a List Where Clause is associated the attribute with the out of the box lookup, the lookup values will be filtered by the Table Domain.
