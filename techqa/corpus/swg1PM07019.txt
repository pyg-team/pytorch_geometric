APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Subscriber server receives a syndication request before it has
   initialized the syndication module. Since the appropriate flags
   have not been set yet, the server assumes that the syndication
   module had failed to initialize and hence marks it as offline.
   Further syndication requests to this server would fail as the
   module has been marked offline.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restart the syndicator server (or enable the syndicator) only
   after the "Syndication initlialized" message has been displayed
   in the subscriber logs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected: All IWWCM users
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   Subscriber server receives a syndication request before it has
   initialized the syndication module. Since the appropriate flags
   have not been set yet, the server assumes that the syndication
   module had failed to initialize and hence marks it as offline.
   Further syndication requests to this server would fail as the
   module has been marked offline.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The startup logic has been modified to ensure that the IWWCM
   start up waits until the syndication module has also initialized
   before taking up any requests.
