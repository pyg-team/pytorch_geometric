Title: IBM I can't obtain a commuter license with the trial network license. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I installed the trial network license for a PASW application (Statistics, Modeler,Amos,...). I'm now testing how commuter licensing works, but I can't obtain any commuter licenses. When modifying the LSERVOPTS environmental variable such that -com is 25 instead of 0 and rebooting the test PC I get commuter licenses: total=0 and in license information I 'Allow commuter license'=No. Why ? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You are not allowed to generate commuter licenses with the trial network license since this might lead to illegal licensing situations in which 10 commuter licenses checked out during the 7-day trial period continue to work for 30 days (the maximum life of a commuter license).
The 7-Day trial period network license can be found in the file lservrc.temp on the Statistics 18 DVD in the folder Windows/Administration/Licensing/NetworkLicensingManage
