PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) and Rational Software Architect for WebSphere Software v8.0 - 8.0.2 Code Coverage on Java application returns 0% coverage on forced stop in console view. 

SYMPTOM
You correctly set the Properties for the Java project : Code Coverage [x] Enable Code Coverage, and package and source coverage set to 80%. 

Code coverage is not up to specified maximum of 80% as expected on forced stop using red stop button in console view on a Java application with an infinite main loop.

CAUSE
This issue was identified as a product defect and logged under APAR PM35789 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM35789]. This APAR was closed as a suggestion/feature enhancement for a future release.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This enhancement was delivered in RAD 8.0.4 and documented in RAD 8.0.4 enhancements under Code Coverage [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27018924#whatsnew_804_codecoverage] as bullet: 

 *  You can now select an option to collect code coverage statistics if the Java program exits abnormally.
   

This corresponds to this workspace preference as of RAD 8.0.4+ :
