APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The DB2 Administration Tool for z/OS ADBBIND sample BIND member
   does not explain under what situations a SQLCODE -206 is
   acceptable.
   In the reporting customers case the SQLCODE -206 was issued
   for the "SCHEMA" column added by APAR PK72442 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK72442] and the ++HOLDDATA
   for PTF UK47570. In this case the SQLCODE -206 was unacceptable
   and the installer needed to take action to correct. In other
   situations the SQLCODE -206 reflects that the code references
   SQL which will never be executed on the release the plan is
   being bound on.
   .
   Additional symptoms: sqlcode206

   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply The PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The ADBBIND SAMP member comments only
   mentioned DB2 7.  SQLCODE -206 errors can also
   occur on DB2 8 and higher.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The comments in ADBBIND were changed to explain
   when a SQLCODE -206 is valid.
