LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The ClearQuest 7.1 import tool fails to import attachments
   if the import file does not have the "Description" field in
   the import file.  This is a common scenario if importing
   data and attachments from another tool.  The Import tool
   says that it completed successfully, but the attachments are
   not imported.
   
   The solution is to determine if the Description column is
   null and if so, set the empty string as the default value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available in ClearQuest 7.1.1.
