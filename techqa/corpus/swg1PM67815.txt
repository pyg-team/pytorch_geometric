APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Modeler 14.2FP2, 14.2FP3 and 15.0GA cannot grow the CHAID tree
   model. When trying to grow from Node 0, end-user is presented
   with: "Stopping rules prevent any tree growth"
   
   Stopping rules used are:
   Use absolute value:
   Min in parent = 50
   Min in child = 25
   
   Have reduced this to:
   Min in parent = 5
   Min in child = 2
   
   but error still occurs.
   
   Compared this procedure to the one available in SPSS Statistics
   (Analysis > Classify > Tree) and was able to generate 6 child
   nodes from Node 0. Each child node has met the stopping rules
   condition (greater than 50 records in parent and 25 in child
   nodes).
   
   Predictor used only contain 59 categories, ruling out a known
   limitation (127 categories) as a possible cause.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This has been reported to IBM SPSS Modeler development team for
   investigation. At this stage, the only available workaround is
   to use the SPSS Statistics Output node to execute your syntax to
   generate this tree. This is only available if you have a valid
   license of SPSS Statistics on the same workstation that houses
   SPSS Modeler.
