   -- INTERIM FIX DISCLAIMER --
   
   Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers. They are normally sent only
   to customers who have reported one of the corrected problems,
   and who require an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not
   address customer enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted testing of specific
   fixes, not full regression testing. If the fix is not urgently
   required, you may prefer to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack
   Release, which will be fully regression tested. Interim Fix
   corrections, once fully regression tested, are automatically
   included in a future Fix Pack.
