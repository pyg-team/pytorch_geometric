APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the source table does not have the same Primary Key defined
   then the gateway will core if DELETES are not also replicated.
   e.g.
   
   REPLICATE INSERTS FROM TABLE 'custom.status'
   USING MAP 'CustomStatus'
   INTO 'alerts.status;
   
   Where custom.status uses ServerName+ServerSerial as the Primary
   Key rather than Identifier
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Include DELETES in the replication statement;
   
   REPLICATE INSERTS,DELETES FROM TABLE 'custom.status'
   USING MAP 'CustomStatus'
   INTO 'alerts.status;
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users using ObjectServer gateway configured to transfer table
   across with different primary key in source and destination
   table and configured not to pass DELETES.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   ObjectServer gateway can terminate abruptly when source and
   destination table have different primary keys and gateway is
   configured not to pass deletes.
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   None
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The ObjectServer gateway would terminate unexpectedly if the
   source and destination tables had different keys, and the
   gateway was configured not to pass deletes.This is now fixed.
