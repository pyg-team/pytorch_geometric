APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On Solaris servers with disabled processors the RAS1 logs of
   both
    the kuxagent and the kux_vmstat processes may get flooded by
   the
    following messages at the default ERROR level:
   
      vm_stat_externals.cpp,1757,"get_cpu_stats") kstat_lookup
   error -
         (cpu_stat,123,NULL)
      vm_stat_externals.cpp,1758,"get_cpu_stats") kux_vmstat does
   not
         collect cpu123 information
   
    These messages are printed for each disabled CPU, every thirty
   seconds.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
    This issue affects all the UNIX OS Agent versions, on Solaris
   only.
   
   Diagnostics:
    n/a
   
   Initial Impact:
    Low, RAS1 logs become harder to review

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Repeated messages flooding kuxagent and kux_vmstat RAS1 logs on
   Solaris
   
   
   RAS1 logs of the Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS at the default
   ERROR level may become unreadable due to a repeated couple of
   error messages printed while monitoring processors on the
   Solaris platform:
   
   vm_stat_externals.cpp,1757,"get_cpu_stats") kstat_lookup error -
   (cpu_stat,123,NULL)
   vm_stat_externals.cpp,1758,"get_cpu_stats") kux_vmstat does not
   collect cpu123 information
   These messages are printed for each disabled processor, every
   thirty seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  These messages will be printed only at the STATE RAS1 tracing
   level.
