Title: IBM Access custom rule properties during RES.NET execution - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I access custom rule properties during RES.NET execution? 

CAUSE
The default ruleset deployment from Rule Studio (RS), Rule Team Server (RTS) or Rule Execution Sever (RES), results in a ruleset Binary Ruleset Compilation (BRC) file. 
In Rules for .NET 3.0 and 7.0, the BRC file does not support custom rule property. 
When using rule.Properties to access rule properties during RES execution, only the value of the default properties can be retrieved; the custom property will return null. 


ANSWER
If you use custom rule properties, typically in a rule filter for dynamic selection, be sure to use ruleset assembly (dll file), instead of brc file, for execution.
Follow the steps below: 

 1. In RES console, remove the .brc ruleset (deployed by default) from the ruleapp.
