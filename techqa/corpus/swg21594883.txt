CAUSE
Old, corrupted or incorrect Centera configuration is still being accessed. 

ENVIRONMENT

WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.11
Database: Oracle 11.2.0.2
Centera FCD

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Stop the Application Servers and clear the WebSphere server cache. 
 2. Restart Application Server and remove the Centera configuration from FileNet Enterprise Manager. 
 3. Stop the server and clear the cache again. 
 4. Start the server, and recreate the Centera Fixed Content Device, Centera Storage Policy and Centera Storage Area. 
 5. Test adding a document to see if it is processed and moved to Centera Fixed Content Device.
