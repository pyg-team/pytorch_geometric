Title: IBM Rational Team Concert SCM Command Line Interface fails to launch when --config not used in the command - United States

Text:
scm; z/os; zos; path; Ant; result 4 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to run the IBM Rational Team Concert SCM Command Line Interface results in the error "Could not create directory" and fails with an error code of 4. 

SYMPTOM
Attempts to run an Ant script that calls scm.exe results in the error: 

[exec] Could not create .jazz-scm:
[exec] Could not create directory /.jazz-scm
[exec] Result: 4

CAUSE
Cause #1: Your home path environment variable is not set in the /etc/profile or in the $HOME/.profile 

Cause #2: The location of the metadata is not indicated with the --config parameter of the scm command.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the home directory path has not been set with one of the options in step #2 below, the --config switch must be used to identify where your metadata is to be created and stored. 


Prerequisites for running the SCM Command Line Interface on z/OS successfully include the following:


 1. Set up your home directory that is defined in RACF.
    Typically, this is /u/user_id 
    
    For example: /u/george
    
    
 2. Ensure the path to find your home directory and the scm.exe file is set correctly using one of the following methods:
     * Edit /etc/profile
       or 
     * Edit $HOME/.profile
       or 
     * Run the command export PATH=$PATH:/u/george/scmtools/eclipse
       or 
     * Add the command to the Ant script that is launching scm.exe
       or 
     * Use --config to specify the user location in the scm command
       
       [ --config ]path 
       The Rational Team Concert source control command line client stores per-user metadata in a configuration directory. The configuration directory is normally $HOME/.jazz-scm, where $HOME represents your home directory. If you want to use a different configuration directory, specify its path name in path.
       
       Note: If one of the five above is not set, the command will try to use the install directory to launch the command.
       
       
    
    
 3. Ensure the permissions on the directories allow for directory and file creation and that you have permission to create in RACF.
