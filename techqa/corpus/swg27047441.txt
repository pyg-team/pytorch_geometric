 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 dsmtop is a simple text based tool for monitoring DB2, similar to db2top. dsmtop can monitor DB2 versions 10.1 and above. It is intended primarily for use on Linux or AIX. It also runs on Windows, although some limitations apply (see the README file for details).

Key Features 

dsmtop is lightweight, low overhead and works in a text only environment such as a putty window or simple Unix command line. There is no web server and no need for a windowing environment. Monitoring is accomplished using the lightweight mon_get_xxx table functions provided by DB2. Views can be set to fast refresh rates to provide a real-time view of activity in the monitored database.

You can use dsmtop to see key performance indicators in all of the same areas covered by db2top plus additional areas relevant to more recent features. A few of the more significant views provided in dsmtop include: 

 * Sessions – see at a glance which connections are active, blocked, or idle. You can drill down on a connection to see details of the current state of execution of SQL that is 
 * Executed SQL – see a list of recently executed statements. Drill down is provided to see the full SQL text or run explain on a statement. 
 * Top Consumers – find which connections or activities are consuming the most CPU, IO or other resource. 
 * Time spent – shows a breakdown of where the monitored database is spending time, broken down to the full granularity provided by DB2. 
 * PureScale performance 
 * HADR status


Comparison to db2top The goal of dsmtop is to improve on and extend the features that people liked in db2top. With this is mind, it has much of the same look and feel of db2top. It accepts the same command line arguments as db2top and recognizes hotkeys familiar to users of db2top. There are some improvements and new features in dsmtop that people have been requesting for db2top. Some highlights:


 * Support for recent DB2 features including PureScale, BLU (column store tables) and workload management.
