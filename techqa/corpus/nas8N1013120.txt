Title: IBM Enterprise Extender With and Without DTAARA for Host Name - United States

Text:
APPC; EE; SNA/IP TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In V5R4, there is a DTAARA that can be created with the host name in for controllers with HPRIP as the
link type. With the data area (having the same name as the controller description), the iSeries at vary-on
time will do a reverse DNS lookup and find the IP address. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

In V5R4, there is a DTAARA that can be created with the host name in for controllers with HPRIP as the link 
type. With the data area (having the same name as the controller description), the iSeries at vary-on time will
do a reverse DNS look-up and find the IP address. It will then change the Remote internet address in the 
controller description to the address it has found in the reverse DNS look-up.

At V6R1, the system name can be put in the controller. It will do the reverse DNS look-up; however, it will 
leave the system name in the controller description and not replace it with the IP address.

If the DTAARA was created prior to V6R1, it may continue to substitute the IP address for the host name even
if the DTAARA has been deleted. The controller might have to be deleted and re-created after the DTAARA has
been removed for the Remote internet address field to remain the host name at V6R1; otherwise, it might 
substitute the IP address for the Remote internet address in the controller description.
