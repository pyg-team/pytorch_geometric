Chapter 2: Planning for installation of your IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Applaince Machine Type 9235, 4195, 7199 and 7198. 

Use the information in this section to help plan for adding the IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance to your business network environment. We will cover the following planing steps:


 * Access to the Information Center. 
 * What you need to install the appliance in the rack or the cabinet 
 * What you need to configure and initialize the appliance 
 * ADMIN PASSWORD Security 
 * Common Criteria Mode 
 * Secure Backup 
 * Network configuration 
 * Upgrading the firmware



Access to the Information Center: 
 *  Access the product library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/documentation/]. Chose the firmware level Click on the Information Center link 


What you need to install the appliance in the rack or the cabinet:  * 
 * 
 * 


What you need to configure and initialize the appliance:  *  A personal computer (PC) with:  * For a M/T 9235 on of the following:  * serial port connection 
       * docking station with a serial port connection, 
       * USB to serial port connection adapter
      
      
    * For a M/T 4195  * Either a concurrent-KVM (cKVM) or a Serial ove LAN (SOL) console connection
      
      
    * For a M/T 7199 or 7198  * Use the USB serial console cable (USB to RJ45) or DE-9 serial console cable (RJ45 to DB9) supplied with the appliance. 
         
         The drivers for the USB to serial console cable provided with the appliance are on the IBM® WebSphere® DataPower SOA Appliances: Resource Kit CD in an archive file.
         
         The driver for Windows systems is in the driver/win/ directory. 
         The drivers for Mac OS systems are in the driver/mac/ directory.
         For driver installation instructions, see the readme file or Installation Guide in the archive file. 
         
         You can download the resource kit cd from Fix Central. Use this Fix download method for WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21376557] technote. On the Identify fixes pages, click on the "Text" radio button and enter "resource kit" in the field below the radio button 
         
         Notes:  * Do not use an Ethernet cable to plug the serial console port into an Ethernet network. 
          * Do not use a telephone cable to plug the serial console port into a Telephone network (digital or analog).

ADMIN PASSWORD Security 

Do not misplace the new password for the admin account.

A best practice is to secure the admin user id's password and set up back up privileged user ids. Several sections of this document describe how to set up a privileged user id. Do not copy and paste the password in to the DataPower serial connection or WebGUI. You might pick up extra characters and not be able to log in after you log out. DataPower devices are highly secure, tamper-resistant devices, often deployed within secure environments or deployed to meet high security standards. One of the Security features is the fact that we do not offer a non-authenticated / authorized appliance reset or password reset capability. In order to reset the appliance password, the appliance actually has to be re-imaged just like during the initial manufacturing process. We have one facility, a secure location in the United States, where this is done. When you receive the appliance after a password-reset, you must perform an initial setup and install the 
firmware you need and reconfigure the appliance. None of your configuration data will be on the appliance when it is returned, as this is a secure network appliance. 

Common Criteria Mode 

You would consider Common Criteria Mode when a specific authority requires the appliance to be EAL4 certified. To determine whether you will want to use Common Criteria Mode at initialization you should review the topics in the information center and this technote: 

Determining whether to use Common Criteria Mode at initialization. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21388551] 

Secure Backup 

The information center has topics on secure backup. You can enter secure backup in the search box to see a list of topics. Developerworks has these 2 articles 
 * Secure backup-restore for WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1009_furbee/1009_furbee.html]

 * Secure restore for WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1006_majikes/1006_majikes.html]



Network configuration 

Obtain the IP addresses and other network information to define the appliance to the network.  *  The IP address for the Ethernet interfaces for appliance management access (MGMT) and data traffic (ETH0, ETH1, ETH2, etc.). The IP address of the default gateways or routers that support the subnets for the Ethernet interfaces The IP address for the network services (SSH, Telnet, and so forth). A best practice is to configure the MGMT Ethernet interface on a dedicated subnet for all network and system-wide management functions. This dedicated subnet would handle network traffic for logging to FTP, SNMP, XML Management, and Web Management (WebGUI) functions. Use the remaining three Ethernet interfaces to handle data traffic to and from the various DataPower services.
