 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I change the backup network on a N100x, N200x, N300x appliance. 

ANSWER
Gather the needed information from ifconfig regarding the bond and eth's you will be changing.
Check if the VIP for the backup network is a cluster resource by issuing crm_mon -1 as root.
If it is, delete using cib tools.

/opt/nz-hwsupport/pts/cib_tools.pl

Select option 6 to delete a resource.
Select the number of the resource to delete.
When complete, exit the cib_tools utility.

ifdown bond
ifdown nic's

Edit the ifcfg-bond file and change the ip and net mask.

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bondX

ifup nic's
ifup bond

When complete, follow the changes for the bond and nic's on the other host.

After changes have been made to both hosts, add the VIP with the new ip.

/opt/nz-hwsupport/pts/cib_tools.pl

Select option 2 to Add virtual ip
Enter the new ip when prompted.
Enter the interface name of the bond when prompted.
Enter the netmask when prompted.
Enter the name of the VIP.

When complete, verify the vip is started in the cluster, crm_mon -1.

Test the vip by pinging the vip ip from both hosts.

When all is done, don't forget to edit the /etc/hosts file on both hosts with the new network information.
