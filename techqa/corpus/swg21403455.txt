Title: IBM Broker Archive build fails with errors when multiple adapter components exist with same name - United States

Text:
WMB; toolkit; message broker; bar; archive; multiple symbol TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Building a Broker Archive in WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit fails with error messages similar to the following example:

Processing file Test.msgflow
Failed to add file Test.msgflow to archive file
There are multiple symbol table resolutions for this file name.
The ESQL level for Test.msgflow is undetermined
There are multiple symbol table resolutions for this file name.


CAUSE
This problem is caused by a clash in the names used for the various WebSphere Adapter components by 2 or more message set projects in a workspace.

ENVIRONMENT
 

 * WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit 6.1.0.4_IF01 
 * WebSphere Adapter for SAP Software 6.1.0.4_IF01 
 * Windows Server 2003


This problem was detected on WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit 6.1.0.4_IF001 but could happen in other versions of the 6.1 codeline. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Please review the following steps that describe how to workaround this issue. 

 

 1. In the Broker Application Development Perspective, click on the message flow. 
 2. Click on the node that points to the adapter component (for example "SAPRequest" or "SAPInput") and check the added adapter component in the "properties" tab.  1. Click on "Browse" 
     2. You will see a list of existing adapter components. 
     3. Click on "Create New/Import". Follow the steps (retrieve IDocs, service generation and deployment) until you reach the screen "Adapter Connection - Publishing Properties". 
     4. Please insert a name for the adapter component and add it to an existing message set project.
    
    
 3. You will now find the newly created adapter component in the list of Adapter Components to choose. 
 4. Select the new adapter component and click "Finish". 
 5. Create a new broker archive file.
