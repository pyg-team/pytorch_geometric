 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which WebSphere DataPower virtual edition fix pack can I upgrade to and downgrade from? 

CAUSE
Not all scrypt4 fix packs are compatible with the 5.0.0.0 OVA files that were released in November 2012 and March 2013. If you upgrade or downgrade with an incompatible fix pack, unexpected errors might occur.

 Use the following links to determine which fix packs are compatible with your virtual deployment.

 * 5.0.0.5
 * 5.0.0.6
 * 5.0.0.8 or later
 * 6.0.0.0 or later
