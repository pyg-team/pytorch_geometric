ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a duplicate CLUSRCVR channel name is defined and is
   introduced to a Queue Manager Cluster, the Full Repository
   queue manager writes an FDC record with Probe ID RM217001.
   
   The FDC dump data areas will contain the queue manager ID
   (QMID) such as QMGR1_2011-11-23_12.37.49.
   
   Probe Id          :- RM217001
   Component         :- rrmRecoClqMgr
   Program Name      :- amqrrmfa
   MQM Function Stack
   rrmRepository
   rrmProcessMsg
   rrmChangeClqMgr
   rrmRecoClqMgr
   xcsFFST
   
   The FDC had been written to help users guard against accidental
   insertion of a Queue Manager with a duplicated CLUSRCVR name.
   
   But, if the the new Queue Manager with the same CLUSRCVR name
   is intentionally being added, then the FDC is not needed, and
   so is distracting.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When adding a QMGR to a cluster where   *
   *                      there already exists another QMGR with  *
   *                      the same name and channel name then an  *
   *                      FFST is issued.                         *
   *                      This will happen when a QMGR is deleted *

   ****************************************************************
   As the FFST can be seen as information-only in some cases, it
   caused unnecessary concern.
   There is still a need, however, for the administrator to be able
   to see when a QMGR has been introduced via an already known
   cluster receiver channel name.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR introduces a new error message: CSQX468I. It will
   describe the situation better than the FFST. It is still
   necessary for an administrator to read the CSQX468I message and
   ensure the activity is intentional.
   In case where it is accidental, the MQ administrator will still
   need to investigate their systems and rectify the situation.
   
   
   A new message is added to the infocenter under:
     "z/OS Messages and Codes"
       "Messages"
         "Distributed queuing messages (CSQX...)":
   
   "
   CSQX468I: csect-name Queue manager qmgr-uuid1 has replaced
   queue manager qmgr-uuid2 in a cluster due to reuse of channel
   channel-name
   
   Explanation
   
   Queue manager qmgr-uuid1 has joined a cluster using a cluster
   receiver channel with the same name as one that has already
   been defined by queue manager qmgr-uuid2. All cluster receiver
   channels used within a cluster must be uniquely named.
   
   Severity
   
   0
   
   System action
   
   Queue manager qmgr-uuid1 uses channel channel-name. Queue
   manager qmgr-uuid2 cannot successfully participate in the
   cluster while queue manager qmgr-uuid1 is a member.
   
   System programmer response
   
   The use of a channel name currently associated with a different
   queue manager in the cluster can be intentional, for example it
   is possible the original queue manager has been deleted and
   recreated as a new queue manager. However, accidental
   duplication of a channel name across multiple queue managers
   would also result in this behavior. If this action was not
   intended review the configuration of the queue managers.
