PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance rebooted or restarted, you noticed the configured Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy) along with the remote WSDL(s) attached to it had an error status. 

SYMPTOM
The status of the remote WSDL(s) attached to the WS-Proxy show as Error.


CAUSE
When the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance is started, it loads the configuration objects, thus tries to retrieve any remote files and this includes WSDL files for the Web Service Proxies (WS-Proxy). In this case, the remote WSDL retrieval seems to occur before the network interfaces are up so the WSDL retrieval process fails.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around this issue, there is an Automatic Retry option that can be set on the the WS-Proxy. By default, this option is set to Off so DataPower does not try to reload the WSDLs in the event that an error occurs. To enable this option, follow these steps. From the WebGUI: 

1. Click OBJECTS -> Web Service Proxy (Service Configuration section)
2. Click to edit the appropriate Web Service Proxy
3. The Automatic Retry option can be found on the Main tab.
