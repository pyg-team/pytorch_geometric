PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WebSphere® Transformation Extender EDI Wizard is not able to initialize when you are attempting to create the x12mail.mtt or edfmail.mtt type trees from Trading Manager's Partner Manager GUI. 

SYMPTOM
Executing the WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) EDI Wizard displays a pop-up window that states: 

"Unable to initialize WebSphere Transformation Extender - please check your path locations in the EDI Wizard dialog" 

CAUSE
The Windows® Path environment variable is not set properly.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review the value of the Windows environment variable, Path. To check the value of Path.: 

 * Open a DOS Command Prompt Windows ( Start - Run ) and enter cmd.exe in the pop-up window 
 * Click on OK 
 * In the Command Prompt window that appears, type:  echo %PATH% 
   
   
 * Review the returned results for a reference to the installation directory of WTX

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Exit the WTX Partner Manager utility


 * Edit your Windows Path environment variable to include a reference to the WTX installation directory. Using the default installation directory for WTX 8.4 as an example, ensure that "C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.4" is included in the value of Path. It is suggested you edit this value with the Windows Control Panel by selecting, System - Advanced - Environment Variables and then add the appropriate entry to Path. An example of the Path environment variable would be:

 *  C:\IBM\WebSphere Transformation Extender 8.4;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS 
   
   The referenced path to the WTX installation directory must precede older versions of WTX or references to older versions of WTX should be removed.
   
   
 * 
 * Start the WTX Partner Manager and select the EDI Wizard menu bar item
