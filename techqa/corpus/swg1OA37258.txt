ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  KMQMH111E
   
   MQIMONITOR(addrspc) MQI REQUEST ABEND. CODE=xxxxx
   
   Explanation:
   An abend occurred during WebSphere MQ processing of  MQI
   request, with
   abend code identified by xxxxx.  When the Websphere MQ
   monitoring agent
   address space is doing MQI monitoring, it will receive control
   before
   and after MQI calls so that it can maintain statistics.  This
   message
   will be written out if an abend occurs after we pass control to
   WebSphere MQ to perform MQI request.
   
   System action:
   The WebSphere MQ monitoring agent recovery routine percolates
   error.
   MQI monitoring continues.
   
   User response:
   This message indicates that an error occurred during the
   processing of a
   WebSphere MQ call.  Please review logs for address space where
   message
   was issued and abend occurred to determine what the problem is.
   
   received note from WMQ L2 tech...
   
   One last follow-up regarding 02372,035,000 your spin-off PMR
   66053,999,000 and doc APAR OA37258.... the customer reiterated:
   "All I ask you make sure that the message KMQMH111E is the doc
   and points
   you to the MVS system Codes and the WebSphere MQ information
   Center.
   Would be nice to point the customer to the correct documentation
   when he
   looks up the message."
   
   We had chatted about that a while back, but I wanted to be sure
   the System Codes references makes it in the update since OA37258
   doesn't specifically say it.
