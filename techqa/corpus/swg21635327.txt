Title: IBM Installation Manager GUI panel might contain the incorrect architecture for the Java 7 extension offering - United States

Text:
WASV855RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If you use Installation Manager to install IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5.5 or later with the 64-bit JDK feature and then install IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0 on top of it, Java 7 is laid down as 64-bit mode to match the bit version of the JDK 6 feature. When you check the "View installed Packages" panel in the Installation Manager GUI, however, the Java 7 extension offering architecture might be shown as 32 bit.


CAUSE
The WebSphere Application Server offering is a 32-bit offering even though it has a 64-bit JDK feature installed. The extension offering listing in the "View installed Packages" panel contains only the profile architecture and not the extension-offering architecture.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
No resolution is necessary.
