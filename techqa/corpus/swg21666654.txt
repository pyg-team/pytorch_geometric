QUESTION
 How do I convert personal certificates stored in a PKCS12 or PFX file into a CMS key database file for IBM HTTP Server ? 

ANSWER
Key Management utility bundle in the IBM HTTP Server v7.0, v8.x. 

1. Start up the Key Management utility GUI, run the ikeyman.bat or .sh command from the /HTTPServer/bin directory. 
2. Select Key Database File from the menu bar, and then select Open. 
3. In the Open dialog box, Key database types select PKCS12. Enter your key database name: 

For example:
filename.p12 or filename.pfx Click OK. 

Note: The ikeyman release version bundle within the IBM HTTP Server V7.0 may display the following error message:

7. Click OK. 
8. In the Password Prompt dialog box.

Enter a new password, enter the password again to confirm, place a check mark “Stash password to a file” and then click OK to export the selected keys to a key.kdb CMS key database file. 

A new set of CMS key database files (key.kdb, key.rdb, key.sth) created containing your personal certificate and trusted chain certificates. 

Note: Open the new key.kdb key database file and verify in the Key Database content frame section, the personal certificate is set as default. An Asterisk is shown in front of the personal certificate label name. 
For example: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666654&amp;aid=3]
