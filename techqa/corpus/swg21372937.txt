ENVIRONMENT
 

 *  WebSphere Portal server installed as integrated environment with Rational Application Developer v7.0.0.8 
 * Microsoft Windows

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve this issue you can follow either of below instruction sets: 

 

 * Enter the correct User ID/password in the Server Overview page within RAD workbench.
   1. Within Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software workbench double-click Portal server in Servers view to open Server Overview page. 
   
   2. In overview tab, under Security section, make sure that you have entered the valid User ID/password if the security is enabled in WebSphere Application Server. see image 1

   3. In Portal tab, make sure that Websphere Portal administrator section includes the correct User ID/password. see image 2
   Note: Portal server administrator user ID and password is used while running a Portlet/Portal project on Portal server, so it will not be used at server startup, but to make sure you do not encounter the password mismatch issue later when running your project, make sure you have provided the correct credentials in this section.

   4. Save the changes. 
   
   5. Restart the Portal server.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 * Storing the password in the Portal property file, so the required password field will get populated automatically while creating a Portal server instance within RAD using Portal server creation wizard: 1. Make sure Websphere Portal server is stopped. 
   
   2. Within Windows explorer navigate to the Websphere Portal installation directory.
   i.e. C:\IBM\Websphere 
   
   3. You need to access Websphere Portal property file which is located at:
   wp_profile\ConfigEngine\properties 
   
   4. Open up the file wkplc.properties 
   
   5. Search for WASPassword and make sure the WASUserid/WASPassword that you have provided when installing WebSphere Portal server is typed correctly.
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21372937&amp;aid=3]
   
   
   6. Search for PortalAdminId/PortalAdminPWD and make sure the User ID/password that you have provided when installing WebSphere Portal server is typed correctly.
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21372937&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21372937&aid=4]
   
   
   7. Save the file. 
   
   8. From now on, if you attempt to create a WebSphere Portal server instance, the required field for User ID/password will be populated automatically within the server creation wizard.
