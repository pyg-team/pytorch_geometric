PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application server version         *
   *                 6.0.2 users.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a non-clustered application        *
   *                      server is converted into a cluster,     *
   *                      the resources defined at the server     *
   *                      scope are not copied into the cluster.  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a non-clustered application server is converted into a
   cluster, the resources defined at the server scope are
   supposed to be copied into the cluster. So the individual
   server-scoped resources are converted to cluster-scoped
   resources. We don't give end users a choice in the matter -
   all of the server scoped resources are converted because
   that individual server is about to disappear and become the
   first cluster member anyway. These resources are not being
   copied so ultimately they get lost while upgrdaing to cluster.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been corrected so that resources are now properly
   copied.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.0.2.17.
