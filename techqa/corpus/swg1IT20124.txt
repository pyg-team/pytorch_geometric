APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a multi-instance integration node has been configured to run
   without starting the integration node HTTP Listener, it abends
   on a failover shutdown with the following abend stack:
   
   Windows:
   CommonServices!?lock@ImbMutex
   AdministrativeAgent!?stopHABrokerInstance@ImbBrokerDirector
   AdministrativeAgent!?runBrokerDirectorCleanup@ImbBrokerDirector
   AdministrativeAgent!?run@ImbBrokerDirector
   AdministrativeAgent!?start@ImbBrokerMain
   
   Unix:
   ImbBrokerDirector.ImbMutex::lock
   ImbBrokerDirector::stopHABrokerInstance()
   ImbBrokerDirector::runBrokerDirectorCleanup()
   ImbBrokerDirector::run()
   ImbBrokerMain::start

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus V9.0 and V10.0 who have the
   integration node HTTP listener disabled.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If the integration node HTTP listener has been disabled such
   that it does not run, an abend may occur if the integration node
   shuts down due to the associated MQ queue manager becoming
   unavailable.
   With IBM Integration Bus (IIB) V9.0 this will only occur if the
   integration node has been configured as a multi-instance or high
   availability (HA) node.
   With IIB V10.0 this may occur for HA and non-HA integration
   nodes if an associated MQ queue manager has been defined for the
   integration node.
   The abend occurs because the shutdown logic attempts to shutdown
   the integration node HTTP listener process without first
   checking that it is running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now checks whether the HTTP Listener parameters have
   been set, denoting that it is running, before attempting to shut
   the process down.
