ABSTRACT
 PM89095 corrects some minor issues in auto-mapping PLI copybooks for CICS VSAM Transparency for z/OS (CICS VT) V2.1, to bring it into line with COBOL copybook processing. There are new ISPF messages. 

CONTENT
APAR PM89095 [https://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1PM89095] details: 

 1. The following changes are made to PLI copybook/include member processing:  1. Decimal and binary fields in PLI copybooks can have FIXED or FLOAT but if neither is specified the compiler assumes the following defaults, in line with the behavior of the PLI compiler:  1. If there is no defined scale, FLOAT is assumed. For example, FLD01 DEC(5) is assumed to be FLOAT. 
         2. If there is a defined scale, FIXED is assumed. For example, FLD02 BIN(8,2) is assumed to be FIXED.  * Previously, CICS VT assumed the FIXED attribute for all ambiguously specified decimal and binary fields and for implicit FLOAT fields the incorrect length was potentially calculated. After the changes in APAR PM89095 [https://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1PM89095], CICS VT tests for a supplied scale and decides FIXED or FLOAT. 
             * The changes in APAR PM89095 also prompt CICS VT to issue an appropriate status for each field that is not unambiguously defined. The new status is either “Assumed float” or “Assumed fixed”. The former is already used for COBOL copybook processing. The latter is a new status.
            
            
        
        
     2. COBOL copybook analysis highlights floating point and DBCS fields. APAR PM89095 brings these features into PLI copybook analysis. 
     3. Support for PLI overlays is now consistent with COBOL REDEFINES, although depending on the technique, the overlaying fields might be displayed at the end of the file structure, and not in-line as in COBOL. 
     4. Support for PLI COMPLEX numbers. 
     5. Support for the PLI equivalent of COBOL OCCURS DEPENDING ON.
        
        
    
    
 2. The way that the auto-mapper handles overlaid key and AIX fields has changed. Previously, the auto-mapper allowed overlaid key and AIX fields and generated DB2 columns for the overlaid and overlaying fields. After PM89095, new ISPF messages highlighting overlaid key or AIX fields are issued, and user action to delete appropriate fields/columns is required. MAP and SAVE commands are disallowed unless overlaying key and AIX fields are resolved.
