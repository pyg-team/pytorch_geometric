APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When  installing Host On-Demand 12.0 or 12.0.2 the install GUI
   was not able to detect IIS. The customer had to update IIS
   manually to get Host On Demand to work.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually update IIS Web Server
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Affected users are those who want to select the IIS(Internet *
   * Information Server) server on the Web Server panel during    *
   * the installation of Host On-Demand on Windows systems where  *
   * an IIS server is already available.                          *
   * This applies to environments where HOD is being installed    *
   * via the 32-bit version of IBM Installation Manager software, *
   * and the Windows OS is 64-bit.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When a user starts the installation of Host On-Demand on a   *
   * Windows OS where IIS (Internet Information Server) has       *
   * already been installed, the IIS server is not listed under   *
   * "Select from list of detected Web Server(s):" on the Web     *
   * Server panel.                                                *
   *                                                              *
   * In this scenario, the user however, is able to continue with *
   * the rest of the Host On-Demand installation process, and     *
   * alternative steps can later be followed if needed, by the    *
   * user to manually configure IIS for Host On-Demand.           *
   *                                                              *
   * This issue is specific to environments where the             *
   * Installation Manager is of 32-bit architecture, while the    *
   * Windows OS is 64-bit.                                        *
   *                                                              *
   * The Windows OS places certain restrictions thus preventing   *
   * the HOD installation from detecting the available IIS        *
   * server.                                                      *
   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
   * A fix has been added for this issue.                         *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Alternatively, after the HOD installation is complete, the user
   can manually configure the IIS server to publish the HOD server,
   if needed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix uses alternative methods provided by Windows that would
   allow the installation process to detect the presence of IIS
   server.
   This fix is currently expected to be available in the next
   planned releases : HOD 12.0.4.0(version yet to be confirmed),
   HOD v13.0.1.0, HOD v14.0
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Yes
