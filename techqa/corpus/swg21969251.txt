Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Apache HTTPComponents vulnerabilities in WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are two vulnerabilities in Apache HTTPComponents that are used in IBM WebSphere Application Server. Although IBM WebSphere Application server is not vulnerable to these, other products or applications that use these libraries could be vulnerable. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2012-6153 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6153]
DESCRIPTION: Apache HttpComponents could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95328] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-3577 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3577]

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server 

 * Version 8.5.5 Full Profile 
 * Version 8.5 Full Profile 
 * Version 8.0 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The interim fix for this issue hides the Apache HttpComponents from being visible to other products or applications. This is a change back to the original behavior in releases prior to Version 8. If you install the interim fix or the fixpack containing this APAR you may notice a change if your application is relying on the HttpComponents shipped by WebSphere Application Server. If you see a NoClassDefFoundError observed after applying the fix, it is because the API in HttpComponents libraries are no longer visible to your application. 
To resolve this error, your application may need to be updated to add the HttpComponents library into your application. Please refer to the Apache website for information and download: Apache HttpComponents [http://hc.apache.org/] 


The recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI50993 for each named product as soon as practical. 


For WebSphere Application Server: 
For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.8 Full Profile: 
路 Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix PI50993 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041394] 

--OR-- 
路 Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.9 or later. 


For V8.0 through 8.0.0.11: 
路 Upgrade to a minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix PI50993 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24041394] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040613] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039197] 

--OR-- 
路 Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.12 or later.
