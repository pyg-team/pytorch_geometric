ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: The following error message appears when the
   option "-Xlp" is used on a Linux system that was properly
   configured for large pages.
   JVMJ9GC032E System configuration does not support option '-Xlp'
   If the system is configured for large pages, the above error
   message should not be seen when "-Xlp" is used.
   .
   Stack Trace: N/A
   .
   The error was not seen when running on Linux SLES 11, but was
   seen when the customer upgraded to SLES 11 SP1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use the "-Xlp option".
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Changes to /proc/meminfo appeared in SLES 11 SP1 which caused
   problems with the method the JVM used to detect that the system
   supported large pages.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR8
   5.0.0 SR12
   .
   The JVM was updated to support the changes to /proc/meminfo and
   now properly detects when the system is configured for large
   pages.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20100319 or later
