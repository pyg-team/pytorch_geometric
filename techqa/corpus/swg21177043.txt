PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Use this procedure in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) if you are having problems creating your broker using the mqsicreatebroker command.

Gathering this information before calling IBM Support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

To capture a broker creation trace, perform the following steps: 

1. Set the following environment variable. Ensure you reset the environment variable when the command you are tracing has completed.


 * 
 * 
 * set MQSI_UTILITY_TRACE=debug
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * export MQSI_UTILITY_TRACE=debug
 * 


Optionally, you can set the MQSI_UTILITY_TRACESIZE environment variable to 
increase the trace file size up to 2GB. 

2. Run the mqsicreatebroker command until you get the failure. 

3. Retrieve the trace log for the specified component.  * 
 * mqsireadlog <brokername> -t -b mqsicreatebroker -f -o broker.xml
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  <brokername>
 * 


4. Format the XML trace file.  * 
 * mqsiformatlog -i broker.xml -o broker.log


5. Submit the file broker.log to IBM Support for problem determination. 

6. Unset the environment variable - MQSI_UTILITY_TRACE=debug
