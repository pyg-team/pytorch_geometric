APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You can get the CWWSS8014E error message in SAML Web SSO when
   the DN of the signer certificate that signed the SAML
   assertion does not match sso_<id>.idp_<id>.allowedIssuerDN.
   
   CWWSS8014E: The Issuer name in the SAML Assertion is not
   trusted.
   
   This message implies that the Issuer element in the SAML
   Assertion is incorrect, not that the signer certificate is
   incorrect.

   ****************************************************************
   The SAML Web Single Sign-On CWWSS8014E error shown below can be
   misleading:
   CWWSS8014E: The Issuer name in the SAML Assertion is not
   trusted.
   You can get this error for the following reasons:
   1) The Issuer element in the SAML Assertion does not match the
   value configured for the sso_<id>.idp_<id>.allowedIssuerName
   TAI custom property.
   2) The DN of the signer certificate does not match the value
   configured for the sso_<id>.idp_<id>.allowedIssuerDN TAI custom
   property.
   3) A value is configured for the
   sso_<id>.idp_<id>.allowedIssuerDN TAI custom property but, at
   the time the Issuer validation is being performed, the signer
   certificate for the SAML Assertion is not available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SAML Web Single Sign-On TAI is updated to emit more
   detailed messages.
   
   To CWWSS8014E, an insert is added to indicate the Issuer name
   that is in the SAML Assertion that failed validation:
   
   CWWSS8014E: The Issuer name in the SAML Assertion is not
   trusted. [{0}]
   
   
   When the signer certificate of the SAML Assertion does not
   match allowedIssuerDN, the following message will be emitted:
   
   CWWSS8042E: The Subject DN of the signer certificate in the
   SAML Assertion is not trusted: [{0}]
   
   
   When there is a value configured for allowedIssuerDN and the
   signer certificate of the SAML Assertion is not available at
   the time the Issuer validation is performed, one of the
   following messages will be emitted:
   
   1) If the sso_<id>.sp.wantAssertionSigned TAI custom property
   is set to true, the following message will be emitted:
   
   CWWSS8042E: The Subject DN of the signer certificate in the
   SAML Assertion is not trusted: []
   
   Also, if com.ibm.ws.security.web.* trace is enabled, the
   following entry will be in the trace:
   
   Unable to evaluate trusted Issuer Subject DN because the
   signer certificate is not available.
   
   
   2) If the sso_<id>.sp.wantAssertionSigned TAI custom property
   is not set to true, the following message will be emitted:
   
   CWWSS8043E: The allowed issuer validation failed for the
   certificate Subject DN.  The signer certificate is not
   available.  Ensure that the [wantAssertionsSigned] custom
   property is set to true.
   
   Also, if com.ibm.ws.security.web.* trace is enabled, the
   following entry will be in the trace:
   
   Unable to evaluate trusted Issuer Subject DN because the
   [wantAssertionsSigned] property is set to false.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 7.0.0.41, 8.0.0.12, and 8.5.5.8.  Please refer to
