APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Client GUI to restore a
   virtual machine with "Restore VM" option, the restore window may
   not display information about all VCB backups for virtual
   machines that were taken. This can happen after exporting the
   client node using EXPORT NODE
   operation due to missing local data containers. If this
   information cannot be retrieved from the server, the client
   fails to make the correct list of all vm backups. This happens
   when connecting to the target Tivoli Storage Manager server.
   Connecting to the source server works fine.
   
   Platforms and versions affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager client 6.2
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low
   
   Additional Keywords:
   tsm client vstor vcb zz62 vm vstorage
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a point-in-time restore or connect to the original/source
   server if available.

   *                 the fixing levels are available, this        *
   *                 information is subject to change at the      *
   *                 discretion of IBM.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem occurs when display VCB display info is missing
   from the server, e.g. after EXPORT NODE which is fixed under
   server APAR IC76420 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC76420].
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The backup-archive client now checks if the VCB display info
   is present.
