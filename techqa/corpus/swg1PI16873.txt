APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are collecting dependency data and configured options to
   not maintain usage counts and to perform saves after 2000
   updates.
   
   CIU2258I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid DATA_TO_COLLECT=I
   PERIODIC_SAVES=N CINB_TRIGGER=2
   
   The CINT log however shows triggering occurringing much more
   frequently and only saving a few records.
   
   CIU3305I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid CINB save started - because
   of TRIGGER
   CIU3324I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid CINB: 6 DB2 records saved
   CIU3324I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid CINB: 83 CICS records saved
   CIU3324I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid CINB: 89 DEPENDENCY records
   saved
   CIU3306I  mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss applid CINB save ended - 89 records
   saved
   
   CICS IA checks the CICS TCB the task is running on and if the
   same command is issued from the same program offset under a
   different TCB mode, then CICS IA counts this towards the
   trigger value.
   
   CICS IA should only count this type of TCB mode change if it is
   different from the last save.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Interdependency Analyzer V510       *
   *                 users.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When value of 'Trigger for CINB start'  *
   *                      option is greater than 1, the number    *
   *                      of the updated records in Data Space is *
   *                      counted incorrectly.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   Currently the variable that is used as a counter of the updated
   records is increased by 1 each time as a record in Data Space is
   updated. Actually it should be increased if the record was added
   or was not changed since the last save.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been changed to provide a correct counting of
   the updated records in Data Space.
