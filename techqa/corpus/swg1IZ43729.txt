PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.2.1 documentation does not
   describe how to configure fonts in the UNIX monitor box window
   and event list by using the X Resources.
   ****************************************************************
   RECOMMENDATION:
   To configure the UNIX monitor box window and event list fonts:
   1.  Go to the location:
   $NCHOME/omnibus/desktop/locale/arch/locale_name/app-defaults
   Where "arch" is the operating system directory and
   "locale_name" is the full locale name; for example
   en_GB.ISO8859-1. Note that the "locale_name" value must match
   your current locale. You can run the locale command (without any
   arguments) to list the current locale.
   
   2.  Edit the NCOEvent resource file to change the fonts for the
   resources as required:
   -  NCOEvent*fontList: Affects most of the text unless overridden
   by another resource definition
   -  NCOEvent*XmText.fontList: Affects descriptive text items such
   as journal entries
   -  NCOEvent*XmTextField.fontList: Affects editable text items
   such as the Username field in the login window
   -  NCOEvent*XmLabel.fontList: Affects non-editable labels such
   as the labels next to the Username and Password fields
   -  NCOEvent*main_status_line.fontList: Affects the status
   message that is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the
   monitor box window after login
   -  NCOEvent*main_user_field.fontList: Affects the name of the
   logged-in user, which is displayed in the status bar at the
   bottom of the monitor box window after login
   -  NCOEvent*main_server_field.fontList: Affects the ObjectServer
   name that is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the
   monitor box window after login
   -  NCOEvent*sub_status_line.fontList: Affects the status message
   that is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of an event
   list
   -  NCOEvent*sub_user_field.fontList: Affects the name of the
   logged-in user, which is displayed in the status bar at the
   bottom of an event list
   -  NCOEvent*sub_server_field.fontList: Affects the ObjectServer
   name that is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of an
   event list
   -  NCOEvent*sub_clock.fontList: Affects the date and time
   displayed in the status bar at the bottom of an event list
   -  NCOEvent*sub_matrix.labelFont: Affects the column headers in
   an event list
   -  NCOEvent*sub_matrix.fontList: Affects the text for the event
   data in an event list table. This resource is not listed in the
   NCOEvent resource file, but can be added if you want to change
   this font. You can copy the NCOEvent*sub_matrix.labelFont line,
   paste the text below the NCOEvent*sub_matrix.labelFont line,
   and then amend the NCOEvent*sub_matrix.labelFont portion of the
   pasted text to read NCOEvent*sub_matrix.fontList
   -  *view_builder*display_matrix.labelFont: Affects the headers
   above each column in the Display Columns section of the View
   Builder. This change is also reflected in the event list column
   headers.
   
   For example, to increase the font size of any of these
   resources from 12 to 24, you can change
   -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-*-75-75-*-*-iso*-*  to
   -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--24-*-75-75-*-*-iso*-*
   
   3.  Save your changes.
   
   4.  For the changes to take effect, close and reopen the
   monitor box window and event list.
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated to include
   instructions for configuring the fonts in the UNIX monitor box
   window and event list. This update will be available in the IBM
   Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus V7.3 release.
