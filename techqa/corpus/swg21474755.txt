PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While working with connectors in InfoSphere DataStage, InfoSphere Information Analyzer, or InfoSphere Fast Track, an operation times out if it takes too long to complete. 

SYMPTOM
An error occurs indicating that the operation has timed out.

CAUSE
The default timeout for the Connector Access Service is 120 seconds, but the operation has taken longer than 120 seconds to complete. Operations that query large numbers of rows in a database might take longer than 120 seconds to complete. For example, you might encounter this error when you drill down into columns in InfoSphere Information Analyzer.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Modify the timeout value for the Connector Access Service. To modify the timeout value, perform the following steps for the version of InfoSphere Information Server that you have installed. 

Modifying the Connector Access Service timeout for InfoSphere Information Server, Version 8.1

Perform the following steps to create a properties file that specifies the timeout interval:


 1. Change directory to the following directory:
    <WebSphere-App-Server-Root-Directory>/profiles/<profile-name>/classes
    Where <WebSphere-App-Server-Root-Directory> is the root directory where WebSphere Application Server is installed, and <profile-name> is the name of the WebSphere Application Server profile. The default for <profile-name> is default. 
 2. Create a file called cas-server.properties that contains the following text:
    # Time in seconds to wait for response from agent
    ConnectorAccessService.AgentTimeout=120
    Set the timeout period to whatever value you prefer. If 120 seconds is insufficient to get responses from the connector, specify a larger value. 
 3. Restart the WebSphere Application Server to apply your changes. 



Modifying the Connector Access Service timeout for InfoSphere Information Server, Version 8.5 

On the services tier, issue the following command: 

<InformationServer> /ASBServer/bin/PropertyAdmin -set -key cas.agent.timeout -value 120 

Where <InformationServer> is the installation directory for InfoSphere Information Server. 

Set the timeout period to whatever value you prefer. If 120 seconds is insufficient to get responses from the connector, specify a larger value. 

The new timeout value will apply to any new connections that are established after the command has been issued.
