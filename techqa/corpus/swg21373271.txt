PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do you use a port other than default port of 80 for the Contributor web? 

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2003 IIS Manager 6

Steps:

1. Open IIS Manager and expand down to Web Sites.

2. Right click on Web Sites and click New, Web Site and go through the wizard. Here are some example settings -

Description = EP Cognos Web Site

Enter the IP&. = All Unassigned

TCP port&. = 81

Host header&. = (leave blank)

Path = C:\Inetpub\epcognos (name of website) (will need to add epcognos)

Allow the following permissions = Read

3. Click Finish in the wizard.

Right click on the newly created website and click Properties.

On the Web Site tab, next to IP address click Advanced (you should have (All Unassigned) in the IP address field).

Under Multiple identities for this Web Site you should have a 'Default" IP address, click Default and click Edit.

In the Add/Edit window:

IP address: (All Unassigned)

TCP port: (port used in the wizard step above)

Host Header value: web server's machine name

Once done, click OK until all the windows for the website close.

Now create the virtual directories needed to set up the Contributor web as per the instruction in the Installation Guide.

The new URL used to connect to the Contributor website will now be:

ht tp://Machinename:port_number/virtual_directory/contributor

Example:

Machine Name = webserver

Virtual directory = epcognos

Port = 81

URL = http://webserver:81/ep cognos/contributor

Note: Don't forget to go to planning44.asp page to configure the Web site.
