PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error FNRPA0087E prevents login to and deployment of solutions in IBM Case Manager Builder 

SYMPTOM
When attempting first to login to IBM Case Manager the following message appears:
FNRPA0087E An unexpected error occurred. 
See any associated messages and correct the problems that are reported. See the application server log files for more detailed information

Click close and the IBM Case Manager Builder screen remains open. If you attempt to deploy the solution the same message appears. 

The Application systemOut.log reports the following messages:

"[5/28/14 11:53:47:917 CDT] 00000122 servlet E
com.ibm.casemgmt.intgimpl.messages.CaseMgmtLogger error FNRPA0087E An unexpected error occurred.
com.ibm.casemgmt.api.exception.CaseMgmtException: FNRPA0087E An unexpected error occurred.
at
com.ibm.casemgmt.api.exception.CaseMgmtException.createException(CaseMgmtException.java:112)
Caused by: RPC pejb_getSystemConfigInfo. IO Error while serialize bytes to objects.
java.io.InvalidClassException:filenet.vw.server.WorkBasketRef; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 7425, local class serialVersionUID = 7424"



CAUSE
The local class incompatible error is caused by the P8CPE related jar files on the client application not matching the version of the P8 Content Platform Engine (CPE) 5.2 server. 
In this case the local class serialVersionUID = 7424 in the above message refers to the P8 Content Platform Engine (CPE) Client version installed in IBM Case Manager. The IBM Case Manager ping page shows the CPE Client build as: dap520.002.091 which is patch 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002.
The classdesc serialVersionUID = 7425 refers to the P8 Content Platform Engine version on the CPE server. In this case the CPE build version is dap520.003.147 which is patch 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow the steps indicated in the following link "Updating the Content Platform Engine client connector files":
