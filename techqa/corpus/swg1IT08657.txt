APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installation  Windows fails with 1603 error when %TMP% or %TEMP%
   exceeds 100 *.rsp files after multiple failed installations.
   For example with IBM Data Server client installs, the *.rsp file
   is called PROD_CLIENT.rsp.  After each failed installation the
   file named PROD_CLIENTxx.rsp (where xx is a number from 00 to
   99) will remain in %TMP% .
   
   Action start 12:00:00: InitSilentInstallCA.
   1: ERROR:An error occurred while creating or generating a name
   for a temporary file.  Ensure you have access to create
   temporary files.
   1: ERROR:Failed to setup the initial Windows Installer
   properties for the response file installation.
   1: Failed to initialize silent install.
   CustomAction InitSilentInstallCA returned actual error code 1603
   (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation happened
   inside sandbox)
   Action ended 12:00:00: InitSilentInstallCA. Return value 3.
   
   This APAR makes two changes to prevent %TMP% from being filled
   up with temporary installation files upon a failed installation:
   
   1) Reuse %TMP%\PROD_*.rsp file instead of creating a new one
   for each subsequent installation attempt.
   
   2) Limit number of %TMP%\_DB2xxxx directories created to 10.
   
   Upon successful installation, the temporary files and
   directories listed above will be removed.
   
   Notes: Windows has two sets of %TEMP%, one is a User environment
   variable, the other is the System environment variable.  The
   System version usually points to c:\windows\temp.  Thus if using
   LocalSystem for installation it would use the System environment
   variable.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Delete PROD_*.rsp and _DB2xxxx files in the directory pointed to
   by %TEMP% or %TMP%.
