ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is running TAM 4.1 FP02 with WebSeal on Solaris 2.8
   
   
   Problem Description:
   Here are some details about the problem I've seen with WebSEAL
   in
   relation to mutual authentication over SSL junctions while also
   using
   load balancing.
   I have a WebSEAL junction pointing to 3 backend IIS servers.
   This
   junction is configured as a mutual authentication using ssl
   junction.
   Now when there is only one server in the junction the mutual
   authentication works fine. However if I add another server, then
   mutual
   ssl authentication won't work for that server.
   In fact, the only server it works for is always the first server
   defined in the junction.
   I can modify the junction XML file and change the order of the
   files
   and this is still true.
   
   
   ---------
   Further information from development:
   
   There is a defect in our product that causes this problem.  The
   problem
   is that the current implementation of the Junction persistance
   handling
   (to file) does not cater for all Mutually Authenticated SSL
   junctions
   options (this code was written before support was added and has
   not been
   updated ;( ).  They seem to be only implemented within the
   initial
   junction definition and not for a each server that is added.
   
   The function that needs updating is:
   
    void pdWSjuncent::write_serverinfo(wand_extern_jct_t
   *extern_info)
   
   This needs to go through the whole jct definition and write the
   content
   of such to the Jct repository, which at the moment is an XML
   file.
   
   The workaround for the customer is that as long as the default
   certificate is used for each junction server definition, all
   will
   function correctly.  If the customer uses one certificate for
   each
   server, then only the first one defined within the actual
   junction
   definition will function.
