APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer enabled Wiki Macros in 4.5 CR5 and when they do
   that they can no longer save their edits to Wiki pages when
   they are on the HTML Source tab. If they try to save on the
   Rich Text tab it succeeds.
   
   The customer reports that their changes are lost when they hit
   the "save and close" button.
   
   The customer disabled Wiki Macros and the problem stopped.
   
   I tested this issue on a test environment running Connections
   5.0 and when you have Wiki Macros enabled and try to hit "save"
   or "save and close" from the HTML Source tab the buttons will
   not do anything. The page just sits there. If I then switch to
   the Rich Text tab the buttons work and the changes are saved
   properly.
   
   I can also save from the HTML Source tab in 5.0 when I disable
   Wiki Macros.
   
   Also note that this problem happens regardless of whether any
   macros are utilized in the wiki page - or even if any changes
   are made to the page at all.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable Wiki Macros or change to the Rich Text tab and then
   save your changes
