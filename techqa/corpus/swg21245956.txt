ABSTRACT
 The IBM® DB2® Content Manager OnDemand for i5/OS™ (iSeries™), product number 5722RD1, is no longer sent on the stacked media (CDs) that you receive with operating system upgrades. The product is now available from the Passport Advantage web site, where it can be downloaded. You must be Passport Advantage-entitled (with your software subscription) to the 5722RD1 product before you can download it. 

CONTENT
You should verify with your IBM marketing representative or IBM business partner that you are Passport Advantage-entitled. If you are, you can go to the Passport Advantage web site and download the Content Manager OnDemand for i5/OS (iSeries) software. You can also request to get the software on a CD at the Passport Advantage web site through the "Media Access" option. 

To download the software: 

1. . Go to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage] and click the tab labelled Passport Advantage Online. That will bring you to http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm], where you can click Customer sign-in.

2. Enter your registration ID or site number. If you do not know what this is or you do not have a registration ID, contact the Passport Advantage group at 1-800-978-2246. Their hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern time (EDT (summer) or EST (winter)), excluding U.S. legal holidays. For customers outside the U.S. or Canada, please see https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html [https://www-112.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/paocustomer/docs/en_US/ecare.html] . 

3. Click on Software Download & Media Access on the left. Click on I Agree, if prompted. On the Software Download tab, click on Download Finder. All entitled downloads should be listed. Select "IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i5/OS" and then Continue. On the next panel, select the language and platform "IBM i (i6 formerly i5/OS V6)" and then click on Yes next to "If available,would you like to see previous versions of this product?", then Continue. On the screen that follows, click on the plus sign to expand Previous versions. Then look for the eAssembly named “DB2 Content Manager OnDemand iSeries V5.4 Multilingual eAssembly (CR3FGML)”. Click on the plus sign next to this entry.

4. You will see that underneath the CR3FGML entry, C88QHML contains the base Server code (*BASE of 5722-RD1), as well as Options 10 (Common Server) and 11 (ODWEK). C13EBML is for the OnDemand 8.4 Client code. Select the check boxes next to the items you want and then click I agree and Download now at the bottom of the page. 

5. The code might get placed in C:\DownloadDirector, unless you get a chance to override this. The C88QHML.ZIP extracts into two files. These are: 1) the RD1 code in a file named rd1srvr and 2) a text file that has the directions for uploading this code to the i5/OS server and loading the 5722-RD1 Licensed Program Product. It is highly recommended that you print and review the PDF instruction file below rather than using the abbreviated instructions that are downloaded in the TXT file: 

C88QHML.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245956&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245956&aid=1] 

6. If you are also downloading PDF Indexer, you will need to go back to step 3 and instead of choosing "IBM Content Manager OnDemand for i5/OS", choose "IBM Content Manager OnDemand PDF Indexer for i5/OS" and Continue. On the next panel, select the language and platform "IBM i (i6 formerly i5/OS V6)" and then click on Yes next to "If available,would you like to see previous versions of this product?", then Continue. On the screen that follows, click on the plus sign to expand Previous versions. Then look for the eAssembly named "DB2 Content Manager OnDemand iSeries PDF Indexer V5.4 Multilingual eAssembly (CR3FHML)". The entry "DB2 Content Manager OnDemand PDF Indexer for iSeries V5.4 Multilingual (C88QJML)" contains the C88QJML.zip, which will extract into two files. These are: 1) the code itself in a file named rd1pdf and 2) a text file that has the directions for uploading the code to the i5/OS server and loading this option of the Licensed Program Product.
