APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the AND parameter is assigned to all properties in a search
   template, the search template fails with a "Parameter is
   incorrect" error. This problem doesn't occur in Workplace. It
   appears a change was made to search templates somewhere along
   the way causing older templates to fail in Workplace XT.
   
   The workaround is to create the same search template using
   Workplace XT.
