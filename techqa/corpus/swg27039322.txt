In the "Installing and configuring IBM Content Search Services" section of the Information Center: 

 * Deploying a self-signed certificate on Content Platform Engine (JBoss Application Server) [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r2m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin347.htm] 
 * Deploying a third-party certificate on Content Platform Engine (JBoss Application Server) [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r2m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pin348.htm]


In the "Upgrading IBM Content Search Services" section of the Information Center:  * Deploying a self-signed certificate on Content Platform Engine (JBoss Application Server) [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r2m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.install.doc/p8pup716.htm]
