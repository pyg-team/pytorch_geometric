QUESTION
 Can I add a date into a field using either Workflow or Escalations? 

ANSWER
The solution lies in knowing and utilizing the database’s own date/time syntax for correctly setting dates. This usually takes the form of a function name, such as Oracle’s ‘TO_DATE’ and a pair of values – the date you wish to use and a mask describing the format of that date. Below is a simple example of what the function would look like for setting the date to December 31, 2015 (on an Oracle database):
to_date('12/31/2015', 'MM/dd/yyyy') 

There are some other date features available to Maximo workflow. In our expression builder for conditions we have 2 Maximo keywords, DATE and DATETIME. They will return the Maximo server’s date value or date and time values respectively. You can use mathematical operations on these keywords to add or subtract days from the specified date. The keywords can be used in a setvalue action’s expression by using the DATE or DATETIME notation as if they were field attributes of the base object.

Here is a screenshot of an Action made using To_date():

Actions can be used with with both Workflow and with Escalations.
