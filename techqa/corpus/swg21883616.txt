Title: IBM AWSJCO005E and AWSZAP006E Event rule errors with SSL certificates - United States

Text:
TDWC; DWC; authentication SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While creating an event rule to add a jobstream to a z/OS master from TDWC the following error is shown: 

"AWSJCO005E WebSphere Application Server has given the following error: Error getting WsnNameService properties." 

SYMPTOM
The following error is displayed when attempting to create an event rule using the AddJobStream event from Dynamic Workload Console (DWC) for a z/OS Master: 

 
AWSZAP006E Triggered action "AddJobStream" was not completed successfully.
Reason: "AWSJCS011E An internal error has occurred. The error is the following: "Authentication Failed"."


CAUSE
One possible cause is that there is not a Trusted Certificate between the IBM Workload Scheduler (IWS) Master Domain Manager (MDM) and the DWC.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
On both the Integrated Solutions Consoles (ISC) for the DWC and for IWS, check if you are using custom certificates by reviewing: 

SSL certificate and key management > Key stores and certificates > NodeDefaultTrustStore > Personal certificates

If there are custom certificates used on either side you must import the missing certificate. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To import the certificate, log into the ISC of the environment with the missing certificate. Navigate to: 

 
SSL certificate and key management > Key stores and certificates > NodeDefaultTrustStore > Signer certificates > Retrieve from port

Input the host name of the system with the certificate, the port; this is the secure admin port and alias of the missing certificate as listed in the original environment. 

Select "Retrieve Signer"

Apply and save and exit. You must restart the WebSphere instance where you imported the certificate.
