Text:
CAM-AAA-0064; CAM_AAA_Initialize2; Content Manager; CCL_RETHROW; The specified encoding is not valid; UTF-8; CM-CFG-5133; FM Upgrade plugin; CM-CFG-5076 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After TCR startup, when trying to access Common Reporting servlet, a failure occurs and the following message is issued:
DPR-ERR-2109 The dispatcher cannot service the request at this time.
The dispatcher is still initializing. 

SYMPTOM
The TIP SystemOut.log does not show meaningful error, because the failure is occurring in a Cognos component.
From the cogserver.log, you can find the following error messages:

CM-CFG-5076 A Content Manager configuration error occurred during the initialization of Cognos Access Manager.
<Message Name="CCLMessage" File="CAM_AAA" Severity="Error" Nesting="0"> <MessageComponents ID="0x5066289f" ><MessageParms> <MessageParmName="CCLMessageParm" "Type="string" Value="CAM_AAA_Initialize" /> </MessageParms></MessageComponents></Message> <Message Name="CCLMessage" File="CAM_AAA" Severity="Error" Nesting="1" >

CM-CFG-5133 A Content Manager configuration error occurred while initializing the Plugin class "com.cognos.cm.plugin.JNI.FMUpgradePluginJNI". Cause: Failed to initialize in FM Upgrade plugin Runtime Exception stack trace: java.lang.Exception: Failed to initialize in FM Upgrade plugin at com.cognos.cm.plugin.JNI.FMUpgradePluginJNI.initialize(FMUpgradePluginJNI.java:91)



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Usually this problem is addressed by verifying and correcting possible errors with incorrect or missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LIBPATH. 

For such cases, Cognos documentation suggest the following actions:
For Solaris and Linux:
Under the Environment Entries for the Websphere Application Server, ensure that
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is defined and is pointing to the <Cognos>/bin directory.
For AIX:
Under the Environment Entries for the Websphere Application Server, ensure that
the LIBPATH is defined and is pointing to the <Cognos>/bin directory. 


But in some other cases, also having LIBPATH pointing to the correct Cognos path does not help solving the problem.
The main error messages to put focus on, are the following:
-------------------------------------
CAM-AAA-0064 The function 'CAM_AAA_Initialize2' failed. 
The specified encoding is not valid: "UTF-8". 
i18n/cpp/i18n_converter.cpp(1525):I18NRuntimeError:CCL_RETHROW: 
i18n/cpp/i18n_converter.cpp(285):I18NNRuntimeError:CCL_RETHROW: 
--------------------------------------
The root cause is with the way the file system TCR is installed on was mounted.
If the file system is using concurrent I/O, then Cognos Content Manager fails to initialize and
above messages are issued.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Stop TCR process and unmount the file system where TCR installation directory is located.
Remount the file system without specifying Concurrent I/O (IE: direct I/O).
Then start TCR again and problem will be solved.
