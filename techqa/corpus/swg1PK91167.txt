APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Begin Reclaim Period of a Snaplock volume represents the date
   after which the Tivoli Storage Manager server will begin
   reclaiming this volume, but not later than the date represented
   by the end reclaim period.
   For SnapLock volumes, the RETVer parameter of the  DEFINE
   COPYGROUP command determines how long an archive is stored. If
   RETVer is set to 100 days, the volume's reclamation period or
   snaplock volume's "Begin Reclaim Date" will be 100 days after
   the first archive is stored on it. If the RetVer is defined as
   "0", the default days will be defined by RETENTIONEXTENSION
   server option.
   
   A snaplock volume generated with RetV=0 should have a "Begin
   Reclaim Date": Current date + RETENTIONEXTENSION
   "End Reclaim Date" :"Begin Reclaim Date" +30
   and a volume "Last Accessed":  "End Reclaim Date".
    However,  the snaplock volume generated by migration and
   "move data" incorrectly set the "Begin Reclaim Date" to
   current_date+0 and Volume "Last Accessed" to equal "Begin
   Reclaim Date".
