ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Specific document in a folder cannot be opened in DWA
   
   
   detailed description:
   =============================================================
   There seems to be a regression in the Domino Web Access
   Component. I have attached a database containing a folder which
   contains one email triggering the problem.
   
   This problem was fixed a long time ago (I think it was in Domino
   6.X).If you login with Domino Web Access it is not possible to
   open the folder. If this email is copied to your inbox, then you
   can't open your inbox anymore.
   The folder can be opened and the email can be read with a notes
   client.
   The problem occurs with emails which have been imported from our
   old mailsystem. These mails have some different time formats. In
   the notesclient **** is shown as year.
   
   STEPS
   
   Domino 8.5.2;
   
   
   1). Copy the documents in the attached mail file
       (84451.999.724dwaproblem.nsf) into my test mail file
   
   2). Access my test mail file in iNotes
   
   3). Click on the document in the folder, the generic error
       occurred on the iNotes console (screen shots attached
       -folder error852) and the  document can not be opened.
   
   4). This occur on IE 6, 7, 8 and Firefox
   
   
   Domino 8.0.2;
   
   1). Copy the documents in the attached mail file
       (84451.999.724dwaproblem.nsf) into my test mail file
   
   2). Access my test mail file in iNotes
   
   3). Click on the document in the folder, I can open the document
       with a generic error after clicking "OK" on the dialog box
       (Screen shot attached -folder error802.)
   
   4). The same document appears to work in Domino 802 but not in
       852.
