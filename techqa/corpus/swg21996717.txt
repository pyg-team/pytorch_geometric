ANSWER
This is a known defect, APAR IO25066, which is included into Datacap 9.0.1 Fixpack 3. 

 The temporal workaround is to set ActiveX for the problematic repository, but if customer will not treat this as workaround, you need to wait for official fix from Datacap 9.0.1 Fixpack 3. 

 Also the same fix will be included into Datacap 9.1 Fixpack 1
