SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache’s Struts library 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0112, CVE-2014-0094, & CVE-2014-0050 

DESCRIPTION: FlashSystem 840 MTM 9840-AE1, and FlashSystem V840 MTMs 9846-AE1 and 9848-AE1 use the Apache Struts library. Struts is used only by the Service Assist GUI. 

 

CVE-2014-0112 (Apache Struts ParametersInterceptor code execution) 

Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an incomplete fix related to ParametersInterceptor and the failure to restrict access to the class parameter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server to execute arbitrary code on the system. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92740 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92740]
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVE-2014-0094 

Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error in ParametersInterceptor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the class parameter to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92205 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/92205]
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVE-2014-0050 

Apache Commons FileUpload and Tomcat are vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of Content-Type HTTP header for multipart requests. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop. 

CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90987 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/90987]
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
