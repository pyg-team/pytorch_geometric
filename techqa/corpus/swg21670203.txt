Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM® MessageSight™ & TLS Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) - United States

Text:
security SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 How the TLS Heartbleed security vulnerability applies to IBM® MessageSight™. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160]
DESCRIPTION:
OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can only partially affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability.

CVSS:
CVSS Base Score: 5.0
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
Warning: We strongly encourage you to take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability is known to affect the following offerings: 

 * IBM MessageSight Server v1.0 
 * IBM MessageSight Server v1.1


The vulnerability does NOT affect any version or release of the following:  * IBM MessageSight JMS Client 
 * IBM MessageSight Resource Adaptor


IBM Java JSSE does not use OpenSSL. REMEDIATION/FIXES
The IBM MessageSight Server firmware has been updated to use a newer version of OpenSSL, which contains a fix for the heartbleed vulnerability. An updated firmware can be downloaded from Fix Central: 1.1.0.0-IBM-IMA-IT01015 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Other+software/MessageSight&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=1.1.0.0-IBM-IMA-IFIT01015&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http&source=fc].
This fix also addresses CVE-2014-0921, CVE-2014-0922, CVE-2014-0923, and CVE-2014-0924 as described in this technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21670278]. 

After applying the fix, additional steps are recommended for CVE-2014-0160 

 1) Replace your SSL Certificates. 

You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. This includes IBM MessageSight server certificates uploaded using IBM MessageSight configuration object “CertificateProfile”, and Client or CA certificates associated with using IBM MessageSight configuration object “SecurityProfile”. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). 


2) Reset User Credentials 
Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
