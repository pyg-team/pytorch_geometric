Known issues 

IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Deployment Portal

If the default result format for BIRT reports is "BIRT Report Document" in Deployment Portal, the report output may not display properly when using the Google Chrome browser if the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository server is using Oracle WebLogic or IBM WebSphere. You can view the output by using a different browser or by changing the result format.

Bookmarking repository content in Deployment Portal is only supported when using the Internet Explorer browser. 

IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Enterprise View Driver 

Due to known issues on 32-bit Windows 8.1, running the (deprecated) IBM SPSS Enterprise View Driver on this platform is not supported. However, the IBM SPSS Enterprise View Driver functions as expected when used on a 64-bit Windows 8.1 client. 

IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Enterprise View 

IBM SPSS Modeler and IBM SPSS Enterprise View map the Oracle database NUMBER type to different internal data types. As a result, when you create a scoring configuration for an IBM SPSS Modeler stream that accesses an Oracle database directly (for example, by using a Database source node), the Scoring Configuration wizard may not offer a compatible Real Time Data Provider Definition due to a type mismatch. To avoid this issue, take one of the following actions: 

 * Update the stream to use an Enterprise View source node for accessing the database. 
 * Change the Enterprise View data types to match the metadata reported by the Scoring Service (for example, change the Enterprise View columns from INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, and DECIMAL to the DOUBLE data type).


IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 

Job steps that run for more than 5 minutes on an IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository server that uses JBoss EAP 6.0 will be executed multiple times. To prevent multiple executions of long-running jobs, either upgrade to JBoss EAP 6.1 or increase the default timeout value of the coordinator environment. The resolution is documented in Technote 1673861 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21673861]. 

Server Adapter for Statistics 

Statistics job steps may fail to run if your repository server uses version 21.0 FP1 of the Server Adapter for Statistics. If possible, you should upgrade to a later version of the adapter. If you are unable to upgrade, contact IBM support for additional help. 

Axis2 web service clients If you use Axis2 to generate scoring clients for an IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services server running on IBM WebSphere, you may encounter issues with the generation process. For details, see Technote 1665995 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665995] and Technote 1665990 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665990].
