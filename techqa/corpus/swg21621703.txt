QUESTION
 I am trying to install Statistics 21 on Linux Red Hat 6.3 (64-bit). At the end of the install, it prompts me with a message "installer cannot run in this UI mode. To specify the interface mode use I mode identifiers are GUI, console and Silent." I have tried all listed options and am still getting the message.
What can I do to complete the install? 

ANSWER
Linux Red Hat 64-bit is not a supported environment for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 client. We are a 32-bit application and thus need the 32-bit version of libstdc++ and other standard libraries for the OS. For Debian, there is the relatively simple workaround of installing the ia32-libs package. For RedHat it is more difficult to locate and determine which compatibility library packages are needed. 

This is documented in the pre-requisites for installation -- see "IBM SPSS Statistics for Linux Installation Instructions (Single User)." Under System Requirements for IBM SPSS Statistics, we note the minimum hardware and software requirements for operating system: 

SPSS Statistics was tested on and is supported on only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 and Debian 6. We do not expect any problems with distributions derived from Red Hat and Debian,
but we do not test or support them.

If you install on 64-bit Linux (which is not officially supported), you will also need to install ia32-libs from your distributionâ€™s repository.

For any additional requirements, please see the Release Notes at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024941 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024941].
