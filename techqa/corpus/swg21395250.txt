Title: IBM Configuration non-SSL communication - United States

 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you configure VMware vCenter and the VMware VI agent to communicate without SSL? 

ANSWER
When turning off SSL it is important to remember to turn it off on both ends of the communication. 

 * to turn off SSL at the agent, select No during the agent configuration 
 * to turn off SSL at the vCenter, you must edit a file (refer to VMware documentation for complete instructions). The file is "proxy.xml" and it is usually located in "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\VMware\VMware VirtualCenter"


Look for a section that looks like this: 

<e id="5"> 
<_type>vim.ProxyService.LocalServiceSpec</_type> 
<accessMode>httpsWithRedirect</accessMode> 
<port>8085</port> 
<serverNamespace>/sdk</serverNamespace> 
</e> 

The value of "accessMode" may be something other than "httpsWithRedirect". The most important part is finding the section where "serverNamespace" is "sdk" as in the above example. 

Change the value of "accessMode" to "httpAndHttps" which configures the vCenter to accept both SSL and non-SSL. Save the proxy.xml file and stop, start the vCenter.
