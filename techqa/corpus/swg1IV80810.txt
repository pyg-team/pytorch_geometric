APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment: APMUI v7.7
   OS: Linux
   
   Problem Description:
   
   In WAS cluster summary group widget,  JVM CPU status is often
   shown with critical status (red), although the cpu percentage
   is less than 4% in the instance list group widget.
   
   The reason is because the definition is improper in WAS cluster
   summary group widget, and it has an improper definition of
   "scale" for attribute "AS_CPUP"
   
   Detailed Recreation Procedure:
   1) Apply for APMUI v7.7
   2) create application with WAS cluster group widget with
   several WAS instances.
   3) In ITM side, ensure the relative WAS instances JVM CPU
   percentage value are less than 10%, but larger than 1%.
   4) In summary page, you may see server JVM CPU status is
   critical (red), but if you click it to show instance list, you
   may find out many cpu percentage values are not too large.
