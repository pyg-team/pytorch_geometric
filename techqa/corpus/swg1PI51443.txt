APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you have IBM Rational Developer z (RDz) V9.1, IBM Rational
   Team Concert (RTC) V5.0.1 and IBM Rational Software Architect
   (RSA) V9.1 installed in a shell-shared environment using
   floating licensing and you open RDz while there is a repository
   connection to RTC, a RSA license will be checked-out from the
   license server, even though RSA itself is not opened.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Install RSA, RDz, RTC into a shell shared environment
   
   2. Apply floating licenses
   
   3. Open RDz
   
   4. Establish a connection to RTC
   
   5. Close & reopen RDz
   
   6. Examine the "lmgrd.log" file to review the license check outs
   
   Expected Result: No license for RSA is checked out, as RSA was
   not opened.
   
   Actual Result: A license for RSA is checked out, despite not
   having opened RSA.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  There is no known workaround at this time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If you have IBM Rational Developer z (RDz) V9.1, IBM Rational
   Team Concert (RTC) V5.0.1 and IBM Rational Software Architect
   (RSA) V9.1 installed in a shell-shared environment using
   floating licensing and you open RDz while there is a repository
   connection to RTC, a RSA license will be checked-out from the
   license server, even though RSA itself is not opened.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Install RSA, RDz, RTC into a shell shared environment
   
   2. Apply floating licenses
   
   3. Open RDz
   
   4. Establish a connection to RTC
   
   5. Close & reopen RDz
   
   6. Examine the "lmgrd.log" file to review the license check outs
   
   Expected Result: No license for RSA is checked out, as RSA was
   not opened.
   
   Actual Result: A license for RSA is checked out, despite not
   having opened RSA.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The license check has been changed to only be activated when the
   component itself is being used and not when the workbench is
   started.
   
   The problem listed in this APAR has been resolved with
   IBM Rational Developer for System z V9.1.1.3 Fix Pack which
   is available from the Recommended Fixes support download page:
