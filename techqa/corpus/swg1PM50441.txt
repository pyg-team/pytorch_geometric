APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I had Rhapsody 7.6 installed on my system and it was working
   fine. To get this to work I initially had to run the
   'vcredist_x86.exe' file to update the registry.
   I then went to upgrade to Rhapsody 7.6.0.1.
   So I:
   1. Uninstalled Rhapsody 7.6
   2. Ran the setup.exe (as the Administrator) from the Rhapsody
   software and was prompted with the window (see install_1.png)
   and selected install.
   3. I then receive the following message (see install_2.png). Why
   should I then continue with the Rhapsody installation.
   4. I then decide to run the 'vcredist_x86.exe' outside of
   Rhapsody the way it was done in version 7.6 and receive the
   following message. (see install_3.png)
   
   Problems:
   1. I see these messages and now have doubts as to whether I
   should even install Rhapsody. No faith even if I do.
   2. I f this was resolved in the initial release of 7.6 why is it
   trying to install.
