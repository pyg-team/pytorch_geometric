Title: IBM InfoSphere Discovery Fetched Column Value Truncated - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When running Column Analysis, the task completes with the following error:
ODBC Error Message [HY000:1406]: [Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-01406: fetched column value was truncated



CAUSE
The Oracle driver is returning the wrong byte calculation for multibyte data. This problem occurs when using Oracle 10.1.0.2 for the staging data source or the repository

ENVIRONMENT
InfoSphere Discovery Repository Database : Oracle 10.1.0.2, InfoSphere Discovery Staging Database: Oracle 10.1.0.2

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade the staging data source and repository to Oracle 10.1.0.5.




Note: Any machine hosting a database schema used by InfoSphere Discovery 
(repository, staging data source, data source, etc.) must use a code page that is
equivalent to Windows-1252. If you are not using a database with 1252 code page, then suggested workaround is as follows: 

 * Navigate to column analysis 
 * Double the size of all varchar columns 
 * approve it 
 * re-run column analysis
