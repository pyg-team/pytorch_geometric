PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Trying to open an external page in a web widget shows only a blank page, 

SYMPTOM
The Web Widget screen shows just a blank page.


CAUSE
Security limitation how browsers manage information being displayed in iFrames. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Use the Developer Tools in the browser (F12) and check in the Console tab for errors like the one below, mentioning the URL you defined in the Web widget: 


 
Refused to display 'https://www.google.com in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'. 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following limitation occurs when using the Web Widget in DASH: 

The Web Widget uses an iFrame to display external content. External content can choose to include instructions in their content telling the browser to not let it be iframed, or to be iframed only by certain 
hosts. 

 
The reason for this is, that the page in question is sending an "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN" response header. This option prevents the browser from displaying iFrames that are not hosted on the same domain as the parent page. 

The X-Frame-Options header is a security feature to prevent click-jacking attacks. 
This causes some web pages to work and others will not display.
