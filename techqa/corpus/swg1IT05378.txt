APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Conversion to bitstream after SOAPRequest node fails if
   HTTPRequest header is inserted before the SOAPRequest node.
   BIP2136 error is thrown.
   
   If SOAPRequest node is enabled for monitoring events that
   contain bitstream data also, then the emission of the event
   data fails.
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the HTTPRequest Header just after the SOAPRequest node
   and before converting it to bitstream.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker v8 and IBM Integration Bus
   v9 and v10 who use SOAPRequest node.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   Errors like BIP3605E, BIP5010E and BIP2136E are thrown during
   serialization of a SOAP response message received from the
   SOAPRequest node if HTTPRequestHeader is set manually before the
   SOAPRequest node. The problem may also be seen in the case where
   monitoring on the SOAPRequest node is enabled to capture
   bitstream data.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product no longer throws errors when HTTPRequestHeader is
   set manually before the SOAPRequest node.
