APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the list of special errors code we look at to determine if
   indexing should be paused because of problems we have these
   definitions:
       // TASK_ERROR_TEMPORARY_COLLECTION_ERROR
       private static final String TEMP_INDEX_TASK_ERROR =
   "IQQ0071E";
   
       // TASK_ERROR_SERVER_ERROR
       private static final String SERVER_TASK_ERROR = "IQQ0072E";
   
   It looks like these error codes are wrong.
   
   From the IQQI.properties file:
   I0071E.TASK_ERROR_TEMPORARY_COLLECTION_ERROR = An error occurred
   during execution of task {0}. The collection is temporarily
   unavailable for indexing.
   
   
   I0072E.TASK_ERROR_SERVER_ERROR = An error occurred during
   execution of task {0}. The server is currently unavailable for
   indexing. This error may require the involvement of an
   administrator.
   
   
   So the CPE definitions have another "I" like this:
       // TASK_ERROR_TEMPORARY_COLLECTION_ERROR
       private static final String TEMP_INDEX_TASK_ERROR =
   "IQQI0071E";
   
       // TASK_ERROR_SERVER_ERROR
       private static final String SERVER_TASK_ERROR = "IQQI0072E";

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Users doing full text indexing with Content Search Services  *
   * and Content Platform Engine 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003 and prior.   *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Content Platform Engine handles different indexing errors it *
   * receives from Content Search Services differently. Due to    *
   * the wrong error codes in Content Platform Engine, for        *
   * certain temporary indexing error conditions, it responded by *
   * slowing down indexing instead of temporarily pausing         *
   * indexing for the collection from which the errors            *
   * originated.                                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Content Platform Engine 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and   *
   * later                                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Content Platform Engine 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and later uses
   correct error codes to identify the error conditions and handles
   them appropriately.
