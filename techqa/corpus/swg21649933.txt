Title: IBM Batches wait up to a minute before processing by Rulerunner with IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
rulerunner idle delay TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a batch becomes available for processing by Rulerunner, it may wait for a minute or longer before Rulerunner starts processing it. This occurs even when Rulerunner is idle. 

CAUSE
The Taskmaster Server service does not immediately notify Rulerunner when a batch becomes available. Instead, Rulerunner polls the Server service to get a list of available tasks. When idling, Rulerunner will lower its polling rate to reduce unnecessary overhead on the Taskmaster Server, which may cause batches to sit in the Pending state for up to a minute.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To force Rulerunner to poll more frequently during idle time: 

 1. On the Rulerunner station, run Regedit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Datacap\Rulerunner\Misc. 
 2. Edit Maximum Delay and change it to a lower value, such as 2. 
 3. Restart Rulerunner.


Note that lower values for Maximum Delay may increase overhead on the Taskmaster Server.
