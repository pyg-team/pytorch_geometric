 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I understand that IWPM can handle many different kinds of content. I'm trying to import a PDF file into WAF and display it in IWPM. How do I do this? 

ANSWER

1. IWPM doesn't care about the original extension of the imported file. It only looks at the 4-digit content class number that is passed down in the image data stream from WAF. 

2. The EKD0318 needs to have a record added through DFU with this new content class number and name -- anything 4096 or above. The record should look like this: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590825&amp;aid=1] 

3. IWPM needs to have a Display Exit defined as per the IWPM/NT Installation and User's Guide. Basically, you're telling it for content class 4097 in the example above, to run c:\xxxxxx\xxxxxx.exe. You do this through the IWPM Configuration, on the Exits tab. There's an illustration on p. 38 of the IWPM/NT Installation and User's Guide, but this is what I did: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590825&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21590825&aid=2]


4. The WCT entry for the workstation has to be updated to allow Content Class support = Y.

5. When you import the document into WAF, use a document type with a Data type of "2" (As-Is/MODCA). I called mine "PDF" with a description "Imported PDF file".

6. Originally, the images that you wanted to display in PDF had to be updated with the UPDCC API to show they're in content class 4097 so that IWPM would know to launch the user exit. However, I just tested this and it appears it is no longer true. I didn't use UPDCC to change my document from a content class of 1 to a content class of 4097, and it displayed fine. Adobe Reader was launched because the Windows operating system knows what to do that with PDF files. You simply double click on the PDF icon inside IWPM and Adobe Reader displays it.
