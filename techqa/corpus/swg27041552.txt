Q&A 
Q1. I was wondering why single logout is not supported. 
Single logout is very hard to do. It didn't get in our schedule when we first worked on SAML and we haven't had strong customer demand for that feature. If this is a critical item for you, I encourage you to bring that feedback to IBM through the customer forums, making your request known. 


Q2. You mentioned that you support SAML 2.0. Why doesn't that imply that any SAML 2.0 identity provider is supported? 
There's a big difference between will it work and is it supported. If it's supported that means we have to rigorously test it. And we don't have the resources to rigorously test all the various products that are out there. 

But if you're trying something out and you find that it works, please do report it back to us because we do want to have that information. If you try something out and it doesn't work, please report that back to us so that we have that information if we need it going forward to try to resolve any customer problems. But really it's an issue of resources and testing. 


Q3. Is it possible to add IDs into the vault for iNotes users in batch mode? IDs for Eclipse users are in the vault but not for our iNotes users (it is not in the mail also). 
- The option to include ID into the mail file is exposed to the iNotes and Traveler users at a per user over the Web. There's currently not a native option to upload batch IDs to the vault; however, we have exposed "SECidfPut" in the C API 
- I am not aware of any batch upload to the vault, other than policy. The C API SECIDfPut only allows a single ID per instance. http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Notes_ID_vault_on-the-go_and_integration_with_other_programs [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Notes_ID_vault_on-the-go_and_integration_with_other_programs] 


Q4. Has anyone setup ADFS 2.0 with AD? Is it difficult? 
We have a cookbook with screenshots you can follow. http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Cookbookcol_Setting_up_new_Relying_Party_Trust_for_AD_FS_2.0_ [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Cookbookcol_Setting_up_new_Relying_Party_Trust_for_AD_FS_2.0_] 


Q5. Does anyone know if Azure ADFS be used? 
We did not test with Azure ADFS. If the rely partner for Domino can be set up for HTTP post, then it should work. Domino does not support SAML artifact flows. 


Q6a. What happens when a user has not logged into Active Directory? Is fail back graceful unlike SPNEGO? 
With SAML we off-load authentication to the IDP. If users cannot authenticate via Active Directory they are unable to log in at Domino. If running in a mixed environment where some users have Active Directory credentials and others do not, consider having multiple HTTP configurations at Domino to enable SAML for internal users and regular Domino Internet name and password for others. 


Q6b. So a user using a corporate intranet from say, a hotel room, has to create a VPN connection to the HQ LAN, so that they get a Kerberos token to use against SAML? That might be unworkable for many customers. 
That's a Microsoft Kerberos thing, you don't need SPNEGO at ADFS to use SAML. Login at ADFS can present users with name and password prompt. 
 * Follow-up comment: That's great, we want to have an option for username/password when SAML is not available because for instance a user may use a Windows desktop in one session and an iPad on another day



Q7. When will IBM Notes Traveler authentication work with SAML? Any ETA? 
We do not have a committed time frame to support SAML with Traveler. 


Q8. This is great for Notes client and iNotes, but what about other logins, like logging in to a XPages application? 
If you don't need to access the Notes ID you can use regular Web login via SAML. See technote 7039148 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039148] - "Open Mic Webcast: Configuring an IBM Domino Web server to use SAML-based single sign-on - 14 August 2013 [Presentation, Audio Recording and Q&A]" 

Q9. How does SAML authentication work for non-iNotes use? i.e., logging in to a XPages Web app. 
Instead of seeing a Domino login prompt, users are redirected to ADFS to login, shares assertion with Domino and sets LTPA token just like regular Web SSO. 


Q10. Is it possible to authenticate using personal X.509 certificate? 
That SSL client cert auth option would be configured at the IDP (ADFS) 


Q11. Currently we are using IBM Connections 4.0 configured with SAML SSO and our IDP is Microsoft ADFS. Our IBM Connections is working fine with SAML SSO but there is some issue with the IBM Connections plugin for Lotus Notes and Windows where both plugin are not supported SAML SSO. Does anyone know if there is any progress on this? Or any possible future enhancement on these two plugins? 
We would have to look into this. Based on that description, I can't really figure out what the problem could be. We'd have to make sure that all the pieces would be in place both on the Connections side and the Domino side, with the SAML IDP, and the SSO between those components. Probably would be using the IBM LTPA token session cookie. But beyond that general gist, I can't really offer comments without knowing more about the situation.
