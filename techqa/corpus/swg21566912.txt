Title: IBM Unable to Generate the Reporting Framework after Installing OpenPages 6.0.1 - United States

Text:
framework generation failed port number tomcat apache aurora properties TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Reporting framework generation step fails during installation. 

SYMPTOM
An administrator: 

 *  Opens a supported browser. Go to the OpenPages URL. Logs in with an administrator id. Using the navigation menubar, goes to: Administration -> Reporting Framework -> Generation. Clicks on 'Reporting Framework Generation' link that has a failed entry. Clicks on the 'View Log' button. The status column has entries indicating an authentication errors even though the username and password are correct in the properties files. 



CAUSE
After an administrator double-checks the username and passwords in the framework.properties file within: ..\OpenPages\CommandCenter\conf, it was noticed that port 9080 was still up and running even though the framework service was down. Another process was utilizing the same port number.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Utilize the "netstat" command to see if another process is using the OpenPages Framework Generator port.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Utilizing the "netstat" command, an administrator can identify if a port is actively being used (ie: LISTENING). For example, running "netstat -na | findstr 8080" will show if port 8080 is actively being used. 


On the application server: 

 *  Using notepad, open the aurora.properties which can typically be found in: ..\OpenPages\aurora\conf. Find the cognos framework parameter and update the entry to use an unused port (ie: 8080) Save the changes. Open a command prompt window using the 'Run as administrator' option. Change the directory to be: ..\OpenPages\bin. Run the stopAllServers.cmd to stop the OpenPages services. Once the services are stopped, run the startAllServers.cmd to start the OpenPages services. 

On the Cognos CommandCenter server:  *  Stop the OpenPages Framework Model Generator service. Go to: ..\OpenPages\CommandCenter\apache-tomcat-6.0.26\webapps Delete the 'crf-refresher' folder. Using notepad, open the server.xml for TomCat which can typically be found in: ..\OpenPages\CommandCenter\apacahe-tomcat-6.0.26\conf Modify the file to utilize the updated port number (that was specified in the aurora.properties file). Start the OpenPages Framework Model Generator service. 

Once the configuration files have been updated on both the application server and the reporting server, have an administrator kickoff the framework generation again.
