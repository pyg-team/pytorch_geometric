R&M TCR IBM Spectrum Protect TSM TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What steps are needed to set up emails for the Tivoli Cognos reports bundled with ITM for Tivoli Storage Manager/IBM Spectrum Protect version 7? 

ANSWER
1. Set up SMTP email server using the Cognos Configuration tool. 

For Windows, the Cognos Configuration tool is located in:<JazzSM_install_dir>\reporting\cognos\bin64\tcr_cogconfig.bat 

By default, <JazzSM_install_dir> is C:\Program Files\IBM\JazzSM 

 

From AIX/Linux, the Cognos Configuration tool is located in: 

<JazzSM_install_dir>/reporting/cognos/bin64/tcr_cogconfig.sh 

By default, <JazzSM_install_dir> is /opt/IBM/JazzSM 

Note: This tool is GUI-based so you must log in as a graphical session or use X Windows server to display the GUI. 

 

Once you open the Cognos Configuration tool, click on Data Access -> Notification. Fill in the SMTP email server information.

2. Send a test email.
Login to the DASH and navigate to the Cognos Reports.
Choose any report that you want to do a test run. Run the report.
Once the report finishes running, click Keep this version > Email Report.

Fill in the recipient email addresses that you want to send the test report to. Make sure the check box "Attach the report" is checked.
Wait a few minutes as emails can take time to get to the inbox. The report is sent as an attachment. Make sure the email is not blocked or sent to Trash or Spam folders.


3. Schedule reports to run and send emails.
Go to the Cognos report that you would like to run as a schedule.
Click on the Schedule button.
