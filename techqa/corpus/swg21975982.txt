Title: IBM SPSS Statistics: No concurrent licenses found after a Java update was performed - United States

Text:
SPSS Statistics network license manager; sentinel; java; error WlmAdmin lservrc TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You use concurrent (network) licenses for IBM SPSS Statistics software. The License Manager is installed on a windows operating system and was running fine. The Concurrent Licensing Administrative Tool (WlmAdmin) showed all licenses.

However, after installing Oracle Java Update 8 on the Windows machine, the WlmAdmin does not show any Licenses anymore, although the License file lservrc lists all license codes correctly.

When trying to activate the licenses again, by using the Licenseactivator.exe in a command prompt, the following error appears:

Sentinel Licenseactivator error:
LaunchAnywhere Error: Windows error 2 occured while loading the Java VM 

CAUSE
Windows cannot find Java

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the System Variable "Path" as following: 

1. From the Windows Start menu, right-click the Computer icon and select Properties.
2. Click the Advanced System Settings link in the left side.
3. In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables button near the bottom of that tab.
4. In the Environment Variables window, highlight the Path variable in the "System variables" section and click the Edit button.
Add or modify the path lines with the paths : "C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jre1.8.0_72\bin" (You may cross check the right path in your Program files\Java directory and use the recent one)
*Please note that each different directory is separated with a semicolon (;) so you just need to add a semicolon (;) after the existing path.
5. Relaunch the licenseactivator by CMD (command line install) to re-add your licenses.
