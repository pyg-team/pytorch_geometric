Title: IBM REST API page shows 403 authentication error - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After installing 7.1 or applying a Fix Pack or Interim Fix, in some cases the REST API page may stop accepting logins, instead showing a 403 error.

The System.out log will contain something like this:

[9/29/15 12:12:37:543 EDT] 00000136 LTPAServerObj E SECJ0369E:
Authentication failed when using LTPA. The exception is com.ibm.websphere.security.PasswordCheckFailedException: UserSecurityName "admin" not found on the registry.
[9/29/15 12:15:05:266 EDT] 00000136 WebCollaborat A SECJ0129E: Authorization failed for user OpenPagesAdministrator:OpenPagesRealm
while invoking GET on default_host:grc/api/, Authorization failed, Not granted any of the required roles: OpenPagesApplicationUsers 

CAUSE
Re-deploying certain files in the WebSphere application can occasionally cause security roles to be overwritten.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In WAS Admin Console for OpenPages server (example: http://yourserver:9060/ibm/console or https://yourserver:9043/ibm/console) 

Navigate to: Applications > Application Types > WebSphere Enterprise Applications > op-apps
Go to Detail Properties > Security role to user/group mapping 
There should be a line for: 
Role: OpenPagesApplicationUsers
Special Subjects: All Authenticated in Trusted Realms 
If the Special Subjects is set to "None", then that is the problem and it needs to be corrected. Use the Map Special Subjects button to update the setting back to "All Authenticated in Trusted Realms"
