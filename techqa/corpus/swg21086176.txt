Title: IBM What does the message 'Performing consistency check' mean? - United States

Text:
Domino Server; performing consistency check on database.nsf; server console; consistency check TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
When a Domino server is started, the following message can appear: 

Performing consistency check on database <database>.nsf 

What does this message indicate?


ANSWER
This message is an indication that Domino is performing a consistency check on a Notes database. A consistency check is synonymous with the Fixup server task. Consistency checks are done when a database is found to be in an unknown state, corrupt state, or the integrity is questionable.


 * An unknown state occurs when the database is not closed properly (for example, a server crash or a database file being copied at the operating system level while open, etc.). 
 * A corrupt state can occur in several places. These all relate to bad tables, notes, folders, bitmaps, etc. 
 * Questionable integrity occurs when a database header or index has entries that appear to be invalid.



There is no way to prevent a consistency check from occurring. When Domino performs a consistency check, it is a good thing, because Domino is proactively maintaining the stability of a Notes database.
