ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The client is running WTX 8.0.1 with launcher on Sun, using the
   milti-process option and auto startup.  The client has 6
   launcher processes.  5 of the 6 are small (containing several
   msl files).  The 6th process contains approx. 500 msl files.
   The client is running the Management Console from their Windows
   PC.
   
   When the 6 launcher processes are running and we start the
   Management Console, the 5 smaller processes come back with a
   status of Running but the 6th large process never comes back
   with a final response of Running.  When we check the server, all
   6 processes are running.  When we checked the log files on the
   PC, we see a Java error in the Communication log for the 6th
   process:

   We then stopped all 6 processes and set the Event Server to
   manual startup.  We started the Management Console and
   connected.  All 6 processes show up as stopped.  When we try to
   start even a small process, the Management Console shows
   starting but never comes back with a final response of Started.
   If we check the server, the process has actually started.
   
   Researching prior issues we located what appears to be a
   duplicate issue (Scase# 478010 / Ecase# 97554 / WTXCQ20283).
   The client rep just received a new patched launcher based on
   PMR18461,49R,000 / WTXCQ1517 and WTXCQ16784.  It appears the new
   launcher contains the prior fix but we need to verify.
   
   If the new patched launcher does contain the prior fix, I
   believe we need a new debug launcher with a greater increased
   size for timeout and send buffer size.  The difference between
   the original issue and this issue is the number of msl files
   added to the large process, which may require additional time
   for a response back.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Add a new environment settings for the launcher process that can
   be used to resolve Management Console connection problems in
   cases where the network is slow are there are many (hundreds) of
   msl-s present on the launcher side.
   The setting is:
   TIMEOUT_SLOWNET
   And valid range is 30s to 300s, default 30s
