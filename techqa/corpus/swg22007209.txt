CVEID: CVE-2017-0247 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0247]
DESCRIPTION: Microsoft ASP.NET Core is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by improper validation of web requests in the TextEncoder.EncodeCore function. By inserting specially-crafted content into any system using the function to encode content, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to prevent any page delivering the content from loading.
CVSS Base Score: 3.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125297 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125297] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2017-1000381 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000381]
DESCRIPTION: c-ares could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the ares_parse_naptr_reply() function when parsing NAPTR responses. By sending specially crafted DNS response packet, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read memory outside of the given input buffer and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect ASP.NET Core in IBM Bluemix v1.0.20 and earlier releases.

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf ssh <appname> -c cat staging_info.yml

Look for the following lines:
{"detected_buildpack":"ASP.NET Core (buildpack-v1.xxx)","start_command":"cd . \u0026\u0026 dotnet dotnetstarter.dll --server.urls http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}" [http://0.0.0.0:$%7Bport%7D'/]}

If the buildpack version is not at least v1.0.22 your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
You will need to restage (or re-push) your application using the ASP.NET Core Buildpack v1.0.22.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None.
