ABSTRACT
 CICS Transaction Server (CICS TS) Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V2.0 general availability (GA) date was 16 August 2013. This document contains a summary of the feature pack, a link to the announcement letter, and additional ways that you can become familiar with this enhancement. 

CONTENT
The CICS Transaction Server Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting is reengineered to support PHP applications that run inside the CICS web container of CICS TS V5.1 and V5.2. This enables PHP scripts to be included in enterprise-class mixed language CICS application services.

The CICS web container, based on WebSphere Liberty Profile technology, now includes the capability for PHP scripts to run alongside JavaServer Pages (JSPs) and Javaâ„¢ Servlets. PHP applications in CICS can directly call other Java OSGi application components and can access other CICS programs and resources using the Java class library (JCICS) API.

Additionally, PHP applications can now be managed through standard CICS processes. This augments the inherent flexibility of the PHP language with enterprise-class CICS lifecycle management capabilities. This includes the ability for PHP scripts to be managed as part of the new CICS Cloud deployment model.

To use the CICS TS Feature Pack for Dynamic Scripting V2.0, you must have the correct version of software and service installed. For more details and a full list of prerequisites see Dynamic scripting prerequisites [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.dynamicscripting.doc/topics/prereq.html] in the CICS TS 5.1 product documentation or Dynamic scripting prerequisites [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.dynamicscripting.doc/topics/prereq.html] in the CICS TS 5.2 product documentation.

Some functions that were supported in previous versions of the Dynamic Scripting feature pack are discontinued in version 2.0: 

 * WebSphere sMash technology is no longer used. 
 * The Groovy language is no longer supported. 
 * Apache Ivy is no longer used to manage the CICS Dynamic Scripting native modules.
