 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Some queries run faster when bind variables are used in filters and others show better performance without them.

Is it possible to control if Bind Variables are used in Cognos generated SQL? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM Cognos will sometimes use bind variables in the SQL it generates and sometimes it will use parameter markers particularly in the cases of master-detail relationships, reports with prompts, and some model elements such as join or filter expressions that contain prompts. Also, in some of these cases, a parameter value is used rather than the parameter marker itself. Cognos will use whatever it believes will result in the fastest, correct results.
There is no setting to control when bind variables are used and when they aren't. The usage of bind variables is controlled by Cognos internal logic algorithm and there is no way for users to exercise any control over that.

If bind variables are absolutely required or shouldn't be used for any particular queries and Cognos is or isn't using them in the SQL it generates on its own, then custom Pass-Through SQL or a stored procedure can be used by the reports that need it.
