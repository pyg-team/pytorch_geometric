APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Duplicate interview responses will be created if a custodian
   clicks on the link from the interview notice multiple times and
   accidentally responds to each of the questionnaires that are
   opened. When the link is clicked it will open up a separate
   browser window/tab for the interview questionnaire. The
   application will accept the responses from each questionnaire.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Multiple interview responses are recorded from the same person
   for the same interview. When users click their email hold
   interview URL multiple times, they can submit multiple interview
    responses for the same interview. The administrative user might
    see multiple entries in the CONFIRMATION_LOGGING table from the
    same person for the same interview.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Atlas Suite now records only the first response from a
   person for each interview. You get an error submitting more than
    once.
   The fix is now avaialble from Fix Central in fix pack 6.0.1.6
