Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If Internet Explorer 8 or 9 is used for remote HMC access, the Hardware Management Console may not function correctly. To resolve the issue, enable the IE "Compatibility View" option. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 8 and IE 9) are supported in HMC Version 7.7.6 and later. Internet Explorer 8 and 9 are not supported for use with remote access to HMC Version 7.7.5 and earlier. Although not supported, a circumvention is to run in compatibility mode as described below. For further information on HMC remote access browser requirements, refer to the HMC Readme:

7.7.6: http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/firmware/readme?fixid=MH01326#browser [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/firmware/readme?fixid=MH01326#browser]
7.7.5: http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/firmware/readme?fixid=MH01311#browser [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/firmware/readme?fixid=MH01311#browser]

Compatibility mode for HMC Version 7.7.5 and earlier
If IE is not set for compatibility mode, potential problems include screen refresh issues such as a blank navigation panel as shown below. To resolve the issue enable compatibility mode. This can be enabled by clicking on the "torn page" Compatibility icon circled in yellow.

To permanently run the HMC in compatibility mode, click the IE menu option for Tools, Compatibility View Settings. Enter the HMC hostname/ipaddress and click Add. If the HMC falls under the intranet zone rules, the "Display Intranet sites in compatibility view" can be also used.
