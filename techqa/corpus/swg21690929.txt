CAUSE
This is a problem that occurs with IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) agents. ITM has documented a work-around until a fix pack can be released, and the same work-around is needed to install the OMEGAMON XE on z/VM and Linux agent.


ENVIRONMENT
OMEGAMON XE on z/VM and Linux 4.3.0 FP1 and earlier



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7 support requires additional steps and/or prerequisites before installing IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3.0 Fix Pack 5 


Note: There is an issue with the compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-71.el7 version that currently ships with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7 that affects agents on platforms pSeries and zSeries and some 32 bit agents on x86_64. Until Red Hat provides an update the compat-libstdc++-33.xxx libraries from Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6.4 or later should be used.

- IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3.0 Fix Pack 5 is upgrade install only. In order to initially install IBM Tivoli Monitoring, obtain the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3.0 Fix Pack 2 pristine installation media. (See Download IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.3.0.2).

- Before installing from the V6.3.0.2 media, run the following from the command line:

setarch $(uname -m) --uname-2.6

Note: This will put you in a special shell where "uname -r" should show "2.6.xxxx" for kernel version

- Install and configure IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3.0 Fix Pack 2. You will get a prerequisites failure for the Operating System, but you can ignore the failure and continue installation. Once complete you can now exit from the special shell (just type exit on the command line) and then upgrade to 6.3.0 Fix Pack 5 as per normal upgrade install.

Note: Remote Deploy of 6.3.0 Fix Pack 5 OS agent should work without any special steps but the compat-libstdc++-33.xxx issue still applies for pSeries and zSeries.
