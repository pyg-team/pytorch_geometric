QUESTION
 In SWIFT mapping, what is the purpose of the FindObjectName function and where can the value of error1 be found? 

ANSWER


For SWIFT rule libraries error reporting is done using the cerror function. The cerror function takes two arguments: cerror(errorCode, fieldName).
Error descriptions are localized based on the errorCode parameter passed to cerror. The translator takes the errorCode and resolves the description to report using the SWIFTMessages_2008_en.properties file. SWIFT error codes have names such as Tnn, Cnn, Dnn, Enn. The map editor documentation provides the mappings between numeric error codes and the equivalent SWIFT error code.
FindObjectName must be called from the extended rule instead of the rule library function because rule library functions are “detached” from the map structure. FindObjectName resolves the unique field name to be reported as an error. For example, “E:57A” may resolve to the unique name “57A:3”. FindObjectName allows rules to continue working when new versions of SWIFT are released that may change the structure of the maps, and subsequently the field names.
In summary:
1) Use FindObjectName from an extended rule to pass as field name parameters that will be written to the translation report.
2) cerror takes two arguments. First argument is the error code that maps to a SWIFT-specific error code. Second argument is a unique field name that was resolved using FindObjectName in the extended rule.
