APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ADMIN_CMD manages the message files on server by unique
   operation ids, and corresponding unique message names.
   
   The random_number in operation id (<random_number>_<userid>)
   would be values in the range of 0-32767 on AIX and Windows
   system.
   This lack of variety on the operation id can cause the following
   issues.
   
   a) Infinite loop in admcmdCreateNewMsgFile()
   
   Once utility message path (sqllib/tmp by default) is filled by
   32767 number of message files, the function keeps looping to
   look for unique id (but never find).
   In this case, admin_cmd(EXPORT, IMPORT or LOAD) never returns to
   caller, and db2fmp consumes high CPU time.
   
   b) Duplicate operation id.
   
   DB2 intends to use unique operation id, but concurrent execution
   of the ADMIN_CMD()s can exploit a timing hole to use duplicate
   operation id. And Subsequent ADMIN_REMOVE_MSGS() will fail with
   SQL20193N rc=10 due to the duplicate operation id.
   
   This defect will fix these issues by using more wide variety of
   and non-duplicate operation id.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Please remove message files in the utility file path (sqllib/tmp
   or specified by DB2_UTIL_MSGPATH).
