   window
   
   
   Environment:
   
   IBM WebSphere Application Sphere 6.1
   Scheduler 7.1.0.0
   Oil And Gas 7.1.1.0
   Common PMP 7.1.1.6
   Base Services 7.1.1.6
   Linux 2.6.9-67.EL
   
   
   Steps to reproduce;
   
   Reproduced on both core 7115 and 7116 as well as WOTRACK (Oil)
   7110:
   
   1)Go to workorder tracking (Oil)
   2)Create a new workorder 1335

   Changes?" is ticked and Accepts Charges?" is ticked
   4)Go to header "Multiple Assets, Locations and CI's" and click
   "Select" button
   5)Get "Select Locations"
   6)Tick boxes e.g L430 OPERATING type, L3100 OPERATING type and
   MILLER LABOR type
   7)Notice you may get system message BMXAA2663E - Location MILLER
   is not a valid location.Select a non decommissioned location.
   8)Therefore untick MILLER LABOR type box
   9)Click ok
   10)Notice now in header "Multiple Assets, Locations and CI's"
   that both L430 and L3100 are showing twice each in the rows.
   11)There is a bug in the system which leads to duplicate records
   being
   added to the Multiple Assets,  Locations and CI's table.  This
   occurs
   in the following applications screens (Work Order, Jobplans,
   Activities
   and Tasks)
   
   Client needs to have it fixed on core Maximo 7116 with O&G 7110!
