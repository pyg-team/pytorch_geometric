APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When default.kd4.enabled=true in the KK3.dc.properties file and
   ITCAM for SOA is not installed, the user exit still tries to
   monitor the KD4.dc.properties file.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users with the Data Collector for WebSphere
   * Message Broker (K3) active on message flows where the
   * default.kd4.enabled property is set to true in the
   * KK3.dc.properties configuration file when ITCAM for SOA is not
   * installed.
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Data Collector for WebSphere Message
   * Broker (K3) reports the following message in the trace log:
   * stat failed on file /config/KD4.dc.properties (rc=-1)
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Update the default.kd4.enabled property
   * in the KK3.dc.properties configuration file to be set to
   * false.
   * Final recommendation is to apply Fix pack 1 when it is
   * available.
   ****************************************************************
   
   When the Data Collector for WebSphere Message Broker is active
   on message flows and is configured with default.kd4.enabled=
   true in the KK3.dc.properties file, the KK3UserExit tries to
   monitor the ITCAM for SOA KD4.dc.properties configuration file
   for changes even when ITCAM for SOA has not been installed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When the Data Collector for WebSphere Message Broker is
   configured with the default.kd4.enabled property set to true,
   the KK3UserExit will now check to see if ITCAM for SOA is
   installed before monitoring the ITCAM for SOA KD4.dc.properties
   configuration file.
