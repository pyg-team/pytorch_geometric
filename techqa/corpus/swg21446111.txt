Title: IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 might not recognize AIX V7.1 as a supported operating system - United States

Text:
AIX 7.1; AIX71Cert TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you install IBM WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 on a machine running the IBM AIX Version 7.1 operating system, you might encounter a failed operating system prerequisites error. This document explains how to address the issue without setting the disableOSPrereqChecking option value to true. 

SYMPTOM
The following error information might display: 


Failed : Your operating system failed the prerequisites check. 
A supported operating system was not detected. Support for your operating system might have been added after the release of the product. You can continue with the installation, but the installation might not succeed.

If you install the product silently, you might encounter the following error message:

Process, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.
MaintenancePrereqCheckAction, wrn, 
To disable operating system prerequisite checking, set option 
disableOSPrereqChecking to true, or refer to the "Operating 
System Prerequisite Checking" section in the sample response 
file.


CAUSE
 AIX Version 7.1 is a newly supported operating system for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1. The maintenance.xml file might not list AIX Version 6.1 as a supported operating system.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the following steps to update WebSphere Application Server, Application Client for WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Server, or the Web server plug-in. 

 1. Remove the temporary log directories that might have been created by previous installations. 
    
    If you do not remove the log files, you might encounter messages from previous installations. Remove the following directories:  * user_home/waslogs
       
       
     * user_home/plglogs
       
       
     * user_home/cltlogs
       
       
     * user_home/ihslogs
       
       
    
    
 2. Copy the image to a temporary directory if you are installing WebSphere Application Server from a CD or DVD.
    
    
    Note: Ensure that you are using the installation images from 2009 rather than the original V6.1 installation images from 2006 that you might have on physical media. The IBM Passport Advantage web site has the 2009 images. 
    
    
 3. Make a backup copy of the maintenance.xml file.
    
    
    You can find the existing maintenance.xml files in the following locations on your system:  * WebSphere Application Server: temp_directory/WAS/was.primary.pak/
       
       
     * Application Client for WebSphere Application Server: temp_directory/AppClient/client.primary.pak/
       
       
     * IBM HTTP Server: temp_directory/IHS/ihs.primary.pak/ 
       
       
     * Web server plug-in: temp_directory/Plugin/plg.primary.pak/
       
       
    
    
 4. Copy the appropriate maintenance.xml file from the following table and overwrite the original file in the temporary directory.
    
    
    Note: The Product Edition column within the following table refers to the product edition for your WebSphere Application Server-related product and not the system processor type.

 5. Start the installation interface or the silent installation process.
    
    


Notes:  * After you complete these steps, update your WebSphere Application Server installation to Version 6.1 Fix Pack 9 or later so that you are at a supported level when you use AIX Version 7.1.
   
   
 * If you receive a system prerequisite warning when you install the Update Installer, ignore the warning and proceed with the installation of the Update Installer. 
   
   
 * If you encounter a system prerequisite warning when you install a feature pack for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1, ignore the warning and proceed with the installation process.
