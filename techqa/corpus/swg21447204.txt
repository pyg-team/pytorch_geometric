Title: IBM Testing Information Services Connections fails with: Validation Error : Attempt to contact Hostname:31531 failed. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to configure DataStage and QualityStage as a provider for Information Services using the Information Server Console. When I click the "Test" button of the "DSServer" screen I get the following error:

Validation Error : Attempt to contact Hostname:31531 failed. 

CAUSE
This error message is indicating that the the connection with the Agent running on port 31531 was not successful. The most common causes of this error are: 

 * The agent is not running 
 * The agent is running but in a different port 
 * There is a firewall blocking this port

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem check the following: 


 

 1. That the ASB agent is up and running. You can check the status of the agent by running the command: 
    
    ps -ef|grep -i agent
    
    this should show at least 2 processes (LoggingAgentSocketImpl and AgentImpl). For an explanation about how to start the agent please refer to the online documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iisinfsv/v8r1/topic/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.ia.faq.doc/topics/ia_faq_config.html?resultof=%22%6e%6f%64%65%41%67%65%6e%74%73%2e%73%68%22%20#ia_faq_config__config_restart_asb]. 
 2. That the port in which DataStage Engine is running is correct in the screen where you configure the Services Connection in the Information Server Console. You can check what port you need to use by inspecting the /etc/services with the command:
    
    grep dsrpc /etc/services
    
    Make sure that this is the same port used in the Server Console. By default this is 31538. Please note that this port is not the one mentioned in the error message which refers to the port for the ASB Agent (i.e. 31531). 
    
 3. Make sure that there are no firewalls blocking any of the ports used by Information Server. You can get a list of ports in this link [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iisinfsv/v8r1/topic/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.productization.iisinfsv.install.doc/topics/wsisinst_pln_networks.html].
    
 4. Make sure that you have installed Information Service Director (ISD). You can review the Version.xml file and see if you have the key="informationserver" under the <Products> section. This key appears only if you have installed ISD, if you don't have it then ISD has not been installed. 
    
 5. Make sure that you have installed the latest FixPack for the version of Information Server you are using. Earlier releases of 8.0.1 required at least FixPack 1a for the ISD to work properly.
