APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Multiple EGs abend on startup while MQ is unavailable.
   When MQ is stopped under the broker, the execution groups
   come down, but are then restarted even if MQ is still
   unavailable. Multiple EGs will attempt to communicate via
   the internal messageflows using MQ and abend on their
   restart attempts when this is not available. The correct
   behaviour when MQ is down is that the EGs should only be
   restarted when MQ is back up and running.

   ****************************************************************
   When the queue manager is stopped under the broker, the
   execution groups come down, but are then restarted even if the
   queue manager is still unavailable. Multiple execution groups
   will attempt to communicate via the internal messageflows
   using WebSphere MQ, and abend during their restart attempts
   when this is not available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the
   execution groups will only be restarted when the queue manager
   is available.
