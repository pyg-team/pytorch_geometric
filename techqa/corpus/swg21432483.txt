Title: IBM The Tivoli Federated Identity Manager silent install requires the user to accept the license agreement - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The silent install for Tivoli Federated Identity Manager requires the user to accept the license agreement. 

SYMPTOM
The Tivoli Federated Identity Manager silent installation fails. The installer log file contains the following error: 
"...com.ibm.lex.lap.isje.LAPanel, err, License not accepted."

CAUSE
The user has not accepted the license agreement. During a silent install, the LAPanel bean verifies the user has accepted the license agreement by checking the value of the licenseAccepted InstallShield option. This option needs to be specified as a command-line parameter when the installer is launched or in the silent install response file.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The silent install for Tivoli Federated Identity Manager 6.2.1 requires the user to configure the licenseAccepted option to confirm acceptance of the license agreement. During a silent install, the LAPanel bean will check the response file or command line for the following entry:
“-G licenseAccepted=<value>” 

The installation will throw an error if this value is not true.

You can specify the value for this option as either:


 * A command-line parameter. To accept the license agreement you can include the -G licenseAccepted=true option when the installer is launched. 


OR 
 * A configured option in the silent install response file. That is, to accept the license agreement and proceed with the install, you can include the following entry on a separate line: -G licenseAccepted=true
