QUESTION
 How do you modify the list of security tests in a pre-defined test policy of the IBM Security AppScan Enterprise? 

ANSWER
You can modify the Test Policies using the AppScan Standard product, or manually by editing an XML file which represents the test policy contents. 

 1. Login into AppScan Enterprise Console with a user having administration permissions in AppScan Enterprise, and navigate to Administration > Security Test Policies .
    
    
 2. Click the test policy which needs to be modified, and click Export to export the selected test policy to an XML file (see the screen capture below).
    
    
 3. Modify that Test Policy with AppScan Standard. Import, modify and export them in the AppScan Standard > Configuration > Test Policy dialog. 
    
    Note: You do not need to have an AppScan Standard license to modify a Test Policy. 
    Note: The AppScan Standard product is shipped together with the AppScan Enterprise product version 9.0.3.0 (or later). You can find the AppScan Standard installation file, AppScan_Setup.exe, in: C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\AppScan Enterprise\WebApp\Downloads:
    
    You can also modify the test policies (in an .xml file) manually by using a text editor (like Notepad). However this method is prone for errors and it should be avoided. 
    
    
 4. Return to the browser window with the Edit Advanced Security Test Policy page in AppScan Enterprise Console, Re-import the modified XML file (see the screen capture below), and click Save to validate the import.
