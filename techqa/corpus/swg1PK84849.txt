APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  serializeStates(AOMSState*) const':
   MyBlock.cpp:40: error: `rootState_serializeStates' undeclared
   (first use this function)
   
   MyBlock.cpp:40: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported
   only once for each function it appears in.)
   
   make: *** [MyBlock.o] Error 1
   
   
   If I remove the 'evGo' reception from the block and change the
   trigger to 'tm(1000)' the code builds and executes correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No Known Workarounds
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The customer can create a model with two classes, one class with
   a statechart containing two states with a transition event. The
   other class with an activity diagram containing two actions and
   an activity flow with an event trigger. Both of these function
   without error.
   
   Now, if the customer creates a SysML model with two blocks, one
   block with a statechart containing two states with a transition
   event. The other block with an activity diagram containing two
   actions and an activity flow with an event trigger. The state
   chart works correctly but the code for the activity diagram
   produces the following error:
