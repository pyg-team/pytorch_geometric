Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Security Access Manager for Web is affected by multiple NTP vulnerabilities - United States

Text:
PSIRT SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source.

IBM Security Access Manager for Web uses NTP and is affected by multiple NTP vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-9297 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9297]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Project NTP daemon (ntpd) could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by insufficient entropy in PRNG. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the IPv6 address ::1 to bypass ACLs and launch further attacks on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100004 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100004] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-9298 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9298]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Project NTP daemon (ntpd) could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the improper validation of the length value in extension field pointers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100005 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100005] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-1798 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1798]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Project NTP daemon (ntpd) could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of packets that do not contain a message authentication code (MAC) as valid packets wen configured for symmetric key authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to bypass the authentication process.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102051 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102051] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1799 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1799]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Project NTP daemon (ntpd) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error when using symmetric key authentication. By sending specially-crafted packets to both peering hosts, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to prevent synchronization.
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102052 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/102052] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-3405 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3405]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the generation of MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems by the ntp-keygen utility. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the generated MD5 keys to spoof an NTP client or server.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/104387 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/104387] for the current score
