PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to use the IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) Eclipse client results in a crash with a GPF error, exit code=8096. 

SYMPTOM
The Rational Team Concert Eclipse client may crash with a GPF and return the following error. 



Java was started but returned exit code=8096 

C:\Program Files\IBM\TeamConcert_4.0.4\jdk\jre\bin\javaw.exe

CAUSE
There is a JVM option that improves performance by allowing multiple Java-based applications to share compiled classes. If there is something already in this cache, such as an old class from an earlier JVM, it can cause Eclipse to crash with a GPF. 


For more information on the sharedclasses option see this document on the Java Command Line Options [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.doc.user.lnx.60%2Fdiag%2Fappendixes%2Fcmdline%2FXshareclasses.html]


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue perform one of the following: 

 

 * Comment out the -Xshareclasses:name=IBMSDP_%u value in the eclipe.ini file. 
   This file will be found in the same directory as the eclipse.exe executable.
   
   OR: 
   
   
 * Attempt to delete the existing cache directory.
   This folder can be found in the following location on Microsoft Windows 7 and later:
   C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\javasharedresources\ 



If this does not resolve the issue, send the following data to IBM Rational Support for analysis. 
 *  A screen shot of the error message. Any snap*, core*, and javacore* files that were created due to the crash A copy of the eclipse.ini file
