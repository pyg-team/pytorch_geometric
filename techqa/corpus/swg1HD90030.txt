   Additional Closure Information:
   Incident Diagnosis
   .
   Drafting(IntDraft) / No font style applicable for Arial Unicode
   .
   Reason
   .
   Unless the styled(bold/italic/bold-italic) version
   of the selected font(Arial Unicode in this case) is available on
   system or
   CATIA's Font Installation directory , It will not
   be shown in the styled manner.
   Current behavior is comparable to R17 behavior. (
   Even in this case also behavior is similar and
   need not be identical)
   We do not match behavior of font with MSWord.
   As MSWord is specialized software for Text Editing
   , it uses special algorithm ( Non standard across
   different platforms we support) to handle these
   and many other special cases. As we support
   multiple platforms, we do not match behavior with
   MSWord
   .
