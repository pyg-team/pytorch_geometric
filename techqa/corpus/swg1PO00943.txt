ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Curam Universal Access customers who are implementing
   SecurityStrategy as part of an effort to integrate with
   external authentication systems may encounter the following
   scenario.
   
   A user attempts a login via the Universal Access Logon Screen
   but enters an incorrect password. The desired behavior is that
   the user remains on the logon page and an error is displayed
   informing the user that their username or password is
   incorrect. Instead of this there are some circumstances where
   their session is terminated and they are redirected to a
   generic logonerror.jsp page. A user half way through entering
   information will, therefore lose their work.
   
   This falls outside of the clients expected UA user experience.
   
   To prevent this a customer might consider updating their
   SecurityStrategy logic to call their external authentication
   system webservice to authenticate the user rather than just
   verifying their existence.
   
   At present this solution is not possible because the password
   passed into SecurityStrategy is currently encrypted.
   
   In this scenario a customer would require a plain text password
   be passed.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This has been addressed in V6.0.4.0 iFix9.
   Release Note:
   Two new objects have been added to the transaction scope (via
   TransactionInfo.setFacadeScopeObject) for login processing.
   The two objects are:
       A boolean object with the value "true" and a key of
   SecurityStrategy.kCuramCWIsLoginPage.
       A String object with a value of the user provided password
   and a key of SecurityStrategy.kCuramCWNonEncryptedPassword.
   A custom implementation of SecurityStrategy can access these
   object via the TransactionInfo.getInfo().getFacadeScopeObject
   key.
