QUESTION
 The default password does not fulfil corporate security requirements. 

CAUSE
The default password is blank

ANSWER
Looking into guides for this third party software shows HSQLDB command line capability as being: 

 * 
 * SET PASSWORD
 * 
 * 
 * SET PASSWORD <password>;
 * 
 * 
 * Changes the password of the currently connected user. Password must be double quoted. Empty password can be set using "".


An example of changing the password in HSQLDB as above by connecting to the database: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


and issuing the command: 

 * 


quitting: 

 * 


and logging back in with the new password: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


The above example login uses the default ImpactServer name (NCI) and HSQLDB port number (5435). The default password is blank. 

One will have to edit the HSQLDB DataSource to enable it to connect to the database with the new password. 

A) One method is by encrypting the password and editing the HSQLDB DataSource to allow DSA connection. Use nci_crypt to encrypt the password - for example: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


edit the file: 

 * 


to alter the property: 

 * 


from the default value of {aes}9C71E0F544E705326E2B5CBDFC54CE46 to the new encrypted password value - for example: 

 * 


This requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. 

B) An alternate method is to edit the DataSource via the normal Impact configuration GUI and provide the new password there. This alternate method has the advantage that one does not need to perform the encryption oneself, nor does one need to manually edit the configuration file and nor does one need to perform an ImpactServer restart to read up the new configuration into the memory resident database that is the ImpactServer.
