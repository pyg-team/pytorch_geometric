Title: IBM Unable to start the ObjectServer - United States

Text:

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Failed to start the storage system 

SYMPTOM
ObjectServer doesn't start and the log file shows errors: 

Error: E-OBJ-102-020: Failed to start the storage system. (2:No such file or directory)
Error: E-IPC-005-001: OpenServer - Error: 16334/10/0: SRV_START event aborted srv_run
Error: E-STK-102-014: [nstk]: BOB: Failed to start server processing loop. (-19:General failure)


CAUSE
The ObjectServer is in the interfaces file but the ObjectServer itself wasn't created.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Go to $OMNIHOME/bin and run nco_dbinit -server BOB to create the Object Server. Once that runs successfully you should then be able to start the Object Server named BOB.
