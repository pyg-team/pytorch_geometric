ABSTRACT
 The procedures described in this technote can be used to force additional debug information for the Meeting Room Client and the Broadcast Client to be logged to the browser Java console on the user's workstation. The information in this document applies to Sametime 7.5.1 and earlier. 

CONTENT
Important notes: 

 * The Javaâ„¢ console must be enabled on the user's workstation for the debug to be created. 
 * For Sametime 8.0 servers, the following steps are not required. Beginning in 8.0, the debug is turned on from the server-side automatically. Any user, with no prior setup on their end, can open the Java console and obtain that Meeting Room Client debug information.






Turn on Debugging for a Single Client Workstation On the client workstation where you want to log additional debug information, complete the following steps: 

1. Determine the name of the Java home directory on the workstation. The Java home directory is displayed in the Java console when entering a Sametime meeting. Look for an entry similar to the following in the Java console: 

Java Plug-in 1.5.0_06
Using JRE version 1.5.0_06 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
User home directory = C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator

In this case, the Java home directory is C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator


2. Save the attached (below) Diagnostics.properties file in the Java home directory on the client. 

3. Restart your browser in order for the changes to take effect. Additional debug information for the Meeting Room Client and the Broadcast Client will now be logged to the browser Java console. 

4. When Debugging is complete, you can do either one of the following: 

 * Remove the diagnostics.properties file from the Java home directory on the client workstation, or 
 * Edit the diagnostics.properties file in the Java home directory and change the diagnostic settings back to false. 


5. Restart your browser in order for the changes to take effect. 





Turn on Debugging for all Meeting Room clients 

1. Find and edit the Diagnostics.Properties file. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21086819&amp;aid=1] Where to find Diagnostics.Properties file Windows servers iSeries servers Meeting Room Clients Located in the following subdirectory of the Sametime server data directory:

..\domino\html\sametime\
stmeetingroomclient\
STMRCResxx\properties

(where xx is the release of Sametime) Find the diagnostics.Properties file by doing the following:  * Type the WRKDOMSVR command on any OS/400 command line, then press Enter. 
 * Type option 12 (Work object links) next to the name of the Sametime server and press Enter. 
 * Page Down to find the domino directory, then use option 5 (Display) to show the next level of the directory structure. 
 * Repeat this process to advance through the directories until you find the directory containing Diagnostics.properties, which is: <server_data_dir>/
   domino/html/sametime/
   stmeetingroomclient/
   STMRCResxx/properties
   
   

 * 
 * xx
 * 


Type option 2 (Edit) next to diagnostics.properties and press Enter. Broadcast Clients Located in the following subdirectory of the Sametime server data directory:

\Lotus\Domino\data\domino\html\sametime\stbroadcastclient.


or, for releases prior to 7.5.1:

..\domino\html\sametime\
stbroadcastclient\stbccresxx\
properties
(where xx is your release of Sametime) Find the diagnostics.Properties file by doing the following:  * Type the WRKDOMSVR command on any OS/400 command line, then press Enter. 
 * Type option 12 (Work object links) next to the name of the Sametime server and press Enter. 
 * Page Down to find the domino directory, then use option 5 (Display) to show the next level of the directory structure. 
 * Repeat this process to advance through the directories until you find the directory containing Diagnostics.properties, which is: <server_data_dir>/domino/
   html/sametime/stbroadcastclient/
   
   


Type option 2 (Edit) next to diagnostics.properties and press Enter. 
2. Change each of the following settings to true: 

If Debugging the Meeting Room Client:
MRCNotifyEnabled=false
MRCWarningEnabled=false 
MRCTraceEnabled=false 

If Debugging the Broadcast Client:
BCNotifyEnabled=false
BCWarningEnabled=false
BCTraceEnabled=false 

On the iSeries, press F3 twice to save the changes. You do not need to restart the Sametime server. 

3. When debugging is complete, set the values back to false. 







How to obtain javalog.txt debug information on the client 

To enable and obtain debug information (Microsoft VM) 1. On a client machine, start Internet Explorer. From the Tools menu, choose Internet Options. 
2. On the Advanced panel, scroll down to the Microsoft VM group and select "Java logging enabled" and "Java console enabled." Click OK. 
3. Close and relaunch the browser. Activity is written to c:\winnt\java\javalog.txt for Windows 2000 and c:\windows\java\javalog.txt for Windows XP. 
4. On the client machine, login and recreate the problem. 
5. While IE is still open you can view the java console under View -> Java Console, or you can search for the JAVALOG.TXT file (typically in the c:\WINNT\Java directory). 
6. Save and send the console text or the javalog.txt file to Support. 


To enable and obtain debug information (Sun JVM) Open Internet Explorer and select Tools -> Sun Java Console. 
Additionally, the Sun Console can be automatically launched by the Windows Control Panel. 
1. Click Start -> Settings -> Control Panel. 
2. Locate and open the correct Java Plug-in being used for the connections (there may be several based on the number of version of the JVM installed). 
3. On the Advanced tab, check the radio button to Show Console under Settings -> Java Console and click Apply. 

The console should launch automatically, but you can still view the console under the Tools -> Sun Java Console menu. Save and send this console information to Support. 

Note: To automatically pipe the debugs to a text file when using Sun JVM: 
Trigger the "o" (letter "O") option within the java console; toggle it to "true...completed." 

You should then see the trace file being populated under the \Sun\Java\Deployment\log folder. 

Location: <your home Java folder> (or my documents)\Application Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\log 
Example: c:\documents and settings\administrator\application data\sun\java\deployment\log will hold a plugin*.trace file. Opening it up with Notepad, you will see the contents of the trace/debug. 

In cases where browser and Java Console crashes before you can see any debugs, please output the trace to a text file per above and submit to IBM Technical Support. 





Send the diagnostic information to IBM Support 

Follow instructions to send diagnostic information to IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571], and be sure to provide all diagnostic information captured above. This requires that a PMR be opened if not already. 

Refer to the detailed instructions in the Technote " Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]" to make the information available and to update your problem record.
