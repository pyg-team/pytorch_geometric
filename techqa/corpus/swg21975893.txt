 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There is a vulnerability in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition,Version 6.0, 7.0 that is used by IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Transactions. This vulnerability, commonly referred to as “SLOTH”, was disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2016. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

7.3 IV81569 FixCentral link [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=isg400002530] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For CVE-2015-7575: 

Users of Java 7 and later can address the issue by updating the /jre/lib/security/java.security file as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Java 6 requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading the JDK is the only solution.
