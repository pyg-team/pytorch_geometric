ABSTRACT
 Collecting troubleshooting data for the IBM Web Content Manager (WCM) library Java Content Repository (JCR) export/import expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. 

CONTENT
If you already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below for the available methods of data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal 7.0. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21444911] 

WCM library Java Content Repository (JCR) export/import information
This document describes how to collect data for problems related to using the JCR Export/Import of a (WCM) Library in WebSphere Portal. Gathering this information before calling IBM Support will help to understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. 



Manual collection of troubleshooting data I. Enabling trace logging 
Enable tracing during problem recreation in order to investigate the specific behavior of the component(s). Choose to enable either static or dynamic tracing and proceed with the steps accordingly. For further information regarding logging and tracing in the portal, refer to the System event logging [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/System_event_logging_wp7] [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc/trouble/pd_intr_logs.html] topic in the WebSphere Portal Information Center. Please note that the traces need to be enabled on BOTH the syndicator and subscriber servers. 

Option A: Enabling static (extended) tracing 
Static tracing is the recommended method of capturing data, as it collects data from server startup until problem recreation. 

1. Log into the Integrated Solutions Console as the WebSphere Application Server administrator. 
2. Click Troubleshooting->Logs and Trace->WebSphere_Portal->Diagnostic Trace. 
3. On the Configuration tab, ensure Enable Log is selected. On this same tab, ensure you increase the Maximum File Size and Maximum Number of Historical Files as needed to ensure that the tracing of the problem recreation is not overwritten due to the amount of traffic on the system and output of the tracing itself. 
4. Click Change Log Level Details and enter the following trace string: *com.ibm.icm.jcr.command.*=all 
5. Click OK and save the changes. 
6. Restart the WebSphere_Portal application server. 

Option B: Enabling dynamic tracing 
Dynamic tracing can be used for situations that do not permit a server restart. 

1. Log in as the Portal administrator. 
2. Click Administration->Portal Analysis->Enable Tracing. 
3. Type the required trace string into the "Append these trace settings" field:  * 

4. Click the Add icon. Enable Tracing updates the "Current trace settings" field.  * NOTE 1: 
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE 2: 
 * 

5. Run the wpcollector tool to collect the logs and traces on BOTH source and target servers: 

To run the collector, issue the command, \WebSpherePortalServer\bin\wpcollector.sh \ bat. 
The output is located in /WebSphere/wp_profile/filesForAutoPD/wp.mustgather.year.day.time.zip 

Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21201571].
