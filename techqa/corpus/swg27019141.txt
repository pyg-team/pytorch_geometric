 PRODUCT README

ABSTRACT
 This document lists the known issues for the IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr Version 1.1 Fix Pack 1.0 release. 

CONTENT
 

The following known issues exist:


 * The IBM Lotus Quickr documents with property sheet values that contain extended characters cannot be published to FileNet P8 repository.

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * If using WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1.0.11, 6.1.0.27 , or 7.0.0.7, WebSphere fails to perform retry for requests that are made through ORB communication. 

 * 
 * 
 *  Install the fix pack from Support site [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg24025002]. Update WebSphere Application Server Version to Version 6.1.0.31, or Version 7.0.0.9. 
 * The uninstaller program is located in the Uninstall directory under the IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr installation directory. If you ran the installer by using the default locale, English, the uninstaller program is named Uninstall-FileNetQuickrServices-1.1.0.1.exe. However, if you ran the installer by using any other locale, the uninstaller is called Uninstall-FileNetQuickrServices-1.1. There is no difference in the behavior of the uninstaller program. To find the version of IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr that you have installed, open the version.txt file in the installation directory. The version.txt file lists the current version number, for example product.version=v1.1.0.1. 
 * In the Lotus Quickr desktop connectors, the Versions History window for a document contains a column called modified date. This column actually contains the date on which each version was created, not the date it was last modified. For example, you create a new draft at 1.00 PM, work on it until 2.00 PM, save it, and then check it in. The Versions History window displays the time when you originally created the version in the modified date column for the first version, which is 1.00PM.
   
 * To configure IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr for a high-availability deployment in a cluster, you enter a corbaloc URL in the Content Engine URL field in the configuration window.
   
   This URL is of the form corbaloc::sampleserver1:9811,:sampleserver2:9811/cell/clusters/samplecluster/FileNet/Engine, 
   where sampleserver1 and sampleserver2 are two cluster nodes and "samplecluster" is the name of the cluster.
   
   The configuration program validates the URL format. It is hard-coded with a default cluster name and only accepts URLs for of the format /cell/clusters/cecluster/FileNet/Engine. 
   If the URL entered does not use the cluster name "cecluster", the configuration program displays an invalid URL error message.
   
   Workaround: Use the name "cecluster" in the URL instead of the real cluster name, then continue through the configuration program to generate and deploy the EAR file. On most systems, the cluster part of the high-availability URL is not used. Deploy IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr by browsing to the URL http://<hostname>:<port>/dm/atom/libraries/feed. You should see the ATOM feed listing the libraries on your system. 
   
   If the incorrect cluster name cause an EJB communication error, reconfigure the application with the correct value:
   1. Locate the file fnqs.ear in the IBM FileNet Services for Lotus Quickr installation directory. Extract the file to a temporary directory.
   2. In the extracted contents of fnqs.ear file, locate the file lib/props.jar. Unzip it to a temporary directory.
   3. In the extracted contents of props.jar, locate the bootstrap.properties file. Open this file in a text editor.
   4. Edit the value of the ceURI property to contain the correct cluster name.
   5. Re-zip all of the files into fnqs.ear file.
   6. Deploy the application to WebSphere Application Server and verify the configuration change by going to the URL http://<hostname>:<port>/dm.
   
   You can also use the silent install option for the configuration, which does not validate the Content Engine URL. See the information center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/topic/com.ibm.installingp8qkr.doc/p8qdc200.htm] for details.
