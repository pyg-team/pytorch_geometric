Title: IBM RequistePro baseline import can fail with timeout messages in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation - United States

Text:
DNG; timeout; reqpro; baseline; import; query.timeout; CRRRW7601E; CRRRW7556E; error 400; http 0; CRRRW7553E; I/O exception TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Importing large IBM RequisitePro baselines to IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (DNG), can result in a timeout after 2 minutes. 

SYMPTOM
Error message is displayed on the screen advising the import failed.


CAUSE
This can be seen when importing large ReqPro baselines. 

Client queries running for 2 minutes or longer can cause stability problems since a long running query can consume a lot of heap. 


The query timeout occurs by design. If a user action is initiated that excesses a specified timeout value, the query will be canceled. This configurable timeout is built into the product to protect the server from excessive queries.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. The Project Import fails with the following error: 

 * 
 * Project Import Status
   Migrating Project "Project1"
   The IBM Rational RequisitePro project was not imported:

   ID CRRRW7601E The server request to import the Rational RequisitePro project failed.
   
   A connection to the server cannot be established. The following HTTP status code was received: 0

   ID CRRRW7556E The application cannot connect to the server. There might be a problem with your network connection or the server might not be available. Check your computer's network connection. Ask your administrator to check the status of the server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The recommended solution is to increase the RAM in the server and JVM heap settings to allow the import of the large ReqPro baseline. 


If the above does not resolve the issue and if the cause of the timeout is understood in terms of the potential additional load of increasing the timeouts, then follow the steps below to increase the timeout parameters:

1. Go to https://<yourserver>/rm/admin


2. Go to Advanced properties


3. Search for the property Timeout for DNG WebUI communications (ms) 

 * 
 * 



4. Search for the property query.client.timeout  * 
 * 


Note: IBM does not recommend increasing the query.client.timeout beyond 120000 ms (2 minutes) for stability concerns.
