ANSWER
 

Official statement by IBM eCustomer Care Team (Passport Advantage Online help desk):

We would like to inform you that you can only access and download software that has active Subscription and Maintenance from Passport Advantage Online.
If the Software Subscription and Maintenance has expired you will not be able to download the software from Passport Advantage Online.
In this case, you would need to renew your software Subscription and Maintenance.

You can order the Media CD copy of the software your company purchased. The software version is the one up to the time your subscription has expired.
The sales department will be able to advise you if the Media CD is available.
