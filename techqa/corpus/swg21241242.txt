PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Alcatel 5620 CORBA Probe : Warning: Unable to retrieve the reference on the ProxyAgent 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Check that the correct IOR files are being used by the probe.
The IOR file needs to be copied from the Alcatel EMS if the probe is running remotely. 

If the error message in the log file shows an 'Access Denied' exception. 
Restart the Alcatel ems and copy the new IOR files across to the probe server as required.
Check the Alcatel ems log files if the problems persist and contact Alcatel Support.
