ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT:
   
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring for System p - CEC Base Agent v6.2.2
   Interim
   Feature 2 running on VIOS 2.2.1
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   Documentation for use of "cfgsvc" command to configure ITM_cec
   agent
   service on VIOS is unclear.
   
   The following is documented in the current manual:
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring: CEC Base Agent
   User's Guide
   Version 6.2.2.1
   SC23-5239-07
   In Chapter:
   Requirements and agent-specific installation and configuration
   information for the monitoring agent
   
   Under section:
   Agent-specific installation and configuration -> Configuration
   *******
   VIOS
   Although the CEC agent is now preinstalled on the VIOS V2.2.0.0,
   Fix
   Pack 24, you must configure the CEC Base agent with the cfgsvc
   command.
   cfgsvc ITM_cec -attr hostname=name_or_address1,
   mirror=name_or_address3,
   Restart_On_Reboot=value cec=cec_name
   managing_system=name_or_address2 OR hmcuser@name_or_address2
   DIRECTOR_HOST_ADDRESS=<director_hostname> (optional),
   DIRECTOR_PORT_NUMBER=8422 (optional) DIRECTOR
   _AUTHENTICATION=Yes
   (optional)
   Where:
   ITM_cec
   Name of the monitoring agent.
   name_or_address1
   Either the host name or IP address of the Tivoli Enterprise
   Monitoring
   Server to which ITM_agent_name sends data.
   name_or_address3
   Secondary Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server host name or IP
   address.
   cec_name
   Name of the CEC that the agent is monitoring.
   value
   Either TRUE or FALSE as follows:
   TRUE
   ITM_cec restarts when the Virtual I/O Server restarts.
   FALSE
   ITM_cec does not restart whenever the Virtual I/O Server
   restarts.
   name_or_address2
   Either the host name or IP address of the Hardware Management
   Console
   (HMC) attached to the managed system on which the Virtual I/O
   Server
   with the monitoring agent is located.
   hmcuser
   User on the HMC computer (with authority equivalent to
   "hscroot").
   director_hostname
   IBM Systems Director Server to which to navigate using the IBM
   Systems
   Director workspace links.
   Note:
   If hmcuser is not specified, the default user is "hscroot".
   
   Note:  The parameters must be specified in the order indicated.
   *******
   The command syntax for the "cfgsvc" command syntax includes
   commas which
   will result in the ITM_cec agent service not working due to
   invalid
   values for parameters.
   
   The "cfgsvc" command syntax needs to be clarified to remove the
   commas,
   and the (optional) flags from within the actual command syntax.
   
   The above would be clearer if documented as:

   name_or_address3
   Secondary Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server host name or IP

   cec_name
   Name of the CEC that the agent is monitoring.
   The value of the cec-name can be determined from running the

   command on the HMC and choosing the correct CEC from the list
   that the
   HMC manages:

   value
   Either TRUE or FALSE as follows:
