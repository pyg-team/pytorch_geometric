===============================================================================
Incorrect install location
--------------------------

The path you entered did not have any Netcool/OMNIbus components installed.
Please check and try again.


CAUSE
Often the installation was ran as a different user, which created temporary files in /tmp that cannot be written by the non-root user.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Verify the user running the Fixpack installation is the same user that installed Omnibus. Check the ownership of the files in $OMNIHOME to determine the correct user. 

2. As the user that installed OMNIbus, run the listIU.sh command. If the user is a non-root user, this is located in the user's home directory/.acsi_hostname/bin. If the user is the root user, this is located in /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin. Verify the listIU output shows the Omnibus version installed. 

If the listIU output does not show the Omnibus version installed, open a ticket with IBM support to restore the deployment engine registry. 

3. Clean up the temporary files created by the Deployment engine. In the /tmp directory, delete the following - 
drwxrwxr-x. 4 clgrimes74 clgrimes74 4096 Feb 18 16:20 install.dir.15856
-rw-rw-r--. 1 clgrimes74 clgrimes74 0 Feb 18 16:20 8df2c3d71444715f224.notes

drwxrwxr-x. 2 clgrimes74 clgrimes74 4096 Feb 19 08:40 acsiTemp_clgrimes74

Once the files are removed, re-run the Fixpack installation.

If the Fixpack installation still fails, please open a PMR with IBM. Collect the log files using the nc_install_logs utility. If the problem is with an Omnibus 7.4 Fixpack, nc_install_logs is included in the Fixpack package. Go to the directory where the Fixpack is untared and run it as follows - 

./nc_install_logs --pmr 12345,999,000 $NCHOME
