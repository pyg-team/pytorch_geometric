APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Syndicator and Subscriber administration portlets are
   currently intended to only be used by Portal Administrators
   that have access to the Administration area of the site.
   
   This change will allow non-administrators with user access to
   the content root (which can be set on the Web Content
   Libraries Administration portlet), and user access to the
   Syndicator/Subscriber portlets. With this minimum access when
   the portlet is placed on a page in which a non-admin can reach
   it then they will see the syndicator/subscriber portlet with a
   reduced set of actions available. Users can see the set of
   syndicators, trigger an update, review pending items and show
   errors.
