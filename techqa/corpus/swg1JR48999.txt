APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the Process Monitor page of the Process Admin Console, you
   can retrieve lists of process instances and get details of them
   via drill down. In some circumstances not all details are
   available, causing the page fail to load.
   
   This APAR enhances the Process Admin to tolerate this and thus
   allows the list to be displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the Process Monitor or the Process Inspector of the
   Process Admin Console, displaying a list may fail with a
   exception like the following:
   
     CWLLG2229E: An exception occurred in an EJB call.  Error:
       Business Process Diagram with ID BPD.... not found.
   
   PROBLEM DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
   Using the Process Monitor or the Process Inspector of the
   Process Admin Console, you can browse lists of process
   instances.
   In some situations there may be process instances that have not
   all information necessary to be displayed in the list. Such
   instances prevent the display of all others, because the lookup
   of the information leads to server exceptions that stop the
   list generation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix changes the list algorithm in two ways:
   1) The fix adds functionality to gracefully ignore such
     instances and thus allow the list to be displayed.
   2) The fix adds tracing to gather data about the incomplete
     process, e.g. to allow a cleanup.
