ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Tivoli Monitoring for System p - VIOS Premium Agent v6.2.2.2
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In the IBM Tivoli Monitoring:VIOS Premium Agent Version 6.2.2
   Interim
   Feature 2 User's Guide:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.
   itm.doc_6.3/phmcagent6223_user.pdf [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/phmcagent6223_user.pdf]
   on page 7, it states:
   ---
   The VIOS is a closed system and does not support the running of
   non-certified software. Currently, the only IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring
   agents that are certified to run on the VIOS are the VIOS
   Premium
   agent, IBM Tivoli Monitoring: CEC Base Agent, and the IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring: UNIX Logs Agent. IBM Tivoli Monitoring remote
   operations
   are currently not supported for the VIOS Premium agent because
   IBM
   Tivoli Monitoring remote operations require the IBM Tivoli
   Monitoring: UNIX OS Agent to be running on that endpoint.
   ---
   This statement is no longer accurate and needs to be updated.
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   None.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A.  Technote will be created with current details
   of which monitoring agents are supported to be installed
   in VIOS environments.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The list of agents supported on VIOS has changed since the
   publication of the VIOS Agent User's Guide.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following technote provides the list of currently supported
   agents on VIOS:
