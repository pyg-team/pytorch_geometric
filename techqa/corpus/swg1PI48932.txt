APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Cics acts as webservice provider over MQ transport.
   A client put a message on the receive queue, that is triggered.
   Trigger monitor, then, writes on the INITQ and CPIL is attached
   because it is a SOAP message.
   CPIL  performs a MQGET on the receive queue. In the MQ message
   there is a replyDestination.
   CPIL then, starts CPIQ and it performs a MQPUT1 on the
   replyToQueue.
   But this queue is put-inhibited that cause to be returned:
   DFHPI0114 CPIQ The pipeline MQ transport mechanism failed
   because a call to WebSphere MQ function MQPUT1 returned with
   reason code 2051 MQRC_PUT_INHIBITED) x'803'
   .
   At this point CICS should write the message on Dead Letter
   Queue as described in the CICS manuals.
   .
   CPIQ issues a MQPUT1 on DLQ with PASS_ALL_CONTEXT but it fails
   with MQRC_CONTEXT_HANDLE_ERROR.
   No errors messages are sent for this error.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS webservice request using MQ        *
   *                      transport fails with 2097 on DLQ        *
   *                      when attempting to write to the DLQ.    *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A CICS webservice request with MQ transport fails because the
   specified reply-to queue is put disabled, (MQRC=2051) meaning
   the reply message cannot be written. The reply message should
   then be placed on the dead letter queue, but this also fails
   with a context handle error (MQRC 2097).
   
   Keyword(s): MQRC_CONTEXT_HANDLE_ERROR MQRC_PUT_INHIBITED
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHPITQ1 has been altered so that the MQPUT1 which writes
   to the dead letter queue uses the mq_pmo.Option of
   MQPMO_SET_ALL_CONTEXT instead of MQPMO_PASS_ALL_CONTEXT.
   Additionally, the module is also changed so that whenever
   an MQPUT1 fails the failing message is written to the dead
   letter queue immediately.
