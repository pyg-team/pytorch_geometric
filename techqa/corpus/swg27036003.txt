ABSTRACT
 TivoliÂ® Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager stops collecting data when user account passwords expire. You can reset the password and update the necessary services to get the application back up and running. 

CONTENT
Depending on which operating system password expired, and is now invalid in the application, the following symptoms might be seen: 


 * Authentication error when you try to log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. 
 * You cannot view recent historical data in the Tivoli Common Reporting reports. 
 * The Warehouse Proxy agent and Summarization Pruning agent can no longer access the WAREHOUS database. Errors for the two agents can be seen in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal. 
 * Tivoli Common Reporting fails with connection errors. 
 * Data collection stops
