APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Assembler program for call an stored procedure an using
   ASSOCIATE RESULT SET LOCATOR (:LOC1) WITH PROCEDURE
   SYSPROC.DSNUTILS results in:
   
   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -188, ERROR:  THE STRING REPRESENTATION OF A
   NAME IS INVALID

LOCAL FIX
 *  EXEC SQL

              WITH PROCEDURE :PROCNAME
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the DB2 UDB for z/OS Precompiler    *
   *                 with the Assembler host language.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When an embedded SQL statement contains *
   *                      a procedure name, the modified source   *
   *                      generated by the DB2 Precompiler for    *
   *                      the SQL statement may be invalid,       *
   *                      causing SQLCODE -188 to be issued       *
   *                      during execution time.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Following are two examples that expose the problem:
   
   EXEC SQL
         CALL SYSPROC.DSNUTILS (:UID)
   EXEC SQL
         ASSOCIATE RESULT SET LOCATOR (:LOC1)
              WITH PROCEDURE SYSPROC.DSNUTILS
   
   The DB2 Precompiler may return without any error. However,
   SQLCODE -188 may be issued during execution as follows:
   
   DSNT408I SQLCODE = -188, ERROR:  THE STRING REPRESENTATION OF A
                            NAME IS INVALID
   DSNT418I SQLSTATE   = 22503 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
   DSNT415I SQLERRP    = DSNXEVPN SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR
   DSNT416I SQLERRD    = 140  0  0  -1  0  0 SQL DIAGNOSTIC
   
   Additional keywords:  SQLCODE188
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The DB2 Precompiler is corrected so that valid assembler code is
   generated for a procedure name in an SQL statement.
