Text:
empty page TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You notice no error page is displayed when an error or exception occurs while browsing the store. You see the following error displays in the SystemOut.log file: 



[2/10/05 13:32:21:609 PST] 25731da8 CommerceSrvr E DataBeanManager activate_1 CMN0420E: The following CommandException occurred during processing: "java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name storeErrorMessages, locale en_US".java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name storeErrorMessages, locale en_US
at java.util.ResourceBundle.throwMissingResourceException(ResourceBundle.java:724)
at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundleImpl(ResourceBundle.java:695) 

CAUSE
The above error occurs for the following reasons: 

 1. The storeErrorMessages_en_US.properties file does not exist. 
 2. When loading the page, the variable needed to locate the resource bundle is not correctly initialized.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve the problem: 

 1. Ensure the storeErrorMessages_en_US.properties file exists in the following folder: WCDE_installdir\workspace\Stores\Web Content\WEB-INF\classes\StoreName\storeErrorMessages_en_US.properties, where StoreName matches the value in the STORES.DIRECTORY database entry for the particular store ID. 
 2. Ensure the variables are properly included. The ErrorMessageSetup.jspf file that is responsible for locating the resource file and makes use of a variable that is initialized in the JSTLEnvironmentSetup.jspf. 
    In your JSP file that includes the ErrorMessageSetup.jspf and JSTLEnvironmentSetup.jspf files, ensure the files are included in the following order: 
    <%@ include file="../../../include/JSTLEnvironmentSetup.jspf"%>
    <%@ include file="../../../include/ErrorMessageSetup.jspf"%>
    If you include the JSTLEnvironmentSetup prior to the ErrorMessageSetup, you will end up properly initializing the variable that is needed to locate the resource bundle.
