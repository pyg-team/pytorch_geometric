ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Session Management Time Out Change not taken
   in account
   Hi
   The document ?SMARTEAM - Editor Administrator
   Guide.pdf?
   Under the chapter ?Session Management Service?
   In the ?implementation? section (page 86/87)
   paragraph 6 should be change
   To replace it with the comment in FAQ number 556
   NOTE: Please consult Baruch Farkash or Oren Dror
   for the fix.
   FAQ 556 - What does the
   SmarTeam.Std.SessionManagement.Service.Host.e
   xe.config system configuration setting do?
   Each time SmarTeam ? Editor or SmarTeam ? Web
   Editor (/Navigator) is activated, a new work session
   is created. The session stores user login
   information that passes between the client and the
   server. The
   SmarTeam.Std.SessionManagement.Service.Host.e
   xe.config key keeps the session open until the
   configured session expiration time, which is set to
   20 minutes by default.
   For SmarTeam ? Editor:
   When SmarTeam ? Editor is closed, Editor notifies
   Foundation to close the work session. If a
   connection problem occurs between the client and
   the Foundation server while SmarTeam ? Editor is
   open, the session expiration instruction begins to
   track the time, and the work session is terminated
   after the session expiration timeout is reached (by
   default, 20 minutes).
   For SmarTeam ? Web Editor:
   When SmarTeam ? Web Editor is closed, Web
   Editor notifies Foundation to close the work session.
   However, if SmarTeam ? Web Editor remains open
   but no activity is detected for 20 minutes, the IIS
   timeout closes the Internet Explorer connection and
   the work session is terminated after 20 minutes
   without activity.
