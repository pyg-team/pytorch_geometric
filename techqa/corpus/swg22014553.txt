Installing this fix 

There are 3 Package Groups that require this fix:  1. Optim Designer 
 2. Optim Runtime Services 
 3. WAS CE/ Web Applications


It is also recommended to upgrade Optim Masking On Demand if you are using it. 

There are 2 alternatives to install the fixes: 
 1. Use IBM Installation Manager to directly download the fix from IBM and apply it. An internet connection is required on the machine where Optim is installed for this alternative.
    
 2.  Download the zip file and then use IBM Installation Manger to install it. An internet connection is not required on the machine where Optim is installed for this alternative, but the zip file will have to be placed on the machine via a diskette or USB drive to be used.


Here are the detailed instructions for each alternative: 
 1. Use IBM Installation Manager to directly download the fix from IBM and apply it. This method requires an external internet connection on the host machine containing Installation Manager and one, two or all of the following 3 Optim components: Designer, Runtime Services, and WAS CE/Web Applications.
    
    Use the following instructions: 
     1.  Shut down all Optim components. 
     2.  Start Installation Manager. If you have multiple instances of Installation Manager installed, make sure you choose the one used to install Optim. 
     3.  On the main Installation Manger window, select File->Preferences, then Repositories. 
     4.  At the bottom of the Installation Manager Repositories window, ensure the check box "Search service repositories during installation and updates." is selected. 
     5.  Select OK to save the settings and close the window. 
     6.  On the main Installation Manger window, select the Update icon. 
     7.  On the Update Packages window, select one of the following:  1. "IBM InfoSphere” package group for machines where Optim Designer is installed 
          2. “IBM Optim Runtime” package group for machines where Optim Runtime Services is installed 
          3. “IBM Optim Shared” package group for machines where WAS CE and the Web Applications are installed. 
          4. If "IBM InfoSphere Optim Data Privacy" is installed, select it.
         
         
     8.  Select the Next button. 
     9.  On the next window, ensure that the appropriate fix is selected for the version of the Optim that is installed on your machine. 
     10.  Follow the wizard to complete the installation of the fix. 
         
         NOTES:
          1. You must be at version 11.3.0 or higher. 
          2. Repeat this process for each Optim component (Designer, Runtime Services, WAS CE/ Web Apps, and Masking on Demand) that is installed on each machine where Optim is installed.
             
         
         
    
    
 2. Download the zip file and then use IBM Installation Manger to install it.
