PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 During shutdown processing of your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 region you receive message DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'0000017A' in module DFHPEP. You are running with DumpMaster MVS from Macro 4. 

SYMPTOM
DFHAP0001 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhap/AP0001.html] An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'0000017A' in module DFHPEP.


CAUSE
Missing fix for vendor product DumpMaster MVS from Macro 4

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You look at the sequence of events in the CICS program domain and you can see that CICS module DFHTFP linked to program DMCPEP with a valid COMMAREA in key 8:

ASID(X'0100') 15E77490. AREA(Subpool130Key08)+077490 IN EXTENDED PRIVATE

Then DMCPEP does an EXEC CICS LINK to DFHPEP passing an invalid COMMAREA in key 0:

ASID(X'0100') 1530C05E. AREA(Subpool252Key00)+C05E IN EXTENDED PRIVATE

DMCPEP is a vendor module owned by Macro 4 and it tried to link to CICS module DFHPEP with a bad COMMAREA in key zero.
