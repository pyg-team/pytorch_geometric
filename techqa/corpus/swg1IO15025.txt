   Terminal
   - Started a Keyboard Test

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Configuration - if a function code has been configured as a
   double key, then any other key that shares this function code is
   also defined as a double key.
   Double key redesign
   depends on breaks from the keys. Currently, if the  key does
   not result in a break going to the terminal keyboard driver,
   the key gets stuck in dk processing
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Terminal keyboard driver - fix so breaks for capslk, scrlk, and
   numlk are always tossed
   system keyboard driver (USB) - fix so print screen break is
   passed correctly to keyboard glue
   keyboard glue - fix so pause key is broken into make / break for
   terminal keyboard driver
   keyboard device handler - fix so print screen break is correctly
   sent to keyboard glue (Enhanced systems)
