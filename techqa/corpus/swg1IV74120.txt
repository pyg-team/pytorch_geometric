APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Windows OS agent crashes if monitoring the MSSQL Agent (koq)
   which has an instance name greater than 8 characters.
   
   When tracing is set to (UNIT:KCA ALL), the RAS1 log file,
   <hostname>_nt_kntcma_<nnnnnnnn-nn>.log will have the following
   lines at the bottom:
   
   (557AF067.02C9-BFC:kcacmdw.cpp,1611,"openApplication")   PID
   <nnnn>, Application <KOQAGENT.EXE>
   (557AF067.02CA-BFC:kcactrl.cpp,3404,"getManagedEndpointProcess")
   Entry
   (557AF067.02CB-BFC:kcactrl.cpp,3451,"getManagedEndpointProcess")
   Exit
   (557AF067.02CC-BFC:kcacmdw.cpp,1692,"openApplication") Process
   name passed in uinstProcName=KOQAGENT.EXE, trimmed-dot=KOQAGENT
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Monitoring Agent for Windows OS agent crashes if Watchdog is
    monitoring the MSSQL Agent (koq) which has an instance name
   greater than 8 characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been updated address the condition where the instance
   name is longer than the process name.
   
   The problem could also occur when Watchdog is monitoring a
   different agent, but it must be a multi-instance agent where the
   instance name is not part of the process name.   For example
   Watchdog does not have a problem with the Linux Agentless agent
   as it has a process name which includes the instance name:
   kr4agent_<instance name>.exe.  The MSSQL agent has the process
   name as koqagent.exe (the instance name is not part of the
   process name).
