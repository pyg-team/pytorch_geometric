APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The email listener is not handling custom long description
   attributes in formatted emails.
   
   Customer created a new long description custom attribute. Then
   they created a SR ticket using formatted email (via email
   listener). They specify multiple lines of text for the long
   description fields.
   
   However, the multiple lines of text will appear correctly only
   on the standard OOTB long description field. On the custom long
   description attribute, the multiple lines of text will appear
   in one line only.
   
   STEPS TO RECREATE:
   
   1.I created TEST2_LONGDESCRIPTION for this test. Add this field
   to the SR application. One using multiline text box control and
   the other using rich text box control.
   2 Send sample formatted text email below can tickets get
   created via email listener:
   ---
   #MAXIMO_EMAIL_BEGIN
   LSNRACTION=CREATE
   ;
   LSNRAPPLIESTO=SR
   ;
   TICKETID=&AUTOKEY&
   ;
   CLASS=SR
   ;
   DESCRIPTION=Testing1
   ;
   DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION=
   line1
   line2
   line3
   ;
   TEST2_LONGDESCRIPTION=
   line a
   line b
   line c
   ;
   CREATEDBY=MAXADMIN
   ;
   #MAXIMO_EMAIL_END
   ---
   3. My findings:
   For custom attribute TEST2_LONGDESCRIPTION, regardless if the
   box is multiline or rich text, the line feed is gone (not
   displayed at all when the ticket is created). The multiple
   lines of text will be displayed as  a single line even when the
   control is of type multiline textbox (This is the problem
   reported in this PMR)
   
   For the standard long description attribute
   DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION, if the box is multiline
   textbox, the line feed works fine, so I will see the text in 3
   lines.
   If the box is rich text, the line feed is gone, so I will see
   the text in one line.
   
   4. I tested again by sending a free format email like below:
   line1
   line2
   line3
   
   5. My findings:
   
   If DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION is a richtext box, the line feed
   is gone
   If  DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION is a multiline textbox , the
   line feed works fine.
