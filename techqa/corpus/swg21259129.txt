Title: IBM Application fails to start on WTE with error SRVE0147E: No Virtual Host defined for web module - United States

Text:
SRVE0147E; No Virtual Host defined for web module; no virtual host; web module; 1259129 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to deploy an existing J2EE Web application from IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD) into an Integrated Websphere Test Environment (WTE) 5.x version the corresponding application does not start on the server showing the following error in the console log in the Server view:


SRVE0147E: No Virtual Host defined for web module 


The same application has been initially developed and successfully deployed on another user's installation configuration where the relating product versions are identical. 

CAUSE
The No Virtual Host defined output normally indicates there is a mismatch between the Virtual Host Name within the application and the configuration settings within the WTE for the Virtual Host option. This can occur because the previous user has defined a custom alias to the virtual Host Name within their WTE instance and the application references this name when it was imported into RAD.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For this scenario, follow these steps to start the application: 

 * 
 * 
 * Web project -> WebContent -> WEB-INF
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Environment -> Virtual Hosts 
 * 
 * default_host
 *
