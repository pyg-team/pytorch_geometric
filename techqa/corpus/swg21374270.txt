Title: IBM The IBM Cognos service does not start: CM-CFG-5114 - United States

Text:
Cogserver.log; not updated ; hangs TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to start IBM Cognos service the following error appears in the cogserver.log:
CM-CFG-5114 An error occurred while locking the content store database.



SYMPTOM
The IBM Cognos service will not start


CAUSE
IBM Cognos was unable to properly unlock the content store database so the lock remained on the database. When attempting to start IBM Cognos again it failed because the service cannot lock the content store twice. Most common cause is a restored Content Store database from a database backup that was taken while IBM Cognos was actively running. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that the IBM Cognos service is stopped. It may be required to manually stop the java process and cogboostrap service. It is recommended that a Content Store backup is taken prior to proceeding. 

1. Open the Content Store DB using the appropriate database tool/console to execute SQL.

2. Login with Content Store DB credentials used in Cognos configuration

3. Execute the sql script from <install_path>/configuration/schemas/content/<db-type>/ClearActiveCM_<db-type>.sql

For example, /opt/IBM/cognos/c10/configuration/schemas/content/db2/ClearActiveCM_db2.sql

4. Restart Cognos services.
