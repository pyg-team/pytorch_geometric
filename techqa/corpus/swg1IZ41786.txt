APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  File extension is not provided when downloading a report.After
   selecting a report in Browse/Personal documents, one can perform
   several actions. If one chooses Download CSV or Download to
   Excel, the application does not provide for a file extenstion.
   This way the operating system doesn't seems to know in what
   format to save the file or which applicaiton to use to open the
   file in.
   
   
   Please refer to the following snapshot on steps to reproduce the
   problem reported:-
   
   1) Login to TNMPW page----->Browse---->personal
   documents----->Select Action--->Download in Excel
   
   2) The save button will just save the file as CAEJSBFS, with no
   file extension type as xls
   
   3) If you choose the option "Option", windows present you with
   the "Open with" screen.
   
   4) Had to manually choose the application in Excel.
   
   5) When saving a report as a CSV-file, it doesnt show the
   extension.
   
   
   6)  Therefore,it likes to save it as an HTML document.Once can
   do two things:
   a) Save the report without extension:the OS writes the file down
   as an HTML-document.
   b) Put the CSV extension in place; the file will be saved as a
   CSV-file.
   
   7) If one did not specify the extension as html or csv(as for
   the CAO1A5XC example), 2 files will be saved to the directory.
   The CAO1A5ZC.file are also created with 0 kb size.
