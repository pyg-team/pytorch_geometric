Title: IBM Migrating a rule project from 6.7.x to 7.x causes OutOfMemoryError - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 During the migration of a rule project from JRules 6.7 to JRules 7.x, opening the JRules 6.7.x rule project in Rule Studio 7.x can sometimes lead to the Rule Studio running out of memory while building the workspace. This technote addresses how to avoid the OutOfMemoryErrors during migration. 

CAUSE
Rule analysis [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc%2FContent%2FBusiness_Rules%2FDocumentation%2F_pubskel%2FJRules%2Fps_JRules_Global623.html] is enabled by default in Rule Studio, which means rulesets are parsed internally. If errors occur during ruleset parsing, the accumulation of these errors might lead to an OutOfMemoryError.

ANSWER
 Before migrating the rule project to JRules 7.x, deactivate rule analysis by turning off the option "Perform Rule analysis during build [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/ilog.rules.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global2020.html]" in the Build page of the Rule Studio preferences. 

This will prevent the Rule Studio from performing rule analysis and thus accumulating the error messages in the memory. 

It is also recommended that you consider the performance improvement measures for Rule Studio listed in the technote "Improving Build performance of Rule Project in Rule Studio [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430585]".
