Text:
V7RNotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A third consecutive IBM® HTTP Server installation on Microsoft® Windows® operating systems results in partial success. The IBM HTTP Server installer does not create a unique name for the Windows service for a third installation. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use one of the following workarounds to resolve this issue: 

 * Do not install IBM HTTP Server and IBM HTTP Administration as a Windows service. In the HTTP Server installation wizard, unselect the Run IBM HTTP Server as a Windows Service and Run IBM HTTP Administration as a Windows Service options. For a silent installation, include the following code in response file:
   -OPT installHttpService="false" 
   -OPT installAdminService="false" 
 * Create multiple instances of the same IBM HTTP Server. For more information, see Creating multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server on Windows operating systems [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=compass&product=ihs-dist&topic=tihs_startmultserv] in the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.
