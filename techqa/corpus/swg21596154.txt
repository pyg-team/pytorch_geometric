QUESTION
 Explaining the normal contents of the files:
$NCHOME/impact/log/[ImpactServerName]_[EventReaderName].log(.[n]) 

ANSWER
There are the basic start-up and shut-down messages like: 

 * 
 * Start-up sequence:
 * 
 * 
 * 01 Jan 2012 01:00:00,000: Starting the service My_EventReader 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:00,000: Registering My_EventReader as a source of events in the QueueManager 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:00,000: Initializing 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:00,000: stopped: true 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:00,003: Initializing the Event Feed Connection.. 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:01,469: Connected to the Database 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:01,152: Connected to EventFeed. 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:01,152: Setting service state: StateChange = 1325376000, Serial = 1234567 
   01 Jan 2012 01:00:01,156: Running. 
 * 
 * Shut-down sequence:
 * 
 * 
 * 01 Jan 2012 01:05:00,000: Attempting to shutdown... 
   01 Jan 2012 01:05:00,000: Unregistered My_EventReader from the RoundRobinEventQueueManager 
   01 Jan 2012 01:05:00,000: My_EventReader stopped 



Also messages detailing the SQL statements of the EventReader polls and messages detailing the EventReader providing blocks of events to the EventProcessor: 

 * Log file messages of the 
 * SQL Polls:
 * 
 * 
 * [Date] [Time]: Query: select top 1000 * from alerts.status where StateChange >= 1325381400 AND (ImpactFlag=1 and PolicyPath=2) order by StateChange ; 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Log file messages of the provision of event blocks to the EventProcessor:
 * 
 * 
 * [Date] [Time]: Sending a block of: 25 events having block identifier: 1 
 * 
 * 



And there are two other basic types of messages produced in the EventReader log file that I refer to as the "ReadBuffer" and "DeltaQueue" messages: 

 * Log file messages of the 
 * "
 * ReadBuffer
 * "
 *  style:
 * 
 * 
 * [Date] [Time]: Read: 50 New Read: 25 Updates: 0 OSQueue: 50 ReadBuffer: 75 Time: 0 Events Read/Sec: 50 New Events Read/Sec: 25 Memory: 123456789 
 * 
 * 
 *  
   
   Property: Meaning: Read The number of events captured by the EventReader poll overall. New Read The number of event contexts valid for placing in the EventReader's EventQueue. Updates The number of event contexts that had been previously captured but passed Deviant Field checking to then be valid for placing in the EventReader's EventQueue. Please see the TechNote "Deviant Field checking in EventReaders" for further details (link below). OSQueue The size of the EventReader's EventQueue as a result of placing valid event contexts in there with any still not processed from previous polls. ReadBuffer The number of events in the EventReader cache. The EventReader
   stores all events read in the last 3 polls for Deviant Field checking. Please see the TechNote "Deviant Field checking in EventReaders" for further details (link below). Time Number of whole seconds the query/response took - generally 0, since this tends to be sub-second. Events Read/Sec The number of events captured by the EventReader poll - generally, since all events are captured within one second, this value reflects the Read value. New Events Read/Sec The number of event contexts valid for placing in the EventReader's EventQueue - generally, since all events are captured within one second, this value reflects the New Read value. Memory Current memory footprint of the ImpactServer. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Log file messages of the 
 * "DeltaQueue"
 *  style:
 * 
 * 
 * [Date] [Time]: Read: 10/min Total Event Source Queue Size: 100 DeltaQueue: 50 Gap: 00:00:02s 
 * 
 * 
 * approximately
 * 
 * "DeltaQueue"
 * 
 *  
   
   Property: Meaning: Read The rate of event acquisition over the period (working against the New Read value). Total Event Source Queue Size The size of EventReader's EventQueue at the time of the report. DeltaQueue The change in the size of EventReader's EventQueue since the last "DeltaQueue" message. Gap The time difference between the time of the report and the oldest event in the EventQueue.

These last two message styles are useful for charting the EventReader's state (I use a combination of grep and spreadsheet macros to produce a graphical representation of the log files to aid trouble shooting).
