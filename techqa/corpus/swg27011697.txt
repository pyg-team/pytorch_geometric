Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 on Windows 2003  * Clients using the Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 on Windows 2003 server, using ICA. Citrix ICA stands for Citrix® Independent Computing Architecture. It is the "thin" protocol that enables Citrix to separate screen updates and user input processing from the rest of the application’s logic. When using a Citrix ICA client, all application logic executes on the server and only screen updates, mouse movements and keystrokes are transmitted via the Citrix ICA session. Note: Does not support Domino Off-Line Services (DOLS). 


Browser Support Notes  * Mozilla Firefox is supported by the DWA7 and MAIL8 mail templates only, it is not supported by iNotes6 templates. 
 * Attempting to access Domino Web Access through unsupported browsers results in the display of an unsupported browser notice. Netscape 4.x users may see hangs and/or crashes when encountering the Domino Web Access unsupported browser page. If you are a Netscape 4.x user and you encounter these problems, you should open your mail file using the WebMail UI directly through the &ui=webmail switch. This is documented in the topic "Switching to WebMail" in the Domino Web Access help. 
 * Domino Web Access will not work if JavaScript is disabled or if session cookies are disabled.
