APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS Statistics 20 installed on Macintosh Snow
   Leopard 10.6.8 operating system.
   Your menu language for Statistics is set to Japanese language.
   Additionally you set your locale to Japanese and turn Unicode
   mode on:
   
   DATASET CLOSE ALL.
   NEW FILE.
   SET UNICODE = On.
   SET LOCALE = JAPANESE.
   SHOW LOCALE UNICODE.
   
   After that you open a Statistics data file (*.sav) with Japanese
   value or variable labels in the file. After you modified the
   file (e.g. create a new variable) you would like to save the
   file under a different name. However, when you click on File -
   Save As in Data Editor window nothing happens. The dialog where
   you can define file name and path to save to does not occur.
   
   This does not happen for syntax and output viewer window when on
   Japanese GUI. The workaround is to use File- Save instead of
   File - Save As on Data Editor to save the changes under the same
   sav file name or to use SAVE OUTFILE syntax to save the changes
   under a different sav file name.
