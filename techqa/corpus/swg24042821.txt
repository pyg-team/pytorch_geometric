PREREQUISITES
ITCAM Agent for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition Version 7.0.1 must be installed.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================================================
Local agent update
=========================================================================
1. Transfer the appropriate 7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001.tar or .zip 
archive file to a temporary directory on the system that 
contains the agent code to be updated. For example, the
<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this
directory. Note: On a Windows system, this path includes the
drive letter.

2. On UNIX systems, use the "tar" command to expand the archive file 
or on Windows systems use the extract utility. This step creates a
directory structure that contains fixes for all the supported
platforms.

3. Use the "itmpatch" command to install the fix for the operating
system for the agent. For more information about the "itmpatch"
command, see section [6.2].

On UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001,
the installation command is:

> itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>
-i <TEMP>/7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001/km6_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar

where:
- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column returned
by the ./cinfo -i command.

In the following example, the file is "km6_lx8266_tema_if0001.tar".
> ./cinfo -i
m6 Monitoring Agent for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition
lx8266 Version: 07.01.00.00

On Windows system, if the fix was expanded to
<TEMP>\7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001, the installation command is:

> <TEMP>\7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>
-i <TEMP>\7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001\km6_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.cab

=========================================================================
Remote agent update
=========================================================================
1. Transfer the appropriate 7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001.tar or .zip 
archive file to a temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise 
Monitoring Server system. For example, the <TEMP> symbol 
represents the fully qualified path to this directory. 
Note: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.

2. On UNIX systems, expand the archive file by using the "tar" 
command or on Windows systems use an extract utility. This 
procedure creates a directory structure that contains fixes 
for the supported operating systems.

3. On UNIX sytems, to add the agent fix bundles to the remote 
deployment depot, use the "tacmd addBundles" command in 
the $CANDLEHOME/bin directory. On Windows systems, use 
the command in the %CANDLE_HOME%\bin directory. For more
information about the "tacmd addBundles" command, see the IBM 
Tivoli Monitoring Command Reference Guide.

On UNIX systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001

On Windows systems,
if the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001

where:
-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically
added. The -n parameter must be used because the fix
directory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix
requires. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites
for this fix.
-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be
added to the depot.

4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and deploy
the fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use
the following "tacmd" commands. 

On UNIX system:
> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems

For more information about the "tacmd login" and "updateAgent" commands, 
see the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Command Reference Guide.

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t m6
-n <Managed system name>
-v 070100001

On Windows systems:
> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd login -s <server>
-u <itmuser>
-p <password>

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd listSystems

The output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the
remote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the
"tacmd updateAgent" command.

> %CANDLE_HOME%\bin\tacmd updateAgent -t M6
-n <Managed system name>
-v 070100001
Note:
- The component (-t) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is 
specified as 2 characters (m6), not 3 characters (km6).
- The node (-n) for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is the managed
system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.
The target node for the "tacmd updateAgent" command is always 
an OS agent.

=========================================================================
Agent support update
=========================================================================
Fix 7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001 includes changes to the agent support files 
that must be installed. Use the following steps to update the Tivoli 
Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

1. Transfer the appropriate 7.0.1-TIV-ITM_KM6-IF0001.tar
or .zip archive file to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal 
Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

2. On UNIX systems, use the "tar" command to expand the archive file 
or on Windows systems use an extract utility. This step creates a
directory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, 
with the necessary updates.

3. Expand the km6_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip archive file 
that contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Browser, 
and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.

4. To install the application support files, use the Application Support
Installer (ASI) GUI or the silent installation procedure.

GUI installation option
------------------------
To start the GUI, from within the CD-ROM directory where the "setup.jar" 
file is located, use one of the following commands:

On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]

When prompted by the Application Support Installer for the
installable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the
component directory. The installer installs updates for
multiple components at the same time.

Silent installation option
--------------------------
To use the silent installation option, from the CD-ROM directory 
where the "setup.jar" file is located, use one of the following
commands:


On UNIX systems:
> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

On Windows systems:
> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]
[-r <response file>]
[-j <JAVAHOME>]

where:
-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli
Monitoring installation directory.

-r <response file> - Optional. Customized response file name.
The default response file "response.txt" in
the CD-ROM directory can be copied and modified
for your environment. Do not update "response.txt".

-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully qualified path to the "bin"
directory where Java(R) is installed. The
location of Java on your system might vary.

Note: For the silent installation option for Linux and zLinux
operating systems, use the following files: 
- Linux: setupLinux.bin
- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin

These files are contained in the Interim fix 6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 
(http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]).

Follow the installation instructions that are contained in the
"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README".

5. Next, in the Application Support Installer, you select the Tivoli Monitoring 
components to which you want to add application support.
For this fix, check or clear the check boxes as shown here:

[checked | cleared] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)
[checked | cleared] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
[checked | cleared] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)

To continue the installation, select the IBM Tivoli Composite Application 
Manager Agent for WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.1 Interim Fix IF0001.

6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise Portal
Browser is running when you install the update, you must restart it.
