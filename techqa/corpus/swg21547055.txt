STERLINGPRI TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Number of symbolic links encountered during path name traversal exceeds MAXSYMLINKS (SCI54126) 

SYMPTOM
Number of symbolic links encountered during path name traversal exceeds MAXSYMLINKS 
Error occurs after the message 'There is adequate space to install bundled database (optional)' displays on the screen. 
cp: cannot access /usr/j2se/opt/javahelp/javahelp/javahelp/javahelp/javahelp/jav

ERROR unable to copy JDK: 2


CAUSE
symbolic link /usr/j2se/opt/javahelp is preventing normal installation.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Remove the symbolic link /usr/j2se/opt/javahelp (rm /usr/j2se/opt/javahelp)
2. Remove the directory in which the GIS installation did not finish. (GIS must be installed in a new directory; it will not install into an existing directory.)
3. Begin the installation again.
