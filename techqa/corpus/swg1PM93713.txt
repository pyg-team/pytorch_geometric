APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When jar files are included in the
   components/componentName/shared/app directory of a paa file and
   the paa file is deployed on a cluster, if after the paa file is
   installed on the primary node, subsequent nodes fail to start as
   the jar file is missing from the class-path. This fix adds the
   jar file to the solution installer shared library prior to
   starting the server for credential verification, during the
   deployment of the paa file on the secondary node.
   Opened for release 8001
