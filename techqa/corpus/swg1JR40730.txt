APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Information Server / DataStage 8.5 job which accesses Oracle
   11.2 client on zLinux platform using Oracle Connector fails
   with the following error:
   
   /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/PXEngine/bin/osh: symbol
   lookup error: /opt/oracle/11server/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1:
   undefined symbol: clock_gettime
   
   The same job works ok if Oracle 10.x client is used.  Oracle
   11.2 client support is not yet available for some legacy stage
   types on zLinux platform.   This APAR opened to add that
   enhancement.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  IIS 8.5 on zLinux supports connecting to Oracle 11.2 server
   using Oracle 10 client.
   
   The function is currently fully available in v8.7.0.0 Oracle
   Connector.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customer was having errors using Oracle Operator on zLinux with
   Oracle 11g client.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  It was suggested that Customer use the Oracle Client 10g for
   Oracle Operator.
   
   
   The support for Oracle 11g Client on zLinux was added to Oracle
   Connector in v8.7.0.0.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Use the Oracle 10 client for zLinux.
   
   
    
   
   

COMMENTS
 *  At the time we started supporting Oracle 11g there was no zLinux
   Oracle Client available to build and test with.  Once the
   Oracle client became available we had to modify linker options
   to exploit Oracle 11g on zLinux.
