ABSTRACT
 When upgrading a deployed Caching shared service instance from PureApplication Service version 2.2.0.0 to version 2.2.1.0, the upgrade might not complete, hanging at Launching state. 

CONTENT
Problem: The issue might occur because there is not enough available disk space at "/" on the virtual machines for the Caching shared service. For example, if you click Must Gather Logs > Execute (accessed by clicking Patterns > Shared Services Instances, and expanding the Virtual machine perspective, OS nodes and Script packages sections), the Must Gather log files will be created in /tmp/log/MustGather. The log file size varies and could be a few gigabytes in total. You must remove the Must Gather log files after copying them.

Resolution: Take the following actions to complete the Caching shared service upgrade: 

 1. Remove the Must Gather Log files from /tmp/log/MustGather to create more available disk space. 
 2. Stop and start the Caching shared service instance that is hung. To do so:  1. Click Patterns > Shared Services Instances. 
     2. In the tool bar, click the Start icon to start the instance or the Stop icon to stop the instance.

 *  In the Shared Services Instances page, select the instance of the Caching shared service that is hung and locate the deployment ID from the URL; for example, d-645085a6-ad56-4050-9ca0-d8e325cf4c27. Click System > Storehouse Browser. Expand User > Deployments to locate the matching deployment ID. Expand the section for that deployment. Select deployment.json and click Get Contents (New Window). Copy and paste the deployment.json content to Notepad (or a text editor of your choosing). Modify the deployment.json content:  * Search for the key maintenance_mode. Change the value to false or remove the key. 
    * Search for the key update.inProgress. If the key exists, remove it. 
    * Search for the key update.canCommitOrRevert. If the key exists, remove it. 
   
   Launch the following poster URL: https://<rack_ip>/storehouse/user/deployments/<deployment_id>/deployment.json Locate the content type: application/json Paste the updated deployment.json to the content and run PUT. Verify that the Caching shared service instance returned to Running state.
