QUESTION
 I am using SPSS for Windows version 13.x or higher. I received new authorization codes to renew my SPSS licenses. How can I launch the authorization wizard if it doesn't appear in my Start menu? 

ANSWER
The file that launches the SPSS License Authorization Wizard is called Activator.rac. (You may see it in Windows Explorer as Activator, with a file type listed as RAC for Rainbow Activator Configuration File. A network installation will most likely have that file in the LAW subdirectory.) Double-click on this file to launch the License Authorization Wizard
