APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For Impact 5.1.1
   According to the document:
   You can use the Exit function anywhere in a policy where you
   want to
   terminate processing.
   
   The Exit() function terminates a policy, when it's called
   outside a
   function.
   
   But the exit() doesn't terminate, when used in a user-defined
   function.
   Also, there is not much information in the 5.1.1 doc, as to how
   the
   exit() function behaves inside a user-defined function.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Exit() function behavior are the same in both Impact 5.x and
   Impact 6.x.
   It is as 6.1 document described.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  You use the Exit function to stop a function anywhere in a
   policy or to exit a
   policy.
   When you use Exit in a user-defined function it exits that
   function, and the policy
   continues.
