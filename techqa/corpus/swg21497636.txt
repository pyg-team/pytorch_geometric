Title: IBM Execution error XU.ERROR.10411 when a ruleset is generated from Rule Team Server - United States

Text:
ILOGPACKAGEEND ; ILOGPACKAGESTART ; RTS; Teamserver; Rule Team server; Jrules; Ruleset TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 After a migration from Jrules 7.0.x to 7.1.x, ruleset execution fails on Rule Execution Server (RTS) when the RuleApp is deployed from Rule Team Server. The same RuleApp, when deployed from Rule Studio, executes successfully. The ruleset IRL code generated from Rule Team Server shows that the package declarations have ILOGPACKAGESTART and ILOGPACKAGEEND strings appended. Is this expected? 

CAUSE
The prefixes and suffixes, ILOGPACKAGESTART and ILOGPACKAGEEND, were used in Version 7.0.x of Rule Team Server to compile the rules into rulesets. 
Version 7.1.x of Rule Team Server uses ILOGBUSINESSPACKAGENAMESTART and ILOGENGINEPACKAGENAMEEND for the same purpose. 

These strings are appended in the cache for parsing purposes. 
After a migration from Jrules 7.0.x to 7.1.x, the Rule Team Server cache is kept because it is stored on the file system. This is why the generated IRL code contains the package name prefixes and suffixes that are used by Rule Team Server 7.1.x.

As a consequence, an attempt to execute this ruleset on Rule Execution Server might result in an exception stack trace similar to the following one:

Cannot parse ruleset: {ruleset name}, line xx: error (xx times): ... error code: XU.ERROR.10014

ANSWER
To prevent this issue, clear the Rule Team Server cache. After that, Rule Team Server will generate a new set of cache files that are compatible with version 7.1.x. 

You can find more information about cleaning the Rule Team Server cache in section "WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server online help > Configure: Manage your project configuration > Administrator tasks > Cleaning the cache" of the JRules 7.1 documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtsohelp/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/Rule_Team_Server/ps_Rule_Team_Server_OH212.html].
