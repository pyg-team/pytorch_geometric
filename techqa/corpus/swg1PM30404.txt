ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When customer ran:
   ===> SBMJOB CMD(QSH CMD
   ('/QIBM/UserData/WebSphere/AppServer/V7/ND/profiles/wcmt
   stdev/update/updatePortal.sh -installDir
   "/QIBM/UserData/WebSphere/AppServer/V7/
   ND/profiles/wcmtstdev/PortalServer" -fix -fixDir

   0.0.0.ja
   r')) JOB(UPDPRTL)
   he receieved the message "Nothing to install".
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Run install.sh with the parameter "-W
   defaults.portalRootDirName=". Below is an example of performing
   this with the Portal install media all within the directory
   /PORTAL_ENABLED_7/I-Setup/.
   
   STRQSH
   CD /PORTAL_ENABLED_7/I-Setup
   install.sh -W
   defaults.portalRootDirName=/QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer
   /Content1
   
   This will result in a new profile that uses the Portal Binary
   install /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/Content1. This
   value can be whatever you want, but we strongly recommend it
   keep the same directory path only a numeric change to the Portal
   offering directory. For example, the Portal install will create
   the default profile wp_profile that will use
   /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/Content. When install.sh
   is ran again, it will create the profile wp_profile1 and we
   would suggest naming the Portal Binary directory the same
   (/QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/Content1). The profile
   name is customizable via a response file as well, but this is
   just an example. wp_porfile will use
   /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/Content and wp_profile1
   will use /QIBM/ProdData/WebSphere/PortalServer/Content1.
   Installing fixes or upgrading one of these profiles will not
   affect the other.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Fixed in future 7.x stream
   conform to the 7.0 multi-platform method for multiple profiles
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
