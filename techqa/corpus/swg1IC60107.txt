APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to perform remote administration of a queue
   manager using the WebSphere MQ Version 7 Explorer over SSL
   secured channels defined with a Client Channel Definition Table
   (CCDT), the Explorer fails to connect. A trace of the Explorer
   taken during the connection attempt shows the following error:
   
   Exception caught
   [idx=3]: com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2397;AMQ9771:
   SSL handshake failed.
   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException[com.ibm.jsse2.util.h:
   PKIX path building failed:
   java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException:
   unable to find valid certification path to requested target
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Do not use a CCDT and, instead, configure your SSL channel
   configuration directly in the Add Queue Manager wizard.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ V7 Explorer who
   administer remote queue managers, specifying the connection
   details in a CCDT and securing the connection with SSL.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Linux (Power),Linux (x86),Linux (x86-64),Linux (zSeries),
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When the connection from the Explorer to the queue manager was
   created, some of the properties stored in the CCDT and the
   Explorer itself were not being passed correctly to the method
   doing the connect. This caused the SSL handshake to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  All properties defined in the CCDT and the Explorer are now
   correctly passed to the method creating the connection.
