APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If you claim a task on a migrated system and that task works
   with IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) documents by using the
   Document Attachment control, the control might not load.
   Instead, you might see "Error Retrieving Documents List".  This
   issue occurs when document attachments have not yet been
   migrated to the IBM BPM document store.
   
   The following sample stack trace is from the server log files:
   
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E:
   [Servlet  Error]-
   [DocumentAttachmentServlet]: java.lang.NullPointerException
           at com.lombardisoftware.portal.servlet.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue occurs because before migration occurs documents do
   not have a content type associated with them although content
   types are expected.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2017.03
   that assigns a default content type to each document during
   migration to void the NullPointerException.
