Title: IBM Printing from Cognos Controller hangs or very slow - using Citrix - United States

Intercompany Balance report Hewlett Packard TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User attempts to print from Cognos Controller. The printer icon bottom left in the Controller client seems to be active but the one at the top toolbar is not usable.

If the data range parameters are changed the upper print icon may become active.

When the user proceeds to print, either nothing happens at all or it takes a very long time e.g 3-4 minutes (so the user thinks it failed altogether). 

ENVIRONMENT
Citrix thin client with a Kyocera printer - though the same issue may occur with other Citrix environments and printer types

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Try using PDF Creator and then various generic and branded printer drivers for the default printer on the Citrix server. Does this influence the printing performance?

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Try different printer default drivers and evaluate the performance.


For example, a customer has reported to us that a completely generic Citrix printer driver caused the report run time to drop from 3-4 minutes to 30 seconds, but there were some formatting issues. 

Then, selecting a branded printer driver solved the issue with no formatting issues and fast reporting.
