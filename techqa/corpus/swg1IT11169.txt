APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Affected are customers running firmware versions containing
   APAR IC81982 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC81982] fix who send GET requests with a content-type
   header.
   In such scenarios, customers will see the content-type header
   removed in processing prior to the request reaching the backend.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Consider using a single set variable action
   setvar INPUT var://service/append-request-header/content-type
   var://service/original-content-type to inject the header back
   into the request.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are all customers sending (or adding in processing) a
   Content-Type header with a GET request. Applies also for
   sending an empty POST request without the header.
   
   Since APAR IC81982 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC81982], which is a part of the 6.0.0.0 release, the
   Content-Type header gets stripped from a GET or HEAD request
   before connecting to a backend.
   
   Since then, this approach has been proved too intrusive and
   although having the Content-Type header in a GET request has a
   very marginal use, it shouldn't be disallowed. It was also
   found not justifiable to add an artificial Content-Type header
   to a POST request that doesn't contain any message body.
   
   This APAR in fact supersedes APAR IC81982 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC81982], fixing its original
   problem of injecting unwanted Content-Type header into
   requests with no content, while still allowing an incoming
   Content-Type header on such requests to pass through.
   
   Addendum: It turns out that in some cases the Content-Type
   header is being injected despite this APAR. Any customer
   experiencing such behavior is encouraged to use the following
   advice:

   injecting-content-type-for-get-reques/
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 6.0.0.17, 6.0.1.13, 7.0.0.10, 7.1.0.7
   and 7.2.0.2
