QUESTION
 ICN searches saved to a FileNet repository are filed in Unfiled Dcouments folder even when the option "Require users to save new documents and folders in folders" is enabled in IBM Content Navigator (ICN) settings 

ANSWER
The option "Require users to save new documents and folders in folders" which is listed in the General tab of an ICN desktop configuration, applies to content added using the Add Document and Add Folder buttons. It does not apply to saved searches, even though a saved search is essentially a content item in the repository. Therefore, if a folder is not explicitly specified as the location to save a search to, then it will be placed in the Unfiled Documents folder.
