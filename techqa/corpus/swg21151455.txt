PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote details the steps that you should take to thoroughly clean your environment prior to restarting IBM® Rational Rose® RealTime after it has crashed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Some of the following steps do not apply to all versions of Rose RealTime and will be noted below. 

 1. Run RoseRT -cleanup.
    Answer YES to kill all MainWin applications and YES to clean up all MainWin X properties.
    
    bash$ RoseRT -cleanup
    Rational Rose RealTime 2003.06.00
    Copyright (C) 1999-2003 Rational Software Corporation. All rights reserved. 
    
    This will kill all your Mainwin applications. Are you sure? (Y/n)Y
    This will clean up all Mainwin X properties. Are you sure? (Y/n)Y
    
    
 2. Remove the windows directory and it contents from your home directory.
    
    bash$rm -rf ~/windows
    
    Note: For some versions of Rose RealTime there is no windows directory.
    
    
 3. Remove the Mainwin registry directory and its contents from your home directory.
    
    bash$rm -rf ~/.registry.2003.06.00
    
    Note: The registry name will vary depending on what version of Rose RealTime you are running.
    
    
 4. Make sure you do not have any rogue Rose RealTime or rpcss processes running.
    
    bash$ /usr/bin/ps -u <your userid>
    bash $ kill -9 <pid>
    
    
 5. Remove any shared memory segments not owned by root.
    
    bash$ /usr/bin/ipcs -m
    bash$ /usr/bin/ipcrm -m <shmid>
    
    Note: This will affect currently running applications!
    
    
 6. Remove any semaphores not owned by root.
    
    bash$ /usr/bin/ipcs -s
    
    Note: This will affect currently running applications!
    
    
 7. Unset the MWWM environment variable.
    
    bash$ env | grep MWWM
    bash$ export MWWM=
    
    Note: The Mainwin Window Manager (MWWM) environment variable might not be used for your version of Rose RealTime. Do not be concerned if it is not set in your environment. For more information on setting and clearing environment variables, see the manual pages for whichever command shell you use.
    
    
 8. Restart Rose RealTime. 
    
    bash$ RoseRT -recreate_registry &
    
    Note: The Mainwin registry will be recreated automatically; you do not have to explicitly use the -recreate_registry flag.
