Title: IBM Content Collector for SAP P8 agent continually shuts down - United States

p8agent iccsap classpath TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Documents cannot be filed from SAP to Filenet P8 Archive due to the P8 agent repeatedly shutting down.


SYMPTOM
The following error is observed in the IBM Content Collector for SAP (ICC for SAP) ai*.log: 

P8 agent xxxx has terminated, new P8 agent yyyy restarted. 

The P8 agent shuts down before it is fully initialized. The self-healing mechanism restarts the P8 agent immediately but the next agent shuts down again before being fully initialized.


CAUSE
The required pe*.jar files are missing.
The P8 agent always needs these files (pe.jar and peResources.jar), even if the connection to PE is never established.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check that when the P8 agent is used, the variable P8_CLASSPATH is defined in archint.ini and the defined pe*.jar files exist at the location specified. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You must install a Filenet Content Engine (CE) client API matching the version of the CE in the P8 repository and list all jar files of the Content Engine API. 

Additionally, you have to specify the path to a pe.jar and peResources.jar. This can be taken from the server's Workplace (XT) or BPM/PE installation.
Obtain the necessary pe*.jar files (pe.jar and peResources.jar ) and add them to the P8_CLASSPATH variable in the archint.ini configuration file. 
The jars can be taken from the Workplace installation.

The server should then start up normally.
