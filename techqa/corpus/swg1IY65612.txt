APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WMQ is incorrectly comparing the fields of the DN containing the
   the escaped characters with the corresponding fields in the
   SSLPEER channel attribute.
   e.g. if the distinguished name in the certificate was as follows
   "CN=Before Comma\,After Comma,O=CompanyX,UK" and the SSLPEER
   attirbute on the channel was specified identically, then the
   channel would be expected to successfully connect.
   However, due to the escaped \, the channel fails with AMQ9636.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  P09741.7751.SOLARIS.P530.06.tar.Z available from L3 website.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Customers using SSL with certificates which have escape
   characters such as \, in the fields of the distinguished name.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Unix
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The failure is due to the comparison algorithm checking the
   lengths of the two OU strings are equal, after the '\,' in the
   OU from theSSLPEER MQSC attribute had already been replaced
   with ','. Hence, the lengths do not match and the comparison
   fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was fixed to correctly compare the fields.
   
   The fix will be included in the following PTFs:
