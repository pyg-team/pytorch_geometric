ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows XP SP2
   Lotus Notes Version 8.5.1 FP3
   MicroSoft Office 2007
   
   Problem:
   Customer is unable to copy an entire table from an Office 2007
   Excel Sheet into
   a Notes Client memo.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   The sample excel file contains 300 rows.
   
   1) Open sheet1 in Excel,
   2) Control+A to select all, Control+C.
   3) Open Notes memo, Set cursor in body field
   4) Control+V to paste.
   
   Result:
   The table is truncated. An inline bitmap is inserted with only
   74 rows.
   
   Expected Result:
   On copy and paste all rows of an excel table should be inserted
   in a new memo
   instead an inline bitmap.
   Customer wish to preset the default paste type to complete
   "table" instead of
   cropped picture for pasting excel tables.
