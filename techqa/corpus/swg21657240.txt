QUESTION
 Does WPG Support AES*-CTR Ciphers? 

CAUSE
Government Trading Partner requesting if WPG supports the AES*-CTR cipher.

ANSWER
Algorithms supported in FIPS and non-FIPS mode 


Following algorithms are supported in FIPS:
Diffie-Hellman
RSA, DSA
SHA-1, SHA-384, SHA-224, SHA-512
AES, DES, TDES (Triple DES)
FIPS 186-2 â€“ Algorithm for Pseudo Random Number generation (PRNG)
Transport layer security: TLSv1
Keystore format: JKS, JCEKS

Following algorithms are supported in WebSphere Partner Gateway:
Asymmetric Cryptography: RSA, DSA
Hash Function: SHA-1, MD5, SHA-384, SHA-224, SHA-512, RIPEMD/160.
Symmetric Cryptography: AES, DES, 3DES, RC2 (All with CBC mode), CAST5,
Blowfish, Twofish.
PRNG: IBMSecureRandom
Signature algorithm: dsa-sha1, rsa-sha1
Transport layer security: SSLv3, TLSv1
Keystore format: PKCS#12, JKS, JCEKS, OpenPGP
Symmetric key algorithms: AES and TripleDES with modification
detection.
Restriction: You can use TripleDES and AES algorithms only when both
Modification Detection and FIPS mode are set.

The following algorithms are not supported in FIPS but are supported in
WebSphere Partner Gateway:
Hash function: MD5. RIPEMD160
Symmetric cryptography: RC2, CAST5, Blowfish, Twofish
IBMSecureRandom PRNG provider (all cases of WebSphere Partner Gateway).
Transport layer security: SSLv3
Keystore format: PKCS#12

As you can see WPG only supports the AES (All with CBC mode) for
Symmetric Cryptography. There are no plans to support the
AES*-CTR modes.
