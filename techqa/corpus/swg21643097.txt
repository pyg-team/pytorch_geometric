QUESTION
 What is CSQ45BPK and how do I use it? 

ANSWER
PM60589 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM60589] for WebSphere MQ (WMQ) 7.1.0 and PM65422 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM65422] for WMQ 7.0.1 implemented a change to use the DB2 pre-compile VERSION(AUTO) option. The change exists in base code for IBM MQ V8 and above.

The use of VERSION(AUTO) means that a BIND PACKAGE of the collection matching the DBRM is all that is needed to add a new package version to the relevant plan when a new DBRM is shipped in MQ maintenance. 

CSQ45BPK was added to SCSQPROC to bind the DB2 packages. When this job is run, the queue manager will not need to be shut down and will not require SUSPEND QMGR FACILITY(DB2) because the BIND PACKAGE will be for a new version of the plan, different from the one that the queue manager is currently using.

Following PM60589 for WMQ 7.1.0 only CSQ45BPK needs to be run when maintenance is applied.

While CSQ45BPL and CSQ45GEX do need to be run following the apply of the PTF for PM65422 for WMQ 7.0.1, this is a one time run only because this APAR fixes new plan names permanently for each application plan. Future maintenance for WMQ 7.0.1, following PM65422, will not require these jobs to be run again. If DBRMs are shipped in such maintenance only CSQ45BPK will be required to be run. 

CSQ45BPL and CSQ45GEX will still need to be run at installation of each release of base MQ because the plan and package names are version-specific. After these APARs, MQ maintenance will not require new plan names
