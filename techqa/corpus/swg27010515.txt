ABSTRACT
 This document contains system requirements for the WebSphere Broker V6.1 products on HP-UX on PA-RISC. 

CONTENT
The #1Configuration Manager, User Name Server and Broker#c#1#2#3#c requirements for HP-UX PA-RISC are documented below. 

 
Configuration Manager, User Name Server and Broker Requirements:



Please read first [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010515&amp;aid=1]  * WebSphere Message Broker, WebSphere MQ Integrator, and Integrator Broker product READMEs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg27006913] 
 * Where patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. 
 * The Message Broker supports any JMS 1.1 provider. The minimum embedded JRE is Java 1.5. Both of these factors need to be considered when selecting a JMS provider whose client will be embedded in Message Broker. 
 *  [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2239&uid=swg24014302]Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere Message Broker has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere Message Broker Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself. 

Hardware Requirements [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010515&amp;aid=1]  * Hewlett-Packard HP-9000 PA-RISC 2.0 processor machines 

Operating Systems [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010515&amp;aid=1]  * HP-UX 11i V2 (B.11.23) (plus the recommended HP-UX 11.23 patches required for Java 5.0 (Java 1.5)) 
 * HP-UX 11i V3

Databases
(required for the broker component only) [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010515&amp;aid=1] Brokers can access Information Integrator data sources, for user data, on WebSphere Information Integrator for Linux, UNIX, and Windows V8.2.
Brokers can access, via JDBC only, Information Integrator data sources for user data on WebSphere Information Integrator Classic Federation (IICF) for z/OS, where the WebSphere IICF client code is provided for the Message Broker platform.
 * IBM DB2 Enterprise Edition, V8.2 (and other IBM DB2 UDB V8.2 editions for production purposes) [see section notes 2, 4, 6 and 10] [http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/9/sysreqs.html]

Notes:  1.  Oracle Database Server requires the Oracle Runtime Client if using 32-bit Execution Groups. 
 2.  JDBC Type-4 transaction support using DB2 requires a minimum level of DB2 v9.1 Fix Pack 3 or later. Support on DB2 v8 is not available. 
 3.  Only the connect-time failover feature,using a list of alternate servers, of Oracle RAC in non-XA environments is supported. The connect-time failover feature, using a list of alternate servers, of Oracle RAC is also supported in ODBC XA environments for supported Oracle versions from 10.2.0.4 and above, with WebSphere Message Broker V6.1.0.6 or later. Please note that this is only supported for 64 bit execution groups for this platform. 
 4.  Automatic Client Reroute for DB2 is supported. 
 5.  Informix support only for user databases. Large objects (LOBs) are not supported. Stored procedures are supported with WebSphere Message Broker V6.1.0.4 and Informix Client SDK V3.50 with FC4 Fix Pack. 
 6.  Globally coordinated transaction support (‘XA’) is provided. 
 7.  If using DB2 v9.1 the following environment variable must be set and exported in the broker’s environment, MQSI_SIGNAL_EXCLUSIONS=10.
