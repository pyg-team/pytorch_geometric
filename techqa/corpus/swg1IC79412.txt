APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Deployment Engine (DE) installed with the Tivoli Storage
   Manager server is installed globally as a root user.  A
   globally installed DE allows for non-root users to be able to
   upgrade/install components installed by the DE and requires
   some files to be accessible by all system users.  Certain
   environments may require tighter restrictions on what users
   can access files.
   
   The DE provides the capability of controlling DE file
   permissions at 3 levels using the following command:
   
     /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh
   
     Usage: de_security (-singleUser | -group (groupname) |
            -global | -refreshDB )
   
     Single User - Only the user who installed DE will be allowed
                   write access
     Group - Only the current user and members of the specified
             group will be allowed write access to the DE.
     Global - All users will be allowed write access to DE
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager by default uses the Global DE.  It
   is possible for Tivoli Storage Manager users to change the
   DE access to single user or group after installation.  If
   the DE is changed to single user mode, it is important to
   note that installing the Administration Center component
   with a non-root user ID on the same system is not possible.
   
   The above information should be included in the installation
   documentation for Tivoli Storage Manager.
   
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:
   None.
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the Tivoli Storage Manager server installation guides for
   AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris, the following topic was added:
   
   "Configuring access rights to Deployment Engine files
   
   When you install the Tivoli Storage Manager server, the
   Deployment Engine is installed automatically on the same
   system. The Deployment Engine is used to install Tivoli
   Storage Manager components.
   
   The Deployment Engine is installed globally as a root user.
   The globally installed Deployment Engine makes it possible for
   non-root users to upgrade and install the components that were
   installed by the Deployment Engine. The Deployment Engine also
   makes some files accessible to all system users.
   
   You can configure access rights to the files that are
   controlled by the Deployment Engine. The following table
   describes the access levels and the related commands. To view,
   set, or refresh the access level, issue the specified command
   on one line.
   
   Table 1. Commands for viewing and setting access rights to
   files controlled by the Deployment Engine
   
   Action: View
   Description: Displays the current access level.
   Command: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh
   
   Action: Set access to single user
   Description: Only the user who installed the Deployment Engine
   has write access to the Deployment Engine files.
   Command: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh -singleUser
   
   Action: Set access to group
   Description: Only the current user and members of the
   specified group have write access to the Deployment Engine
   files.
   Command: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh -group
   groupname
   
   Action: Set access to global
   Description: All users have write access to the Deployment
   Engine files.
   Command: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh -global
   
   Action: Refresh
   Description: After you change the access level, use this
   command to display the change.
   Command: /usr/ibm/common/acsi/bin/de_security.sh -refreshDB"
   
   In the topic "Installing the Administration Center," the
   following note was added:
   
   "<AIX, Linux, Solaris> Restriction: If access rights for
   Deployment Engine files are set to single user mode, you
   cannot install the Administration Center on the same system by
   using a non-root user ID. If single user mode is specified,
   install the Administration Center by logging in as the root
   user or modify the access rights for Deployment Engine files.
   For details, see Configuring access rights to Deployment
   Engine files."
   
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Linux.
