VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2177 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2177]
Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an integer in codebase. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2178 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2178]
Description: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DSA implementation that allows the following of a non-constant time codepath for certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a cache-timing attack to recover the private DSA key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2180 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2180+]
Description: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds read in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted time-stamp file to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115829]for more information

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-6302 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6302]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length by the tls_decrypt_ticket function A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a ticket that is too short to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117024 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/117024]for the current score

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2182 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2182]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an out-of-bounds write in the TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted value to cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116342 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116342]for the current score

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2179 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2179]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending specially crafted DTLS record fragments to fill up buffer queues, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to open a large number of simultaneous connections and consume all available memory resources.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116343 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116343]for the current score

CVE-ID:CVE-2016-2181 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2181]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the DTLS replay protection implementation. By sending a specially crafted sequence number, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause valid packets to be dropped.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116344]for the current score
