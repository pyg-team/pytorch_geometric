APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem replication:
   
   Pre-requisit
   
   Turn off Smart fill.
   
   Steps to replicate:
   1. Goto Work Order Tracking
   2. In the Location field, type in an invalid Location Code.
   3. The error message location#NotValidLoc is displayed.
   There currently is a MAXMESSAGE in the Maximo database called
   locations#NotValidLoc.
   It would seem the Java coder has mistakenly typed in
   location#NotValidLoc instead of plural locations#NotValidLoc.
   
   Go to Domains application, Retrieve LOCATIONCROSSCI (Crossover
   CI from location), we will see the Error Message Group value =
   'location' and Error Message Key = 'NotValidLoc'.  If you look
   in MAXMESSAGES, this message doesn't exist, however if you
   change the Error Message Group value to 'locations', it does
   exist.  This is your standard Maximo error that should be fixed
   in future releases.
   
   select * from maxmessages where msggroup = 'locations' and
   msgkey = 'NotValidLoc' returns 1 record
   
   select * from maxmessages where msggroup = 'location' and msgkey
   = 'NotValidLoc' returns 0 record
   
   Client is reporting this issue on MBS7116.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change location to locations within Domains application for
   LOCATIONCROSSCI domain.
