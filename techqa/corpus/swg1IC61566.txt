APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The memory used by the channel pooling process (amqrmppa) grows
   continuously until it reaches the process limit, at which point
   resource errors start occurring.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  not sure
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Any users of WebSphere MQ with pre-V7 clients connecting to a
   V7 queue manager or with SVRCONN channels with a SHARECNV value
   of less than 2.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The problem was caused by optimisation logic within the channel
   pooling process in order to reduce the performance overhead of
   managing a connection to the queue manager with a shared hConn.
   For pre-V7 clients or if the SHARECNV value is set to less than
   2, the channel pooling process does not require a shared hConn
   handle to the queue manager, so it disconnects and reconnects
   with a normal hConn. However, during this processing, the
   counter which tracks connections to the shared memory IPCC
   subpool became incorrect, leading to a failure to clean up
   connection resources when the thread disconnected from the queue
   manager. This would result in a memory leak of approximately 6Kb
   for every client connection to the queue manager.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere MQ was modified to ensure that the subpool connection
   counter in the channel pooling process was adjusted correctly
   when reconnecting to the IPCC subpool.
