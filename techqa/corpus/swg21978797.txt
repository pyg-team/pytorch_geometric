PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While attempting to start Portal 8.5 we see the following error, ADML0004E in the startServer.log 

SYMPTOM
After installing Portal 8.5 you attempt to start Portal and see nothing logged to the SystemOut.log and the following logged to the startServer.log....

CAUSE
In this case the problem was determined that the sys admin had installed Portal and turned it over to the developer. However, the developer did not have the proper file system permissions. Specifically to this file...

/IBM/Portal/wp_profile/config/cells/MyCell/nodes/MyNode/ser
vers/WebSphere_Portal/variables.xml

Because the user starting Portal could not read this file the startup could not determine the location of where to write the SystemOut.log so the startup immediately failed.


ENVIRONMENT
Portal 8.5 

Windows


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ask sys admin to correct the OS permissions issue. Once the user as the proper permissions to read the files in the Portal file system then the Portal startup should not have these problems.
