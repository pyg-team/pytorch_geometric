Title: IBM CDM - Solvency II bv137_2 rule validation fails. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The rule BV137-2 (Solvency II 1.1.X ) is failing. This rule is found in the S.06.02.01.02 form - Information on assets.


SYMPTOM
During the solo submission for Q1 reporting with Algo Reporting for Solvency II 1.1.X, the rule BV137-2 is failing.


CAUSE
The bv137_2 rule was deactivated by EIOPA on 18.03.2016 and deactivated by CDM in the EIOPA_Final_v7 package as well.


ENVIRONMENT
CDM 10.2.4 IF16

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM



1. Run the report validation 
2. Notice that there is an error referring to the rule BV137-2 which fails. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Even if this is shown as an error (because the rule fails), the values should be properly generated in the XBRL instance, therefore the error can be ignored.
