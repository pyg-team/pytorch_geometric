QUESTION
 How do you know what IDs are used by TEP to access the TCORE and SDMS databases? 

ANSWER
The two IDs referenced in the security.xml file are the IDs used to configure the SDMS and TCORE databases. (The OAL is in reference to TCORE.)
The IDs are located in the files below on the TEPS machine. 

For Windows: 
<ITM_HOME>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\config\cells\ITMCell\security.xml 

For Unix: 
<ITM_HOME>/<platform>/cq/profiles/ITMProfile/config/cells/ITMCell/security.xml 

The entries in the xml file look like this: 
<authDataEntries xmi:id="JAASAuthData_1317172331734" 
alias="ITMNode/kd4Alias" userId="db2admin" password="{xor}OzY7OzM6bj4=" 
description="kd4-alias" /> 
<authDataEntries xmi:id="JAASAuthData_1317172416968" 
alias="OALJdbcAuth" userId="db2admin" 
password="{xor}Zm4uOA0cNDRrLzBmMjoSCxIMGR4sOGJi" />


While you can change the IDs here, you have to use the ConfigSDMS.sh script to change the passwords.
