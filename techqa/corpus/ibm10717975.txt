 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
IBM Flex System EN6131 40Gb Ethernet / IB6131 40Gb Infiniband Switch Firmware has addressed the following vulnerabilities in OpenSSL: 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3735 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3735]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error while parsing an IPAdressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds read, resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131047] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2017-3736 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring function bn_sqrx8x_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
