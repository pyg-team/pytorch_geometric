IGI ARCS SAP adapter agent TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 ARCS-SAP Adapter Agent installation failure due to the lack of a SAP Role 

SYMPTOM
Following the instructions at the Knowledge Center link: 

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGHJR_5.2.0/com.ibm.igi.doc/CrossIdeas_Topics/ARCS/ARCS_SAP_Agent/Installation_Procedure.html?lang=en [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGHJR_5.2.0/com.ibm.igi.doc/CrossIdeas_Topics/ARCS/ARCS_SAP_Agent/Installation_Procedure.html?lang=en]

in order to install IGI ARCS-SAP Adapter Agent, it is not possible to complete step 8:
"In the SU01 transaction, create a user of type “Communication” and then assign it to the SAP role Z_CCS_REMOTE"


CAUSE
The role Z_CCS_REMOTE does not exist in the SAP system, because it has not been provided in the ARCS-SAP Adapter Agent installation package. Then it is not possible to assign it to the new user of type "Communication", and the ARCS-SAP Adapter Agent cannot be used.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Extract the content of attached zip file Z_CCS_ARCS.zip. Follow the instructions in the document "Insert New role into sap.docx" in order to create the new role with structure definition contained in the file Z_CCS_ARCS.SAP
