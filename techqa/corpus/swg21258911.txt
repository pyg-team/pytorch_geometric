PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
This technote explains that you cannot execute an IBM® Rational® Functional Tester script or Rational Manual Tester from the IBM Rational ClearQuest® Test Manager (CQTM) 7.0.x client. You must run it from the testing clients instead.

SYMPTOM
Trying to run scripts directly from Test Manager perspective of the ClearQuest client fail.

CAUSE
In Rational Functional Tester and Rational Manual Tester version 7.0.x, tests are executed from the ClearQuest perspective of the testing tool.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To run your Functional Tester and Manual Tester script, follow these steps:


 1. Open Functional Tester and Manual Tester. 
 2. In Manual Tester click Window > ClearQuest .
    In Functional Tester click Window > Open Perspective > Clear Quest . 
 3. Restore the ClearQuest database connection. Click ClearQuest > Database > Restore connection. 
 4. Navigate to the execution tab to execute your suite or configured test case.



Note: The option to run Configured Test Cases (CTCs) from the RCP client is unavailable for versions 7.0.1.1 and later. 
A note about Test Suite execution: The same holds true for executing scripts within a Suite. CTCs with Manual Tester or Functional Tester scripts cannot be executed from the ClearQuest Eclipse RCP Client, whereas CTCs with Robot or TPTP scripts can be executed from CQTM. For this reason, the "Execution" option is not greyed out in the RCP Client. This was reported as a defect and was resolved as "working as designed". Here is a link to that APAR:

A Test Suite may hold a combination of configured test cases (test types). These may be executable or non-executable, depending upon the test type. CQTM allows you to attempt to execute the suite, and then gives you the result separately for each test case under the test suite as noted. It does not block execution. 

For more information about the execution of Test Suites, see technote 1302987:
