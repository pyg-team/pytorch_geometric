APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A thread running in the JBoss environment which is using the
   WebSphere MQ classes for JMS as provided by the WebSphere MQ
   Resource Adapter v7.5, hangs when trying to consume a message
   from a MQ queue.
   
   The stack of the thread when in this hung state is:
   
   "DefaultMessageListenerContainer-5997" prio=10
   tid=0x00007f2ed09c3000nid=0x39bf in Object.wait()

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the:
   
     - WebSphere MQ V7.5 classes for JMS
     - IBM MQ V8 classes for JMS
     - IBM MQ V9 classes for JMS
   
   who have multiple threads consuming messages from an MQ queue
   manager and closing down JMS Connections, Sessions,
   MessageConsumers or MessageProducers in parallel across the
   threads.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS contain a counter which is used
   to indicate the number of threads which are attempting to close
   down a JMS MessageConsumer or MessageProducer.  This is used to
   prevent a thread from receiving or sending a message while
   another thread is, in parallel, attempting to close down the JMS
   artifacts associated with sending/receiving that message.
   
   There were two places within the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS
   where this counter was not being accessed from under a suitable
   lock.  As a consequence in a busy JVM, two threads could see
   different values for the same variable, which could lead to a
   thread which was attempting to consume a message go into an
   indefinite wait, resulting in a hung thread.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS have been updated so that the
   close counter is only accessed while under a suitable lock.
