APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With the DB2 server authentication type SERVER_ENCRYPT a DB2
   server accepts connections from an IBM Data Server Driver for
   JDBC and SQLJ client (also called JCC driver) even when the
   client's security mechanism is CLEAR_TEXT_PASSWORD_SECURITY.
   That means that the DB2 server accepts user names and passwords
   that are not encrypted from such clients.
   
   The DB2 server authentication type is set by the database
   manager configuration parameter AUTHENTICATION.
   The security mechanism is set by the of the IBM Data Server
   Driver for JDBC and SQLJ client property securityMechanism.
   
   To prevent the DB2 server from accepting such connections this
   APAR introduces a value JCC_ENFORCE_SECMEC for the DB2 registry
   variable DB2AUTH.
   To have the DB2 server not accept connections from an IBM Data
   Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ client with security mechanism
   CLEAR_TEXT_PASSWORD_SECURITY when the DB2 server authentication
   type is SERVER_ENCRYPT, set the DB2 registry variable DB2AUTH to
   JCC_ENFORCE_SECMEC at the DB2 server.
   
   No application modification is required, except that if you use
   Oracle JVM and use the security mechanism
   ENCRYPTED_USER_AND_PASSWORD_SECURITY you must also have the IBM
   Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ property
   encryptionAlgorithm set to 2, which means using 256-bit AES
   (strong) encryption. To use 256-BIT AES (strong) encryption with
   Oracle JVM, install the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
   Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy" files from Oracle.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This feature was first added in DB2 Version 10.1 Fix Pack 4
   At a minimum, the change for this APAR should be applied on the
   server.
