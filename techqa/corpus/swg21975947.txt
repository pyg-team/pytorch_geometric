 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Does OpenPages support the use of Internet Explorer via Microsoft App-V? 

ANSWER
The OpenPages application itself is not supported for deployment under App-V. However it is possible to deploy and use Internet Explorer via App-V to users, provided it is the correct IE version. 

Those customers looking to enable Internet Explorer via App-V for their user base should consider the following:


 *  IBM/OpenPages do not provide any support or advice for App-V. IBM/OpenPages have not carried out any QA testing of App-V and as a result, cannot confirm if any such configuration will work as expected. For any issues arising with the use of IE/App-V that require an IBM-led investigation, the customer will be expected to reproduce the use case with a non-virtualized instance of Internet Explorer outside of App-V, before it is considered for contractual Support.
