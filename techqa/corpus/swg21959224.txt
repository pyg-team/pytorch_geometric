CAMDPALL CAMDPSEC TLS 1.0 1.2 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is this HotFix for TLS 1.0 (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694441 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21694441]) able to support also TLS 1.2? 

ANSWER
Yes, TLSv1.2 is supported by using the same fix.
Just an additional NOTE: As the default version expected is TLSv1, if you have disabled TLSv1 in the DataPower appliance (use only TLSv1.2), then please make sure to manually modify the value of KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL to TLSv1.2.
