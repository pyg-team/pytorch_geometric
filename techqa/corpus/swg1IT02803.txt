APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Upon clicking ?F5? key within front side client browser to
   refresh webpage, the backend HTTP server might return HTTP 304
   No Modified response. If "Process Message Whose Body Is Empty"
   option is on, and DataPower receives HTTP 304 response, the
   request will fail and an error like below will be logged.
   
   network error 615792663   1.1.1.1 0x80e006bf xmlfirewall
   (sampleXMLFW): A timeout occurred when reading or writing
   through the default identity processor.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set "Process Message Whose Body Is Empty" = OFF to avoid
   triggering this timeout.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are Datapower configurations with XML Firewall service.
   
   When the service receives a legitimate HTTP response with no
   body from its backend (for example with HTTP status codes 1xx,
   204 or 304), the service will not recognize the back-side
   transaction as complete and will continue waiting until the
   backend closes the connection, resulting in a timeout error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.17, 6.0.0.9, 6.0.1.5 and 7.0.0.2.
