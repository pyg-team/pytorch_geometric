Title: IBM Error: com.ibm.websphere.sdo.mediator.jdbc.exception.DBException: Not a recognized database type when using SDO at WebSphere Application Server 6.x runtime - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you are running an application that uses SDO (Service Data Objects) on a WebSphere® Application Server (WAS) 6.x, you might receive an error message similar to the one below in the server console:
[3/23/07 10:51:38:287 CDT] 00000022 ConnectionWra E Could not determine database type: com.ibm.websphere.sdo.mediator.jdbc.exception.DBException: Not a recognized database type => MySQL
at com.ibm.ws.sdo.mediator.jdbc.ConnectionWrapperImpl.initializeDbType(Unknown Source)
at com.ibm.ws.sdo.mediator.jdbc.ConnectionWrapperImpl.getDBType(Unknown Source)
at com.ibm.ws.sdo.mediator.jdbc.MediatorImpl.initialize(Unknown Source)
at com.ibm.ws.sdo.mediator.jdbc.MediatorImpl.<init>(Unknown Source)
... 

CAUSE
This is due to the fact that WAS does not support certain database types (for example, MySQL), although these database types could be supported by IBM® Rational® Application Developer (RAD). 

A WAS 6.x server recognizes only the following database types when an application using SDO is launched:

If the database type that the application passes to the server is not on this list, the result is the following error message: 
"Not a recognized database type => " + productName 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you are using a database type that is unsupported by WAS, you will still be able to add this datasource as a user-defined datasource to the WAS server through the administrative console, and then connect to them through the WAS runtime. However, any applications using SDO and an unsupported database type will not work running on the WAS runtime. This is working as designed. 


As an alternative to the SDO approach, you can use JavaBeans™ to process data from the datasource for the particular project.
