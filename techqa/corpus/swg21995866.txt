[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21995866&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21995866&aid=1]



CAUSE
This is caused if Guardium has not been able to create the required partitions in the internal database. This may be because the database was busy when it tried to create the partitions.





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Check the following: 

1. All aggregation processes are completing successfully in the Aggregation/Archive Log report in the GUI. If not, look into why these are failing

2. Check there are no long running queries running in the Running Query Monitor report in the GUI. For example there may be Audit Processes that are taking long time to run. If this is the case, you can kill the query and run the Audit Process over a shorter time period in the query runtime parameters 

 

3. Check that there are no scheduled jobs running in the first 30 minutes after midnight in the Scheduled Jobs report in the GUI. This is when Guardium performs some daily processes, and may conflict with the creation of partitions 

 

4. Make sure you are on the latest GPU, combined fix pack (CFP), and sniffer patch available on Fix Central 

 

5. If all aggregation processes are running, and there are no long running queries in the internal database, please log a PMR with the following information: 

 i. agg_issues must gather 

 ii. system_db_info must gather 

 iii. a description of the issue, including screenshots if possible
