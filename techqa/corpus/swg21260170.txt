QUESTION
 Will a binary executable built using XL compilers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 4 run correctly on version 5? 

ANSWER
IBM strives to provide binary application compatibility with XL compilers. Our goal is to generate portable binary code on RHEL 4 that would run correctly on RHEL 5 without rebuilding. However, the binary application compatibility from RHEL 4 to RHEL 5 depends on several factors outside of IBM's control, such as the extent of the operating system support for binary application compatibility, as well as the level of application compliance with the standard Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). 

IBM has run tests building programs on RHEL 4 with XL compilers and running the resulting binary executables on RHEL 5. During these tests, no incompatibility was found that resulted from the behaviour of the XL compilers. These results alone, however, cannot guarantee that any application compiled with XL compilers will run correctly when moved from RHEL 4 to RHEL 5. This largely depends on whether the operating system vendor made changes in version 5 that could affect binary compatibility. 

For details on the compatibility between RHEL versions 4 and 5, we recommend that you contact the operating system vendor (Red Hat [http://www.redhat.com/]) directly.
