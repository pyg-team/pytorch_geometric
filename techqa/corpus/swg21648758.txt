CAUSE
This error may be a result of an existing file (nco_run) as a link to itself at above location on zLinux platform .

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Delete the existing file which is a link to itself.
2. Take DE backup using #/home/<username>/.acsi_<username>/bin/de_backupdb.sh command or back up the 'repos' directory - copy the directory itself somewhere
3 . Rename DE directory from /home/<username>/.acsi_<username> to .acsi_<username>_backup
4. Now invoke your installer which installs DE and also installs package successfully.
