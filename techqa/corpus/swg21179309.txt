PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 WebSphere MQ or one of its fix packs is failing to install or uninstall properly, and you need to collect MustGather data to find a solution. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions apply only to WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 and V5.3 on HP NonStop Server. Refer to the IBM MQ Read First page for instructions on other operating systems:



 * IBM MQ Read First [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618728]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please answer these questions about the problem and then follow the steps below:



 * What are you trying to install or uninstall?
 * What account are you using to perform the installation or uninstallation?



STEP 1: GENERATE DATA

It is important to gather information from the system when the install or uninstall problem is happening in order to identify the cause:



 1.  
 2.  For install problems, list the contents of the directory containing the install image or fix pack. Guardian users should run the osh TACL command to switch to the OSS environment first. For example:
 3.   
     LISTING INSTALLATION FILES IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY
     
     osh> ls -al > WMQ.installfiles.txt 
     
 4.  
 5.  
 6.  For uninstall problems or fix pack problems, list the contents of the MQ installation directory tree. For example:
 7.   
     LISTING INSTALLED MQ FILES
     
     osh> ls -alR /usr/ibm/wmq > WMQ.installedfiles.txt 
     
 8.  
 9.  
 10. Save the output of any errors reported by the install or uninstall process. Take a screen shot of the error, or log the install or uninstall process to capture the error. For example:
 11.  
     LOGGING A WEBSPHERE MQ INSTALL TO A FILE
     
     osh> script WMQ.install.txt 
     osh> instmqm 
     ... 
     osh> exit 
     
 12. 



STEP 2: COLLECT DATA
 1. 
 2. Record the MQ version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621707] currently on the system or identify the version you are attempting to install.
 3. 
 4. 
 5. Record the operating system version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634678].
 6. 
 7. 
 8. Use the sdcp script to package your files for IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21671892], including files containing the output from the commands listed in Step 1 and 2. For new install problems you can simply send the list of installation files (WMQ.installfiles.txt) and the installation log (WMQ.install.txt) to IBM.
 9. 



STEP 3: SEND DATA TO IBM
 1.  
 2.  Send your data to the IBM ECuRep repository [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/send.html] by email to websphere_support@ecurep.ibm.com, or by standard or secure HTTP or FTP.
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  While the data is transferring, send an email or use the IBM Service Request tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to update your PMR with your description of the problem and of the data you are sending.
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Please do not send data without providing a description!
 9.  
 10. Contact your country representative [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/] if you need to speak to an IBM technical support representative, or in the US call 1-800-IBM-SERV. Refer to the IBM Software Support Handbook [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/handbook/home.html] for more information on working with IBM.
