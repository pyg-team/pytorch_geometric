 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I upgrade WebSphere Application Server used in an Information Server 11.5 installation that will be upgraded to version 11.7? 

CAUSE
Upgrading Information Server 11.5 to version 11.7, requires WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment 8.5.5.x to be upgraded to WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment 9.0.0.4.

ANSWER

Information Server versions 11.3 and 11.5 supported WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment 8.5.5.x, and WebSphere Application Server Liberty 8.5.5.x (and above).

Information Server 11.7 requires WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment 9.0.0.4 or later, or WebSphere Application Server Liberty 17.0.0.2 or later. If your installation does not have an appropriate version, WebSphere should be manually updated, or auto updated by the Update Installer. 

.

WebSphere Application Server Liberty installations
No manual action is needed to upgrade WebSphere Liberty. 
The 11.7 mod pack install will automatically upgrade WebSphere Liberty to version 17.0.0.2 if WebSphere Liberty is at an older version.

Update the migration.properties file in the folder, based on values specific to your environment. Protect the file by changing the file permissions as appropriate. Make the script file executable
   chmod +x PostMigration.sh You can validate the values you provided in migration.properties by running
   on Unix: ./PostMigration.sh -validate
   on Windows: PostMigration.bat -validate You can perform the updates by running the script
   on Unix: ./PostMigration.sh
   on Windows: PostMigration.bat
   
   The following Information Server files and WebSphere artifacts are updated by the script:  * <Installation Directory>/Version.xml 
    * <Installation Directory>/ASBServer/conf/MetadataServer.info 
    * <Installation Directory>/ASBServer/bin/setupEnv.[bat|sh] 
    * WAS 9 profile 
    * <WAS 9 Install Location>/AppServer/profiles/InfoSphere/config/cells/<WAS 9 cell Name>/security.xml 
    * <WAS 9 Install Location>/AppServer/profiles/<WAS 9 Profile Name>/config/cells/<WAS 9 cell name>/nodes/<WAS 9 node name>/servers/server1/server.xml
   
   You should ensure that the isf-server-rest2 application is working correctly by doing the following steps: 
 *   1. Check whether isf-server-rest2 application started properly:
       In the WAS administration console, go to Applications > WebSphere enterprise applications.
       Scroll through the listed applications until you locate isf-server-rest2, and note its status. 
    2. If it is not in the Started state, with a green icon, start the application by clicking on the start button.

       <Installation Directory>/ASBServer/bin/iisAdmin.sh -deploy -war <IIS Install Location>/ASBServer/apps/deploy/isf-server-rest2.war -warName isf-server-rest2 -contextRoot /ibm/iis/security -warModule isf -iisAuthRole true -autoStart true -authfile <authfile with encrypted password> -virtualHost default_host -cluster <cluster name> -webServer <webserver name>
       
       After redeploying the application, again check whether it has been started properly using the WAS administration console. If it is not started , start the application by clicking on the start button.
