Title: IBM Can an update query be run against the C&DS repository to update job results? - United States

Text:
mass change query update results TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We have jobs set up in SPSS Deployment Manager. We would like to do a mass change of the location set up on the location set on the location tab. 

CAUSE
Currently all results are written to a specific file system and the server is full. We would like to change the location the results of the output. 

ANSWER
The job data is stored as metadata. There is no query or batch process that can be run to do a mass update to change the location of your results tab. The recommendation is to work with your IT administrator to clean up your file system, point your file system to a new location or manually update all of your jobs
