APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SSL renegotiation was permanently disabled with fix IC64790 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC64790].
   
   However, this may not be suitable for all customer environments.
   This APAR will add a configurable option to allow users to
   enable or disable SSL renegotiations.
   
   Disabling the option would allow an SSL handshake renegotiation
   to occur.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Not allow SSL renegotiation and use mutual SSL authentication.
   This is documented in Technote 1410851:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410851 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410851]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  SSL renegotiation was disabled because of a vulnerability in teh
   SSL protocol spec (CVE-2009-3555).  This caused some customer
   applications to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Provide a new SSL option in CryptoProfile to re-enable old
   behavior (along with the vulnerability).
