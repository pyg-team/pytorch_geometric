Title: IBM [Informix ODBC Driver]General error.Syntax error - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running a report against Informix ODBC that does a SUBSTRING on an expression rather than a database column fails with the following error:

Error number -239:

DMS-E-GENERAL, A general exception has occurred during operation 'prepare request'.
DMS-E-DBPARSER, The underlying database detected an error during processing of the SQL request.
[Informix][Informix ODBC Driver]General error.Syntax error 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A new option was added to the Cogdmif.ini file for native Informix connections but not for ODBC. The same option can be implemented for ODBC by simply adding the following lines to the Cogdmod.ini file in the /cer1/bin folder:

[Exceptions General DATABASE:INFORMIX]
Substring_On_Expr=F

This will force the substring on expressions to be performed locally instead of sending it to the database.
