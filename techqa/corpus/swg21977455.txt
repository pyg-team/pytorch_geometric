Title: IBM How to deploy IBM Content Navigator to multiple JVMs in a node ? - United States

Text:
daeja; docCacheRoot. TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Is there a JVM argument that can be used for DocCacheRoot parameter to override the path set in iviewpro.streamer.properties file for Daeja ViewOne ? 

CAUSE
The reason is that the client has the configuration directory and network directory. The network share directory is to be used by the viewer and document subdirectories. The viewer and document subdirectories are created when the IBM Content Navigator Web Application task is run. For high availability environments, this network share directory must be accessible to all IBM Content Navigator nodes in the cluster during configuration and run time. It is imperative that the Streamer does not share a "docCacheRoot" location with any other Streamer. Sharing a "docCacheRoot" location will result in undefined behavior including the failure to stream documents. The configuration directory can be shared, but the "docCacheRoot" property in the iviewpro.streamer.properties file must resolve to a location that only individual nodes have access to. But, in client's scenario, they can only have one directory for a node with 2 JVMs. So, these two jvms will be stepping on each other. so that is the reason to search for a configuration where they need a parameter to override.

ANSWER
No, we have no way of using JVM parameters to override the properties file. The viewer components are not designed to work like this and we need to have separate cache folders.
