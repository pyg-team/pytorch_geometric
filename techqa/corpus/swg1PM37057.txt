   ****************************************************************
   DB2 10 for z/OS implemented the preliminary support to enable
   remote clients to access DB2 using digital certificates. In the
   z/OS digital certificate environment, the Secure Socket Layer
   (SSL) client (mutual) authentication security protocol
   identifies and authenticates the remote client when it presents
   its certificate as identification and its proof-of-possession
   (of the certificate) as authentication.
    Note: Traditional remote client applications authenticate
     themselves to DB2 by presenting their user ID and password.
     Thus, the client's user ID and password provide
     identification and authentication.
   The client certificate is registered and stored in certificate
   profiles in RACF. Each certificate is associated with a RACF
   user ID. When a secure connection is established between the
   client and DB2, the RACF user ID associated with the client
   certificate is known to DB2. During DB2 remote connection
   authentication processing, if the remote client's user ID is
   not the same as the user ID associated with the certificate,
   DB2 needs to give special considerations when authenticating
   the remote client that is attempting to access DB2 using a
   digital certificate.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  DB2 10 for z/OS remote connection authentication processing has
   been enhanced to ensure remote client's that accesses DB2 using
   a digital certificate are properly authenticated when the
   remote client user ID is different from the certificate user ID.
   To implement client access to DB2 using a digital certificate,
   users need to define a trusted context at the DB2 server where
   the system authorization ID is set to the value of the user ID
   associated with the client certificate. The trusted context
   would need to include all the user IDs that are allowed to use
   it (such as, remote client user IDs or the mapped user IDs if
   z/OS identity name filtering is configured).
   Example: A client certificate is registered to RACF and it is
    associated with user ID, CERTID01. A remote client application
    is configured to access DB2 using a digital certificate and
    its user ID provided to DB2 is USER01. To define the trusted
    context at the DB2 server, users might consider the following
    sample DDL:
      CREATE TRUSTED CONTEXT CTXT1
      BASED UPON CONNECTION USING CERTID01
      NO DEFAULT ROLE ENABLE
      ATTRIBUTES(ADDRESS '1.2.3.4')
      WITH USE FOR USER01;
