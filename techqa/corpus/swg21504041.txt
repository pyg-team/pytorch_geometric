Title: IBM How to include the Schema into the WSDL ? - United States

Text:
TPAEINTEGRATION; INCLUDE WSDL TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 In some cases a client WebService developer wants to have all Schemas in the WSDL file. How can an Integration developer configure MIF to include the schemas into the WSDL file? 

ANSWER
The Integration Developer has to configure a System Property to include the Schemas.

Go to > System Configuration > Platform Configureation > System Properties

Select the property mxe.int.wsdlincludesschema


To include the schema into the WSDL file, this property value has to be set to 1.

If the property value is 0, the schemas will not be included into the WSDL files.

After changing this System Property, save and do a Live Refresh.

When you create / deploy a new WebService, the schemas will be included into the WSDL file.
