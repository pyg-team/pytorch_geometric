APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When deploying a Worklight with the Server Configuration Tool,
   with Oracle as database and with the connection information as a
   JDBC URL a Null Pointer Exception occurs when deploying a
   Runtime.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Edit the configuration in the Server Configuration Tool, but do
   not enter the password information.
   Export the configuration as a ant file (Menu File/Export
   Configuration as Ant Files...)
   Edit the ant file of the runtime and comment out the element
   <adminDatabase>...</adminDatabase>
   and run that file with ant:
   <WorklightInstallDir>/shortcuts/ant -f <antFile> databases
   install
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Administrators of a Worklight server  or Developers who      *
   * wants to deploy a Worklight runtime with the Server          *
   * Configuration Tool using a customized url to connect to      *
   * Oracle database.                                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The server configuration tools performs consistency checks   *
   * to verify that the database of a runtime will not overlap    *
   * with another database in the same configuration. This        *
   * consistency check does not support a connection information  *
   * defined as a JDBC URL.                                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * -                                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Server Configuration Tool has been modified so that the
   consistency check does not fail if the connection information is
   provided as a customized JDBC URL.
