   R  WAS  NOT  SET  CORRECTLY,  AND  WHEN  WE  REQUESTER
   W,  IT  POINTED AT DFSSLUP.  PLEASE ADVISE - IS THIS A
   TION? I FIXED BY POINTING DFSSLUP AT A DIFFERENT EXIT,
   INGS THEN WORKED OK, BUT I  HAVE  THE  SAME  SITUATION
     UP  IN  DIFFERENT  CONTROL  REGIONS  SOON.   THANKS,

   S3651I INDICATES THAT IMS COULD NOT  FIND  DFSSLUW  OR
   - FAULT DESCRIPTOR DFSSLUP. IF DFSSLUW CANNOT BE FOUND
   ILL  TRY  TO  FIND  THE DEFAULT. SINCE THE DEFAULT WAS
    "UNAVAILABLE" DUE TO THE  INVALID  EDIT  ROUTINE  THE
   1I  MESSAGE  WAS ISSUED. ARE YOU SURE DFSSLUW IS BEING
   IED AT LOGON?  I SUSPECT IMS IS ALWAYS USING  THE  DE-
    DFSSLUP  BECAUSE  DFSSLUW  CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE DE-
   OR TABLE OR IS NOT BEING CORRECTLY SPECIFIED AT LOGON.
   LD NEED A SLIP AT LOGON IN DFSCNXA0 TO  DETERMINE  EX-
    WHAT  IS  HAPPENING, BUT A QUICK CHECK OF THE CONTROL
    FOR A SLUW DEVICE WOULD TELL  US  WHETHER  THEY  WERE
    USING  DFSSLUP OR DFSSLUW SINCE THE OUTBUF PARAMETERS
   
   ENT.        REGARDS, TOM  SULLIVAN  -W951X05      MDS1
   0100    -ILINKGB      -P3S3-01/08/28-06:12 -XE RESPOND
   ONICALLY.  TOM: WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DFSDYNU0 SUBSTI-
   FOR DFS36010 IN THE DFSSLUP  DESCRIPTOR,  THE  LIST  I
   IS IDENTICAL TO THE ONE THAT FAILED ANF TO THE ONE BE-
   ED IN SEVERAL OTHER CONTROL REGIONS.   IT  HAS  ALWAYS
     FINE  AND  CONTINUES  TO DO SO IN THE OTHER REGIONS.
   HOW WOULD DFSSLUP BECOME THE DEFAULT  AND  WHAT  WOULD
    IMS  TO INVOKE THE DEFAULT? I WILL SET UP A TEST WITH
   SLUP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BUT THAT WILL TAKE A COUPLE
   S. THANKS, ===BOB=== -W951X05   MDS1        -5655B0100
   GB    -P3S3-01/08/28-06:37 -XE RESPOND ELECTRONICALLY.
   E AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:  1) WE ALWAYS  DO  LGEN;  MY
    NOTES  FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO STATES THAT DESCRIPTORS
    BE GENERATED WITH LGEN.     2) OUR ETOFEAT PARM SPEC-
   ETOFEAT=(YES,NO) AND 3) WE DO  NOT  HAVE  DFSDSCMX  IN
   B,  ONLY  DFSDSCTX.  ALSO,  WE RECEIVED NO NOTICE THAT
   W WAS IN ERROR. ===BOB===
   HE DEFAULT DESCRIPTOR  DFSSLUP  IS  USED  FOR  DYNAMIC
   EP  DEVICE  UNLESS  A DESCRIPTOR IS SPECIFIED WITH THE
    PARAMETER, AN LU NAME DESCRIPTOR EXISTS, OR THE LOGON
   PECIFIES ONE. SINCE THE LOGON EXIT MAY NOT  PROVIDE  A
   PTOR,  DFSCNXA0 ENSURES THAT A VALID DESCRIPTOR EXISTS
    THE EXIT IS CALLED. IN YOUR CASE NONE OF THE DESCRIP-
   XIST RESULTING IN THE ERROR MESSAGE.  THIS  DESIGN  IS
   ONABLE  SINCE  THERE  IS  NO REAL REASON TO REJECT THE
   IF THE LOGON EXIT IS GOING TO PROVIDE A VALID DESCRIP-
    BELIEVE IN YOUR CASE DFSSLUW IS SPEC- IFIED  BY  YOUR
    EXIT.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VALID DESCRIPTOR, THE LOGON
   READY BEEN REJECTED BECAUSE YOU DON'T  HAVE  AT  LEAST
   F  THE  OTHER  DESCRIPTORS DEFINED. PLEASE VERIFY THAT
   W IS SPECIFIED BY YOUR LOGON EXIT DFSLGNX0 RATHER THAN
   E LOGOND PARAMETER. IN THE MEANTIME, I WILL REVIEW THE
   M WITH DEVELOPMENT TO SEE IF THEY WILL ACCEPT AN  APAR
    CURRENT RELEASE.    REGARDS, TOM
     THANKS.  DFSSLUW  IS REQUESTED BY MY LOGON EXIT. I'M
   NTERESTED IN SATISFYING MYSELF  AS  TO  WHAT  HAPPENED
     AND KNOWING WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR IN THE FUTURE THAN
   N SUBMITTING AN APAR. YOUR EXPLANATION SEEMS  LIKE  IT
    BE  WHAT'S  HAPPENING, BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE
   O DFSSLUP DESCRIPTOR? THIS IS A FUTURE POSSIBILITY, AS
   TATIC SLUPS HAVE BEEN PHASED OUT, AND  THE  REST  WILL
   BE  DELETED, AS WELL. IF I HAVE TO KEEP THE DESCRIPTOR
   , I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT. ===BOB===
   ASED ON THE CURRENT DESIGN, IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE A DE-
   OR WITH THE LOGOND PARAMETER OR HAVE AN  LU  NAME  DE-
   OR  DEFINED  (AS  IN YOUR CASE AND IN MOST CASES), THE
   T DESCRIPTOR MUST BE AVAILABLE IN THE DESCRIPTOR TABLE
    LOGON WILL BE REJECTED EVEN IF YOUR LOGON EXIT SPECI-
    VALID DESCRIPTOR (AS IN YOUR CASE). SINCE WE  BELIEVE
    UNREASONABLE TO FORCE YOU TO INCLUDE DEFAULT DESCRIP-
   N YOUR TABLE THAT WILL NEVER BE USED, WE  ARE  WILLING
   E AN APAR TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE FIX FOR NOW WOULD BE
   URE THAT VALID DEFAULT DESCRIP- TORS ARE MAINTAINED IN
   TABLE.  THIS  "DESIGN RESTRICTION" WOULD BE REMOVED BY
   AR FIX. DEVELOPMENT WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THE OPTION  TO
    THE  APAR  'FIN' AND FIX THIS PROBLEM IN THE NEXT RE-
   IF THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. LET  US  KNOW  WHAT  YOU
       REGARDS, TOM
   APAR PQ52385 HAS BEEN CREATED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.
   DIS- CUSSED, IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE CLOSED 'FIN'  WITH
   PROVIDED IN THE NEXT RELEASE OF IMS.    REGARDS, TOM
