APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an ESQL module references a Java class, and the Java
   project containing the Java class is not referenced by the
   library or application containing the ESQL, a JAR file for the
   Java project is incorrectly added to the BAR file containing the
   library or application. The JAR file should not be added to the
   BAR file as the Java project is not referenced from the library
   or application.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove or close the unwanted project in the workspace to avoid
   it being pulled into the BAR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Toolkit who have Java projects in
   their workspace that are not referenced by libraries or
   applications, but contain Java classes that are referenced from
   ESQL modules in the libraries or applications.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When an ESQL module references a Java class, and the Java
   project containing the Java class is not referenced by the
   library or application containing the ESQL, a JAR file for the
   Java project is incorrectly added to the BAR file containing the
   library or application. The JAR file should not be added to the
   BAR file as the Java project is not referenced from the library
   or application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been updated to avoid adding unreferenced Java
   projects to BAR files as JAR files.
