 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Multiple vulnerabilities in Open Source Apache Tomcat reported by The Apache Software Foundation affect IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
 

CVEID: CVE-2017-15706 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15706]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the incorrect documentation of the CGI search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify which script to execute. The error resulted in the failure of some scripts to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138486 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138486] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-15698 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15698]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat Native Connector could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper handling of fields longer than 127 bytes when parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate. The parsing error resulted in the OCSP check being omitted and made it possible for client certificates that should have been rejected to be accepted.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138491 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/138491] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2018-1305 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraints that are defined by annotations of Servlets in certain cases. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2018-1304 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly enforce security constraint definitions that contain a URL pattern of "" (the empty string) that exactly maps to the context root. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass security constraints to access restricted resources.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5

Please get familiar with eFix readme in etc/<efix_name>_readme.txt 
Note that the eFix requires manual deletion of the external/apache-tomcat directory. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

The only solution is to apply eFix prepared to specific TADDM version (7.2.2.5 or 7.3.0.0). This fix is only tested for TADDM versions 7.2.2.5 or 7.3.0.0. Though, if applied to the other maintenance levels, it should not lead to any issue, but if it does, consider upgrading to the latest maintenance level to apply this fix.
