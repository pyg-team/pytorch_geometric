APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Resolution of variables in binariesURL in deployment.xml of
   application fails during update of application in WAS 6.0
   Network Deployment.
   
   During update of application, if deployment.xml has a variable
   in binariesURL it fails to resolve that variable
   defined. Application deployment needs this variable to
   be defined at dmgr scope level.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Application deployment needs variable defined at
   dmgr level if app deployment.xml has path variable in binary
   URL.

   ****************************************************************
   Resolution of variables in binariesURL in deployment.xml of
   application fails during the update of an application in
   Application Server 6.0 Network Deployment.
   
   Steps to recreate the problem
   
   Use a node with a standard (out of the box) server1
   configuration
   
   Add an environment variable for the WAR target directory to
   this node, for example  WAR_TARGET = c:\temp
   
   Deploy some test WARs / EARs with the $(WAR_TARGET) variable
   used as a target directory in the config dialog of the
   deployment wizard
   
   That is, in target directory field enter:
   $(WAR_TARGET)/installableApps
   
   Check that the binaries are deployed to the specified target
   directory and that the applicationss are running without errors.
   
   Check that the binary URL in deployment.xml of the test apps
   contains the $(WAR_TARGET) in the path specification
   
   Federate this node to DMgr
   
   Try to update 1 of the previous deployed test applications
   (the ones with the $(WAR_TARGET) var used)
   
   ==> You should get the undefined variable WAR_TARGET exception
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  We have made changes to the relevant code which resolves the
   problem.The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for
   inclusion in fixpack 6.0.2.2. Please refer to the Recommended
