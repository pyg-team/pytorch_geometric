ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Support for the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC  driver was added in
   Fix Pack 6.1.0.15. But it can not be selected as an option on
   the on administrative console if the user upgrades to
   Fix Pack 6.1.0.15 or later with existing profiles.
   
   This driver type can be selected as a database type in the
   administrative console only if the user installs Fix
   Pack 6.1.0.15 or later, and then creates a new profile.
   
   The Version 6.1 Information Center does not mention that a
   user, who has installed Fix Pack 6.1.0.15 or higher, can also
   define the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver as a user-defined
   database type, and then use it for profiles that were defined
   prior to the installation of Fix Pack 6.1.0.15 or later.
   
   This information needs to be added to the Information Center.

   The Version 6.1 Information Center topic "Data source minimum
   required settings for Microsoft SQL Server" does not
   indicates that support for Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver
   was added in Fix Pack 6.1.0.15, and that this new database
   type can be selected for 6.1.0.15 or later profiles. However,
   this topic does not mention that Users who have installed Fix
   Pack 6.1.0.15 or higher, and have profiles that were defined
   prior to the installation of Fix Pack 6.1.0.15, do not know
   that they can define the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver as a
   user-defined database type, and then use this driver for the
   profiles that were defined prior to the installation of Fix
   Pack 6.1.0.15 or later.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following paragraph will be added to the New Feature note
   about Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver support, that is
   contained in the Version 6.1 Information Center topic "Data
   source minimum required settings for Microsoft SQL Server:"
   
   If you already have profiles defined when you install Fix Pack
   6.1.0.15, or later, you cannot use the administrative console
   to select the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver as a database
   type for these profiles. However, if you want to use the
   Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver for one or more of the
   already existing profiles, you can add the Microsoft SQL
   Server JDBC driver as a new user-defined database type, and
   then associate this user-defined database type with those
   profiles.
   
   Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our
   information centers. Thus, the changes might exist in the
   current documentation before you read this text. To access the
   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.
   
   The modified documentation will be available in the February,
   2009 update to the Information Centers.
