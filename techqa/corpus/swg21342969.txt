Text:
Oracle DB2 SQL Server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The _days_between function is a Cognos function and will therefore require local processing. Are there database functions that will accomplish the same thing? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For most databases, subtracting one date column from another date column will return the days between.
