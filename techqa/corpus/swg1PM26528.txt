APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  UpdatePortal fails on a migrated profile with webdav item
   (null) could not be found.
   
   Reproduction Scenario:
   1. Migrate Portal 6.1 to Portal 7
   a. Install and configure Portal 6.1
   b. Install Portal 7 binary only (no profile)
   c. Use WAS migration to create a WAS 7 profile and migrate to
   it
   d. Use Portal migration to update the new WAS 7 profile to
   Portal 7
   
   Expected Results:
   UpdatePortal succeeds
   
   Actual Results:
   BUILD FAILED
   com.ibm.wps.resolver.webdav.tree.exceptions
   .WebdavItemNotFoundException: EJCBG0018E: The item [null] could
   not be found.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None available
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The filestore did not exist after the migration and thus the
   install failed when it tried to store data in it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added logic to setup the filestore before the other install step
   tries to store data in it.
