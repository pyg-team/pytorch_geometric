APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an XPATH match action rule is used in a processing policy
   and DataPower tries to match on a Non-XML request, an XML parse
   error is logged as expected and this is due to DataPower trying
   to parse the Non-XML message:
   
    xmlmgr (default): rule (default): implied action Parse input as
   XML, attempt pipeline failed: illegal character 'X' at offset 0
   of http://<ip>:<port>/uri [http://<ip>:<port>/uri]
   
   Although the XML parse error is logged, DataPower still proceeds
   to select and run the appropriate processing rule (a match ALL
   rule if configured). The issue seen is that, the INPUT context
   given to the selected processing rule is empty so the Non-XML
   message is not processed successfully and an error message is
   logged as follows:
    'Missing input on action'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If a multiprotocol gateway processing policy
   includes both URL-based and XPath-based matching rules, but
   the input message is not valid XML, then when the rule indicated
   by the URL match runs, it will fail with an "empty context"
   error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DataPower firmware releases 3.7.1.11,
   3.7.2.7, and 3.7.3.6 will be updated to resolve this issue.
