Title: IBM ICCSPWebService fails to install in IIS - United States

Text:
ICC; SharePoint; IIS; ICCSPWebService; wrong directory TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to install IBM Content Collector (ICC) for SharePoint on the Microsoft SharePoint Web Front End server(s) result in an incomplete installation of "ICCSPWebService" in the root of the C: drive instead of under the C:\Inetpub\wwwroot directory. 

SYMPTOM
The "ICCSPWebService" directory is created off the root of the C: drive instead of under the "\Inetput\wwwroot" directory.


CAUSE
The IBM Content Collector for SharePoint v2.1.x installer will fail if there is not a web site with an Identifier value of "1" defined in Internet Information Services (IIS) on the Microsoft SharePoint Web Front End server(s).

ENVIRONMENT
The issue occurs under these circumstances:


IBM Content Collector for SharePoint v2.1.1 or earlier is being installed. 

Microsoft IIS on the SharePoint Web Front End server does not have a web site with an "Identifier" value of "1" defined.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The issue does not exist with IBM Content Collector (ICC) v2.2 or later. 

For IBM Content Collector v2.1.1 or earlier, please follow these steps as a workaround on each Microsoft SharePoint Web Front End server: 

 1.  Open the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager. 
 2.  Verify that there are no existing web sites that have an "Identifier" value of "1". 
 3.  Create a new web site and ensure that its home directory is set to "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot". 
 4.  Note the "Identifier" value for the newly created web site (for example, "111222333"). 
 5.  Open a Command Window and run the following commands, substituting your new web site's "Identifier" value for "111222333":
     CSCRIPT C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts\adsutil.vbs STOP_SERVER W3SVC/111222333
     CSCRIPT C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts\adsutil.vbs MOVE W3SVC/111222333 W3SVC/1 
 6.  Verify that the new web site now has an "Identifier" value of "1". 
 7.  Uninstall and reinstall the InfoSphere Content Collector for SharePoint component. 
 8.  Verify that "ICCSPWebService" now shows up in the IIS "Web Sites" and "Application Pools". 
 9.  Verify that the C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ICCSPWebService directory now exists. 
 10. Launch the SharePoint Administration console. 
 11. Verify that the IBM Content Collector feature exists in the SharePoint Site Collection.
