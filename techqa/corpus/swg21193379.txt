Title: IBM Servlet Request Processor Exception: Virtual Host/WebGroup Not Found - Favicon.ico - United States

Text:
WASRUN; WASENG TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When accessing the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, you could see an error similar to the following:

Servlet Request Processor Exception: Virtual Host/WebGroup Not Found : The web group /favicon.ico has not been defined 

CAUSE
This can occur when accessing content directly from a WebSphere Application Server internal port, bypassing the plug-in, when there is no Web module with the context root of "/". You could also see this error when using the WebSphere Administrative Console because it accesses the administrative console application through an internal port. 

favicon.ico is an icon displayed by browsers next to the URL or in the favorites menu and is purely aesthetic. The condition causing the favicon.ico request by the browser is browser dependent.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This message can be safely ignored. To avoid this messages in the logs, you could deploy a Web module (WAR) with a context root of "/" that contains a favicon.ico file. A sample WAR file to deploy can be found at the bottom of this page. 



You will be unable to install the WAR to dmgr from the administrative console. You should use wsadmin to do so. Here are the instructions:

1. Start the wsadmin tool from the Install_Root/bin directory:
wsadmin.sh/bat

2. Install:
$AdminApp install Install_Root/installableApps/favicon.war {-node <<NodeName>> -cell <<CellName>> -server dmgr -appname favicon -contextroot /}

3. Save the changes:
$AdminConfig save

4.List all the applications:
$AdminApp list 

 

For further information on deploying a WAR, please refer to the appropriate documentation in the WebSphere Application Server Product Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/library/]. 

If you encounter a similar problem for your application rather than the administrative console application, you can install the below war file to the "/" context root to fix the problem. If a web module already exists with the "/" context root, add a favicon.ico file to the base of the war file with context root "/".
