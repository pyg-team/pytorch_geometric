Title: IBM Status Gauge in JazzSM 1.1.3 (Dash 3.1.3) Appears Pixelated - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does the Status Gauge widget showing TBSM service status appear pixelated on my page? It was working fine before. 

CAUSE
There was a change in JazzSM/Dash to allow the use of custom status icons from the dataset connected to the widget, which in this case is the TBSM dataset. Currently, TBSM is returning Status Gauge images in PNG format which does not scale well and causes the pixelated look. Please see the comparison in appearance below:

ANSWER
This is a known issue, and will be fixed in TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 5. 


Furthermore in JazzSM 1.1.3, when the status gauge is first dropped on the page without being connected to any dataset, it uses DASH's sample dataset, which is also returning a PNG format image this causing the pixelated appearance. This will be fixed in future releases of JazzSM/Dash.
