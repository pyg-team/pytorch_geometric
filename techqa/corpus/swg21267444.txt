PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote addresses a problem that occurs with version 7.x of IBM® Rational® ClearQuest® running on UNIX®-based operating systems. When connecting remotely to the machine with Cygwin, ClearQuest could hang when launching. 

SYMPTOM
When using Cygwin/X to remotely connect to a UNIX based machine, launching ClearQuest can result in the program hanging. The splash screen may load after an extended period of time, but will appear discolored. In some cases, the actually client will load, but will be unresponsive to mouse or keyboard input.

CAUSE
This problem is related to a known issue between Cygwin and the Eclipse IDE. This problem can cause Eclipse based applications to hang during start up. This problem is referenced in the WebSphere Application Server Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tins_aixsetup.html]: 



Restriction: There are known issues with using Cygwin/X to run Eclipse-based applications on remote AIX machines. This affects your use of the Profile Management tool and the Installation Factory. With Cygwin/X on remote AIX, for example, a splash screen for the Profile Management tool appears but the Profile Management tool never actually comes up. 

For details of existing Bugzilla reports on these issues, see the information at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36806 [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36806]. 

If a different X server (such as Hummingbird Exceed) is used, these problems do not occur.


ENVIRONMENT
This behavior has been observed on, but may not be limited to, the Sun Solaris and IBM AIX® operating systems.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If users are experiencing this behavior when using Cygwin/X for remote access, it is recommend that an alternative X Window server program be used for remote access.
