QUESTION
 Our TRIRIGA server is configured to use SSL. Whenever one of my users accesses the GIS tab on a location record or refreshes their home page that has the GIS portal loaded, 
a 
mixed content message appears. Is there any way to make these mixed content messages stop occurring?
We are using an External GIS Server. 


CAUSE
Your TRIRIGA system is https but it is trying to access the GIS servers through http. Your browser is blocking it, thus the mixed content messages. 

ANSWER
Set ArcGIS in your TRIRIGA environment up to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. 


The easiest way to do this is to go back through the steps you took for 'Specifying External ArcGIS Servers,' [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHEB3_3.4.1/com.ibm.tap.doc/con_esri/t_esri_specify_external_arcgis_servers.html?lang=en] but 
before uploading the 'EsriJS_arcgis.js' file 
to [HOME] => Tools => 'System Setup' => System => 'Class Loader' => EsiJS => EsriJS_arcgis.js file, 
change the file contents to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. 
Just do a global replace of all instances of 'http:' with 'https:' 

If you do not feel comfortable in doing this, a manual approach for fixing this problem can be taken, instead: 

 * To make mixed content messages when accessing the GIS tab on location records stop happening, do the following:  * 
    * 
    * Integration Object
    * 
    * change the URLs to use HTTPS
    * 
   
   
 * To make mixed content messages with the [HOME] page's GIS portal stop happening do the following:  * 
    * 
    * Basemaps
    * 
    * make each URL use HTTPS instead of HTTP
