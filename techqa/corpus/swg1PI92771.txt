APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After the customer switched to using *CRASTART method, there
   were several Endevor API errors issued
   while retrieving number of dependencies from element component
   list. This causes dependency list
   processing to fail leading to return code 4038.
   
   In the CARMALOG output, several API errors can be observed:
   
   CRANDVRA touched DD CARMALOG on 30 Oct 2017 at 15:01:31.926164
   (startup)
   CARMA v2.0 is initializing at Mon Oct 30 15:01:34 2017

   01.When invoking the search request, if the storage area used
      for the response is not initialized, this may cause errors
      when processing the request. The subsequent requests may
      fail as a result.
   02.This update matches the fix for IBM Debug Tool APAR PI81873 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI81873].
   03.When debugging COBOL V4, the listing listing reader was not
      processing some variables correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The IBM IDz Endevor integration has been changed to
      initialize the response area prior to each request.
   02.This update matches the fix for IBM Debug Tool APAR PI81873 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI81873].
   03.The Integrated Debugger engine was updated to correctly
      process variables in the COBOL V4 listing, so that variables
      are displayed.
