APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have run the case study for Spatial Association Rules, using
   the files and options choices in that exercise. However, the
   output in the Case Study shows 10 rules displayed in the map and
   rules tables, while only 4 rules are displayed in your output.
   You did not sort the data files before running the analysis.
   Also, when you requested 20 rules in the /MAPOUTPUT DISPLAY
   subcommand, you received a warning that the maximum was 10
   rules. The Command Syntax Reference mentions a default of 5 but
   lists no maximum. A maximum should be listed in the Command
   Syntax Reference.
