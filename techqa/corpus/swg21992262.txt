PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Our IT is planning to move to Windows 10 with the browser Edge.

Does ARA 5.0 support the new browser? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As of October 2016: Only IE 11 is supported in the present releases. 

My understanding is that there may yet be a long tail of IE 11 support from Microsoft, especially in corporate environments, so we have time.
