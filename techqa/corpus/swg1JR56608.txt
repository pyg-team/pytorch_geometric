APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you run the BPMUpdateSystemApp wsadmin command to update
   system data toolkit content to the latest version, broken
   relationships occur across the LSW_PARTICIPANT and
   LSW_PARTICIPANT_GROUP tables for the teams defined in the system
   data toolkit.
   This issue occurs because these relationships are lost when the
   command runs. As a result, team bindings from this toolkit are
   not shown in the Process Admin Console.
