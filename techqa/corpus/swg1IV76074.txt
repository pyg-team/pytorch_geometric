APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem:
   The Windows OS Agent can wrongly send the same alert twice when
   evaluating  situations defined on the File Change attribute
   group, if  the situation is defined with an associated reflex
   action.
   Note that in general it can happen to receive more than one
   alert  after a single external modification to a file monitored
   by a situation  on File Change, depending on the number of
   notifications the agent  receives from the Windows operating
   system, that may map the external  action on the file into a
   set of internal changes.
   
   The bug that will be fixed by this APAR is instead a real
   duplication  of alerts being sent for the very same kind of
   file change.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   This issue affects all of the Windows OS agent versions and
   does not  depend on the Windows operating system version.
   
   Diagnostics:
    RAS1 logs at (UNIT:KRA ALL)(UNIT:knt all) are needed and the
    definitions of all the situations on the File Change group.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Duplicate alerts triggered by situations on the File Change
   attribute group.
   
   
   Situations on the File Change attribute group of the Monitoring
   Agent for Windows OS may send duplicate alerts when the
   condition evaluates true, if a reflex action is defined.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fixed to avoid sending duplicated alerts.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   
   | FixPack    | 6.3.0-TIV-ITM-FP0006
   | InterimFix | 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_WIN-IF0005
