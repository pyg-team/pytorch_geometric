APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Duplicate IDs in Rich Text editor sections of  IBM Rational
   Quality Manager (RQM) artifacts  causes pdf export to fail
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Using Microsoft  Word or any other editor, create an HTML
   file which contains at least two header nodes with the same ID,
   like this:
   
   <h1 dir="ltr" id="_1403038735295" style="margin: 1em 0px 0px;
   padding: 2px; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: normal; border: 2px
   solid transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,
   sans-serif;">1. Introduction</h1>
   <h1 dir="ltr" id="_1403038735295" style="margin: 1em 0px 0px;
   padding: 2px; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: normal; border: 2px
   solid transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial,
   sans-serif;">2. Chapter 1</h1>
   
   2. Open the file in a browser, select the text (make sure to
   include the headers) and copy the selection.
   3. Create a Test Plan in RQM. Add Summary and then click on
   Business Objectives section.
   4. Paste the HTML selection into the Business Objectives
   section.
   5. Save the Test Plan.
   6. Click on the PDF export options  and click on "Export
   Detail".
   
   Expected Result:
   The Manage Export Job queue shows the Document being created
   successfully.
   
   Actual Result:
   A red "X" is shown in the status column for the document,
   indicating the export failed. Document cannot be downloaded.

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update the ids in the xml of the test artifact  so that there
   are no duplicates and upload the xml back into RQM.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Prevent HTML duplicated IDs on RTE sections to avoid PDF /   *
   * CSV failures                                                 *

   *                                                              *
   * Rich Text sections such as Test Plan's Business Objectives   *
   * allows user to enter text copied from HTML sources which in  *
   * some cases might include attributes like DOM node IDs        *
   * (specially when copying from MS Word). When for some reason  *
   * these IDs are duplicated, most of current browsers are able  *
   * to ignore the issue and thus there's no visual indication of *
   * a problem. However, that anomaly is saved in the DB and when *
   * the artifact is submitted to be exported to PDF / CSV        *
   * format, the HTML code requires to be validated and then the  *
   * duplicate ID issue throws an exception, breaking the         *
   * exporting job and thus marking the export as failed. This is *
   * the issue.                                                   *
