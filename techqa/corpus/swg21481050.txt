Title: IBM Problem with Group Reservations for Sentinel RMS License Manager 8.1 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I've followed the documentation to create several group reservations in the new Sentinel RMS License Manager 8.1 shipped with SPSS Version 16, among other products. Even though the documentation indicates that you can have up to 256 members per group, and I can see all members I've added to the group using the Wlsgrmgr tool, the License Manager doesn't appear to be actually reading the entire membership list. There are clearly licenses available but some of my group members from later in the list are being rejected.

I know resolution 65558 dicusses a problem with physical line length in the lsreserv file in the 7.3.0.9 version and shows a way you can hand-edit the file using \s as continuation characters. I tried that, but it still doesn't help.

What's wrong? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been fixed by SafeNet in the Sentinel RMS License Manager version 8.2. This version or a later one will be available beginning with SPSS PASW Statistics version 18.0, scheduled for release in the second half of 2009. If you need it sooner, please contact SPSS Technical Support.

It appears that the Sentinel RMS License Manager 8.1 now has a 2100-character restriction on the total length of the readable line. The Wlsgrmgr tool will display the entire membership, but the manager will only evaluate those member names that appear in the group through 2099 characters -- even spread across lines with continuation characters.

Until you can upgrade to the later release, the only workaround is to restrict each group membership list to 256 members or fewer, and no more than 2099 characters total.
