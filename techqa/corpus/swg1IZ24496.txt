   Steps to replicate: 1) Configure Impact in Cluster mode ( ie,
   with 2 servers, Primary and Secondary) 2) Start Primary Server
   3) Sart Secondar Sever 4) Configure any service ( ie,
   EventReader or JMSListener) 5) Start the Service 6) Stop
   Primary server so that secondary becomes primary 7) The Service
   will stay in standby mode. You may see a yellow light next to
   the service name or red light NOTE: Make sure that the service
   is not set to autostartup.
