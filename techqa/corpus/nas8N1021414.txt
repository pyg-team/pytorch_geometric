 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have Python installed on my IBM i. How do I make sure it is up to date? 

ANSWER
Once you have Python installed on your IBM i (Options 2 and 4 of licensed program 5733OPS), you will need to apply PTFs to get the latest updates and then install the add-ons. 

The following link contains the current PTFs for Python:

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/Python%20PTFs [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/Python%20PTFs]

Once you have the PTFs applied, you need to update the add-ons for the following:

o Native DB2 Connector
o DB2 Django Interface
o Toolkit for IBM i
o FastCGI gateway support
o Lightweight Web Framework

To do this, issue the following from a command line:

CALL QP2TERM

This will bring up a shell command line. The following link has the commands you need to enter to install the new versions of the add-ons that were provided by the PTFs:

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/Installing%20shipped%20add-ons [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20i%20Technology%20Updates/page/Installing%20shipped%20add-ons]

These links will be updated each time a new set of PTFs are released. Each time the new PTFs are released, you will need to install the add-ons.
