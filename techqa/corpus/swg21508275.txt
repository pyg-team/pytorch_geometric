Title: IBM ldap-server-config attribute missing in ivacld.conf - United States

Text:
ldap.conf pdacld ivacld TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why is the ldap-server-config attribute missing from the ivacld.conf file? 

CAUSE
ivacld.conf.template file in TAM versions 5.1, 6.0, and 6.1 did not have this attribute, so when pdacld instances are configured, ivacld.conf will not include the ldap-server-config setting... also, for environments upgraded / migrated from one of these versions, legacy ivacld.conf files might not have been updated to include the ldap-server-config setting 

ANSWER
the ldap-server-config attribute can be added under the [ldap] stanza in ivacld.conf for any configured (existing) pdacld instances, in order to have pdacld reference a specific ldap.conf for purposes of setting up ldap replicas and failover/load-balancing schemes, etc... 

** Note: for the topic of TAM components with respect to LDAP failover and load balancing, refer to the following technote:
