PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the IBM Business Monitor server is taking a long time to start, in the order of hours, there might be security software running on the system that causes a conflict with the file scanning operation in IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Monitor. 

SYMPTOM
In a combined profile with IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Monitor, if the system is running a security software, such as Digital Guardian, there might be an adverse impact on the server start time due to the following error: 


Startup thread hang with WSVR0605W as below:
WSVR0605W: Thread "server.startup : 1" (00000051) has been active for
730750 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s) in total
in the server that may be hung. 
at java.io.WinNTFileSystem.getBooleanAttributes(Native Method)
at java.io.File.isDirectory(File.java:765)
at org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.commonarchivecore.internal.strategy
.DirectoryLoadStrategyImpl.addNextFromBinariesDirectory
(DirectoryLoadStr ategyImpl.java:1369)


The performance degradation occurs when the system scans a large enterprise archive (EAR) file with large number of sub directories and files, such as the Cognos.ear file.


CAUSE
The Digital Guardian software has a conflict with the file scanning operation in IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Monitor.


ENVIRONMENT
This issue is only observed in Microsoft Windows 7 running the Digital Guardian software.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To diagnose the issue, see if the server takes an abnormal amount of time to start. You can also check if the following error message exists:

Startup thread hang with WSVR0605W as below:
WSVR0605W: Thread "server.startup : 1" (00000051) has been active for
730750 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are 1 thread(s) in total
in the server that may be hung. 
at java.io.WinNTFileSystem.getBooleanAttributes(Native Method)
at java.io.File.isDirectory(File.java:765)
at org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.commonarchivecore.internal.strategy
.DirectoryLoadStrategyImpl.addNextFromBinariesDirectory
(DirectoryLoadStr ategyImpl.java:1369)



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue you can disable Digital Guardian, or configure Digital Guardian to allow IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Monitor to scan their own directories.
