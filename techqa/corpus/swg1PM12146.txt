LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Request for module FXXZCBLH exceeds maximum USE count.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Assembler program FXXZCBL fetches 'C' program FXXZCBLH.
   Each fetch is like a LOAD and will load a copy of FXZZCBLH
   into memory. For an API program that calls FXXZCBL many
   times, the maximum USE count on FXXZCBLH can be exceeded.
   FXXZCBL will be changed to only fetch FXXZCBLH one time
   during Service Director initialization. And will release
   FXXZCBLH during Service Director termination. FXXZCBLH's
   address will be kept in a name/token for all FXXZCBL calls
   after initialization.
