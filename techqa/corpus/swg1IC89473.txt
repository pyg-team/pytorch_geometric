APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Tivoli Storage Manager Administration Center prereqcheck.bin
   checks for the libXm.so.3 library by querying the RPM database
   for the openmotif-libs-32bit RPM and listing the included files.
   This library is not included in the openmotif-libs-32bit
   package in Suse 11, but instead is included in the package
   openmotif22-libs-32bit. This will cause an incorrect  failure
   message to appear in the prereqcheck.log file if the
   libXm.so.3 file is already installed with
   openmotif22-libs-32bit.
   
   
   
   Customer/L2 Diagnostics:
   
   Output from the prereqcheck.log.0 log file will show:
   
    SEVERE : Checking rpm -ql openmotif-libs-32bit | grep
   libXm.so.3:
   Failed (from com.tivoli.dsm.check.TSMEnvironmentRuleHelper.log)
   
   .
   Initial Impact:
   Medium
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:
   6.3 Administration Center on Suse 11
   
   Additional Keywords:
   openmotif admin admincenter prereckchecker
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install libXm.so.3 via the openmotif22-libs-32bit package on
   your SuSE 11 system,
   and then bypass the prerequiste checker by installing
   AdminCenter with the following flag:
   
    ./install.bin -DBYPASS_TSM_REQ_CHECKS=true
