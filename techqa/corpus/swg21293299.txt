PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A WebSphere MQ queue manager is experiencing a problem while handling a client connection from another system, and you need to collect MustGather data to find a solution. 

ENVIRONMENT
These instructions apply only to WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 and V5.3 on HP NonStop Server. Although WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 and V5.3 does not support client applications connecting to other systems, it does allow incoming client connections from remote systems. Refer to the IBM MQ Read First page for instructions on other operating systems and to the MQ Client Troubleshooting guide for self-help on this topic:



 * IBM MQ Read First [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618728]

 * Troubleshooting MQ Clients [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21620866]



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Please answer these questions about the problem and then follow the steps below:



 * What client connection problem did you observe on the system?
 * What time did the client connection problem start and when did it stop?
 * Which operating system and MQ version is the client using to connect?
 * Which SVRCONN channel, queues, and other objects does the client application use?



STEP 1: GENERATE DATA

If the client problem is reproducible or is happening right now, generate data to provide more information about the problem:



 1. 
 2. Generate a trace of the queue manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667375] while the client connection problem is happening.
 3. 
 4. 
 5. Generate a simultaneous MQ trace of the client application which is connecting to the HP NonStop queue manager:
    
     * Linux and UNIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665357]
     * Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21666876]
     * IBM i [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664990]
    
     * Java or JMS client [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21174924]
     * HP Integrity NonStop Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667396]
     * HP OpenVMS [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21667361]

STEP 2: COLLECT DATA
 1.  
 2.  Record the MQ version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621707].
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  Record the operating system version and maintenance level [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634678].
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  Use runmqsc to record the configuration of the queue manager and of the queues and the SVRCONN channel which the application uses when it runs. If any command gives an error, carry on with the others:
 9.   
     DISPLAY QMGR ALL 
     DISPLAY QLOCAL(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY QALIAS(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY QREMOTE(*) ALL 
     DISPLAY CHANNEL(*) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) ALL 
     
 10. 
 11. 
 12. Use the sdcp script to package your files for IBM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21671892], including files containing the output from the commands listed in Step 1 and 2.
 13. 



STEP 3: SEND DATA TO IBM
 1.  
 2.  Send your data to the IBM ECuRep repository [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/send.html] by email to websphere_support@ecurep.ibm.com, or by standard or secure HTTP or FTP.
 3.  
 4.  
 5.  While the data is transferring, send an email or use the IBM Service Request tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/] to update your PMR with your description of the problem and of the data you are sending.
 6.  
 7.  
 8.  A good description of the problem and the data is the most important information you can provide to IBM. Please do not send data without providing a description!
 9.  
 10. Contact your country representative [http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/] if you need to speak to an IBM technical support representative, or in the US call 1-800-IBM-SERV. Refer to the IBM Software Support Handbook [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/handbook/home.html] for more information on working with IBM.
