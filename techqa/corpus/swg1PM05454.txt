ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The CICS region took abend0C4 's in DFHTSPT offset x'92E' during
   a SOS for below the line UDSA storage. The abend0C4s are
   occurring for tasks that are trying to RETRIEVE data from
   DFxxxxxx queues. DFHTSPT is processing a GET_RELEASE_SET
   request, and fails on a MVC instruction (D207 F000 AC7E) with
   Reg15 containing zeroes. This instruction is trying to copy the
   >TSIOA eyecatcher into SET storage. The SET storage should have
   been acquired from an unconditional GETMAIN in DFHTSPT.
   .
   It appears that the GETMAIN for SET storage failed, probably due
   to the task being timed-out while waiting for storage. But
   DFHTSPT issues a Lock Manager call to regain the TS lock before
   checking the response from DFHSMGF for the GETMAIN. The Lock
   Manager call uses the same parameter list as the GETMAIN so
   would overwrite the GETMAIN response.

   CICS was short on storage. A started task issued an EXEC
   CICS RETRIEVE command to retrieve the FROM data passed to
   it by the START command. Interval control called
   temporary storage to return the data. DFHTSPT issued
   a conditional getmain to acquire set storage to move the
   temporary storage data into. This failed with a reason of
   insufficient storage. DFHTSPT then called lock manager to
   release the domain lock, before calling storage manager
   to perform an unconditional getmain. This could time out or
   be purged. However, DFHTSPT then called the lock manager to
   reacquire the domain lock before analysing the response
   to the storage manager call. Since DFHTSPT is defined to
   use the same area of automatic storage for lmlm_parms
   and smgf_parms, the response and reason codes from
   the getmain were by now overwritten by those from the
   lock manager call. DFHTSPT interpreted the response as
   being one of smgf_ok, so attempted to move data into what it
   thought was the storage area from the getmain. Since no
   address was returned, this tried to move data into low-core,
   and a protection exception / abend akea took place.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHTSPT has been changed to define the storage for lmlm_parms as
   separate to the union of plists used by its other domain calls.
