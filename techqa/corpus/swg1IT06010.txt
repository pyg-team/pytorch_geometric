APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to provision a new Virtual Machine (VM) using
   the "Self-Service->Request new Servers" menu option in
   SMARTCLOUD ORCHESTRATOR 2.3.0.1 cfix5, the following error is
   encountered.
   
   "OpenStack reported the following message: Malformed request
   url"
   
   This problem impacts any user that is not in the "admin"
   project.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The following is a work-around to this problem.
   
   1. Open config file:
   /opt/ibm/rainmaker/purescale.app/private/expanded/ibm/scp.ui-1.0
   .0/config/openstack.config
   2. Modify section "openstack" by adding "cache_service_versions"
   parameter with value false. After this change is made, openstack
   section should be similar to one below.
   
   "openstack": {
         "server_operation_timeout_sec": 3600,
          "server_operation_check_interval_sec": 10,
           "cache_service_versions": false,
           "image_service":"vil"
   },
   
   3. Restart IWD:   service iwd restart
   
   After following these steps, the problem should be resolved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users of IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.3 FixPack 1 with iFix5
   applied may encounter a problem with provisioning virtual
   machines in custom projects. The deployment fails with the
   following message: "OpenStack reported the following message:
   Malformed request url".
   IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator 2.3 FixPack 1 iFix5 introduced a
   performance fix, by which OpenStack service versions are
   cached. The caching module had a defect which resulted in
   inappropriate rewriting of project-relative URLs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code of the caching module has been updated to perform
   per-project caching of service URLs
