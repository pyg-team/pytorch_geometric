Title: IBM SiteProtector Event Collector debug logs - United States

Text:
SP; EC; trace; log TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you generate debug logs for SiteProtector's Event Collector component? 

CAUSE
The Event Collector component of SiteProtector is used to collect events from the Agent Manager for newer sensors and from older sensors directly. Once it collects events from these sources, it sends them to the SiteProtector Database for storage. If an issue with the Event Collector is suspected, IBM Support might request the logs that are generated by the instructions in this Technote.

Important: The instructions in this article apply only if the Event Collector is communicating with SiteProtector. If the Event Collector is in a Not Responding status, you will instead need to follow the steps in Technote 1692917: SiteProtector Event Collector manual debug logs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692917].


ANSWER
Follow these instructions to generate and collect the logs:


 1. Open the SiteProtector Console and go to the Agent view.
    
 2. Right-click the entry for the Event Collector in question and select Properties.
    
 3. In the left pane, click the Agent Properties icon.
    
 4. In the right pane, locate the Event Collector tracing section in the General tab and change the value of the E.C. trace level field from Error to Debug.
    
 5. Go to Action > Save to save your changes.
    
 6. Replicate the issue that we are troubleshooting or wait at least 10 minutes.
    
 7. Add the following directory to a compressed file:
    
    \Program Files\ISS\SiteProtector\Event Collector\Logs\
    
 8. Revert the changes that were made to the Event Collector settings in Steps 1 - 5 to disable debug logging.
    
    Important: If you skip this step, the log files can grow to a very large size and cause disk space issues on the server.
    
 9. Send the compressed file containing the logs to Support by using Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep) [http://www.ibm.com/de/support/ecurep/index.html].
