QUESTION
 How to run a nzraidcheck and collect the results? 

CAUSE
IBM support has requested a nzraidcheck to verify the storage disks.

ANSWER
To run a nzraidcheck, issue the following command, as NZ user: 

$ /nz/kit/bin/adm/tools/nzraidcheck -mode checkOnly

or to run in background - 
$ nohup /nz/kit/bin/adm/tools/nzraidcheck -mode checkOnly &

To check status of NZRAIDCHECK
$ /nz/kit/bin/adm/tools/nzraidcheck -mode show

This can be ran with the system state 'Online' and the process can be stopped and restarted, as needed, until complete.

Please review the output of the command once it reaches 100% and return the output to support.

If the results indicate any issues are found, issue the following command, as NZ user, for the complete table and return the output to support.

$ nzsql -c "select * from SYSTEM..V_NZRAIDCHECK_ERROR_DETAIL_LATEST"
