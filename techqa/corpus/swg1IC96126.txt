APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When executing a SFTP Get service using parm
   "RemoteFilePattern" and filename contains a wild card to pull
   all files, all files never pull down and BP hangs in
   Waiting_On_IO. It was determined this only occurs when there is
   an attempt to get a file the contains a space, for example a
   filename of positions.txt 2 (a space is just prior to the 2).
   
   The SI SFTP Client log during the SFTP Get post error
   'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is
   specified.'
   
   To recreate this issue:
   Execute a BP that contains the SFTP Client Get service with
   parm RemoteFilePattern and filename contains a wild card to
   attempt to retrieve all files from the SFTP server.
   Ensure at least 1 of the files on the remote SFTP contains a
   space, for example filename of positions.txt 2 (see a space is
   just prior to the 2).
   This test will result in the SFTP Get service hangs in
   Waiting_On_IO. Also the SFTP Client log should post error
   'INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is
   specified.'
   Note:  You will need to manually go into the SI UI
   Troubleshooter screen and terminate this hung BP.
