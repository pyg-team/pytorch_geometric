Title: IBM SSL/TLS handshake failure when sending file with Connect Direct adapter and Secure+ - United States

Text:
b2b; CD TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using 2 Connect Direct nodes the connection is broken after the certificate exchange process. The following error is obtained: 
[2014-04-17 04:19:33.236] DEBUG PNodeConnection.execute() - uh oh, got an exception returning from pSession execute successfully on Pnode Session Id= FTA-DEV_CDSERVER_ADAPTER_node1P0001148702602L41:3691 Exception= MSGID=JMGR020E,RC=8,FDBK=1,CLMTHNAME=SecureConnectStep.execute,
CDTXT="SSL/TLS handshake failure. Protocol send or receive failed during handshake.
If error persists check for possible SSL/TLS configuration issues.
Low-level protocol error message ID is: JMGR012I Thread=Thread-33632 

SYMPTOM
Getting handshake errors when activating Secure+ in the source and destination nodes. The transfer is working OK when Secure+ is disabled.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
System certificates of both nodes have been delivered by the same Certificate Authority with a 3 level certification chain. The file is sent successfully from one of the two Connect Direct nodes using Secure+ to independent UNIX node. 

The following error is obtained when trying to connect both Connect Direct nodes: 
[2014-04-17 04:19:33.236] DEBUG PNodeConnection.execute() - uh oh, got an exception returning from pSession execute successfully on Pnode Session Id= FTA-DEV_CDSERVER_ADAPTER_node1P0001148702602L41:3691 Exception= MSGID=JMGR020E,RC=8,FDBK=1,CLMTHNAME=SecureConnectStep.execute,
CDTXT="SSL/TLS handshake failure. Protocol send or receive failed during handshake.
If error persists check for possible SSL/TLS configuration issues.
Low-level protocol error message ID is: JMGR012I Thread=Thread-33632


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The changes must be recognised and updated by Sterling Integrator (SI). 

The Connect Direct adapters on both nodes must be stopped and restarted for the changes to be recognised by SI, 
Communication between both nodes will then be successful when using Secure+.
