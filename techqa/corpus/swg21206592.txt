 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What is the recommended procedure for installing WebSphere Application Server (WAS) fixpacks on a system with Tivoli Access Manager Web Portal Manager (WPM)? 

ANSWER
When WebSphere fixpacks are installed, they replace the PD.jar that TAM (WPM) is using with their own one, which is different. This will cause the WPM to fail. As a result, the TAM files need to be put back. There are different ways to do this (only need to do one of them)... 

1) use the pdjrtecfg command to unconfigure the java runtime, and then re-configure it..
pdjrtecfg -action unconfig -java_home {jre_home| all}
pdjrtecfg -action config -host policy_server_host -port policy_server_port -java_home jre_home [-domain domain_name] -config_type full

2) using the regular pdconfig tool, you can simply unconfigure and re-configure the web portal manager (including the java runtime)

3) after installing the WAS fix, you can run the {TAM_HOME}/sbin/pdjrteupg command 

(it doesn't matter in this case if you use the "full" or "standalone" option)
