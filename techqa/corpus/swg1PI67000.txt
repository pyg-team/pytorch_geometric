ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), when scrolling
   within a module by using the scroll bar or the mouse wheel, the
   module is scrolling to random places or back to the initial
   positions. Sometimes, the scroll bar jumps independently from a
   position to another and back again for many times.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   - In a module with over 300 artifacts and a dozen columns in the
   view, scroll through the requirements after using the Search and
   Replace function
   
   Expected Results:
   Scrolling brings the user to the expected position.
   
   Actual Results:
   Scrolling brings the user somewhere else or back to initial
   position.
