APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS NEW FUNCTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This feature is to enhance Audit Log Header to include the type
   of security/protocol is being established on a connection
   (ie: SSLV3, TLS10, TLS11, TLS12).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No known Work around
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Currently SDS is capable of supporting SSL V3.0, TLS V1.0,
   TLS V1.1 and TLS V1.2 secure connection protocols.
   
   If end user does SSL port based operations like
   search/adds/deletes/unbinds, Audit log header only shows 'SSL'
   and for startTLS based operation it only logs 'TLS'.
   
   This enhancement is to include SSLV3, TLS10, TLS11, or TLS12
   keywords based on the underlying secure protocol version that?s
   in use.
   For example, "SSL" will be replaced by "SSL TLS12" when TLS v1.2
   is used via SSL port. Similarly "TLS" will be replaced by
   "STARTTLS TLS12" when TLS v1.2 is used via startTLS operation on
   regular non-SSL port.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
   maintenance packages:
   | VA release | 8.0.1.7-ISS-ISDS_20180701-2312 |
