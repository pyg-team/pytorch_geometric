Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect WebSphere Lombardi Edition and IBM Business Process Manager (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The LogJam Attack on Diffie-Hellman ciphers (CVE-2015-4000) may affect some configurations of IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile and IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile that are shipped as a component of WebSphere Lombardi Edition and IBM Business Process Manager. The IBM HTTP Server used by WebSphere Application Server is not affected. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION:The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 

 * IBM Business Process Manager V7.5.x through V8.5.6.0 
 * WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.x



For earlier unsupported versions of the products, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version of the product. REMEDIATION/FIXES
Please consult the security bulletin Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2015-4000) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21957980]for vulnerability details and information about fixes. 
The following setting in java.secruity allows you to reenable ciphers using DH and DHE key exchange that you had to disable as a temporary workaround:
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize <768 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None
