APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS USER ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have installed Modeler Server on Linux Power LE and made sure
   I have installed libxlc and libxlsmp.
   I have installed R 3.2.2.
   When I run ./SPSS_Modeler_REssentials_18.0_Power_LE.bin I get:
   The installation of IBM SPSS Modeler Essentials for R is
   finished, but some
   serious errors occurred during the installation.  Please see the
   installation
   log for details.
   The logs show:
   g++: error: argument to '-G' should be a non-negative integer
   make: *** [ibmspsscf83.so] Error 1
   ERROR: compilation failed for package 'ibmspsscf83'
   * removing '/usr/local/lib/R/library/ibmspsscf83'
   
   and
   
   Custom Action:            com.ibm.spss.ia.MakeFailure_IA
                             Status: FATAL ERROR
                             Additional Notes: FATAL ERROR -
   class com.ibm.spss.ia.MakeFailure_IA FatalInstallException:
   Error: Failed to install R plugin
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Install the IBM XL C/C++ and IBM XL Fortran compilers, then
   install R from
   source and configure it like this:
   
   export CC="<XLC_PATH>/bin/xlc_r -q64"
   export CFLAGS="-g -O2 -qstrict -qfloat=nomaf:fenv"
   export F77="<XLF_PATH>/xlf_r -q64"
   export FFLAGS="-g -O3 -qstrict -qfloat=nomaf:fenv -qextname"
   export CXX="<XLC_PATH>/bin/xlC_r -q64"
   export CPICFLAGS=-qpic
   export CXXPICFLAGS=-qpic
   export FPICFLAGS=-qpic
   export SHLIB_LDFLAGS=-qmkshrobj
   export SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS=-G
   export FC="<XLF_PATH>/xlf95_r -q64"
   export FCFLAGS="-g -O3 -qstrict -qfloat=nomaf:fenv -qextname"
   export FCPICFLAGS=-qpic
   export CXX1XSTD=-qlanglvl=extended0x
   
   Where <XLC_PATH> and <XLF_PATH> are the locations of IBM XL
   C/C++ for Linux and IBM XL Fortran for Linux respectively.
