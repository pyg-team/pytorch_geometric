 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Datastage job accessing MySQL database aborts with following error despite the fact that the MySQL database version is greater than 5.0:

DSR.MetaGeta(GET.DSNINFO)(SQLConnect('MyConnection','prod')) : BCI Error: SQLSTATE=S1000,CODE=0,[DataStage][SQL Client][ODBC][IBM(DataDirect OEM)] [ODBC MySQL Wire Protocol driver]Connections to versions of MySQL prior to version 5.0 are not supported. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are 2 possible causes for this issue:


 1. The above error is received when you connect to a *MySQL* database v. 5.1.50 with the DataDirect ODBC *MySQL* v 5.3 driver, patch 5.30.0.69; this is a known issue with DataDirect. If you are running this driver version, then you should upgrade your ODBC driver to more current version. 
 2. This error may also be seen if you are trying to connect to *MySQL* Community Server Edition. The DataDirect ODBC drivers support 5.0 and later versions of *MySQL* Commercial or *MySQL* Enterprise servers. They do not support any of the *MySQL* Community servers. You must use either the Commercial or Enterprise edition with the ODBC drivers.
