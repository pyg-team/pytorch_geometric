APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the IBM Process Center and the online IBM Process Server are
   connected by a load balancer and the load balancer is not
   configured to route the traffic between the Process Server and
   the Process Center, it should be possible to use the
   HEARTBEAT_DESIGNATED_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT scenario key, which by
   default is the INTERNAL_CLIENT scenario,  for direct
   communication. However, online deployment is not working even
   after configuring the HEARTBEAT_DESIGNATED_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT
   scenario key.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Make sure process center can communicate with process server via
   load balancer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ProcessServerInternalUrlServlet is not using
   HEARTBEAT_DESIGNATED_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT scenario key as one of
   its endpoints, which results in incorrect configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM 8.5.0.1 that correctly updates
   ProcessServerInternalUrlServlet to use the
   HEARTBEAT_DESIGNATED_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT scenario key.
