APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When loading a ClearCase VOB database of a UCM project VOB as
   schema 80
     either as part of reformatvob or mkreplica
    then db_loader will fail if any UCM stream has too many
   internal folders.
   
   A stream has, by design, up to 3 internal folders as containers
   for its child objects
    an "Activity Folder" to contain UCM activities
     a "Stream Folder" to contain child streams
     a "Timeline Folder" to contain component timelines
   
   If it has multiple folders of the same type, then it cannot be
   loaded as a schema 80 database.
   
   There is a race condition that can lead to a stream having
   multiple "Timeline Folder"s
   If two operations are initiated a very close point in time, on a
   stream that does not yet have a timeline folder,
     then both processes may decide to reae the timeline folder,
   resulting in the stream having two.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Contact IBM Rational Client Support to obtain a tool that will
   merge multiple folders into one

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A special tool was created to merge multiple timeline folders to
   one on schema 54. After the fix, this schema 54 pvob can be
   migrated to schema 80.
