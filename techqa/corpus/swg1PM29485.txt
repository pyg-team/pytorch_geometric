APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HTTP sessions reported in the Web Browser page in MS VE are not
   removed as soon as a the actual web session is closed either by
   logging out from the application, closing the browser or waiting
   for the expiration of the Session Timeout in WAS Admin Console.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * ITCAM users who use Web Session browser at MOD L2 level to
   * view the HTTP sessions.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * The Web Session Browser page in MS VE displays the list of
   * HTTP sessions that are currently active in the application
   * server. However, in rare situations, it has been noted that
   * some invalidated sessions are also displayed in this screen.
   * This case is very rare and can be attributed to timing issues.
   *
   * This APAR provides a way to retroactively to fix this issue,
   * if observed.  An alternate method to invalidate the HTTP
   * sesison is provided where a ITCAM HTTPBindingListener object
   * is added to the HTTP session that receives invalidation
   * event.
   *
   * Note that this would add a new HTTP session attribute to
   * the session.  This should not affect normal application
   * behavior. However, the new attribute will show up if the
   * application for some reason lists all the HTTP attributes.
   *
   * This alternate method can be turned on by adding the following
   * property to either the datacollector_custom.properties or
   * toolkit_custom.properties in the runtime/custom directory:
   *
   *   am.httpsession.attribute.add=true
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * RECOMMENDATION:
   *
   * Normally, the Web Session Browser should display only active
   * HTTP sessions. However, if invalidated sessions are observed,
   * this alternate method can be used which would guarantee the
   * ITCAM DC knows about session invalidation immediately.
   *
