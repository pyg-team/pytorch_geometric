Title: IBM CFGFW component is missing from WPVersionInfo output - United States

Text:
missing product file; cfgfw.product; PUI issue; incorrect version output; missing version output TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
During upgrade of binary install of Portal 7,0 to fixpack 1, it appears that CFGFW.product is missing when the WPVersionInfo script is run.

CAUSE
This is expected behaviour as the Portal Update Installer removes the CFGFW.product file when it detects that there is a binary install and no profile.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

- Install Base Portal v7000 using binary only option
- CFGFW.product file should exist under WebSphere/PortalServer/version folder
- Upgrade to v7001 (no profile created yet)
- CFGFW.product file should be removed at this point from the WebSphere/PortalServer/version folder
- Run WPVersionInfo.sh/.bat file to confirm




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

- Create a profile
- Run Portal Update Installer which will now detect that the binary install has a profile so adds the product file to WebSphere/PortalServer/version folder.
- Run WPVersionInfo.sh/.bat file to confirm
