Important notes


 * Depending on the version of IBM BPM version you are upgrading from, you must also look at earlier post-upgrade tasks:

 *  Post-installation tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.6 CF02 and V8.5.6 CF01 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047155] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047585] Post-upgrade tasks for IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.7 Cumulative Fix (CF) 2016.09 and CF2016.06 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048418]

 * After IBM Process Center is successfully upgraded, update your process applications to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels so you can integrate the latest improvements and defect fixes associate with the toolkit objects. After you update to the latest IBM BPM toolkit levels, you might notice small behavior changes in your process application, such as to the user interfaces, which you might need to modify.
   
 * Installing cumulative fixes can modify the existing system toolkits for the associated version. If your applications are associated with the latest system toolkits, they will automatically include the changes. 


The following table includes new settings and actions related to interim fixes that are included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 CF2016.12. 

Interim fix (APAR) Description Task to enable the function JR56801
Task indexer fails with a NullPointerException when it can't find task participant information in the IBM BPM database When the IBM BPM Task indexer can't find a task's participant information in the IBM BPM database, it fails with a NullPointerException reported in an FFDC. Rebuild the Lucene index by following the instructions in Updating the Process Portal index [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ibm.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/cadm_task_index_updating.html].

Important: If you have several nodes, start only one node with indexing enabled and wait for this node to completely build its index before starting another node and rebuilding that node's index. All the other nodes must remain stopped.

To check if a node has started building its index, search the logs for the following message: 

"The BPM process search full re-index job was successfully started."

To check if the index for a node is completely built, search in the logs for the following message: 

"The BPM process search full re-index job was successfully completed."
