PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker 6.1    *
   *                 with HTTP Request nodes.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It is not possible to suppress the      *
   *                      "Content-Length" HTTP Request Header    *
   *                      generated by the HTTP Request node.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The HTTP Request node always generates a "Content-Length" HTTP
   Request header even when the request is empty and therefore
   has a length of zero.
   In most cases this is the expected behaviour, but in the case
   of a GET or HEAD request the "Content-Length: 0" header can
   result in the request being rejected by a security device.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that no
   "Content-Length: 0" HTTP Request Header is generated for GET
   or HEAD requests. If the request message has a non-zero length
   then the appropriate header will be generated.
   
   If a "Content-Length: 0" header is required then it can be
   explicitly requested by using ESQL in a Compute node before
   the HTTPRequest node to
     SET OutputRoot.HTTPRequestHeader."Content-Length" = '0';
