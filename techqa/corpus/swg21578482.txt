Title: IBM Configuring Java Web Start Shortcut for Windows 7 with Multiple Java Versions - United States

Text:
IC79930; JWS TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do I launch the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI on Windows 7 if I have other applications on the same host already using a different (non-IBM) Java version? How can I get my other applications to use something other than the IBM JRE again? 

CAUSE
The Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI requires the IBM JRE to launch correctly. However, you may need to use other Java-based applications on the same system that use the Oracle (or Sun) JRE. Only one JRE can be associated with a web browser at a time. If the IBM JRE is installed after the Oracle JRE, even if it is not chosen as the system JVM, the applications begin to launch with the IBM JRE.

ANSWER
 

Starting with IBM Spectrum Control 5.2.8, the stand-alone GUI is no longer available, including the Java Web Start based version. Refer to the Knowledge Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5R93_5.2.8/com.ibm.spectrum.sc.doc/fqz0_r_whats_new_release_5.2.8.html] for more information. 
This technote covers a couple of possibilities for resolving the problem of conflicting Java versions on the same machine. As long as you have the IBM Java files on the system and the Oracle (or Sun) system JVM is functioning correctly with the other applications and web browser, you can create a shortcut for launching the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI with Java Web Start that avoids using a web browser. Both sets of steps below walk you through creating a shortcut that will be on the Windows desktop. The properties of the shortcut specify the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center JNLP file (tpcgui.jnlp) and the location of the Java Web Start executable file to use. 

The options listed below assume that you already had the Oracle JRE installed on your system for use with some applications and that those applications stopped working after installing the IBM JRE as part of launching the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI. As a result, the Oracle JRE is re-installed in both cases. 

Option 1 - Re-install both Java versions and create a shortcut  1. Uninstall any Java versions on your Windows 7 system. 
 2. Install IBM Java.  1. Use the link provided by Tivoli Storage Productivity Center.
        http://<device_server_location>:<device_server_port>/ITSRM/app/welcome.html
        Port 9550 is the default value. 
     2. Click on one of the provided links to download and install the IBM Java package for your supported platform. 
     3. Do not install as system JVM. 
     4. Do not check boxes for browser plug-ins.
    
    
 3. Launch the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI through the browser once so that it is cached.  1. Click on the link labeled "TPC GUI (Java Web Start)".
    
    
 4. Create a shortcut to the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI from the Java Cache Viewer.  1. Control Panel > IBM Control Panel for Java > General Tab > Temporary Internet Files > Click on View... 
     2. Select Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI from the list of applications and choose Install Shortcuts. 
     3. Right click on the shortcut and view properties. Confirm that the target shows the correct path to the IBM JRE (javaws.exe).
        Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Java60\jre\bin\javaws.exe" 
    
    
 5. Install the Oracle Java version of choice for the other applications on the system.
    This installs as the system JVM without prompting.


Note: If you have installed the Oracle and IBM JREs already and don't want to uninstall all Java versions, you can follow the next steps instead. 

Option 2 - Create a shortcut and re-install Oracle Java  1. Launch the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI through the browser once so that it is cached.  1. Use the link provided by Tivoli Storage Productivity Center.
        http://<device_server_location>:<device_server_port>/ITSRM/app/welcome.html
        Port 9550 is the default value. 
     2. Click on the link labeled "TPC GUI (Java Web Start)".
    
    
 2. Create a shortcut to the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI from the Java Cache Viewer.  1. Control Panel > IBM Control Panel for Java > General Tab > Temporary Internet Files > Click on View... 
     2. Select Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI from the list of applications and choose Install Shortcuts. 
     3. Right click on the shortcut and view properties. Confirm that the target shows the correct path to the IBM JRE (javaws.exe).
        Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\Java60\jre\bin\javaws.exe" 
        
        You will need to adjust the path to the IBM JRE (javaws.exe). It will most likely point to the one in c:\Windows\SysWOW64. The digital signature in the properties of that javaws.exe file shows that it belongs to Oracle/Sun. This is because the system JVM is Oracle/Sun.
    
    
 3. Re-install the Oracle JRE.
    This step is to make sure the Oracle JRE is used by the web browser for all other applications.



At this point, applications launched through the web browser (Internet Explorer or Firefox) will automatically launch using Oracle's Java. Since the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI should not be launched using that Java, use the shortcut created that points to IBM's Java. No browser window is required for launching the Tivoli Storage Productivity Center GUI in this way.
