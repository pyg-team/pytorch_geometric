Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 There are issues how Microsoft Objects are generated when included as part of Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. 

ENVIRONMENT
Windows 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

The following example will illustrate tips on using Microsoft Excel Objects with Microsoft PowerPoint reports as part of building reports using IBM Cognos Disclosure Management


Figure 1 shows the basic chart with periods in the rows and animals count listed in the columns.

Figure 2 shows the bar chart out for animals by month using Microsoft Excel

The example has inserted some data and created a chart. That's really all there is to it if you want to use a chart. Let's switch to the PowerPoint object


 * Select the content area in PowertPoint where you wish the chart to appear 
 * Select "Insert Variable" 
 * Select "Chart" 
 * Select the chart from the appropriate report object, in this case the object is named "chart" in the report "Test"

Figure 3 - shows the blank Microsoft PowerPoint Slide 

Notice the "Insert as chart" button at the bottom right of the "Reference Variables" pane. It actually gives us two options:  * Insert as chart 
 * Insert as chart and resize


The first will simply insert the chart at its original size as in Excel. The second will re-size the chart to the container in which the link lives. Let's see how each option looks with the default generation options (more on that later).

There's really not much reason to use the first option. However the second option has an enormous advantage, that the chart will always re-size to fit the container, meaning it's not necessary to worry too much about matching the size of the source and the size of the destination. There is one drawback though, since the chart is an image changing the size can or zooming in can introduce pixelation. Look at a close-up of the chart title:

Figure 7 - shows example of image 

There's only so much we can do about this. An image will always appear pixelated if zoomed in far enough or resized radically enough. There are two things we can do about this. 

Generate Images with a Higher DPI
In the CDM.config file on the application server (default locationC:\inetpub\wwwroot\CognosDM-Server\Config\CDM.config) find the following line:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968770&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968770&aid=8]

Hint: You are changing the style by cdm.config file. Caution should be used when making changes to how images will handle using Cognos Disclosure Management.

Do not generate charts as image
As stated above, any image will appear pixelated if you zoom in far enough. CDM can also copy content from Excel to PowerPoint (or Word) as actual Office content that uses vector graphics, meaning you can zoom infinitely. In order to do this follow the same steps as above using the "No Re-Size" method, except when generating un-check the following option:

Figure 9 - shows the preferences for charts. 


This results in the following output:

Figure 10 - Bar chart sample

Note that the content inside the chart is selectable, it's an actual chart, not an image. It will never be pixelated, here's that word again at the same level of zoom:

Figure 11 - shows the sample of image

However there is one serious drawback here, let's look at the same chart when we use the "Re-Size" option, but let's drastically change the size of the container to be very tall and skinny:

Figure 11 - Chart slim view


This is probably not what we intended, the title has wrapped to the next line, and only part of the legend is visible. This is because re-sizing here is exactly like re-sizing a native PowerPoint or Excel chart. The font size won't automatically change to adapt. This will work well if the source and target are not too different, but if they are, particularly if the target container is smaller, the chart may not actually fit. An image doesn't have this problem since no matter how it's re-sized the relative distances between any two points always stays the same

Microsoft Excel Tables and Microsoft PowerPoint
Tabular Excel data is only slightly different. There are two ways to get Excel tables into PowerPoint (or Word): 

 * An image range (##IRS/##IRE) 
 * A named range


The first will always bring the content in as an image, the second as a native Office table. The same caveats about re-sizing apply here as they did for charts. Here is an Excel file that has the same table available as both options:

Figure 12 - shows Microsoft Table 

The table is surrounded with ##IRS/##IRE. There is also a named range "myRange", which contains the table and is turned into a ##S variable. 

Name Ranged 
To insert the table into PowerPoint as a native Office table:  * Select the content area in PowertPoint where you wish the table to appear 
 * Select "Insert Variable" 
 * Select "Named Range" 
 * Select the table from the appropriate report object, in this case the object is named "table" in the report "Test"


There are two options for how to insert:  * Insert as Destination Variable 
 * Insert as Hyperlink


They are functionally the same, differing only in the way they appear in the object when unresolved. In summary:
The above can be summarized with a chart like so:

Figure 13 - shows comparison between resized image and standard image

Here "ease of use" refers to the amount of fiddling necessary. 

 * A re-sized image has the highest ease of use since it will always size to its destination container regardless of source size. However this is also likely to product the lowest image quality. 
 * A standard image will require more work since the source and destination must be roughly the same size, but a lack of re-sizing the image will keep quality higher than above. 
 * Office content always has the same quality. However opposite to the above points it's likely to be more work if re-sized since elements will move around in ways that may be non-intuitive.
