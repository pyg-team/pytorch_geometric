APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The system was upgraded to PureApplication System version
   2.2.0.0 and the user noticed that there were no available
   fixes listed for an MQ pattern upgrade.
   
   This issue would affect any virtual system pattern, but the
   initial defect was opened using the IBM Pattern for MQ.
   
   The steps to reproduce the issue are:
   1. Install IBM Pattern for MQ version 1.0.0.2
   2. Deploy an instance of the pattern.
   3. Install the IBM Pattern for MQ version 1.0.0.3
   4. Click the "Check for updates" button on the running instance.
   5. Click the "manage" button to open the Instance Console. On
      the Operations tab, select Maintenance. There are no
      available fixes listed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  1. Create a virtual system pattern in the Pattern Builder.
   2. From Images, drag a Core OS component onto the canvas.
   3. On the Core OS component, use the "Add a Cmponent Policy" to
      add a Base Scaling Policy to it.
   4. On the Base Scaling Policy, enable a Memory-based rule (you
      can use the default values).
   5. Deploy the pattern.
   
   This instance can be deleted once the deployment is launched,
   there is no need to wait for the deployment to complete.
   
   After these steps the fixpack issue should be resolved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The security token used to access the Instance Console
   did not have access to the deployment information.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System
   version 2.2.1.0.
