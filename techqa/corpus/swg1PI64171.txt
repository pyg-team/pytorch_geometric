ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Framework Manager returns an error (red bullet, white 'X')
   without error message and thus prevents to import new metadata
   or to test query subjects. Error situation occurred after
   upgrade from IBM Cognos BI 10.2.1 FP5 to 10.2.2.x. The error
   situation is seen under certain conditions or their combination,
   for example: query based parameter maps to dynamically switch
   data source Catalog/ Content Manager Data Source, prompt macros,
   user defined functions or PowerCubes
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Several workarounds available. All require to replace macros/
   parameter maps on data source properties pane to be able to
   test/ import metadata. Depending on requirements within the
   package (-> report usage) the property entries must be reverted
   to macro definition.
   
   (a) Replace macro definition by known value for current required
   data source, revert before publishing packages.
   
   (b) Replace macro by a more simple prompt macro for example
   using a default: #prompt('WhichDB','token','myDB')#
      -> same default as for Parameter Map
      -> requires to verify proper handling later for report
   users/consumers
   
   (c)  Replace macro by a simple mandatory prompt macro for
   example: #prompt('WhichDB','token')#
      -> all modelers must enter a valid value
      -> to be verified: all report users/ consumers are connected
   to their apropriate data source (report based solution)
