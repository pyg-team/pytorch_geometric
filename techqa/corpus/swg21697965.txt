Title: IBM Missing socket entries in "Socket Services Information" view - United States

Text:
Socket information services klzsockd linux session listening established linux klzagent TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why the Linux OS agent TEP view "Socket Services Information" does not show all the entries returned
by the command "netstat -an"? 

ANSWER
The TEP view "Socket Services Information" shows data from attribute group "Socket Details", table klzsockd.
This attribute group collects and parse data from those two OS files:
/proc/net/tcp
/proc/net/udp
Those files contain only information for ipV4 sockets.
Information for ipV6 sockets are instead maintained by Linux into /proc/net/tcp6 and /proc/net/udp6, that are not currently used for data collection from the Linux OS agent.
So, into view "Socket Services Information" you will always get only information for active ipv4 socket, you cannot compare it with the output of command netstat -an.
The correct command is: netstat -anA inet
The output of this command includes only the ipv4 sockets for all protocols.
