queue statistics incorrect fast put message count TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 We notice that when viewing the queue statistics for transmit queues, the messages put and the messages read counts do not match. It appears at times the messages read counts are not accurate. Why is this? 

ANSWER
There are 2 ways that our monitor can collect queue related messages read/put values. The first method is our MQI monitoring. With this method, we intercept MQI calls and gather statistics about application 
and queue activity. With this method, since messages being put and read to the transmit queues are done by internal MQI processing within the channel initiator address space, they do not always go through the standard MQI call processing that is used to collect these statistics. So for transmit queues, the messages put/read is not always complete. 
The second method, just for queue statistics, is to specify STATISTICS(YES) on our SET QUEUE statements. With this method, we rely on WebSphere MQ statistics that our returned by their RESET QSTATS command. This will provide messages put/read statistics for transmit queues. 
The only caveat is for WMQ Version 6 and above. Performance enhancements made 
to WebSphere MQ result in these statistics not being updated when "fast puts" are used. These occur when NPMSPEED(FAST) is specified for channel associated with the transmit queue, the channel is started and the message is non-persistent.
