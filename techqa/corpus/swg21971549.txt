AIX 
1) Enable debug mode on Impact and Impact GUI: 
1.1) Enable debug mode on Impact server: 
Edit file $IMPACT_HOME/impact/etc/impactserver.log4j.properties: 
From: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.threshold=INFO 
To: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.threshold=TRACE 

From: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.maxBackupIndex=3 
To: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.maxBackupIndex=10 

From: 
log4j.category.com.micromuse=INFO,NETCOOL,NETCOOL-ERRORS 
To: 
log4j.category.com.micromuse=TRACE,NETCOOL,NETCOOL-ERRORS 

You DO NOT need to restart the Impact server for this changes to be applied. 

1.2) If there is problem with GUI, then enable debug mode on Impact GUI server: 
Edit file $IMPACT_HOME/impact/etc/impactgui.log4j.properties: 
From: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.threshold=INFO 
To: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.threshold=TRACE 

From: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.maxBackupIndex=3 
To: 
log4j.appender.NETCOOL.maxBackupIndex=10 

From: 
log4j.category.com.micromuse=INFO,NETCOOL,NETCOOL-ERRORS 
To: 
log4j.category.com.micromuse=TRACE,NETCOOL,NETCOOL-ERRORS 

You DO NOT need to restart the Impact server for this changes to be applied. 

2) Set the PolicyLogger for problem determination, launch Impact GUI interface. Select PolicyLogger under Service Status. Configure with the following options: 

- Highest Log level = 3 
- Check under Log What: 
"All SQL Statements / Policy Query Diagnostics", 
"Parameters for Built in Functions", 
"Local Variables on Exit of Custom Functions", 
"Full Current Context on Entry and Exit of Custom Functions", 
- Check Log Service Log: 
"Service log (write to file)" 
"Append Policy Name to log file" 

3) Execute the nci_collect_logs command from the $IMPACT_HOME/bin directory. The logs are created as a zip file in the $IMPACT_HOME/bin directory. The filename has the format "impact_logs_<DATEANDTIME>.zip
