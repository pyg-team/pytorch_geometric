APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A service request is not being created from a service catalog
   order when a GLACCOUNT is specified on the order.
   
   The error message is:
      BMXAA4198E - Organization needed for GL attribute GLACCOUNT
   on object {1}.
   
   However, the GL account that was specified is active in the
   Chart of Accounts for the Organization.
   
   The error only occurs if a GLACOCUNT is entered.  But it
   consistently gets the error if it is entered regardless of
   catalog request/order.  Without a GLACCOUNT, the SR is created.
   
   
   REPLICATION STEPS (per OOB env)
   
   
   1. Modify an OOB offering to have Requisition Processing in the
   Offerings app set to 'Catalog Order Approved', and Fulfillment
   Modality under Fulfillment Options app set to "Service Request"
   2. Log in as PMSCSRUUSR and fill out associated fields and add
   offering to cart.
   3. Specify a GL clearing account in the "GL Debit Account" field
   of the section 'Charge Information' in the shopping cart
   4. Submit the shopping cart
   5. Log out and log in as PMSCSRUMUSR and approve the catalog
   request.
   6. You will get a popup that says that the Catalog Request has
   been approved.
   7. Log out and log back in as maxadmin, go to 'View Catalog
   Requests', select the associated Catalog Request, and go the the
   History tab. You will see that there is an approved Catalog
   Request, approved Catalog Order, etc, but NO SR has been
   created.
   
   Repeat steps 1-6 but omit step 3, that is, DO NOT specify a GL
   Debit Account. Then in step 7, you will also see a SR has been
   created after the Catalog Order is approved.
