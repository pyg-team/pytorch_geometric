 PREVENTIVE SERVICE PLANNING

ABSTRACT
 Some IBM SystemStorage SAN768B and SAN384B, some CP blades may have insufficient memory to support upgrading to newer firmware versions. This article describes how to determine whether the problem is present before upgrading firmware. 

CONTENT
Some IBM SystemStorage SAN768B and SAN384B (2499-384 and 2499-192, respectively) CP blades were shipped with insufficient amounts of compact flash (CF) memory. These blades should have been shipped with 2GB but in some cases only 1GB was shipped. 

Because of this, firmwaredownload commands can fail with an out of disk space error message when FOS 6.4.2b or earlier versions are upgraded to 6.4.3 or later (including 7.x). 

 

For systems running FOS 6.4.2b or earlier, either of the following two actions can confirm the size of the CF: 

 

1) View the df command output 

 * 
 * df : 
 * Filesystem 1k-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on 
 * /dev/root484280431740 27544 94% / 
 * /dev/hda1483760386864 71928 84% /mnt


Here, adding the two filesystem sizes in the 1k-blocks column yields 968,040, which is roughly 1GB. 


2) View the /var/log/dmesg entry while the system probes the CF during bootup  * 
 * Probing IDE interface ide0...
 * hda: STI Flash 8.0.0, CFA DISK drive 
 * ide0 at 0xc20153e0-0xc20153e7,0xc20157ec on irq 58 
 * hda: max request size: 128KiB 
 * hda: 2001888 sectors (1024 MB), CHS=1986/16/63


The last entry confirms 1GB CF capacity. 


If this situation is confirmed please contact IBM support to arrange replacement of the CP blade(s) before upgrading firmware.
