PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The IBM Java Security team announces the availability of
   IBMJCEFIPS Version 1.8 that is currently undergoing the FIPS
   140-2 certification process. The new IBMJCEFIPS was submitted to
   NIST for a full certification on April 1st, 2016 and approval is
   expected in 3 to 6 months from the date of submission.
   IBMJCEFIPS will be certified for Java 8 and vendor affirmed for
   Java 6 and 7. The new IBMJCEFIPS will be available to Java
   Bundlers through Java CR16-03 service streams for Java 6, 7, 8.
   The IBMJCEFIPS provider, version 1.8, will replace the earlier
   version 1.71.
   The version 1.71 was last certified in May 2016 to older SP186-2
   digital standards. It was certified on Java 6 and Vendor
   affirmed for Java 7 and Java 8. Finally it was certified as
   software-only without any hardware acceleration.
   The new IBMJCEFIPS 1.8 is compliant with SP186-4 digital
   signature requirements. It is also certified on hardware
   platforms with crypto-capable processors(Java 8 only), in
   addition to the software-only version. Version 1.8 is fully
   compliant with SP800-38D requirements and contains security
   fixes to vulnerabilities found since the last full
   certification. The newer version also meets the new FIPS random
   number rules and seeding requirements. It contains resolutions
   for multiple APARS. Versions 1.8 and 1.71 cannot coexist, and
   bundling applications must account for the incompatibilities
   between the two versions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The SP186-4 digital signature standards impose new limits on key
   sizes and algorithms. Applications must change application code
   to use FIPS-approved algorithms and key sizes. Owners of all
   impacted applications must upgrade to the Java CR16_03 service
   releases to obtain the updated IBMJCEFIPS Provider and IBM JSSE
   Provider.
   There are behavioral changes between version 1.71 and version
   1.8. The new IBMJCEFIPS provider could enter an error state
   under certain error conditions and a restart
   of JVM will be needed to recover from the error state.
   APARs resolved with the new FIPS Provider:
   IV82939 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV82939] -- "Signature algorithm mismatch" only on hybrid JVM
   IV82919 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV82919] -- Application fails to start on zOS when using
   IBMJCEFIPS
   IV83173 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV83173] - IBMSecureRandom in IBMJCEFIPS gets hang after some
   time
