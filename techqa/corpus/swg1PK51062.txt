   tries to failover to the remaining grid server, this issued:
   Caused by: com.ibm.websphere.objectgrid. LockTimeoutException:
   9BD684B0-0113-4000-E000-33523103494C timed out waiting for lock

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Extended Deployment   *
   *                 using ObjectGrid.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A LockTimeOutException may be seen on   *
   *                      HTTP request failure when using         *
   *                      HttpSession persistence to ObjectGrid   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When using HTTP Session persistence to ObjectGrid, when session
   failover happens, a LockTimeOutException may be seen in the
   client application server logs. The lockTimeoutException is
   caused due to a bug in the way Objectgrid transactions are
   started and committed by the HTTP Session persistence code. This
   fix addresses this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix has been put in to prevent the LockTimeoutExceptions.
   This fix will be shipped with the ObjectGrid 6.1.0 IFix 2.
