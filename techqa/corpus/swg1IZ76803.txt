APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Regardless of running NEWCOPY, result was same cashed output
   through MF NetExpress COBOL.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  TXSeries CICS code will be fixed to have correct NEWCOPY output.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In Windows operating systems, the Micro Focus Net Express COBOL
   programs can be cached by the Micro Focus runtime. A new copy of
   the Micro Focus Net Express COBOL program cannot be removed from
   the cache. The program can issue SET PROGRAM COPY (NEWCOPY)
   command for a Net Express program to reload the new program.
   This command will unload programs in cache and the new copies of
   the same program loads when the programs are reused.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For all other supported Operating System except windows, NEWCOPY
   feature is already implemented. This APAR is targeted only for
   windows operating system to change the implementation logic for
   SET NEWCOPY command.
