Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in Network Time Protocol(NTP) affect WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance (CVE-2016-5300, CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-8138) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in Network Time Protocol(NTP) implementation that is used by WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance. These vulnerabilities addressed include the ability to disable the NTP client and bypass security restrictions to bypass the timestamp validation check. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-5300 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5300]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to correctly implement the threshold limitation for the '-g' option. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept NTP traffic and make multiple steps larger than the panic threshold.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107594 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107594] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)


CVEID: CVE-2015-7704 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7704]
DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the rate-limiting mechanism. By sending spoofed Kiss-o'-Death packets, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to disable NTP at a victim client.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107446 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107446] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-8138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8138]
DESCRIPTION: NTP could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. By sending a specially crafted packet with an origin timestamp of zero, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the timestamp validation check.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110025 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110025] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1
WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply an interim fix, according to the table below. Interim fixes are associated with the original APAR that is documented in the table. Because these APAR references might be updated to more recent APARs, see the links in the table for the most recent interim fix information. 

This interim fix contains a new default SSL certificate, as the previous default SSL certificate, which was never intended for production use, has an MD5 signature and is no longer compatible with Java. The result is that installing this interim fix will make it incompatible with any WebSphere Datapower XC10 appliances that are running with an MD5 certificate, including the default SSL certificate that was shipped prior to this interim fix. If the appliance is configured with a custom keystore and certificate with an MD5 signature, it must be replaced prior to upgrading to this interim fix or the 'clear-tls-config' command must be run on the appliance before or after performing the upgrade. Failing to do so will result in the appliance failing to start. Note that changing the active certificate for an appliance collective does require that the cache be reloaded and client truststores must be configured to trust the new certificate.
