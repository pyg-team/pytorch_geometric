PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to manually uninstall IBM Rational Application Developer 6.0.x on a Microsoft Windows operating system. 

SYMPTOM
When you are trying to remove Rational Application Developer from a Microsoft Windows operating system, the InstallShield Uninstaller might fail, with the following message displayed in the InstallShield Uninstaller window: 

 * 
   Errors occurred during the uninstallation




CAUSE
The uninstall program has failed, so a manual uninstall is necessary.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In cases where the uninstall program fails to remove the product successfully, you can use the following steps to manually remove Rational Application Developer: 

 

The manual uninstall steps are as follows: 

 1. Delete the target directory where the product was installed 
 2. Delete the RAT60 directory in the following location: %WINNT%\IBM 
 3. Delete or Rename the vpd.properties file located in the %WINDIR% directory 
 4. Backup the registry using Microsoft Windows backup procedures. (see Note relating to this step at the bottom of this technote) 
 5. * Delete the following directory: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\LUM 
 6. Edit the registry using regedit, and delete the following key: HKEY Local Machine\SOFTWARE\IBM\Rational\Software Development Platform


* Deleting the LUM directory deletes the license for all IBM applications that are registered on the system (such as WebSphereÂ® Studio Application Developer). You can reinstall the licenses by following the steps documented in the technote linked below:

 * 1207589: Getting a License cannot be found or License cannot be found or has expired error


An additional technote listed in the Related information section addresses the issue of uninstalling WebSphere Test Environments (WTE).  

It is not recommended that you manually uninstall the product, so these steps should only be used in situations where the uninstall program fails. If you have any uncertainty when performing these steps, contact IBM support to request assistance.
