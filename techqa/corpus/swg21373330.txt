Title: IBM Rendering formatted text file from a file component displays content without the formatting - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

SYMPTOM
The format of a text file is lost when it is attached to a file component and is referenced in a content page

CAUSE
The text file is not displayed without the format in browser due to the mime type not being set. The text is rendered as html

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can set the mime type in WCMConfigService.properties: 

 
1. Find the "# Mapping of mimetypes to extensions" section 
2. At the end of "mimetype.list=", put following: 

,extensiontype.txt

3. Put following after "extensiontype.lzh=application/octet-stream" 

extensiontype.txt=text/plain

4. Restart the server, make sure to remove all the browser cache at this stage 

The *.txt file should be displayed correctly in Firefox and Internet Explorer after the setting.
