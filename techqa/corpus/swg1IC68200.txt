APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A user with a message flow which includes a HTTPRequest node
   may see the execution group abend when it processes the first
   message. The top of the stack for that abend may look like this:
   ImbRdl!?generateRuntimeObjects@SqlPathInterface
   ImbRdl!?initializeInterface@SqlPathInterface
   ImbRdl!?evaluate@SqlPathInterface
   WSLibrary!?evaluate@ImbWSRequestNode
   and may indicate a problem in generateRuntimeObjects following
   on from a call to ImbWSRequestNode::evaluate.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker v6 and v6.1 who use the
   HTTPRequest node.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   When an HTTPRequest node is placed in a flow its default
   properties include:
   "Request message location in tree" - InputRoot
   "Response message location in tree" - OutputRoot
   "Error message location" - OutputRoot
   
   If these properties are left unmodified then the WMB toolkit
   recognises that the location is the default and does not send
   it to the broker resulting in improper node initialisation
   leading to an access violation.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that the
   HTTPRequest node is correctly initialized.
