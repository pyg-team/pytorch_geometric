PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You upgrade from VSE 230 running CICS/VSE V2.3 to a later version of VSE running CICS Transaction Server for VSE/ESA (CICS TS) V1.1.1 and start receiving message DFHZC3400. 

SYMPTOM
DFHZC3400 Chain exceeds max chain size


CAUSE
CICS TS enforces the IOAREALEN values.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Your transaction that ran in the CICS 230 environment causes message DFHZC3400 in the CICS TS environment. This is due to tightening of CICS code in CICS TS. CICS/VSE 2.3 never put into effect IOAREALEN(value1,value2). Because it was never used, there was never any enforcement. The only time that you receive a DFH3400 under CICS/VSE 230 is when the data received exceeds 32K. In CICS TS, if the data being received is greater than value2, CICS creates message DFHZC3400 and rejects the request from the terminal.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Change the Typeterm [http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/DFHWA406/4.13.4?DT=20030723162910] definition for the terminal receiving this error. Specifically, you need to increase the value2 parameter for IOAREALEN to be the maximum size of data that the terminal can receive.
