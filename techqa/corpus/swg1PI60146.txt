APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Shared DB connections in the  background threads will cause
   connection "leak" (increase and stick to
   number of threads). One possible fix would be disable the
   shared DB  connection by default in the concurrent1.0
   package,
   or at least make it  an easy configuration option,

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   WebSphere Application Server Liberty does not have the
   capability to override the default connection sharing behavior
   when using direct lookups.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR adds the property enableSharingForDirectLookups on the
   ConnectionManager to allow the connection sharing to be
   controlled. If set to true, which is the default, connections
   are shared. If set to false, connections are unshared.  This
   property will only affect resources accessed through direct
   lookup.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
   pack 17.0.0.1.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates page for
   delivery information:

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The connection sharing can be controlled by using indirect
   lookup, either using a resource reference or resource
   injection.
