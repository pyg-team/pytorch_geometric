PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The installation of Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager into an existing IBM® Tivoli® Monitoring environment logs the CRIMC1018E error when install.sh is launched 

SYMPTOM
The installation is launched with sudo for the itmid user. The following messages are logged : 


sudo -u itmid ./install.sh
GUI failed to start. For more information see /tmp/install.12745.log. 
Launching console mode...
CRIMC1018E ERROR: Administrator privileges are required.
Explanation: You started the Installation Manager in administrator
mode, but you do not have the required administrator privileges. On
Microsoft Windows XP Professional, you must be a member of an
administrator group. On Windows Vista, Windows 2008, Windows 7, and
Windows 8, you must use the Run as administrator option. On Linux,
UNIX, Mac OS X, IBM i, and z/OS, you must have root privileges.
User Action: To use the Run as administrator option on Windows:
1. Right-click the executable icon.
2. Select Run as administrator.
3. Enter an administrator password when prompted for either an 
administrator password or a confirmation.
4. Click Continue.



CAUSE
Incorrect package used for installation.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify the packages used for installation. In this case, the following packages were used : 

MONIT_FOR_TSM7.1_LIN_1OF2_ML.bin
MONIT_FOR_TSM7.1_LIN_2OF2_ML.bin
These packages are the incorrect packages to install into an existing IBM® Tivoli® Monitoring environment.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you have an existing IBM® Tivoli® Monitoring system that does not have Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager installed, you can run the native IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation wizard to install more monitoring agents. 

If you do not want to install the agent, you can install only the application support files, which are required by the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and Tivoli Enterprise Portal server to monitor Tivoli Storage Manager servers.

To install the monitoring agent or application support files into an existing IBM® Tivoli® Monitoring environment, download the appropriate executable file from Passport Advantage®, or the FTP download site at 
ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/maintenance/reporting/v7r1 [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/maintenance/reporting/v7r1]

The file name for installing only the monitoring agent, or only the application support files, can be recognized by the word AGENT in capital letters. For example:
7.1.0.000-TIV-TSMRPT-AGENT-Linux.bin [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/maintenance/reporting/v7r1/7.1.0.000/7.1.0.000-TIV-TSMRPT-AGENT-Linux.bin]
