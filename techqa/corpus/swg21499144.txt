Title: IBM Page performance report in Rational Performance Tester test results report does not display performance statistics of certain requests or pages - United States

Rational Performance Tester; RPT; page performance report; test results report; performance statistics TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Occasionally, where scripts are recorded on HTTP Protocol and played back, the performance test results report does not show the performance statistics like response time, attempts / hit rate, etc., for some HTTP page requests. The values in the rows against these pages / requests are null and appear blank.

The performance test execution will proceed without interruptions or errors. However, the performance statistics for these page requests that may contain vital transactions to be measured, will not be displayed, leading to loss of performance measurement data. 

SYMPTOM
Performance statistics in Page performance report and related performance reports of Rational Performance tester is not displayed for certain HTTP requests / pages, even when the requests are sent and received by Rational performance tester software during performance test runs.

CAUSE
This occurs because, in the test scripts, a few of the secondary requests of the HTTP pages whose performance statistics are not displayed have Response Code as Not Found 404 or Internal Server 500. When Rational Performance tester encounters this page request and sends this request to the application, it receives a Not Found 404 or Internal Server Error 500 as the response, in which case, the performance statistics of the request like response time, hit rate, number of attempts, throughput, etc., cannot be captured. 

The Response code 404 or Not Found error message is an HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what the resource requested as the URL may be broken, or the resource requested may have been moved to another location, and hence is missing at this location. 404 errors should not be confused with "server not found" or similar errors, in which a connection to the destination server could not be made at all. A 404 error indicates that the requested resource may be available again in the future. A 500 Internal server error, on the other hand, is a very generic message displayed in case of any errors occurring either at the HTTP Server or at the Middleware in rendering responses.


ENVIRONMENT
This occurs in the Rational Performance Tester host controller that is installed on either a Windows or Linux platform



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Problem is identified by checking the secondary requests in the test scripts for a response code of 404.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The resolution to this problem is to Disable or Remove all of those secondary requests in the test script whose response code is 404 or 500. These types of requests are normal and occur in the test script ,because, at the time of recording, the application internally makes requests for subsequent web components / resources that may be missing at the time of the request. During playback, the same set of requests are sent, the response code will still be Not Found - 404, or Internal Server Error 500; in which case, performance stats for this requests cannot be captured. 

Disabling or removing these requests will not cause any breakage in the script, because the responses to these requests are not used or correlated to any other subsequent requests. Therefore, it is safe to disable or remove such requests
