SUMMARY
 An IBM Tivoli Monitoring shared component is included as part of Agent for NetApp Storage. Information about a security vulnerability affecting an IBM Tivoli Monitoring shared component has been published in a security bulletin. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2625
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/104743 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/104743] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1931
DESCRIPTION: IBM Java Security Components store plain text data in memory dumps, which could allow a local attacker to obtain information to aid in further attacks against the system.
CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102967 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102967] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-7575
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”. 
CVSS Base Score: 7.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
