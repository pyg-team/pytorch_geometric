Title: IBM Missing JDBC driver definitions for Oracle and MS SQL Server when adding new database connection in Decision Optimization Center - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When adding a new database connection (in the Data Source Explorer in the Data perspective), the JDBC driver definitions for Oracle and MS SQL Server are initially missing from the list of predefined drivers. This is because the associated driver jars are not delivered with the product. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can download these jars from the Oracle and Microsoft web sites. To have a driver listed, close the IDE and copy the driver jar (ojdbc6.jar for Oracle, sqljdbc4.jar for MS SQL Server) to the directory <installdir>\Developer\ide\eclipse\dropins\oplide\plugins\ilog.odms.ide.odm_3.8.0.xxxxxxxx-xxxx, then restart the IDE. The predefined driver will now be listed with the rest of the predefined JDBC drivers.
