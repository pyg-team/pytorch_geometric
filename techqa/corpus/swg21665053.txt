Title: IBM Filtering the target IP addresses that are displayed in the Server UI. - United States

Text:
IPv6 IP addresses; IPv4 IP addresses; filter addresses TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 For targets that report both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, how can I display only the IPv4 addresses in the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote Control Server UI? 

CAUSE
When targets are reporting both IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses to the server, the IP address field in the UI is difficult to read. 

ANSWER
There is a property in the trc.properties configuration file named invalid.net.addresses. The property contains a comma separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 machine or network addresses that should be filtered from the list that is reported by the target. 

 
Adding the network address ::/0 filters all IPv6 addresses that are reported by the target the next time the target contacts the server. 

For example, 
When you add the value to the default configuration, the property contains the following value: 
invalid.net.addresses=0.0.0.0,127.0.0.0/8,::/128,::1/128,fe80::/10,::/0 

If the value of the property is edited by using the Edit properties files menu option, the change is effective as soon as you click Submit. However, if this value is updated by editing the properties file manually, you must restart the server service or reset the application so that the change takes effect.
