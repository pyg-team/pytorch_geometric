QUESTION
 Why do I get a "HTTP 404 - File not found" when I attempt to connect to my LCMS site? 

ANSWER
The 404 error indicates that the URL does not exist. If you have entered the correct server/instance name, the most probable cause is that the site is running on a port other than port 80. If this is the case, check what port the server is on and enter the URL as, e.g.: "http://<yourserver.domain>:8080/<lcmsname>".
