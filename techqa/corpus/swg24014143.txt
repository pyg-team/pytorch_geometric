ABSTRACT
 Download a sample LDAP server configuration, SSL certificates and CRLs for use with WebSphere MQ and MQIPT certificate revocation checking. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
In large organisations, managing the certificates used for SSL authentication can be difficult, especially if the private key corresponding to a certificate becomes compromised. Many people therefore choose to use SSL Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to revoke certificates which are compromised or no longer required.

This SupportPac consists of sample SSL certificates and LDAP CRL configurations. These samples demonstrate how to configure WebSphere MQ to use LDAP CRL checking to manage SSL trust across an organisation. 

POSSIBLE USES
For users of MQIPT, the SpportPac gives information on use of LDAP CRLs in your route setup.
The sample SSL certificates and CRLs can be deployed in a test/QA environment, to test this functionality and give administrators practical experience of managing certificates using LDAP and CRLs.

SKILL LEVEL REQUIRED
You must be familiar with common WMQ administration tasks including channel and queue definition. Ideally, you also have some knowledge of SSL configuration.
