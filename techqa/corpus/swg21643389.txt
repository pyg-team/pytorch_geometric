PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to run the Documentum crawler from Content Analytics with Enterprise Search. But it only runs for a short time before I get Out of Memory errors. 

SYMPTOM
JVMDUMP010I Java dump written to /opt/ibm/ContentIntegrator/bin/javacore.20130628.142655.11796632.0012.txt 

JVMDUMP013I Processed dump event "systhrow", detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError".

The crawler finally dies with the message.
"FFQD4708E An IBM Content Integrator API error occurred." 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Since the Documentum crawler runs through IBM Content Integrator, try increasing the max heap settings for the Content Integrator RMI Bridge. 

 * The default RMI Bridge script is found in ICI_Home/bin/RMIBridge.bat (RMIBridge.sh). 
 * This file should be copied so that customization can be made specifically for the connection to Documentum. 
 * Try increasing the max heap settings in this file as follows:  * Default:-Xms256m -Xmx256m ^ 
    * Modified: -Xms512m -Xmx512m ^
   
   
 * After making this change, save the file and restart this RMI Bridge. 
 * If you still see Out of Memory errors after this change, try increasing the max heap further as your environment allows and monitor the system performance.
