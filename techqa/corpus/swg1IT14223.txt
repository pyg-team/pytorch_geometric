APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Database Routine transform in a Graphical Data
   Map to call an Oracle Stored Procedure that is returning
   locally relabeled columns in one or more Sys Ref Cursors from
   table joins, the column data may not be mapped correctly giving
   unexpected null output element values.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To work with locally relabelled columns, the fix must be applied
   to the Graphical Data Mapper and a co-req fix applied and
   activated via an environment variable in the IBM Integration
   Bus.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Graphical Data Mapper V1.0 running maps that
   use the Database Routine transform with Oracle RDBMS.
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using the Database Routine transform in a Graphical Data
   Map to call an Oracle Stored Procedure that is returning locally
   relabelled columns in one or more Sys Ref Cursors from table
   joins, the column data may not be mapped correctly by the
   runtime giving unexpected null output element values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Graphical Data Map Editor now preserves the order of column
   additions Sys Ref Cursors so that the runtime can correctly
   process an Oracle Stored Procedure that is returning locally
   relabelled columns.
