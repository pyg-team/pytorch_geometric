Title: IBM Clicking on FileNet Business Process Manager Process Engine Tasks results in Timeout org.omg.CORBA COMM_FAILURE error. - United States

Text:
Load Balancer; TCP keepalive; CORBA COMM_FAILURE; Radware; session timeout TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When user clicks on Process EngineTasks, Inbox, Queues or opens a work item they see the message ORB Timeout org.omg.CORBA COMM_FAILURE 

SYMPTOM
The Timeout org.omg.CORBA COMM_FAILURE, purge_calls:1899 Reason: CONN_ABORT (1) State: Abort (5) IBM minor code: 306 completed, error would appear intermittently. At first users would not have an issue accessing the PE components but after a while of clicking the error would appear for all users. The only way to get out of the situation would be for all users to sign out and close their browsers. Network traces show a rest coming from the Process Engine servers and application Engine servers.


CAUSE
The session/client timeout setting on the Load Balancer (Radware in this case) is set too low.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the session/client timeout setting on the Load Balancer to the same value or higher than the TCP keepalive setting on the Server. In our example set it to 1000.
