ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The HTTPRequest node is being used to call a webservice.  The
   node is setting the parameters Host, Content-Length,
   Content-Type and Connection in the HTTPRequestHeader element.
   The help documentation for the node says that, in this case, the
   Content-Type will be automatically populated with "text/xml;
   charset=utf-8".  Trace shows that the node has populated
   Content-Type with the charset from the message root Properties
   element.  The Info Center document is incorrect and the charset
   should match the CCSID of the message body being sent out.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Message Broker        *
   *                 using default HTTP headers from              *
   *                 HTTPRequest node.                            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When the generate default http header   *
   *                      option  is selected in a HttpRequest    *
   *                      node the contentype element in the      *
   *                      httpHeader is set to the value of       *
   *                      ccsid from the message body instead of  *
   *                      utf-8 as per the infocenter.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Users might expect to get the charset value of contentype
   element in default HTTP header, to be set as UTF-8. A
   HTTPRequest node will populate the charset from message body,
   and it should match the ccsid of the message body being sent
   out.
   The WebSphere Message Broker infocenter topic on HttpHeaders
   (ac00477_) is now updated to reflect this information.
   
   Section 2. Reply and 3. Request in topic ac00477__  now show
   then Value  in the Content-Type field as:
   text/xml; charset=ccsid of the message bodyEnd of change
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere Message Broker infocenter topic on HttpHeaders
   (ac00477_) is now updated to reflect this information.
