APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A WebSpehre/J2EE server that has its java.rmi.server.codebase
   property set for use by its applications using RMI is configured
   with ITCAM Data collector, the value is overwritten.
   This results in application failure since the RMI classes are no
   longer able to be downloaded.  The exception seen is typically a
   java.lang.Class NotFoundException that could be wrapped in a
   remote ServerException.
   
   Users Affected:  WebSphere/J2EE applications that use RMI.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually merge the application-specific java.rmi.server.codebase
   value with ITCAM's in the
   <DC_HOME>/runtime/<server>/dc.java.properties file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   *
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * Application servers that use RMI applications and have set the
   * java.rmi.server.codebase property to annotate RMI remote
   * classes.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * ITCAM uses RMI for Data Collector <-> Managing server
   * communication.  It sets its own java.rmi.server.codebase
   * property for this purpose that overrides the application
   * setting.  This causes failure in RMI calls made by the
   * applications.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This fix merges the java.rmi.server.codebase proprety that is
   set in the start up script of the application servers with that
   of ITCAM URLs.  The ITCAM URLs are appended at the end of the
   codebase value.
