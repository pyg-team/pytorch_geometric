ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Module prompts to save even when there are no modifications made
   to the module
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   - Open module in Exclusive Edit
   - Click on Edit -? Attributes
   - Select an attribute and click on Edit
   - Do not modify anything, just click on OK
   - Close the module
   
   Current behavior:
   User will be prompted to save the module.
   Module level history entry is created for modification of
   attribute
   
   Expected behavior:
   No history entry should be created, and no prompt to save the
   module should be shown.
   
   Other symptoms:
   - If the module is opened in Read-only and performs the same set
   of operations, clicking on OK in the Edit Attribute dialog will
   throw the following message:
   'No access to modify attribute ?attribute name?'
   - The behavior is applicable for Attribute Types as well - but
   limited to specific Types only.
   Note - if these other symptoms needs considered as different
   problem, please update this at the earliest so that I can raise
   another APAR.
