APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During installation of Central Server 2, the install of BPM
   reached a 30 minute SSH timeout and the installation eventually
   failed.
   
   The error looks like:
   ################################################################

   ################################################################
   
   In this case it was noticed that the ERROR occurs at exactly 30
   minutes after the BPM install was started.  I was only
   happenstance that BPM install was the action taking place -
   depending on the environment or the configuration it could be
   another install task which fails.  By design, our installer
   provides 4 hours timeout for all of the BPM install and profile
   configuration steps to complete.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The workaround is to disable the 2 entries in the sshd_config,
   and restart sshd service:
   #ClientAliveInterval 30m
   #ClientAliveCountMax 0
   
   When chef initiates remote session from deployment server to
   central server (and region server) it uses ssh connections in
   thread and as such these connections are limited by the sshd
   server configuration on the machine being connected to.
   
   We reccommend that during ICO install, the sshd service turn
   off the above settings and then re-enable them once install is
   complete.
