QUESTION
 How can I open a web page successfully using the Web widget in the Dashboard Application Service Hub (DASH) ? 

CAUSE
Using the Web widget in DASH, trying to open a web page like:

http://www.ibm.com [http://www.ibm.com]

might result in a blank page being displayed.

ANSWER
Newer version of browsers started being more particular how pages are being called within a page. If the parent page (DASH) is loaded as https:// it won't let you load just http:// in the iframe.

Try using https://www.ibm.com [https://www.ibm.com] instead.
