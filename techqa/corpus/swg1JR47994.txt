APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a user deletes a widget from a Business Space page, it is
   removed from the page at the time of deletion; however, after
   the user logs out of Business Space and logs back in, the
   previously deleted widget reappears on the page.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue only affects certain browser versions, using a
   different browser version can work around the problem.  Firefox
   17, Chrome and Safari browsers can be used to edit the pages
   where widgets need to be deleted.

   ****************************************************************
   Widget deletion in Business Space does not work correctly
   (deletion is not "persisted" at logout from Business Space).
   A Dojo update changed the method dojo.destroy() in a way which
   caused this issue.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Revising the dojo.destroy() method to properly handle widget
   deletion resolved the issue.
   
   An interim fix for Business Space V8.0.1.1 has been published
   to Fix Central.  Please refer to the separate file that is
   automatically downloaded with the interim fix for prerequisite
   information and installation/uninstallation instructions.
   This interim fix can be installed on Business Process Manager
   V8.0.1.1 and Business Monitor V8.0.1.1 (which include Business
   Space V8.0.1.1).
