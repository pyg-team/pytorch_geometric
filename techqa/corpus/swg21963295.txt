CAUSE
The integration script to integrate DASH and TCR fails to execute after install. After, JazzSM services are installed the WebSphere Application Sever (WAS) may take a long time to come back up and this can prevent the integration script from being executed.


ENVIRONMENT
This affects all the versions of JazzSM post 1.1. These scripts were introduced 1.1.0.1 onwards but were not present in 1.1 release.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1) Confirm the Reporting services are installed properly and accessible directly. Open a web browser and enter the following URL for the reporting interface (this link should be used in the local environment): 

http://host.domain:port/tarf/servlet/dispatch 

NOTE: host.domain is the fully qualified IP address or hostname which hosts the reporting server (localhost). The default port number is 16310.

2) Enter the user name <was_admin> and password <was_admin_password> to log on.

A successful log on implies the reporting service has been properly installed. However, the integration script for DASH failed to execute.

3) The "cognosPortlet.war" file should be missing in the following directory:
Windows: JazzSM_Install_Home\profile\installedApps\JazzSMNode01Cell\isc.ear
Linux/UNIX: JazzSM_Install_Home/profile/installedApps/JazzSMNode01Cell/isc.ear


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In order to get the above directory in the folders mentioned above execute the integration files under: 

Windows: JazzSM_Install_Home\reporting\integration\dash\integrateDASH <was_admin> <was_admin_password> 
Linux/UNIX: JazzSM_Install_Home/reporting/integration/dash/integrateDASH.sh <was_admin> <was_admin_password>

Once the above scripts are executed the "cognosPortlet.war" file should be populated under:
Windows: JazzSM_Install_Home\profile\installedApps\JazzSMNode01Cell\isc.ear
Linux/UNIX: JazzSM_Install_Home/profile/installedApps/JazzSMNode01Cell/isc.ear
