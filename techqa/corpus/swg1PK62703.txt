   1. The VSE tape fileid can be a maximum of 17 bytes and can
      contain embedded blanks.  If tape fileid contains embedded
      blanks then Ditto/ESA for VSE requires the fileid to be
      enclosed in quotes. With the tape fileid panel field being
      only 17 bytes wide , then the maximum tape fileid cannot be
      entered.
   2. Section title in functions BT - Create Tape Data and
      BS - Create Sequential Data are Input and Output instead
      of Output and Output Records.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  1. Ditto/ESA for VSE panel fields for tape fileid have been
      expanded to 19 characters to allow maximum size tape fileid
      to be enclosed in quotes.
   2. The section titles have been corrected.
