Title: IBM How can I create a TM1 Service? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What steps should I take to create a TM1 Service? 

ANSWER
 

From a command window, change to the TM1 bin directory. The default installation path is "C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1\bin"

For example:

CD "C:\Program Files\Cognos\TM1\bin"
tm1sd.exe -install -n"ServiceName" -z"DataDirectoryPath"

NOTE:
* There should be no space between the parameter and its value (e.g., no space between -n and "ServiceName")
* If either the Service Name or the Data Directory Path contains a space, its value must be enclosed by double quotes

A successful command returns the following message:

TM1 Server / ServiceName installed.
