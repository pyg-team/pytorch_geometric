Title: IBM Rational Software Delivery Platform desktop product fails to launch - United States

Text:
RSA; RSD; RMT; RPT; RAD; RSM; RFT; JVM; CPU; hang; launch; start; 100%; eclipse.ini; 11480 442 000; 1255195; exit code = 1; exit code TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to launch one of the desktop products of the Rational Software Delivery Platform, such as Rational Software Architect, Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software, Rational Performance Tester, results in the error "JVM terminated Exit Code = 1" or the javaw.exe process takes 100% of the CPU and hangs. 

SYMPTOM
You receive a "JVM terminated Exit Code = 1" error, or the javaw.exe process takes 100% of the CPU and hangs.

CAUSE
The problem may be due to the -Xshareclasses:singleJVM,keep switch in the eclipse.ini file. 

This switch creates a cache that provides a means of sharing all loaded classes that places no restrictions on the JVMs that are sharing the class data. This feature offers a straightforward and flexible solution for reducing the virtual memory footprint and improving startup time. 

If the cache becomes corrupt, no new JVMs will be allowed to connect to the cache. Existing JVMs can continue to function, but cannot update the cache.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, the corrupted cache needs to be cleared. 

Note: The cache will be rebuilt the next time the product is launched. 

Prior to clearing the cache, ensure that all Java-based applications are closed and that javaw.exe is not running. If javaw.exe is running, you may need to terminate the process. 

To clear the cache: 

 1. Open a command prompt.
    
 2. Navigate to .../SDP70/jdk/jre/bin
    
 3. Enter the following command:  * On Microsoft Windows: 
       javaw.exe -Xshareclasses:destroy
       
     * On Linux: 
       ./javaw -Xshareclasses:destroy
       
       
    
    
 4. The product should now launch normally
