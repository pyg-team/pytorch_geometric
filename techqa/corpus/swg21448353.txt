QUESTION
 The SOA agent crashes trying to process a large metric log file. 

CAUSE
This is caused by a large metric log file. The agent tries to process this file and crashes.

ANSWER
The SOA d4 agent may crash when trying to process a very large metric file (approx. 1GB). This large file was created over a period of time when the agent was down earlier for an extended period of time. Thus, when the agent comes back up, it can't handle this large file and crashes. 

The recovery is simply to delete (or move) this large metric file and restart the agent. You will find the agent will stay up now.

The future prevention is to make sure when the agent goes down for extended periods of time, is to disable the DC too.
