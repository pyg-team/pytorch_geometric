APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer reported using a Proxy server to redirect clients to
   the Traveler server.  The proxy is using standard 302 redirects
   but is using a relative URL segment instead of the fully
   qualified path.  This appears to work fine with Android and
   Apple devices but not Windows Mobile or Nokia.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Customer reported that both Windows Mobile and Nokia device were
   not able to connect to their Traveler server.  The customer is
   using a proxy server that redirects using a relative URL
   fragment.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Windows Mobile and Nokia clients were not handling the
   relative URL correctly, while Android and Apple were.  The WM
   and Nokia clients have been updated to handle correctly.
   
   This is an uncommon scenario.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  This fix will be included in Lotus Traveler 8.5.3.2 and later
   releases.  For the latest recommended maintenance please see
