DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Netcool/Omnibus stores DE path in the following file. If the path of DE being used does not match the value of the DEHOME property this file then DE will display above message. Take a look into this file and resolve the discrepancy.

$NCHOME/omnibus/platform/<ARCH>/install/install.properties.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If host name is changed then certain files need to be updated in DE to reflect new host name and DE installation directory. Following Technote explains how to change host name in DE:

The following file is Netcool/Omnibus specific. To resolve above Error/Warning message update DEHOME property in this file to reflect the new DE directory:

$NCHOME/omnibus/platform/<ARCH>/install/install.properties.

After making above change try installation again.
