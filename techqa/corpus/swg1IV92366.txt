   Application effected
   ====================
   USER INTERFACE
   
   L2 ACTION TAKEN
   =================
   I had a remote session with the client and I have reproduced
   the second use case scenario which was reported by client after
   applying LAFIX_IV87825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV87825]_7605-20160611 in the original PMR:
   78173,001,754.
   
   Basically client is saying this APAR: IV87825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV87825] hasn't fixed all
   possible use case scenarios. i.e when adding Multiline text box
   with a condition to display "SUBMIT" button. Field Tab out
   skips to browser URL Issue for Multiline text box.
   
   Here is the detailed description of the use case which is not
   fixed by LAFIX_IV87825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV87825]_7605-20160611
   
   Steps to reproduce
   ==================
   
   I have been able to reproduce the same behaviour in 7605.
   
   1. Copy the following code and past after line 105 in out of box
   CREATESR.XML -->Save changes and Import via App Designer

   2.Create two conditions in Conditional Expression Manager :
   
   Name: BGHIDE1
   Type: EXPRESSION
   Expression: :REPORTEDPRIORITY =1
   
   Name: BGHIDE2
   Type: EXPRESSION
   Expression: :INTERNALPRIORITY =2
   
   3. In App Designer create two new sigoptions BGHIDE1 and BGHIDE2
   
   4. Grant access for new sigoptions in Security Groups MAXADMIN
   and add these conditions created at step 2: BGHIDE1 and BGHIDE2
   
   Make sure "Always Synchronous?" is enabled in App designer for
   CREATSR.
   
   5. Go to App Designer-->CREATESR--> Highlight presentation -->
   Bring up Presentation Properties and Check the box for "Always
   Synchronous?"
   
   6. Go to Self Service-->Service Request--> Create Service
   Request
   
   7. Under Details SECTION - in "Please Read: Is this a correct
   Address" field Enter 1 and tab out
   
   8. You see the second field "Please Read: Do you want to
   continue with no gas job set up" is DISPLAYED
   
   ORIGINAL PROBLEM
   =================
   9. Enter 2 and tab out, you see the focus of the cursor moved
   to Maximo URL rather than displaying the 3rd field.
   
   10. Now move the cursor in any other field. i.e Details field.
   
   You will see the 3rd field is finally displayed.
   
   THIS ORGINAL PROBLEM IS NOW RESOLVED WITH
   LAFIX_IV87825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV87825]_7605-20160611 -HOWEVER THE LAFIX HASN'T RESOLVED
   ALL POSSIBLE USE CASES - HERE IS THE CONTINUATION OF THE USE
   CASE WHICH NEED TO BE RESOLVED.
   
   11. Create new condition BGHIDE3 (DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION
   is not null)
   
   12. Open Application Designer --> Open CREATESR application.
   
   13. Create new signature option named BGHIDE3.
   
   14. Add a Multiline text box and bind it to
   SR.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION in Create Service Request
   application below SR.INTERNALPRIORITY Field. (Note we are
   updating the same section which we created to recreate the
   issue earlier)
   
   15. Copy/past SECTION Buttongroup below Multiline text box &
   Apply the sig option BGHIDE3 on the "SUBMIT" button section.
   
   16. Save the record.
   
   17. Go to Security Group and open Create Service Request
   application.
   
   18. Apply condition BGHIDE3 on signature option BGHIDE3, grant
   access and save the record.
   
   To Test the new use case bug with Multiline text box
   =====================================================
   19. Navigate to Create Service Request application
   
   20. Create a new record.
   
   21. Enter value ?1? in first field (SR.REPORTEDPRIORITY)
   and tab out. This will display second/next field
   (SR.INTERNALPRIORITY).
   
   22. Enter value ?2? in field 2(SR.INTERNALPRIORITY ) and
   tab out, it will then display the third field (Multi Line text
   box - SR.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION). Works fine till here with
   LAFIX_IV87825 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV87825]_7605-20160611
   
   23.  Now, enter text in third field (Multi Line text box -
   SR.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION ) and then tab out. (Note
   We have a condition to display "SUBMIT" button when value is
   entered in SR.DESCRIPTION_LONGDESCRIPTION field)
   
   Expected result: On tab out, next field/button should be visible
   i.e."SUBMIT" button.
   
   Actual Result: On tab out, next field (i.e.button) is not
   visible, and tab out reference switches to browser URL.
   Sometimes, you have to click on the field and tab out multiple
   times or wait long period for the next field to appear.
