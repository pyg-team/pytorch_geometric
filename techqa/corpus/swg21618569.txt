Title: IBM wasadmin userid in IBM Content Analytics with Enteprise Search 3.0 - United States

Text:
wasadmin; master administrator TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search (ICAwES) the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) administrative userid wasadmin is seen in the list of administrative users as a master administrator. Why is this user id created and when? Also when I try to log in I am unable to do so. What do I need to do to log in as wasadmin? 

ENVIRONMENT
Assumptions: 

WebSphere Application Server userid : wasadmin 

Enterprise Search Administrator userid: esadmin


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When you install ICAwES on WAS with global security enabled, the ICAwES installer automatically adds global security administrator as master administrator. This is an enhancement on ICAwES 3.0 to avoid a situation that no one can login to Admin UI. 

 
Secondly the reason why you were not able to login to the ICA 3.0 system using wasadmin was most probably because only the administrative security was turned on in the WAS console. If you want to be able to login to the ICA ESAdmin using the wasadmin userid, the esadmin userid and also your userid from another LDAP server then you need to setup Federated LDAP Repositories in WAS.
