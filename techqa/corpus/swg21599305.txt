Title: IBM SecureMain fails with error KCI1343E - United States

Text:
0403-027 The parameter list is too long; SecureMain; KCI1343E; 0403-027 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Agent install fails during secureMain and generates an error - /usr/bin/chmod: 0403-027 The parameter list is too long 

SYMPTOM
The itmsecure_<timestamp>.log shows the below error

/Tivoli/itm/bin/secureLock[134]: /usr/bin/chmod: 0403-027 The parameter list is too long. 
KCI1343E secureMain completed with errors. For more information, check 
the log file /Tivoli/itm/logs/itmsecure_062012135428.log. 


CAUSE
The real cause for this error is: 

 
The system has exceeded the AIX ARG_MAX value: 0403-027 The parameter list is too long. This AIX value can be increased with smitty. 

The maximum size, in 4KB blocks, that the ARG/ENV list is allowed when running exec subroutines. This prevents exec subroutines from failing if the argument list is too long. You can specify a value in the range of 6 through 1024. The default value is 6. Specifying a higher value may constrain system memory resources. This change takes affect immediately and is preserved over boot."


ENVIRONMENT
AIX any version



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue increase the ARG_MAX value 

To check the value use the below command : 

lsattr -E -l sys0 -a ncargs 

To change the value use the below command. You can change the value to 32, or increase to few more than the original value.

chdev -l sys0 -a ncargs='32' (default is 6)
