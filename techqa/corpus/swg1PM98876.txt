APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During the CF installation Portal starts the node manager and
   the Portal server on the node. When the node manager starts the
   server on its own then this clashes with the server start by
   the install process. This results in the install to fail.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Change the monitoring policy to STOPPED before you install the
   CF.
