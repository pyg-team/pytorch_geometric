Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM SDK Java Technology Edition that is used by IBM License Metric Tool and IBM Tivoli Asset Discovery for Distributed.These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015. 

This bulletin also addresses FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys SSL/TLS vulnerability and RC4 Bar Mitzvah Attack for SSL/TLS vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0488 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0488]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and Jrockit related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102336] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-0478 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0478]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and JRockit related to the JCE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/102339] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]
DESCRIPTION: Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101995] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
 IBM License Metric Tool v9 & v7.5 & v7.2.2 

IBM Tivoli Asset Discovery for Distributed v7.5 & v7.2.2 

IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis v2.2 & v9

REMEDIATION/FIXES
- For products with version 9, upgade to version 9.2.1.0 or newer. 

In order to upgrade to version 9.2.1.0 or newer: 

 * In IBM Endpoint Manager console, expand IBM License Reporting or IBM BigFix Inventory node under Sites node in the tree panel. 
 * Click Fixlets and Tasks node. Fixlets and Tasks panel will be displayed on the right. 
 * In the Fixlets and Tasks panel locate Upgrade to the newest version of License Metric Tool 9.x or Upgrade to the newest version of IBM BigFix Inventory 9.x fixlet and run it against the computer that hosts your IBM License Metric Tool or IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis server.


Note: In an airgapped environment, you have to run BESAirgapTool and BESDownloadCacher first in order to update your site.  

- For IBM Endpoint Manager for Software Use Analysis v2.2, upgrade to Patch 10 or newer. 

- For products with versions 7.5 and 7.2.2, apply WebSphere Application Server fixes for IBM Java SDK as described in the following security bulletin: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902260 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902260]. Please mind that servers in version 7.5 use WebSphere Application Server 7, and servers in version 7.2.2 use WebSphere Application Server 6.1.
