PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You would like to use IBMLink to check for the price or cost of the product. You are planning to upgrade to CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) 5.2, 5.1, 4.2 or 4.1 or to a new version of one of the CICS Tools. On the "Purchase/upgrade tools" menu, you select the "Look up IBM standard hardware and software prices (Price)" application. You enter the product number and the search results in a RC=4 (RC4) and message SMSG0028. 

SYMPTOM
You receive the following error in red text: 

Retrieval of price data failed; RC = 4

SMSG0028 Product is not in Data Base

Note: For recent zSeries Software Prices, select ESWPrice from the Purchase/upgrade tools page.


CAUSE
Newer products are no longer entered in the Price application.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the Look up zSeries Entitled Software prices (ESWPrice) application to find the price for CICS TS V5.2, V5.1, V4.2 or V4.1, and the CICS Tools. To do this, you can do the following:


 1. Sign onto IBMLink at http://www.ibm.com/ibmlink [http://www.ibm.com/ibmlink]
    
    
 2. On the ServiceLink screen, click on Purchase/upgrade tools: 
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=1]
    
    
 3. Click on Look up IBM System z software prices (ESWPrice).
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=2]
    
    
 4. Click on Product number, enter 5655-Y04 for CICS TS V5.2 and V5.1 or 5655-S97 for CICS TS V4.2 and V4.1, and then click on Search:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=3]
    
    You can get the prices for CICS Tools in the same way. The Product number for each of the CICS V5.2 Tools can be found in the CICS V5.2 Tools announcement [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS214-153] under "Program number". For example, 5655-Y22 is the Program number in the announcement letter for CICS Deployment Assistant for z/OS.
    
    
 5. Click on the "Entitlement Entity (EE)" of S0172DF for CICS TS for z/OS V5.2 and V5.1 or S015H9T for CICS TS V4.2 and V4.1. Both EEs will have a "Description" of CICS TS for z/OS:
    
    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21220237&aid=4]
    

Then the prices will display. 

Note: There were no charges for upgrades to a higher release within a version. Therefore, the price for CICS TS V5.2 and CICS TS V5.1 are the same and the price for CICS TS V4.2 and CICS TS V4.1 are the same.
