ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ESR: In Version 7.1 of omnibus, the logs for the UNI/BI gates
   (v7 nco_g_objserv_uni/nco_g_objserv_bi) are showing a lot of
   unuseful messages due to a script running an nco_ping agains the
   gateay. we want these messages to be cleaned from the logs as
   they are not useful.
   As the ping runs every minute to check if the gateway is still
   running, these messages are filling up the logs.
   customer wants to get ride if this.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the Object Server uni or bi         *
   *                 gateway.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When nco_ping is run against the        *
   *                      gateway, an unhelpful message is        *
   *                      logged.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   nco_ping and friends try to log in as user nobody. This is
   logged as a failure, as the user nobody is unlikely to exist
   locally.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The user nobody is now special and can not log on. Any
   connections of user nobody are silently dropped, since nco_ping
   uses this to test the connect.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:  - 7.0.1.9-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0009  -
   7.1.0.2-TIV-NCOMNIbus-FP0002
