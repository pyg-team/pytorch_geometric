LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3 that applies the
   required database changes for the interim fixes specified in the
   -ifix parameter of the upgradeProcessData command.
   
   On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
   for JR56053:
   
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
     the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
     level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR56053, and click Continue.
   
   When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
   the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
   additional installation instructions and information about the
   fix.
   
   To apply the fix, complete the following steps:
   
   1. Perform a controlled shutdown of the IBM Business Process
     Manager server to ensure that all transactions have completed.
   2. Extract the compressed file to a directory, such as C:\temp.
   3. Add the fix pack repository location in IBM Installation
     Manager:
     a. In Installation Manager, click File > Preferences >
       Repositories.
     b. Click Add Repository.
     c. Browse to or enter the file path to the repository.config
       file. The repository.config file is located in the directory
       where you extracted the compressed files. For example, enter
       C:\temp\repository.config, and then click OK.
   4. On the main page of the Installation Manager, click Update.
   5. After all the fixes have been installed by using Installation
     Manager, update the database:
     a. Back up the IBM BPM database.
     b. For the DB2, MSSQL and Oracle databases, complete the
       following steps:
       i. From a command prompt, go to the
         {SERVER}\BPM\Lombardi\tools\upgrade\UpgradeProcessData
         directory,
       ii. Running the following command:
         - On a stand-alone server
           - On Windows
           upgradeProcessData.bat -profileName {PROFILE_NAME} -ifix
            <interimfix list separated by ,>
           - On Linux
           upgradeProcessData.sh -profileName {PROFILE_NAME} -ifix
            <interimfix list separated by ,>
         - In a network deployment environment
           - On Windows
           upgradeProcessData..bat -profileName {PROFILE_NAME}
   -nodeName {NODE_NAME} -serverName {SERVER_NAME} -ifix
   <interimfix list separated by ,>
           - On Linux
           upgradeProcessData..sh -profileName {PROFILE_NAME}
   -nodeName {NODE_NAME} -serverName {SERVER_NAME} -ifix
   <interimfix list separated by ,>
   6. Verify that the output of the command states "JR<xxxxx>
   installed successfully" for all interim fixes of the interimfix
   list. The output might contain one or more occurrences of the
   message "Error executing SQL statement". You can ignore this
   message as long as the command is completed with the success
   message.
   
   7. Restart the IBM BPM server.
   
   To remove the fix, complete the following steps:
   
   NOTE:  Remove the fixes in the reverse order they were applied.
   Do not remove a fix unless all fixes that were applied after it
   were removed first. You may reapply any fix.
   
   For example, if your system has fix1, fix2, and fix3 applied in
   that order and you want to remove fix2, fix3 must be removed
   first; then you may remove fix2.
   
   1. Perform a controlled shutdown of the IBM Business Process
     Manager server to ensure that all transactions have completed.
   2. In IBM Installation Manager, cick Uninstall.
   3. Select the package you want to uninstall and follow the
     prompts.
   4. Restart IBM BPM.
   
   To reapply the fix, perform steps 1-4 of the procedure to
   install the fix and then restart the IBM BPM server.
