QUESTION
 Can ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0 TEMA be enabled for self-description (SDA)? 

CAUSE
When an agent integrates with IBM Tivoli Monitoring version 6.2.3 or later and the HUB and remote monitoring servers (RTEMS) and the agent are enabled for self-description, application support files are automatically installed on the HUB and RTEMS and the portal server, without the need to recycle the monitoring servers or the portal server. 

ANSWER
ITCAM for J2EE v7.1.1.0 TEMA agents (unpatched) are not self-describing. 

You must Install ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 support files for TEMS/TEPS/TEP in the ITM environment.

ITCAM Agent for J2EE 7.1.1.0.0 support files are both contained in the agent installation image (e.g. 7.1.1-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE-Windows-RP001 on Fixcentral) and bundled in a separate installation image (e.g. 7.1.1-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE_ITM-RP001 on Fixcentral).

On the other hand SDA feature has been introduced starting from Interim Fix 1 7.1.1.0-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE-IF0001, so you might want to patch YJ agent to this or a later maintenance level to exploit SDA.
