ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Bug in source code concerning the Deployment for TAD4D 7.2.1.
   
   The deployment for TAD4D has hard coded "server1" name which is
   incorrect. The server name is "tad4dserver" within Websphere and
   within
   setupWAS.properties file.
   PMR 68586,004,000 was the first PMR which defined the first set
   of
   problems dealing with TAD4D 7.2.1.
   ****** here are errors during deployment ******

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A fact that application server name can be different than
   server1 was addressed by adding the following point in the
   upgrade scenario:
   
   (optional) Change the serverName property in the
   deployISCAEWars.ant file if the server name is different then
   default server1. In the file deployISCAEWars.ant located in
   WAS/profilesTemplates/iscae71/actions directory provide a valid
   server name in the following line: property name="serverName"
   value="server1".
