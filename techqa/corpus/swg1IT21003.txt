APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The mq-qm state machine may stop if there are more than 2
   events transiting the same mq-qm object to down at the same
   time.
   For example, there are more than 2 connections established for
   the mq-qm. When the network suddenly goes down, both of the
   connections break and then transit the mq-qm to down at the
   same time. In this case, the mq-qm state machine may stop. It
   will need manual restart the mq-qm object to reactivate.
   Only these or later firmware version are affected:  7.0.0.17,
   7.1.0.14, 7.2.0.11, 7.5.0.5, 7.5.1.4, 7.5.2.2
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually restart the mq-qm object to reactivate it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The state of mq-qm might not change when there are more than
   two external events fired in a short time.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.1.0.18, 7.2.0.15, 7.5.0.9, 7.5.1.8,
   7.5.2.8 and 7.6.0.0.
