QUESTION
 How can I remove the AccessAgent from a system without any user interaction? 

ANSWER
 

You will need to modify the following settings in the SetupHlp.ini.


;Whether to suppress all prompts and write to log. <1|0> (default: 0)
;Required for GPO installation
InstallTypeGpo=1

To suppress a reboot 
;Whether to trigger a machine reboot after setup. <1|0> (default: 1)
RebootEnabled=0


Using the standard msiexec command and switches you can create a package to run on systems that you would like the Access Agent uninstalled without rebooting the system. 

 

Example of the command would be 

msiexec /uninstall "ISAM ESSO AccessAgent" /quiet /norestart 

or if you would like the system rebooted after the uninstall 

msiexec /uninstall "ISAM ESSO AccessAgent" /quiet 


Note: The Access Agent will not be logged off or removed from the system until the system is rebooted.
