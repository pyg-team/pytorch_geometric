 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you clean up huge cache files in IBMIMShared folder after installation of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (ISBI) using IBM Installation Manager (IIM)? 

CAUSE
During installation of ISBI using IIM some big files are are cached in IBMIMShared folder.
After installation those files are no longer neded but they are not deleted automatically.

ANSWER
Please do not delete those files manually but follow the instruction outlined in the IBM TechNote "Deleting installation rollback files" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692512].
Alternatively set 'com.ibm.cic.common.core.preferences.preserveDownloadedArtifacts' from 'true' to 'false' in the installation XML response file so that those big files will not be kept.
