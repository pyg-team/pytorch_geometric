Message Broker flow hang TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.x flow may hang while processing a WebSphere Transformation Extender Map Node. 

SYMPTOM
Message Broker flows that contain WebSphere Transformation Extender Map Nodes stop processing data.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Message Broker input messages continue to accumulate and no output is generated from flows that contain WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Map Nodes. Generating and inspecting a Message Broker Service trace will indicate a message is being processed by a WTX Map Node yet the WTX map execution does not complete. There will be no corresponding WTX Map Node completion message in the service trace. 

The Message Broker service trace, stdout and / or stderr files will not indicate any errors indicating the WTX map within the flow is in a hung state.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Review the contents of the WTX dtx.ini initialization file to determine whether the Resource Manager setting for CentralMgmtNonLauncher is enabled. In Windows environments, the dtx.ini file will be located in the WTX installation directory and in UNIX environments the dtx.ini file is located in the config subdirectory of the WTX installation. 

The CentralMgmtNonLauncher option is enabled by default with a value of 1. 

Solutions are: 

 1. If the CentralMgmtNonLauncher option is enabled, then disable by changing the value from 1 to 0. Then save the dtx.ini file and restart Message Broker. 
 2. Open a PMR and request the patch for APAR PM74929 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM74929].
