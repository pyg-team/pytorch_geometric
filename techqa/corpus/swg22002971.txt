RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You should be able to change that in the vmcliConfiguration.xml config file. By default this is located in: 


Windows : 
C:\IBM\tivoli\tsm\tdpvmware\webserver\usr\servers\veProfile\tsmVmGUI 
Linux : 
/opt/tivoli/tsm/tdpvmware/common/webserver/usr/servers/veProfile/tsmVmGUI/ 

You will need to change the vcenter_url parameter.

<vcenter_url>https://vcenter.myco.com/sdk [https://vcenter.myco.com/sdk]</vcenter_url>
<enable_direct_start>yes</enable_direct_start>
</vmcliAdaptor>

Make sure to restart the "Data Protection for VMware Web Server" service to pick up the change in Windows.
