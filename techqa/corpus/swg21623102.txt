QUESTION
 Which Attribute Group(s) should be enabled for Historical Data Collection (HDC) in order to generate TCR reports provided by monitoring agent for SAP V7.1? 

CAUSE
 Corrections are required to the information published in the documentation for SAP agent V7.1, Tivoli Common Reporting.
1) The documentation page for history configuration required for the predefined reports needs corrections.
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/sap/tcr_configurehistoricalcollection.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/sap/tcr_configurehistoricalcollection.html]
2) The documentation for table names in Warehouse database used by some of the predefined reports are incorrect:
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/sap/tcr_predefinedreports.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.1/sap/tcr_predefinedreports.html]


ANSWER
1) The TCR history collection document has the following incorrect information, only the daily summarization is used by the predefined reports and the table names listed on this page are not correct: 


Enable daily and hourly summarization for the following tables:
KSAALERTS
KSAARCHIVE
...
KSAPERLAYR
KSAPROSSTS
KSAQRFCSA

Correct history collection and summarization information is as follows: 

- The history collection is required for only the attribute groups listed in the table below. Each row shows the TCR report name, history collection required for that TCR report and the corresponding table name in Warehouse database. 

- Daily summarization is used by the predefined TCR reports. Hourly summarization is not required. 

 

SAP Agent 7.1 Predefined TCR report Attribute Group name (HDC) Table name in Warehouse database DB2 Database Performance DB2 Configuration Information DB2_CON_INFO ICM Monitoring Performance SAP ICM Monitor SAP_ICM_MON_INFO Instance Performance Instance Configuration R/3_Instance_Configuration qRFC Inbound Queue Performance SAP qRFC Inbound Queues SAP_qRFC_Inbound_Queues_Overview Server Performance Report Solution Manager Servers SolMan_Servers_Overview 
2) Refer to following table for correct history table names used by predefined TCR reports for the SAP agent:  

SAP Agent 7.1 TCR report Incorrect Warehouse table name Correct Warehouse table name ICM Monitoring Performance PI_ICM_MON_INFO SAP_ICM_MON_INFO qRFC Inbound Queue Performance PI_XI_qRFC_Inbound_Queues_Overview SAP_qRFC_Inbound_Queues_Overview 
3) The Daily summarization table and view names have the following appended to the Warehouse table name: 
Daily summarization table, _D 
Daily summarization table view, _DV 

For example, the Daily Summarization for Warehouse table DB2_CON_INFO is stored in the table named DB2_CON_INFO_D and the Daily Summarization View is named DB2_CON_INFO_DV. 

The correct information is published in the SAP agent reference information [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JRN_7.2.1/com.ibm.itcama.doc_7.2.1/sap/sap_landing_ref.html] document for SAP agent, 7.1.1 release. RELATED INFORMATION
