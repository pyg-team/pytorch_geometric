APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Channel Authentication fails with various errors when CLNTUSER
   id is greater then 12 characters.
   The following errors will be seen:
   AMQ9557: Queue Manager User ID initialization failed.
   EXPLANATION:
   The call to initialize the User ID failed with CompCode 2 and
   Reason 2035.
   
   AMQ5653: The user 'xxxxxxx' is not defined.
   EXPLANATION:
   The system call getpwnam("xxxxxxx") failed with errno -1.
   
   AMQ9777: Channel was blocked
   EXPLANATION:
   The inbound channel 'QM1.SVRCONN' was blocked from address
   'xxx.xx.xx.xxx' because the active values of the channel
   matched a record configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active
   values of the channel were 'CLNTUSER(xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx)'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a userid less then 12 characters in length.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users using channel authentication who wish to configure and
   use rules for client names longer than 12 characters on
   non-Windows platforms.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Solaris x86-64, Solaris SPARC, Linux on zSeries, Linux on
   x86-64, Linux on x86, Linux on Power, HP-UX Itanium, AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   On Unix platforms, the maximum length of the CLNTUSER field when
   adding a channel authentication (CHLAUTH) record was 12
   characters. However incoming clients were matched against
   their long user ID, not the short user ID. This meant it was not
   possible to correctly map clients which reported usernames of
   longer than 12 characters as it was simply not possible to
   configure this within the queue manager on Unix platforms.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The maximum length for the CLNTUSER field has been increased
   on Unix platforms to 64 characters. This is the same length
   Windows users, and is the maximum length of the long user ID
   field of an MQMD.
   
   This makes it possible to configure the queue manager such
   that clients reporting user names of longer than 12 characters
   will be correctly mapped.
