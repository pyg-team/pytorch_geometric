 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am trying to install SPSS for Windows and get the following error:

"Error 1311 Source file not found basutl.cab" 

and cannot continue with installation. How can I install SPSS? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This error message is due to the security policy of Windows which may not let your computer autoplay the SPSS CD-ROM or allow you to double click on the CD in order to run the installer. 

This can be worked around by either editing a registry key or running the setup file off of your desktop.

To edit the AllocateCDRoms key:
Go to Start->Run and type 'Regedit' in the Open field. In the registry, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon\AllocateCDRoms. If the value for AllocateCDRoms is set to "1", change it to "0", reboot the machine and try again. 

Warning: These instructions involve modifying the Windows registry. Modifications to the Windows registry, if not done correctly, can cause serious problems to a Windows system. Consider backing up any registry keys you modify to a .reg file.

To run setup off the desktop:
Copy the SPSS folder from the CD-ROM to your Hard Drive (If running Windows NT 4.0/2000, you may skip this step.):
Go to Start->Programs->Windows Explorer
Right-click the SPSS CD-ROM and select Open to access the contents
Drag the entire SPSS directory to directory on your hard drive, e.g. c:\windows\temp.
This will take a few minutes, but when it is complete, close the Windows Explorer.

Log in with Administrative privileges (For Windows NT 4.0/2000 only).
Go to Start->Run and Browse to the SPSS directory on the hard drive.
Within that directory, navigate to Setup.exe and select Open and Press OK to begin installation.
