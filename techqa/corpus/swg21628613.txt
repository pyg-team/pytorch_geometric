QUESTION
 While configuring ITCAM for SOA and WebSphere DataPower Appliances, I am able to access Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) using the default SYSADMIN user ID without the use of a passord. How to I enable TEP to require a password for the SYSADMIN user? 

CAUSE
The SYSADMIN user ID is created by default to not require the use of a password.

ANSWER
The SYSADMIN ID is a special ID and the password used for it is the operating system password. 

For setting and changing the password in Windows:

1. Reset thesysadmin password:
a. Open a command window.
b. Issue the following command:


 * net user sysadmin new_password


For example, issue the following command: 
 * net user sysadmin Passw0rd


2. Ensure that the sysadmin user is not disabled. Sometimes the user is disabled because of too many logins. 
a. Right-click My Computer 
b. Select Manage > Local Users and Groups > Users > sysadmin 
c. Verify that the account is not disabled. 

3. Recycle (stop and then start) the Tivoli Enterprise Monitor Server agent and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server agent from the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server:

For setting and changing the password in Unix: 

1. Add SYSADMIN as a UNIX ID by issuing the following command: 
 * useradd sysadmin
 * 


2. Specify a password for sysadmin by issuing the following command: 
 * passwd sysadmin


3. Recycle (stop and then start) the Tivoli Enterprise Monitor Server agent and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server agent from the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server:
