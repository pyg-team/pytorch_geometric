APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using MQIPT 2.0.0.3 with SSL channels that specify a
   ciphersuite that uses the TLS 1.0 protocol, the channels fail
   the SSL handshake as there is a protocol mismatch between MQIPT
   and  WebSphere MQ.
   
   The following error will be see in the queue manager log file:
   
   AMQ9661 : 'Bad SSL data from peer on channel ...'
   
   The following ciphersuites, specified in the MQIPT
   configuration are affected:
   
   SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5
   SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
   SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5
   SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Customers using SSL with MQIPT 2.0.0.3 in SSLClient and/or
   SSLServer mode, with WebSphere MQ
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   During the SSL handshake between MQIPT and WebSphere MQ, each
   side of the communication establishes the SSL/TLS protocol
   version that they require to be used.
   
   This error occurs because MQIPT requests SSL 3.0 when the
   ciphersuite requires TLS 1.0 (sometimes referred to as SSL 3.1)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The package that determines which protocol to use based on the
   ciphersuite specified has been changed to map the TLS 1.0
   ciphersuites to TLS 1.0 rather than SSL 3.0.
