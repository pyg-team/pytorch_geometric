APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Starting with Version 6.1.0.21, if a task containing the
   AdminApp object install, installInteractive, edit,
   editInteractive, update, or updateInteractive command is
   deployed with the  MapEnvEntryForWebMod option containing the
   value description: null, the task fails with WASX7017E and
   WASX7111E exceptions. The description: null setting must be
   changed to description: * before the task is deployed. The 6.1
   Information Centers need to be updated to reflect this change.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Instead of providing a null for the description field in
   MapEnvEntryForWebMod task in batch mode, customer should replace
   the null with a wildcat match .* so that it could match
   anything.

   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere Application Server   *

   ****************************************************************
   Starting with Version 6.1.0.21, after you run the default
   bindings for the MapEnvEntryForWebMod option of the
   AdminApp object install, installInteractive, edit,
   editInteractive, update, or updateInteractive commands, you
   must change the description: null content to description: *
   before you deploy the task containing that command: If you
   leave the content as description: null, the task fails
   with WASX7017E and WASX7111E exceptions.  The V6.1 Information
   Center topic "Options for the AdminApp object install,
   installInteractive, edit, editInteractive, update, and
   updateInteractive commands" needs to be updated to document
   this requirement.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The V61. Information Centers topic "Options for the AdminApp
   object install, installInteractive, edit, editInteractive,
   update, and updateInteractive commands" will be updated to
   include the following "Avoid Trouble" note in the description
   of the MapEnvEntryForWebMod option:
   
   Avoid Trouble: If you are running on Version 6.1.0.21 or
   later, after running the default bindings, change the null
   value to * before you run this task. The * value is the wild
   card value that lets any description be a match. If you leave
   the value as null, WASX7017E and WASX7111E exceptions will
   occur when you run the task.
   
   Note: Periodically, we update the documentation in our

   latest on-line documentation, go to the product library page
   at http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and

   The modified documentation will be available in the February,
   2009 update to the Information Centers.
