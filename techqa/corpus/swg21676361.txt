rad; was TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 If the IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 Test Environment is installed onto IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD), RAD automatically creates a WAS 7.0 server runtime environment with an empty runtime name upon entering a new workspace 

SYMPTOM
RAD automatically added a WAS 7.0 server environment runtime with an empty name to your list of server environment runtimes.


CAUSE
Default server runtime environments names are not set properly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. When the Runtime environment and profile settings wizard appears for configuring the WAS 7.0 server, ensure Add WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 configuration to the workspace is unchecked. 
 2. Manually add the WAS 7.0 server runtime environment by navigating to Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments > Add.
