ABSTRACT
 Collecting troubleshooting data for installation problems with IBM WebSphere Portal 6.1 expedites time to resolution by enabling IBM Support to provide informed problem analysis. 

CONTENT
If you already contacted IBM Support and must collect data to determine the nature of a problem in WebSphere Portal, review the information below regarding data collection. Otherwise, review Collecting Data: Read first for WebSphere Portal [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21312740]. 

Collecting Installation specific information
Provide the following details about the problem: 

 * Version/bit information for the following: 
 * Operating System 
 * Installing to an existing WebSphere Application Server? If so, what version? 
 * Any other IBM products currently installed in the environment 
 * User information (Administrator, root, non-root) 
 * Number of installation attempts


Automated collection of troubleshooting data Automated log collection is available for this MustGather information and is the recommended method for improving accuracy of the data collection.

IBM Support Assistant Lite (ISA Lite) for WebSphere Portal
Download Tool [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&ca=portall2&uid=swg24008662] | View Demo of Log Collection [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/demo-isalite-fundamentals-version-1.3.3-for-ibm-websphere-portal] [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/isalite-fundamentals-version-1.3.3-for-ibm-websphere-portal]

After downloading IBM Support Assistant Lite, perform the following steps to collect the data and send to IBM Support: 

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to the <wp_profile_root>\PortalServer directory, which will create the subdirectory "ISALite" (e.g. c:\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\ISALite). 

2. Run the runISALite.bat file (Windows) or runISALite.sh (UNIX or Linux) from the ISALite directory (e.g. c:\WebSphere\wp_profile\PortalServer\ISALite\runISALite.bat). 

3. Once the tools starts, select the following Problem Type: WebSphere Portal-> Installation and Configuration ->Portal Install Problem. Answer all questions you are prompted for as accurately as possible. 

4. Provide the output path and a file name of "<PMR #>.isalite.zip" (e.g. 22222,111,000.isalite.zip). 

5. Click Collect Data and follow the series of dialog boxes to set the tracing and reproduce the issue. If you choose not to FTP the files to IBM via ISA Lite, then follow the instructions in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571]. />


Manual collection of troubleshooting data If you are unable to use IBM Support Assistant Lite (ISA Lite) for WebSphere Portal for automatic log collection, use the following instructions for manually collecting the necessary information. 

I. Collecting and submitting logs and configuration data manually 

1. Collect screenshots, userId, and timestamp information as appropriate. 

2. Collect all of the following log directories. Depending on where the installation failed, some of these directories may not exist yet: 

 * <PortalServer root>/log 
 * <AppServer root>/logs 
 * <wp_profile root>/logs



The table lists each file, describes the file content and recommends when to check the file for information that might assist in troubleshooting installation problems. 

Table 1. Installation log files that pertain to Windows and UNIX Log file name Description Problem symptoms wpinstalllog.txt Contains trace information that is generated by the installation program. Check this log if the WebSphere Portal installation stops before successful completion. installmessages.txt Contains messages that are generated during installation. The messages in this file are translated for the language that is specified during installation. Check this log for errors generated during installation. LocalizeTrace.*.log Contains archive installation or fixup messages.

Important: The LocalizeTrace.archive5.log file is the log most likely to contain detailed tracing information. Check this log for errors generated during the archive installation or fixup. restoreConfig.log Contains trace information of the preconfigured WebSphere Application Server profile that WebSphere Portal uses. Check this log for errors generated during the installation step when WebSphere Portal initializes the WebSphere Application Server 

Note: During a successful installation, the restoreConfig.log file may contain what looks like an error but is actually not an error. The following message is "normal" for WebSphere Portal and does NOT require a manual correction:

ADMU7006W: The cell name contained in the backup file is not the same as the current cell name of your configuration which is "cells\\<yourcellname>\\". Since you specified the "-force" option, the backup file will be restored but you will need to manually correct the resulting problems. wplaunchlog.txt Contains trace information about the WebSphere Portal installation program launch. Check this log for errors generated during the launch of the installation GUI. cmcfgdbu.log Contains trace information that is generated during the creation of the JCR tables in WebSphere Portal's database. Check this log if the creation of the JCR table fails. finalfixup.log Contains trace information of additional installation/fixup steps. [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21468568&amp;aid=1] log.txt Contains trace information generated during the installation of WebSphere Application Server.

Note: Located in AppServer_root [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Directory_structure_wp7]/logs directory for successful installs.

Note: Located in the temporary directory (%TEMP% on Windows or /tmp/ on UNIX) for unsuccessful installs. Check this log if you have problems with the installation of WebSphere Application Server. 
3. Save these files in an archive or zip file. Provide a file name of "<PMR #>.zip" (e.g. 22222,111,000.zip). Send the files to IBM Support by using the instructions outlined in Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=688&uid=swg21201571].
