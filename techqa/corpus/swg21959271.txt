QUESTION
 Does IIDR/CDC drop indexes on target tables before loading rows in refresh? 

ANSWER
The answer depends on the platform. By default, 

CDC for DB2/z and CDC for DB2/400 do not drop indexes prior to load.

CDC for DB2 UDB does not drop indexes, but can be configured by system parameter to optionally drop and re-create indexes when bulk loading.

CDC for Oracle will drop indexes prior to load and recreate them afterwards.

CDC for SQL Server and CDC for Sybase will drop indexes prior to load and recreate them afterwards when using bulk loader.
