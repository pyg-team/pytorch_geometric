APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A WebSphere MQ v7.1 or v7.5 multiple instance queue manager
   (QMgr) will not automatically start as a standby instance, after
   a system restart/reboot. This even though the qm.ini for the
   QMgr has:
   
   InstanceData:
   AutoPermitStandby=Yes
   
   When the system hosting the active instance is rebooted, the
   standby running on another system takes over as the active
   instance. This is as expected. However, once the system
   completes its restart, the QMgr instance does not
   automatically start-up as the standby.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Start the second instance of the QMgr manually, after reboot
   has completed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users implementing multi-instance queue managers on the
   Windows platform.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The required check for AutoPermitStandby on queue manager
   start up was omitted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The required check was added. The queue manager will now start
   as expected when AutoPermitStandby has been specified in the
   qm.ini file.
