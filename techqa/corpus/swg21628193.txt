SSL; Disposition Sweep Configure; JRE; path; CA certificate TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Configure an IBM ECM FileNet P8 (P8) environment to run under SSL. When saving the IBM Enterprise Records (IER) Disposition Sweep configuration, an error appears indicating that it cannot find the CA certificates located in the Java keystore on the IBM ECM FileNet Content Engine (CE). 

SYMPTOM
 

The following error appears in the command shell after clicking Apply in the IER Disposition Sweep Configuration Console:

2013-03-08 13:45:42,238, Got exception in BDP WSIProxyFactory getObjects : javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.h: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: PKIXCertPathBuilderImpl could not build a valid CertPath.; internal cause is:

CAUSE

Disposition Sweep is pointing to another version of java installed on the system that doesn't contain the CA certificates. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Point the Disposition Sweep to the correct java version installed on system, which does contain the CA Certificates. This is located in the Java keystore on the IBM ECM FileNet Content Engine (CE).
