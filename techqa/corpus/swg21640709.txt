CAUSE
LDAP properties entries configuration is missing an entry or has been configured incorrectly

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that all properties required for the LDAP connection are present in the configuration and have been correctly configured. Check for typing mistakes.

Note: The entry below is also required. This property is used only if the user_bind property is set to false but Sterling Integrator still checks for this property. 

authentication_1.password_attribute=userPassword
