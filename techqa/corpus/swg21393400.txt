QUESTION
 When archiving e-mail from Microsoft Exchange with IBM Content Collector for E-Mail, why do I see "ibm.ctms.lotusconnector" references in the log files and Windows Services? 

ANSWER
IBM Content Collector connectors communicate with the task-routing engine using named pipes. In this case, the named pipes for the e-mail connectors are called "ibm.ctms.lotusconnector". They are used for both Lotus Domino and Microsoft Exchange environments, so this behavior is normal.
