Title: IBM Loging into GlassBox web console results in "authentication failed due to Bad credentials" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempting to login to the GlassBox web console of IBM Security AppScan Standard fails with "authentication failed due to Bad credentials" error. 

SYMPTOM
GlassBox is correctly installed on the target application server, and it can connect to AppScan Standard without a problem. It allows the scan correctly. 
However, when a login is attempted using the http://<hostname>:<port>/GBootStrap/ URL, it goes back into the login screen. 

The glassbox log report the following: 

[64500@rldeva3] | 06/01/2015 13:13:11 | INFO : [GBootStrap] validateAuthentication - throwing exception 'Bad credentials'
[64500@rldeva3] | 06/01/2015 13:13:11 | DEBUG: [GBootStrap] AuthenticationFilter - authentication failed due to Bad credentials


CAUSE
Application Server uses the httpOnly flag with GlassBox agent on the session cookie (JESSIONID), however GlassBox web UI does not work correctly when the httpOnly flag is activated.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Glassbox API page is used only for debugging and troubleshooting, then you need to deactivate the 

HttpOnly flag for session management in your Application Server settings.
The change must be only temporary since it could expose the applications to security exposures.
Here is how to proceed for Websphere Application Server v8.x and higher: 
Application Servers > (Server Name) > Session management > click on "Enable cookies" and clear the checkbox for "Set session cookies to HTTPOnly to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks"
The same parameter can be changed in TomCat 7.x by editing CATALINA_BASE/conf/context.xml and set useHttpOnly="false".
