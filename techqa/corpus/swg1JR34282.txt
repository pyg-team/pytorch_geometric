ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Profile Manager for dmgr prompts "Oracle 10 or 11", but
   would be more accurate to change PMT to distinguish between the
   two.
   When one or more drivers are present, which driver should be
   used? If Oracle 11, should use ojdbc6.jar and if oracle 10
   should use ojdbc14.jar.  See:
   http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/ht
   docs/jdbc_112010.html [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_112010.html]
   
   Instead of having to change PMT with each oracle release run a
   test with the driver files found in the jdbc driver directory
   enterd by the user. Select the higest number to make test
   connections to the database and compare the results to match the
   driver. Enable the end user to add new driver names to a driver
   versions file in the event new file naming convention is used.
   Parse results from SQL> select * from v$version;
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  technote directs users to Oracle 10g jdbc driver
