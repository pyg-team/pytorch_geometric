APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running the ConfigEngine wp-add-la-property task, the task
   may fail for various errors and does not add the new property to
   the Properties Extension database
   
   However, when you correct the errors and run the task again, it
   will fail with this new error:
   
   [wplc-add-property]
   com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.SchemaAlreadyExistException:
   CWWIM0511E The 'teamname' property type is already defined for
   the 'PersonAccount' entity type.

   com.ibm.websphere.wim.ejb.WIMServiceBean.createSchema(WIMService
   Bean.java:119)
   
   Cause: The wp-add-la-property task incorrectly adds the new
   property to wimextensions.xml located in
   <wp_profile_root>/config/cells/<cellname>/wim/model even though
   the task failed.
   
   
   This issue is resolved in fixpack v6101 but customers who cannot
   upgrade need a separate APAR for v6.1.0
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Remove the failing property entry from
   wimextensions.xml and restart server1 and WebSphere_Portal
   servers before rerunning wp-add-la-property task.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When running the ConfigEngine wp-add-la-property task, the task
   may fail for various errors and does not add the new property to
   the Properties Extension database
   
   However, when you correct the errors and run the task again, it
   will fail with this new error:
   Cause: The wp-add-la-property task incorrectly adds the new
   property to wimextensions.xml located in
