Title: IBM Content Engine Searches do not utilize Oracle Database Indexes - United States

Text:
nls_sort; oracle; search TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Content Engine (CE) searches performed using CE API or Workplace do not use the Oracle DB index, causing the queries to be performed using full table scans. 

SYMPTOM
CE searches do not return in a timely fashion


CAUSE
The Oracle parameter NLS_SORT is set to "BINARY_CI''. Note that this parameter could be set manually for the database via SQL updates or through an application server's "Test SQL" setting. 

For other possible causes, check the P8 Performance Tuning Guide as well as the technote:
"Indexing for IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine Searches":

ENVIRONMENT
Oracle only.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Check if Oracle parameter NLS_SORT is set to "BINARY_CI" 

2. Go through P8 Performance Tuning Guide and the Indexing for CE Searches technote mentioned above, and perform diagnosis for database-related performance issues.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restore the Oracle parameter NLS_SORT to the default value of BINARY. If case-insensitive searching is required, please follow the instructions in P8 Performance Tuning Guide and the P8 InfoCenter for enabling "Force Case Insensitive Searches".
