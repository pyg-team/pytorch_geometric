APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  According to the documentation:
   com.collation.AllowPrivateGateways=true
       The default value is true.
   
   This property specifies whether a Windows computer system
   can be discovered using SSH or IBM Tivoli Monitoring
   connections without requiring an intermediate gateway.
   
   The default is to allow SSH or IBM Tivoli
   Tivoli Monitoring connections to Windows systems. If the value
   is set to false, only gateway-based discovery can be used.
   
   
   The last sentence; "If the value is set to false,
   only gateway-based discovery can be used" is not clear as this
   implies only gateway based discovery is done. What 'false' means
   is TADDM will only discover Windows targets that are configured
   as gateways. If the target is not in the gateway list, then
   discovery will fail with "CTJTP1100E A private gateway session
   is not allowed to a target host system that is not configured as
   a gateway"
   
   
   Suggest changing this sentence in the documentation to;
   
   If this property is false then Windows targets will only be
   discovered if they are listed in the TADDM gateway list. If they
   are not in the gateway list, the Windows Session sensor will
   fail with a CTJTP1100E error.
