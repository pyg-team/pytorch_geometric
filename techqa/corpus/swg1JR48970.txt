APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  System monitoring for the IBM WebSphere Application Server
   shared service does not work well to monitor the WebSphere
   Application Server instances that run on deployed instances of
   the IBM BPM V8.0.1.0 Advanced Pattern because it can not
   detect the correct location where WebSphere Application Server
   is installed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Option 1:
   ---------
   1) install newer plugin.com.ibm.itcamwas into rack.
       - Do this by going to "Workload Console->Cloud->System
   Plug-ins" panel.
       - Click the "+" button to import the new plugin. This will
   result in a "Import plug-in" dialog where you can browse to the
   "itcamwas-1.0.1.0.tgz" plugin that was provided in another
   email.
       - NOTE: The "Adding, modifying, and deleting system
   plug-ins" section of the PureAS InfoCenter provides additional
   information related to this type of activity.
   
   2) upload the EnableITMForBPM.zip script package and add it
   into BPM pattern
       - Go to "Workload Console->Catalog->Script Packages"
       - Click the "+" button and enter "EnableITMForBPM" for the
   "Script name" and click OK
       - In the resulting EnableITMForBPM panel, click the
   "Browse" link in the "Script package file" field and select the
   location where the EnableITMForBPM.zip file is located (this is
   script I sent you). Click Open and then click the "Upload"
   button on the panel. Everything else in this panel should be
   okay and not need changing.
       - Go to "Workload Console->Patterns->Virtual System
   Patterns" and click on the BPM vSys pattern and then click the
   Edit button.
       - On the right part of the panel under "Panel Editor",
   expand the "Scripts" section.
       - Scroll down to the EnableITMForBPM script and add it to
   the "Process Center deployment manager" and the "Process Center
   custom nodes" VMs. Please let me know if these nodes are not
   seen in your BPM vSys pattern.
   
   3) deploy a new BPM vSys to pick up changes from 1) and 2),
   which will be using ITCAMWAS monitoring;
   
   
   
   Option 2: manually fixing the already deployed BPM VM:
   -----------------------------------------------------
   NOTE: after discussing this option more with my development
   team, I wanted to note that we do not encourage updating
   plug-ins for deployed/running VMs. This would be required in
   order to get this Option 2 to work. This scenario has not been
   adequately tested and verified and we suggest that this option
   not be used at this time. I do have some detailed steps and
   another script that can be used to attempt this, but due to the
   un-guaranteed nature of this option, I will wait and send this
   to you after you have time to consider this and let me know if
   you still wanted to proceed with this. Unless you really need
   to get the current deployed BPM instances working with the ITM
   monitoring, I would suggest that you leave them as they are and
   possibly redeploy new instancess instead after Option 1 is
   complete.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM BPM V8.0.1.0 Advanced Pattern           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The WebSphere Application Server        *
   *                      agent that runs on the IBM BPM          *
   *                      virtual machine is not detecting the    *
   *                      correct location &#130; &#160;where WebSphere
   *                      Application Server is installed.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Several parameters that system monitoring needs for the
   WebSphere Application Server shared &#130; &#160;service during
   configuration are not provided by IBM BPM &#130; &#160;V8.0.1.0 Advanced
   Pattern.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An emergency fix is available that contains one script package
   that must be attached to the Process Center custom node or the
   Process Server custom node of the IBM BPM system pattern.
   After deployment is successful, system monitoring for the
   WebSphere Application Server shared &#130; &#160;service can monitor the
   custom nodes of the instance.
