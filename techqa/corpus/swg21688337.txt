 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in IBM DB2® shipped with IBM PureData™ System for Transactions. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE ID: CVE-2014-6209 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6209]


DESCRIPTION:
IBM DB2 contains a denial of service vulnerability. A remote, authenticated DB2 user could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specially-crafted ALTER TABLE statement on an identity column . This may cause DB2 server to terminate abnormally. To exploit the vulnerability, the malicious user needs to have valid security credentials to connect to DB2 and the authorization associated with the authorization ID of the connection would need to match one of the authorization scenarios listed below. Note that these authorities or privileges could be obtained by membership in a group or by assignment of certain role. 

1) CONTROL or ALTER privilege on a table
The user would need either CONTROL or ALTER privilege on a table to execute the ALTER TABLE statement. Customer could consult the SYSCAT.TABAUTH table to determine the users, roles, and groups that have CONTROL privilege or ALTER privilege on a table. Furthermore, the owner of a table has implicit control privilege and the DBADM authority has implicit control privilege on all tables. Customer could look up owner of a table from the SYSCAT.TABLES table.

2) ALTERIN privilege on any schema that contains a table
User with this privilege could execute ALTER TABLE statement on any table in the schema. Customer could consult the SYSCAT.SCHEMAAUTH table to check for users, roles, and groups with this privilege. Also, customer could check the SYSCAT.TABLES for existence of tables in the schema.

3) CREATETAB authority on a database and USAGE privilege on at least one table space
With this authority, the user could create a table and then execute ALTER TABLE statement on that table. Customer could lookup the SYSCAT.DBAUTH table to find out users, roles, and groups with CREATETAB authority and check the SYSCAT.TBSPACEAUTH table for users, roles, and groups with USAGE privileges on table spaces.

CVE ID: CVE-2014-6210 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6210]


DESCRIPTION:
IBM DB2 contains a denial of service vulnerability. A remote, authenticated DB2 user could exploit this vulnerability by issuing multiple ALTER TABLE statements on the same column. This may cause DB2 server to terminate abnormally. To exploit the vulnerability, the malicious user needs to have valid security credentials to connect to DB2 and the authorization associated with the authorization ID of the connection would need to match one of the authorization scenarios listed below. Note that these authorities or privileges could be obtained by membership in a group or by assignment of certain role. 

1) CONTROL or ALTER privilege on a table
The user would need either CONTROL or ALTER privilege on a table to execute the ALTER TABLE statement. Customer could consult the SYSCAT.TABAUTH table to determine the users, roles, and groups that have CONTROL privilege or ALTER privilege on a table. Furthermore, the owner of a table has implicit control privilege and the DBADM authority has implicit control privilege on all tables. Customer could look up owner of a table from the SYSCAT.TABLES table.

2) ALTERIN privilege on any schema that contains a table
User with this privilege could execute ALTER TABLE statement on any table in the schema. Customer could consult the SYSCAT.SCHEMAAUTH table to check for users, roles, and groups with this privilege. Also, customer could check the SYSCAT.TABLES for existence of tables in the schema.

3) CREATETAB authority on a database and USAGE privilege on at least one table space
With this authority, the user could create a table and then execute ALTER TABLE statement on that table. Customer could lookup the SYSCAT.DBAUTH table to find out users, roles, and groups with CREATETAB authority and check the SYSCAT.TBSPACEAUTH table for users, roles, and groups with USAGE privileges on table spaces.

CVE ID: CVE-2014-8901 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-8901]


DESCRIPTION: 

IBM DB2 contains a disruption of service vulnerability. A remote, authenticated user can issue a specially crafted XML query to cause DB2 to increase CPU usage and create serious performance degradation to the system.
