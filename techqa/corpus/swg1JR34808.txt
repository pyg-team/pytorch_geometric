ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With Internet Explorer Version 6 as the browser, if you
   configure the KPI widget and the checkbox to enable events on
   the Wiring tab was checked prior to configuring, saving the
   configuration will result in the checkbox being unchecked.
   Subsequently, no data will be sent from the KPI widget to the
   widget to which it is wired.
   
   This does not occur with Internet Explorer Version 7, or
   with Firefox.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Each time you configure the KPI widget, ensure that the
   checkbox to enable events on the Wiring tab is checked, if
   desired, before saving the configuration changes.
