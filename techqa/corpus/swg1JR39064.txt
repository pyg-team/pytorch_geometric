ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Title: ODBC Connector gives error "Invalid string or buffer
   length" while connecting to SQL Anywhere drivers
   
   Description:
   Cannot connect to SQL Anywhere database using ODBC Connector
   because of error "ODBC Function "SQLBindCol(2)" reported
   SQLSTATE = HY090: Native Error Code = 0: Msg = [Sybase][ODBC
   Driver]Invalid string or buffer length"
   In the ODBC trace file ODBC Connector is sending ODD buffer
   value to SQLBindCol.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When ODBC Connector connects to SQL Anywhere database following
   error message appears "ODBC Function "SQLBindCol(2)" reported
   SQLSTATE = HY090: Native Error Code = 0: Msg = [Sybase][ODBC
   Driver]Invalid string or buffer length".
   
   This happens because ODBC Connector sends ODD integer value for
   SQLBindCol buffer length parameter.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Now sending only Even value for buffer length.
