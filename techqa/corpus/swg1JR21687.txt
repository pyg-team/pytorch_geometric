APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem 1:
   Do not select import utility for Q subscriptions of type
   bidirectional or peer-to-peer. The reason is that for import
   when it does delete of the target table, it logs the deletes,
   and capture would recapture it. There is no mechanism to signal
   capture that this is utility. Also for peer-to-peer unnecessary
   triggers will get fired.
   
   Problem 2:
   Replication Center: Correct a problem in the Create Q
   Subscriptions wizard that caused invalid column mapping data to
   be displayed when the target (table) of a Q Subscription is
   changed.
   
   Problem 3:
   Replication Center: Correct a problem in the Create Q
   Subscriptions wizard that caused incorrect SQL scripts to be
   generated when Q Subscription object were removed from the
   Review Q Subscription page.
   
   Problem 4:
   Replication Center: Correct a problem in the Create Q
   Subscriptions wizard where attempting to use an invalid stored
   procedure as a target caused an incorrect wizard page to
   display.
   
   Problem 5:
   Replication Center: Correct a problem that caused incorrect Load
   and Target Object Profile information to be displayed in
   multi-node peer-to-peer configurations with mixed platform
   nodes.
   
   Problem 6:
   Q Replication: Delete Q subscription in a bidirectional or
   peer-to-peer configuration fails if one or more of the table
   replicas does not exist. Table replica refers to a physical user
   table on a node in the bidirectional or peer-to-peer
   configuration and the user table is referenced either as the
   source table or target table of the Q subscription to be
   deleted.
   When this problem happens, error message ASN2102E (The database
   object "<object_name>" of type "<object_type>" does not exist at
   the server "<server_alias>") will be issued and no SQL script
   will be generated.
   Possible work around: Before the fix to this problem is
   available, the problem can be circumvented by recreating the
   table replica expected by the replication administration tool.
   The newly created table needs to have table structure (for
   example, same number of columns, column names, unique
   constraints, etc.) as the original table replica.
   
   Problem 7:
   Cannot create a Q Subscription that uses a stored procedure to
   write to a federated target.
   
   Problem 8:
   Replication Center: Repair the select nicknames portion of the
   Load page in the Create Q Subscriptions wizard so that it
   returns the correct list of nicknames when the source and target
   tables do not have the same name.
   
   Problem 9:
   Replication Center : The column mapping page shows an incorrect
   column mapping when the source table has identity columns and
   the target table is created as new.
   Possible work around: Create target table manually and use this
   table as target when creating the Q Subscription.
   
   Problem 10:
   Replication Center and asnclp: Q subscription cannot be
   generated because column constraint name is too long (although
   it is not so for DB2).
   Possible work around: Create target table manually and use this
   table as target when creating the Q Subscription.
   
   Problem 11:
   Creation of the Q Subscriptions failed because of the dublicate
   index name is used.
