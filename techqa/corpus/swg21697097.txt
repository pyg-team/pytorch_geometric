PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Follwoing the modification of the file LotusConnections-config.xml in IBM Business Intelligence Connections. In order to Integrate Cognos Workspace with IBM Connections, users are not able to log in to IBM Connections.

Reverting all the changes for Cognos in the file resolves the problem. Hence confirmed problem caused by Cognos settings. 

SYMPTOM
WebSphere Application Server log Systemout.log on which IBM Connections is deployed shows the following error:

CAUSE
Cognos Documentation below missing detailed information on parameter profiles_directory_service_extension_enabled:

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos BI 10.2.1 and IBM Connections 4.5



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

For the parameter profiles_directory_service_extension_enabled in the LotusConnections-config.xml file, set the following values depending on how IBM Connections is set up:

1. Confirm which User directory in IBM Connections is being used. LDAP directory or Profiles directory.
2. If using Profiles as directory, this setting needs to be set to "true". 
If using LDAP as directory, this setting needs to be set to "false"
3. Resynchronize all nodes and restart the IBM Connections servers.

You should now be able to log in to IBM Connections and the integration between Cognos Workspace and IBM Connections works too.
