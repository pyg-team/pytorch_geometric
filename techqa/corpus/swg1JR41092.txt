APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "Hide Unpopulated Hierarchy Nodes" giving faulty results in
   Single Edit "Categories" tab.
   
   The same feature in the left navigation pane with the same
   hierarchy is giving a different result.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Create a simple catalog with associated hierarchy. Add some
   categories (at least 2 or 3 levels deep) and some items to some
   of the categories. Ensure that at least one of the populated
   nodes at level 2 or 3 has a top level node that is unpopulated.
   
   2. Click on an item in left pane to load it.
   
   3. Switch tab to "Categories".
   
   4. By default "Hide Unpopulated Hierarchy Nodes" checkbox is not
   checked. Observe that all categories in the tree are displayed.
   
   5. Check the "Hide Unpopulated Hierarchy Nodes" checkbox. Note
   that populated categories at level 2 or lower are hidden (even
   though they should not be) as long as the level 1 parent is
   unpopulated. Any populated node should be visible along with all
   ancestor nodes.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use left navigation pane instead of the Categories tab to see
   only the populated nodes (after checking "Hide Unpopulated
   Hierarchy Nodes".
