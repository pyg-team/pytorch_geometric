ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This question/issue is really in any application but my example
   is in
   the Work Order Tracking (Cal) application.  We have just
   upgraded to
   Maximo 7.1.1.6.  I have a user that is using a Saved Query to
   pull up
   records on the Work Order Tracking (Cal) List tab.  After the
   list
   appears he is typing a Work Order Number into the Find field at
   the top
   of the screen.  In this particular case the work order number he
   is
   typing in is included in the Result Set on the List tab but he
   gets a
   message that there are no records found.  When I do the exact
   same
   steps I get varied results.  Sometimes I get the message and
   sometimes
   I get the work order to come up.  What is the expected result?
   What
   could be causing his message?  Please see the attached screen
   shots.

   USING THE FIND FIELD/SAVED QUERY IN ANY APP NOT WORKING
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS IS NOT A BUG.  When you use Find on top of the screen to
   find a record, it searches the whole table, not within the
   context of the last executed query.  It has nothing to do with
   the last saved query run, or the default query.  For example,
   if I type in 1000 to search for work order using the Find
   button, the where clause is as simple as (wonum='1000')
   
   
   
   
   
   In the customer's case, this query is for typing in PB106198 in
   the Find box:

   08:19:51:773  INFO  BMXAA6719I - USER = (27366) SPID = (Cannot
   get spid.) app (PLUSCWT) object (WORKORDER) : select * from
   workorder  where ((status = 'WAPPR' and upper(wolo2) =
   'RC04-TEAM07A' and woclass = 'WORKORDER' and istask = 0 and
   siteid = 'PB')) and ((wonum = 'PB106198'))
   
   
   
   
   
   Where do all the rest of the where clause come from?  It might
   be from Industry solution, or the customized code from the
   customer.  But it's not from base service.
