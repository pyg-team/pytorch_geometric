Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User performs a database optimise. After a few minutes, user receives an error. 

SYMPTOM
Error occurred when deleting temporary VFP files: ODBC Error (2)


CAUSE
There are other potential causes of this (or similar) errors. 

 * TIP: See separate IBM Technote #1365329 for more examples.


This Technote specifically relates to the scenario where the small 32-bit portion of the Controller server (the FoxPro components) cannot locate a 32-bit Oracle database client. 
ENVIRONMENT
Both of the following are true: 

 * Customer using 64-bit version of Controller server software (i.e. Controller 10.2 or later) 
 * Controller application server only has 64-bit version of Oracle client installed on Controller application server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install 32-bit version of the same Oracle client on the Controller application server. 

 

Steps: 

Assuming that the customer has installed the Oracle 11G rel2 64-bit client already, then now install the Oracle 11G rel2 32-bit client. 

 * TIP: For full details of how to do this, see separate IBM Technote #1656559.
