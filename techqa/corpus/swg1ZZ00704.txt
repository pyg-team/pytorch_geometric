APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ICO with BYOOS installation fail pre-checker indicating the
   problem with the default domain. ICO installation is hard-coded
   for "Default" domain and our DOC pages instruct users to
   prepare various openstack settings based on Default domain,
   however, we do not explicitly mention that this domain must be
   setup in advance.
   Some Openstack's may not define a Default domain.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Create "Default" domain prior to ICO install.
