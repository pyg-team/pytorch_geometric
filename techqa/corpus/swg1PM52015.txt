ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A a webservice request comes in over HTTP basic authentication
   and the user password is expired,  CICS creates the message
    DFHXS1202 and the pipeline process  continues and ignores the
    RACF return code from the  expired password.
   Subsequently, the alias transaction runs under the default
   transaction CWBA even though a matching URIMAP was found that
   supplies a different transaction as the alias transaction.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Web Service request using HTTP basic    *
   *                      authentication is allowed to run in     *
   *                      CICS even though the supplied password  *
   *                      is expired.                             *

   ****************************************************************
   A Web Service request is sent to CICS, which matches with a
   URIMAP with USAGE(PIPELINE).  The TCPIPSERVICE definition
   specified Authenticate: Basic and an HTTP Authorization header
   may be included in the request.  When CICS receives the request
   the userid and password in the Authorization header are
   extracted and verified.  The password is found to be expired.
   This causes CWXN to set the required alias transaction to CWBA
   and the converter program to DFHWBPW.  This is done to start an
   HTML dialogue to change the password which is inappropriate
   for SOAP pipeline requests.
   
   CWBA now runs under the specified userid.  However, code in
   DFHWBXM changes the initial program from DFHWBA (CICS Web Alias
   program) to DFHPIDSH (CICS HTTP pipeline dispatcher).  This
   causes the web service request to run normally and the response
   sent back to the client.
   
   If the password had expired then the Web Service request should
   not be allowed to run.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHWBSR has been changed to reject with an HTTP 401 error
   response SOAP pipeline requests that have expired passwords.
