ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SKETCHER - WHEN OPENING PART FROM V5R4 IN V5R6 , UPDATE
   REQUESTED GENERATES ERRORS ON SKETCHS CONSTRAINTS.
   
   sCENARIO.
   1 - open shassis.Catpart in V5R6
    => part is red displayed, an update is needed
   2 - click update button
    => update error is displayed on sketch.
   
   On most of them I had to recreate coincidence constrainst. On
   sketch
   where error on a face was detected I have edited the face and I
   have
   reselected the face.
   On sketch 340 and 341, I have deleted your sketch and I used
   elongated
   hole to create the same hole.
   I have performed these modifications on V5R6 BSF but I think
   that a
   user can correct this part. I have just edited each update
   error,
   deleted and recreated the coincidence constraints or reselected
   the
   faces.
   I do not know which modifications have been performed on the
   part
   before the update so I do not known if it is a user operation
   error. On
   sketchs 340 and 341, the sketch done was not optimized.
   The size of the part decreases because the useless historical
   designs
   are now deleted and not saved as in older versions.
   Only new and unmodified design is saved. Old version of a sketch
   is now
   deleted from saving operation. There is no impact of this on the
   use of
   the part.
   I hope you will find here answers requested.
   Thanks for your cooperation.

   UPDT : I informed above to SS Ishizuki.
       He requests us to keep open this for a while, since he
   verifies
       your reply.
   DISP : Wait for his feedback.                          ukkey0717

   UPDT : Hello Cyrille,
   Thank you so much for your support.
   He verified your reply and had a few questions.
   This problem was not occurred on V5R4, but this problem
   was occurred on V5R6.
   He would like to know the cause of update error.
   Since the specification on V5R6 was change, was the update
   error occurred ?
   In other word, since V5R6 looks into the model in
   more detail than V5R4, was the update error occurred ?
   Or was the update error occurred by a showstopper on V5R4 ?
   He desperately wants to get detail information.
   The reason is as following;
   Since the customer has many sheetmetal models which were created
   on
   V5R4, he thinks that the same problem will happen to other
   models.
   If the problem may be occurred on the other models, he has to
   create
   a guide to the customer.
   .
     Thank you very much and best regards,   UKKEY   ukkey0718
   
   Update From LE LANN Cyrille                       ==>
   $$RSPMNT=CEJ$$ <=
   Hello Level1,
   As you have requested on 01/07/03, the PMR request was only to
   correct
   this model and the customer thinks that it is a model specific
   issue.
   So I have corrected this part by removing and recreating the
   constraints on sketch shown in the update error window.
   Now you request from me a methodology to provide to customer in
   order
   ti create a guide. It seems to be model specific so the only
   methodology is to edit each sketch shown in update error and to
   edit
   each error shown in the window. I think that user, as I did ,
   just have
   to check each error that can be edited and have firstly to
   recreate all
   coindcidence constraints or other if needed.
   Thanks for your cooperation.

   Hello
     Thank you for your update.
     Now, SE.Ishizuki san found that there are so many models which
     have same problem.
     (Problem means :  no problem occurred on V5R4,
                       and UPDATE error occurs on V5R6.)
   .
   So, here we would like to know what is the real cause of this
   error.
   Is there any possibility that 'some checking mechanism becomes
   severe'??
   You told that following elements are invalid,
        .........More than  sketch 291. There was update error on
   sketch
        291,292,293,294,295, 340 and 341.
         On most of them I had to recreate coincidence constrainst.
   .......
   .
   Why these elements cause no error by V5R4 but cause error by
   V5R6??
   Thanks and regards     Yoko Yuharagi
   
   Update From LE LANN Cyrille                       ==>
   $$RSPMNT=CEJ$$ <=
   Hello Level1,
   Some improvement have been done in sketcher between V5R4 and
   V5R6
   levels.
   The way to have this bad behaviour explained is to have part
   analyzed
   by dev tem through an APAR.
   Do you agree with an APAR opening on this issue ?
   Thanks for your cooperation.
   Best Regards, Cyrille LE LANN.
   
   Hello
     Thank you for your update.
     Please submit an APAR for this problem.
   Customer has a plan to release up all systems to V5R6 in this
   month,
   so they need the solution of this problem in this month.
   Would you please answer of this problem by 07/26??
   Thanks and regards    Yoko Yuharagi
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *   INCIDENT DIAGNOSIS:
   Problem with projections inside a sketch if projections were
   created prior to V5R6 and updated for the first time on V5R6
   or higher level.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM IS PERMANENT RESTRICTION IN CATIA
   
    TECHNICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE RESTRICTION:
   The problem comes from the fact that projection operator was not
   versionned prior to V5R6GA.
   Inside sketch, projections or constraints based on a projection
   can be reversed during first update on V5R6 or higher level.
   
   The problem was corrected with versionning on R6 and higher.
   
    BY-PASS / METHODOLOGY :
   It is needed to regenerate projections or constraints as follow:
   
   1- In case of constraints based on 3D geometry :
     a- Before updating CATPart, unfold sketch in the tree.
     b- Deactivate all constraints
     c- Edit sketch
     d- Delete previously deactivated constraints.
     e- Recreate constraints.
   
   2- In case of projections :
     a- Before updating CATPart, unfold sketch in the tree.
     b- Isolate projections
     c- Create new projections
     d- Create constraints between new projections and
        previously isolated geometry.
