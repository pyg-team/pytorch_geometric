Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The customer has installed the Statistics 23 successfully, when you run the License Authorization Wizard, there is a small blank window to enter the authorization code. The window is so small that the authorization code cannot be entered at all. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a workaround, please activate the license by these commands: 

On Windows, open a Command Prompt window as an administrator.
Navigate to the installation path of Statistics Client 23 (default paths below for 64 and 32-bit installs):

cd C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\23

* NOTE: Please just edit the version number instead of '23', depending if you installed Statistics Client version 19/20/21/22. *

Then, press 'Enter' key.

Use the 'licenseactivator' command to enter your authorization code:

licenseactivator <authcode>


NOTE: where <authcode> is your authorization code
