 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 You see the following record added to the WebSphere MQ event messages queue 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT'.

[timestamp] Unknown Object Name [2085]
Event Type: Queue Manager 
Queue Manager Name: QMGR
Appl Type: Unix 
Appl Name: amqpcsea 
Queue Name: SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE 

CAUSE
a) The queue SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE is used by the MQ Telemetry 
component. A typical scenario for its usage is this: 
The MQ command server, amqpcsea, reads PCF messages from the 
SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE and if the PCF message is related to 
Telemetry, then the PCF message is forwarded to the 
SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE for the MQ Telemetry component to handle.
.
b) This queue is used by certain monitoring products such as Nastel and InfraRed360



ANSWER
Some ways to handle this situation: 


a) You can create the queue by using the following command:
. 
runmqsc QMGR 
DEFINE QLOCAL(SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE) 
END 

b) If you do not want to create the above queue, then you will need to disable the monitoring from the products mentioned in the "Cause" section.
