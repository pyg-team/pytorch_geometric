ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM MobileFirst Application Center 6.0 - 7.1 works with iOS9
   under the following conditions:
   
   * Apache Tomcat Server:
   The server runs with IBM Java 6, IBM Java 7, IBM Java 8, Oracle
   Java 7.
   TLS 1.2 is enabled, among other protocols. In practice, to
   support older devices or non-iOS devices, TLS 1 and TLS 1.1
   should also be enabled.
   Oracle Java 6 is not supported in combination with iOS 9 since
   it does not support TLS 1.2.
   Oracle Java 8 can only be supported with a modified Weak
   DH/LogJam vulnerability fix. Details, see at the end.
   
   * Websphere Liberty Profile Server
   The server runs with IBM Java 6, IBM Java 7, IBM Java 8, Oracle
   Java 7 and Oracle Java 8.
   TLS 1.2 is enabled, among other protocols. In practice, to
   support older devices or non-iOS devices, TLS 1 and TLS 1.1
   should also be enabled.
   If no firewall or IHS is used, then Oracle Java is preferred
   because Android 5 devices work better with Oracle Java. iOS 9
   can communicate with both IBM Java and Oracle Java.
   
   * Websphere Full Profile Server
   The server runs with IBM Java included in  Websphere.
   TLS 1.2 is enabled, among other protocols. In practice, to
   support older devices or non-iOS devices, TLS 1 and TLS 1.1
   should also be enabled.
   
   The Application Center client needs no modification for iOS9.
   The Application Center war files installed in the server need no
   modification for iOS9.
   
   On iOS9 phones, the Application Center installers.html page may
   open in rare cases in the browser in tablet mode which is
   unsuitable for the phone screen dimension. This effect typically
   occurs only when using the refresh button of the browser
   extensively. As workaround, turn the phone in landscape
   orientation, or use the fallback page inst.html, as mentioned in
   the documentation.
   
   
   
   An additional note to Apache Tomcat and the Weak DH/LogJam
   vulterability fix:
   Oracle Java 8 is incompatible with the Weak DH/LogJam fix
   currently published at https://weakdh.org. We recommend the
   following modification, concerning the connector element in
   Tomcat's server.xml. It needs to include a specific cipher list.
   
   <Connector ... SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
   sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
   ciphers="TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WIT

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In general, IBM Application Center works on iOS 9 devices
   without changes, however the server must have the SSL protocol
   TLS v1.2 enabled.
   The use of Oracle Java 6 is discouraged in combination with TLS
   v1.2 since it is not properly supported by Oracle Java 6.
   After reconfiguring the web server correspondingly, no further
   changes are needed, neither in the Application Center war files
   nor in the Application Center client. They work as is.
