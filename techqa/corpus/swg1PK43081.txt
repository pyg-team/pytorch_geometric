APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Information Center for WebSphere Application Server
   Version 6.0.x and 6.1 needs to included information about
   an enhanced Enterprise Archive (EAR) file. When you export
   an application from the Administrative Console, it exports
   the application as an enhanced EAR file with all of the
   current configuration for the application.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: This APAR affects users who install an       *
   *                 application, export it, and then reinstall   *
   *                 the application in a different cell.         *
   *                 Affected users are probably reading the      *

   *                 in the Information Centers for WebSphere     *
   *                 Application Server Version 6.x.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: If you install an application, export   *
   *                      it, and then reinstall the application  *
   *                      on a different cell, the application    *
   *                      installation path contains the cell     *
   *                      name of the original cell. Thus, if     *
   *                      you install an application in CellA,    *
   *                      export it, and then reinstall the       *
   *                      application in CellB, the application   *
   *                      installed on CellB contains "CellA" in  *
   *                      the application installation path.      *

   ****************************************************************
   The documentation on exporting applications and the
   application installation wizard help in the Version 6.x
   Information Centers needs to provide the following information:
   Unless you specify the $(CELL) variable, the exported
   application is reinstalled to a directory path that has the
   name of the cell from the original application installation.
   When you first install an application, you can specify this
   variable in the Directory to install application field on the
   Select installation options panel within the application
   installation wizard. You also can specify this variable using
   the Update operation when you reinstall an exported application.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Two files have been changed.
   
   Within the following "Exporting J2EE applications" topic, the
   following information has been added:
   
   About this task
   Exporting applications enables you to back up your applications
   and preserve binding information for the applications. You
   might export your applications before updating installed
   applications or migrating to a later version of the product.
   
   To export applications, use the Export button on the
   Enterprise Applications page. Using Export produces an
   enhanced Enterprise Archive (EAR) file that contains the
   application as well as the deployment configuration. The
   deployment configuration consists of the deployment.xml and
   other configuration files that control the application
   behavior on a deployment target.
   ...
   
   What to do next
   You can edit your exported enhanced EAR file and then
   reinstall it. By default, installation expands an EAR file
   in the app_server_root/profiles/installedApps/cell_name
   directory. If you specified the $(CELL) variable for
   Directory to install application on the Select installation
   options panel of the application installation wizard when
   you first installed the application, the cell_name directory
   is the current cell name.
   
   To reinstall the enhanced EAR file, do either of the
   following:
   
   -Use the Update operation available from the Enterprise
    Applications page to upgrade the existing application
    installation.
   
    The Update operation adds the application files to the
    app_server_root/profiles/installedApps/cell_name directory,
    where the cell_name is the current cell name or the name of
    the cell that you specified for Directory to install
    application when you first installed the application on a
    deployment target. The Directory to install application
    setting is on the Select installation options panel of the
    application installation wizard. If you specified the
    $(CELL) variable for Directory to install application when
    you first installed the application, the cell_name directory
    is the current cell name.
   
   -Use the Install New Application operation to install the
    exported EAR file.
   
    If you specified the $(CELL) variable for Directory to
    install application when you first installed the application,
    the cell_name directory is the current cell name. That is,
    if the file is originally installed on Cell1 with $(CELL)
    variable in the destination directory and you reinstall the
    enhanced EAR file on Cell2, the cell_name directory is Cell2,
    the current cell name.
   
    If the $(CELL) variable was not specified for the first
    installation, using Install New Application to reinstall an
    enhanced EAR file installs the application in the cell_name
    directory of the exported application. That is, if the
    application is originally installed on and exported from
    Cell1 and you reinstall the enhanced EAR file on Cell2, the
    cell_name directory is Cell1. The enhanced EAR file expands
    in the Cell1 directory even though the current cell name is
    Cell2. By default, the application destination directory
    contains Cell1 in its path because the deployment.xml file
    in the exported application has Cell1 in it.
   
    If you exported the application from Cell1 and did not
    specify the $(CELL) variable when first installing the
    application, and you want to install the enhanced EAR file
    on a different cell, deselect Process embedded configuration
    on the Select installation options panel of the application
    installation wizard to expand the enhanced EAR file in the
    current cell name directory, which is not Cell1.
   
   Within the "Select installation options settings" topic, the
   following paragraph has been added to the Directory to install
   application description:
   
   If you intend to export the application from one cell and
   later install the exported application on a different cell,
   specify the $(CELL) variable for the initial installation
   of the application. For example, specify
   ${APP_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CELL) for this setting. Exporting the
   application creates an enhanced EAR file that has the
   application and its deployment configuration. The deployment
   configuration retains the cell name of the initial
   installation in the destination directory unless you specify
   the $(CELL) variable. Specifying the $(CELL) variable ensures
   that the destination directory has the current cell name, and
   not the original cell name.
   
   Date that information will be available externally to
   customers:
   The modified documentation will be available in the next
   update
   to the Information Centers, which is scheduled to occur on or
   before June 30, 2007.
