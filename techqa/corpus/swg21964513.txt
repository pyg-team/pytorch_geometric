QUESTION
 I am unable to login through Deployment Manager client to my C&DS server deployed in WebSphere when I am using SSL. Whenever I try I receive the following error:



javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: com.ibm.jsse2.util.j: PKIX path building failed: java.security.cert.CertPathBuilderException: PKIXCertPathBuilderImpl could not build a valid CertPath.; internal cause is: 

java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: The certificate issued by CN=SOME-DOMAIN-NAME.com, OU=Root Certificate, OU=SOME-DOMAIN-NAMECell01, OU=SOME-DOMAIN-NAMECellManager01, O=IBM, C=US is not trusted; internal cause is: 

java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Certificate chaining error



I have followed the instructions in the C&DS Repository Installation and Configuration Guide which indicate to import the SSL certificate into the local client Java keystore (cacerts file) like this:



keytool -import -alias spss -file C:\my_certificate_file.cer -keystore "C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Deployment\7.0\DeploymentManager\jre\lib\security\cacerts"



And the import of my certificate completes successfully, but I still see the exact same error as if the certificate still is not recognized or is invalid for some reason?






CAUSE
This can happen if the .cer file you import is not the correct .cer file extracted from the WebSphere application server where SSL is enabled.

ANSWER
To correct this, make sure to extract the appropriate certificate file from WebSphere by going to the WebSphere administration console and then go to Security | SSL Certificate and key management | Key stores and certificates | NodeDefaultKeyStore | Personal certificates. From there find the appropriate certificate used by WebSphere and select the option to "Extract..." and then extract a Base64 encoded ASCII data file to a .cer file on the local file system of the WebSphere server. Then take that .cer file and import that into the cacerts keystore file on the client using the keytool command.
