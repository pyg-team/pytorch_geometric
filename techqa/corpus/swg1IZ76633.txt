LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker Version 6 and the MIME
   parser.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   All Platforms
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The WebSphere Message Broker is configured with the proxy
   servlet (support pack IE01) and messages that need the
   MIME parser are not correctly parsed. The attachments are
   removed.
   When sending http messages through the servlet proxy (IE01),
   the Content-Type in the http header arrives in the flow as
   content-type (all lower case) and the MIME parser fails to
   recognize the content-type field.
   The content-type is used to locate the attachments.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The MIME parser has been changed to correctly recognize a
   content-type in lower case.
   Note: This only applies to WebSphere Message Broker V6.
