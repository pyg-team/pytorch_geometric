   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An S0C4 in CECLRI01 occurred when       *
   *                      IMS is using dual logging for OLDS      *
   *                      and the number of primary OLDS does     *
   *                      not equal the number of secondary       *
   *                      OLDS.                                   *

   ****************************************************************
   Classic DBRC API calls were returning information on secondary
   logs indicating the DBRC was recording information for
   secondary OLDS logs in addition to the primary OLDS logs.
   However, there are points in Classic code that does
   not check the number of secondary OLDS properly, which can
   cause the abend S0C4 in CECLRI01.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Classic gets its information about secondary logging from its
   DBRC calls.  If the DBRC calls indicate secondary logs are
   being written to, Classic code will attempt to use them if
   there is an I/O error on the primary OLDS. Classic code will
   be changed to check correctly the number of secondary OLDS
   being used, which will prevent the abend S0c4 seen.
