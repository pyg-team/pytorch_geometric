APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Regarding why we don't get NV_ALARM_ID populated on resynch, it
   is because "Nortel and Siemens use the remainder of the body
   only in notifications so we do not want to attempt to parse this
   if we are in a resync phase".
   
   Only in the case of Notifications, is there support for both
   filterable and non-filterable notification parameters. Only in
   case of Notifications, the StructuredEvent struct will contain a
   remainder_of_body field (as described below), which can be used
   for storing fields like NV_ALARM_ID.
   
   struct StructuredEvent {
       EventHeader header;
       FilterableEventBody filterable_data;
       any remainder_of_body;
   }; // StructuredEvent

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of the Siemens and Nortel CORBA    *
   *                 probes.                                      *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A customer reported that the Nortel and *
   *                      Siemens CORBA probes are not currently  *
   *                      populating the NV_ALARM_ID field at the *
   *                      time of resynchronization.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   *                                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   A new subsection Populating tokens during resynchronization
   will be added to the Filtering notifications and alarms section
   of the reference guide of the following probes:
   
   - Nortel OAM 3GPP - Nortel Preside Wireless Internet - Siemens
   Corba V2
   
   
   
   The new subsection will contain the following information.
   
   Populating tokens during resynchronization
   ========================================== The StructuredEvent
   struct from CosNotifications.idl contains a remainder_of_body
   field that has the following structure definition:
   
   struct StructuredEvent {     EventHeader header;
   FilterableEventBody filterable_data;     any remainder_of_body;
   }; // StructuredEvent
   
   The remainder_of_body field is only present in notifications,
   where it can be used for storing non-filterable fields like
   NV_ALARM_ID. The probe will not populate tokens, other than the
   standard filterable ones, for alarms received during
   resynchronization; for example, the probe cannot populate the
   NV_ALARM_ID field for alarms received during resynchronization.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product documentation will be updated with the next release
   of the various Siemens and Nortel CORBA probes.
