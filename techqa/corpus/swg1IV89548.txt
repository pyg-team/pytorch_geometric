APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The JACORB implementation does not use the value of ORBLocalHost
   and instead uses host value.
   
   This is because of a setting in the file:
   $OMNIHOME/probes/java/corba/jacorb-3.3/etc/jacorb.properties
   
   # Use DNS names in IORs
   jacorb.dns.enable=on
   
   Which causes an IP Address to be translated into a hostname
   which causes issues if the EMS does not have knowledge of the
   probe server.
   
   For example, entries in the /etc/hosts for the probe server
   
   The symptom is that the OrbLocalHostPort is not contacted by the
   EMS.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update the jacorb.properties file:
   
   $OMNIHOME/probes/java/corba/jacorb-3.3/etc/jacorb.properties
   
   # Use DNS names in IORs
   jacorb.dns.enable=off
