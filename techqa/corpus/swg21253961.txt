PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to start IBM WebSphere Application Server v6.1 in profiling mode on a 64 bit Intel machine on Linux using WebSphere Application Server Toolkit results in an "UnsatisfiedLinkError" error. 

CAUSE
The full error message is as follows:

ADMU3011E: Server launched but failed initialization. startServer.log,
SystemOut.log(or job log in zOS) and other log files under 

/app/was/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/logs/server1 should 

contain failure information. 

 

native_stderr.log contains: 

JVMJ9VM011W Unable to load piAgent: libpiAgent.so: cannot open shared 

object file: No such file or directory





It is not currently possible in Linux for a 64-bit program to dynamically load a 32-bit library. Since the Rational Agent Controller is currently only available as a 32 bit library, the 64 bit Linux machine will not be able to dynamically load the 32-bit library. 




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When the Rational Agent Controller supports the 64-bit Intel architecture for Linux, there will no longer be a problem since it will then be dynamically loading a 64-bit library.
