Text:
CVE-2015-7450 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 An Apache Commons Collections vulnerability for handling Java object deserialization was addressed by the Apache Software Foundation and incorporated into an IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty fixes. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
IBM Rational Directory Server Tivoli and Rational Directory Administrator are affected by the following vulnerability:




CVEID: CVE-2015-7450 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7450]

DESCRIPTION: Apache Commons Collections could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the deserialization of data with Java InvokerTransformer class. By sending specially crafted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary Java code on the system.

To apply the fix for Rational Directory Server Tivoli 5.2.1: 

Note: The vulnerability affects the Rational Directory Administrator (RDA) that ships with Rational Directory Server Tivoli. 

Note: That you must upgrade to WebSphere Application Server Liberty 8.5.0.2 before applying this fix.


 1. Open a console and navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file for the fix. 
 2. Run the command: java -jar 8.5.0.2-WS-WASProd_WLPArchive-IFPI52103.jar 
    
    The following launch options are available for the jar file:
    
    --installLocation [LibertyRootDir] 
    
    By default the jar will look for a "wlp" directory in its current location. The default location is in the following path in the Rational Directory Server installation: WebAppsServer/WLP_<version>. For example, WebAppsServer/WLP_8.5.5.2. If your Liberty profile install location is different than "wlp" and/or it is not in the same directory as the jar, then you can use this option to change where the jar will patch. [LibertyRootDir] can either be relative to the location of the jar or an absolute file path.
    
    --suppressInfo 
    
    Hides all messages other than confirming the patch has completed or error messages. 
 3. Stop Rational Directory Administrator. 
 4. Start Rational Directory Administrator.
    Note: By restarting Rational Directory Administrator, you are restarting the Liberty profile.
    


To apply the fix for Rational Directory Administrator 6.0.0.0, 6.0.0.1 or 6.0.0.2: Note: You must upgrade to WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.6 before applying this fix.


 1. Open a console and navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file for the fix. 
 2. Run the command: java -jar 8556-wlp-archive-IFPI52103.jar 
    
    The following launch options are available for the jar file:
    
    --installLocation [LibertyRootDir] 
    
    By default the jar will look for a "wlp" directory in its current location. The default location is in the following path in the Rational Directory Administrator installation: WebAppsServer/WLP_<version>. For example, WebAppsServer/WLP_8.5.5.2. If your Liberty profile install location is different than "wlp" and/or it is not in the same directory as the jar, then you can use this option to change where the jar will patch. [LibertyRootDir] can either be relative to the location of the jar or an absolute file path.
    
    --suppressInfo 
    
    Hides all messages other than confirming the patch has completed or error messages. 
 3. Stop Rational Directory Administrator. 
 4. Start Rational Directory Administrator.
    Note: By restarting Rational Directory Administrator, you are restarting the Liberty profile.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of the open-source Apache Commons Collections and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
