APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DataPower appliance recycles when using SCP logging. There
   is a timing issue, which impacts watchdogs, thus crashing the
   appliance.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  (1) Changing the logging protocol to SFTP instead of using SCP.
   
   -or-
   
   (2) The logging file size has to be modified before the log
   rotation occurs, which is every 120 seconds. Therfore the
   rotation of the logs must be less than 120 seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A timeout value (100 secs) is set for scp log target.  If scp
   action is not complete within 100 secs, drouter will kill it to
   prevent watchdog.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 3.7.3.12, 3.8.0.6, 3.8.1.4
