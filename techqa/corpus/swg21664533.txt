Text:
snmp; traps TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Netcool Knowledge Library (NcKL) was introduced into the system. After adding a few vendor specific rules to the main rules file, probe terminates immediately after starting and generates core file. 

SYMPTOM
Probe shuts down immediately after starting up, producing a core file.


CAUSE
Probe process memory limit was reached.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Environment variable LDR_CNTRL needs to be set, in order to increase process memory limit. For example, to increase the process memory limit to 1.25GB, you would set:

export LDR_CNTRL = MAXDATA=0x40000000

Please consult your system administrator or IBM support if you're not sure about the value to be set for LDR_CNTRL.
