Title: IBM How can I export the DDL for my EVENT MONITOR definitions? - United States

QUESTION
 I have a DB2 for Linux, Unix and Windows database (DB2 for LUW), and I would like to export the DDL for my event monitors, so that I can create them in another database. I cannot find how to do that in the Infocenter. How do I do this? 

ANSWER
Db2look would be the logical tool to accomplish this, but right now it does not have that functionality. It DOES have the ability to export WLM Event Monitors using the -wlm option, but this does NOT include "regular" event monitors. This is a request that might make it into future DB2 releases, but as of v11.1 FP1, it is not included.

If you are backing up one database and restoring to another, then the event monitors would be included in the backup image, and thus would exist in the restored database.

Otherwise, it is possible to reconstruct the CREATE EVENT MONITOR statement using the information contained in the SYSCAT.EVENTMONITOR, SYSCAT.EVENTS and SYSCAT.EVENTTABLES tables. Rows in the first table describe event monitors with columns representing the various options that can be specified as part of creation. Rows in syscat.events describe the events captured for an event monitor (type of event, options) and rows in syscat.eventtables describe the target tables for the event monitor (applicable to write to table event monitors). It would be a manual process, but will ultimately work. See the links below for information on the SYSCAT tables mentioned above, and the CREATE EVENT MONITOR statement.
