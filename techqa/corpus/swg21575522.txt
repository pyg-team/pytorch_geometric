Title: IBM Execution Group abends showing WTX libraries following WMB upgrade - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you upgrade to WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) 7.0.0.3, message flows containing WTX nodes cause their Execution Groups to abend.

Note: This has also been confirmed to occur in WMB 7.0.0.2 and WMB 8.0.0.0. 

SYMPTOM
The abend files will show WTX libraries (dtxwmqi.lil).


CAUSE
The 'jre16' directory provided with some versions/Fix Packs of WMB contains a file ('libjvm.a') that negatively impacts WTX processing.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make the following changes to the directory 'jre16/lib/ppc64/classic': 

1) alter the filename of 'libjvm.a' to 'libjvm.a.bkp'
2) create a new symlink 'libjvm.a' pointing to 'libjvm.so'

Then, restart your Broker.

The final directory contents should look similar to this:
jre16/lib/ppc64/classic
lrwxrwxrwx root system 9 libjvm.a -> libjvm.so
-rwxr-xr-x root system 136763 libjvm.a.bkp
-rwxr-xr-x root system 136763 libjvm.so
