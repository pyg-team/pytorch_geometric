KNOWN ISSUES
 * 
 * If you upgrade to v10.0.0.4, and later upgrade to v11.0.0.1 or v11.0.1.0, the upgrade would fail because OpenSSL version downgrading is not possible. To work around this issue, ensure that any later upgrade to v11 is at least v11.0.2. For information about upgrading to v11.0.2, see Upgrading to Watson Explorer Foundational Components Version 11.0.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048896] 
 * 
 * IBM Knowledge Center is no longer included as an installable component of Watson Explorer.
 * 
 * If you use an older version of IBM DB2 JDBC driver, you might see a database connection failure with the error code as shown in the following technote: SqlException with message "Caught java.io.CharConversionException." and ERRORCODE=-4220 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684365]. To work around this problem, upgrade the DB2 JDBC driver to Version 9.7 Fix Pack 5 or above [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21363866].
 * 
 * The ASP.NET interface is not supported in IBM Watson Explorer Versions 8.2-6 and 9.0.0.8.
