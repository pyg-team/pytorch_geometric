APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you define your own document types in your Enterprise
   Content Management (ECM) system, depending on the capabilities
   of the ECM system you might be able to define a choice list for
   a property of the document type. For example, in FileNet Content
   Manager you can define a choice list, use this list for a
   property template, and use this template for a property
   definition on a document class definition. For the choice list,
   you can define a value and a display name for each option. You
   can also group options into nested groups.
   
   When you use the Document List coach view in IBM Business
   Process Manager (BPM), you can create documents. The coach view
   renders a form to help you create the document by using the
   properties defined in the definition of the document type. For a
   choice-based property, the form has a list that drops down so
   you can select a value. This list does not show the display name
   of the options, only the value. Also, the list is missing nested
   options.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM BPM accesses the ECM system by using the Content Management
   Interoperability Services (CMIS). When the type information is
   retrieved, it is transformed into the ECMObjectTypeDefinition
   business object from the Content Management toolkit. The
   information about the properties is available in the
   propertyTypeDefinitions property from the
   ECMPropertyTypeDefinition business object. This business object
   allows you to store possible values for the choice options but
   does not allow you to store display names for the options, nor
   to specify an nested structure. This information is, therefore,
   not available for the Document List coach view.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 CF2016.06. The fix
   extends the ECMPropertyTypeDefinition business object type to be
   able to store all the information about the choice options. The
   Document List, Document Explorer, and Heritage Document List
   coach views use this information to render a list that shows the
   display name and the hierarchy of the choice options. The
   Document List and Heritage Document List use the choice metadata
   to show the display name instead of the value for columns that
   are backed by a property with choice options.
