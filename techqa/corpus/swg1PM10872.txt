APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Possible SQLCODE413 running DB2 Log Analysis Tool.
   Reported msgs included the following:
   
    DSNT408I SQLCODE = -413, ERROR: OVERFLOW OCCURRED DURING
             NUMERIC  DATA TYPE CONVERSION
    DSNT418I SQLSTATE = 22003 SQLSTATE RETURN CODE
    DSNT415I SQLERRP = DSNXRINT SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR
    DSNT416I SQLERRD = -101 0 0 -1 0 0 SQL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
    DSNT416I SQLERRD = X'FFFFFF9B' X'00000000' X'00000000'
             X'FFFFFFFF' X'00000000' X'00000000'
             SQL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
   
   If the column COPYPAGESF in SYSCOPY contains a value that
   exceeds the limit of an integer, a SQLCODE of -413 can be
   encountered. This fix will prevent the -413 SQLCODE in this
   circumstance.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Running the MODIFY RECOVERY utility on objects with very old
   entries may prevent the problem.
   
   The proper use of MODIFY RECOVERY will greatly enhance the
   performance of DB2 Log Analysis Tool.
