QUESTION
 How do you use multicasting with SysML1.2 standard ports in IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

CAUSE
This is not documented elsewhere.

ANSWER
Multicasting works in a similar way for SysML1.2 standard ports as it does with UML standard ports. Rational Rhapsody still uses the MULTICAST_GEN macro. You have two options: 

 1. Add a send action and Rational Rhapsody will automatically generate the correct macro - MULTICAST_GEN
    
    or,
    
 2. Add the MULTICAST_GEN macro manually to the statechart. For Rational Rhapsody, in C this should replaced with RiC_MULTICAST_GEN_PORT
