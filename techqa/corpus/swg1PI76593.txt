APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With the release of Statistics 22.0 changes were introduced in
   the underlying component for the GENLIN and GLMM commands in
   SPSs Statistics.  Recently, it has been found that some of these
   changes were inappropriate for the binomial distribution and
   need to be rolled back in the product to the pre-Statistics 22.0
   routines.
