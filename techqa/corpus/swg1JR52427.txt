 *  Preface:
   --------
   Usage of the left navigation search pane and decreasing the
   size of it.
   
   Current situation:
   -------------------
   The action buttons in the left nav search page are not

   From a certain pane width a scrollbar is displayed.
   With IE9 all buttons remains in 1 button line, with IE10 the
   Delete button is shown in transparent mode in a second button
   line.
   
   Desired situation:
   ------------------
   With IE9 and IE10 the buttons have to be relocated in more the
   1 button line when size of the left navigation pane is
   decreased.
   The behaviour should be the same as it was before FP01 for 11.4.
