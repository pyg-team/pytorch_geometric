Title: IBM AMQ6047 for conversion between UTF8 and EBCDIC codepages on HP-UX - United States

Text:
MQPRB hp hp-ux hpux ccsid supported unsupported amq6047 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 

An error similar to the following is observed in the WebSphere MQ queue manager error logs, for a HP-UX queue manager:

AMQ6047: Conversion not supported.
EXPLANATION:
WebSphere MQ is unable to convert string data tagged in CCSID 1208 to data in CCSID 500.
ACTION:
Check the WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference Appendix and the appropriate National Language Support publications to see if the CCSIDs are supported by your system.


 The most likely circumstances are a channel between a HP-UX queue manager and a z/OS queue manager, where CONVERT has been specified. 



CAUSE
HP-UX is not provided with codepage conversion tables between UTF8 and the EBCDIC codepages which are used by default on z/OS queue managers (as can be seen by inspecting the file /usr/lib/nls/iconv/config.iconv on HP-UX).
These EBCDIC codepages, such as CCSID 500, do not support the Euro â‚¬ character.
There are a set of corresponding EBCDIC codepages, which differ only in support of the Euro character, for which codepage conversion tables are supplied on HP-UX.
As such, changing the CCSID of the z/OS queue manager to a corresponding CCSID should resolve the issue.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


 Change the CCSID of the z/OS queue manager to a corresponding EBCDIC codepage, which supports the Euro character.
The following table summarizes these codepages:
