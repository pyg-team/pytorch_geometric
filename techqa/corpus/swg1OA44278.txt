   ****************************************************************
   NetView for z/OS Enterprise Management Agent application support
   resource jar files do not have the required MANIFEST.MF
   statement "permissions:all-permissions". The browser's applet or
   java web start access to the Tivoli Enterprise Portal will be
   blocked if the browser's java is Oracle v7 update 51 (u51). No
   other levels or versions of java running in the browser will
   have this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Enterprise Management Agent workstation application support
   and language pack support resource jars are being rebuilt to
   include the new permissions statement in the manifest file. For
   NetView 5.4, the fix is included in the package identified as
   level 5.4.0.2 (5.4 fixpack 2). Defect 180490 contains the
   change. For NetView 5.3, the fix is included in the package
   identified as level 5.3.0.3 (5.3 fixpack 3). Defect 180491
   contains the change.
   
   Fixpacks for NetView 5.3 and NetView 5.4 will be available for
   download from Fix Central by 14 February 2014 and will be
   listed in technote #1660437 at:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660437 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660437]
   
   There are no host parts (no PTFs) for NetView 5.3 and NetView
   5.4 since only application support is affected.
