 How to Install Software Extension Toolkit 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) What is SQL extension toolkit package? 

- SQL extension toolkit package is an optional package that contains additional SQL functions for IBM Netezza data warehouse appliances.

2) Does SQL extension toolkit package installation require downtime?
- SQL extension toolkit package installation is an online activity. It does not require any downtime.

3) How much time it is required to install SQL extension toolkit package?
- SQL extension toolkit package installation gets completed within 30 minutes.

4) How to download SQL extension toolkit package?
- Download the required SQL extension toolkit package by following below steps.

SQL Extension Kit:

URL: http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]

Select product:

Product Group* ---> Information Management
Select from Information Management* ---> IBM Netezza Applications
Installed Version* > SQLEXT_7.X (Select required SQL extension toolkit package)
Platform* ---> Linux

Continue ---> Browse for fixes ---> Continue ---> (Download required SQL extension toolkit package).

5) What are the steps to install SQL extension toolkit package?
- Below are the steps to install SQL extension toolkit package?

5-1) Log in to the Netezza system as the root user.

5-2) Copy the sqlext.package.tar.z file to a directory on the Netezza system such as /home/nz or /nzscratch or another location.

5-3) Untar the package using the following command:

$ tar -xzvpf sqlext.package.tar.z 

The command extracts two files, libnetcrypto-version.tar.gz and libnetxml-version.tar.gz

5-4) Extract the software files and compiled objects from each of the two files using the following command:

$ tar -xzf libnetcrypto-version.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf libnetxml-version.tar.gz

The tar command uncompresses and untars the contents to the directories named libnetcrypto/version and libnetxml/version in the current directory, where version is the version number of the IBM Netezza SQL extension toolkit package.

6) Enabling IBM Netezza SQL Extensions support in a database:

To enable the IBM Netezza SQL Extensions, do the following:

6-1) Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.
6-2) Change to the directory where the SQL Extensions library is installed, where dir is the directory in which you untarred the files.

$ cd dir/libnetcrypto/version 

6-3) Run the install script and specify the database name and database user login credentials. The SQL toolkit library will be enabled in the specified database. The specified database user will be the owner of the library functions.

$ ./install -d dbname -u username -W password

Upon completion, the command displays the message “Successfully Installed Crypto Library to dbname.”

For example:
$ ./install -d testDB -u admin -W xxxxxxx
Successfully Installed Crypto Library to testDB
$

6-4) Similarly install the XML library following Steps 2 and 3, above, but running the install script from the libnetxml subdirectory.

$ cd dir/libnetxml/version

7) Disabling IBM Netezza SQL extension toolkit package in a database:

7-1) Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.

7-2) Change to the installation location of the XML functions in the toolkit, for example:

$ cd install-dir/libnetxml/version

7-3) Run the install command with the “-R” switch, specifying the database name and database user login credentials used for installation.

$ ./install -R -d dbname -u username -W password

The command disables the XML functions of the SQL toolkit library in the specified database and displays the message “Successfully Uninstalled XML Library from dbname” when it completes.

For example:
[nz@nzfabric 1.3]$ ./install -R -d testDB -u admin -W xxxxxxx
Successfully Uninstalled XML Library from testDB
[nz@nzfabric 1.3]$

7-4) Change to the installation location of the crypto functions in the toolkit and run the install command as described in Step 3.

7-5) Repeat Steps 2 through 4 for each database in which you want to disable IBM Netezza SQL extension toolkit support.

8) How do I verify whether SQL extension toolkit support is enabled for any specific database?
- You can follow below steps to verify whether SQL extension toolkit support is enabled for any specific database.

$ nzsql
$ \c <Database Name>
$ select regexp_version(); 
$ select crypto_version();
