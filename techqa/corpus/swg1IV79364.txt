   CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
   ==============================
   The following instructions are for configuring private
   situations on the IBM i OS agent.
   
   1. Set the following environment variables in the
   QAUTOTMP/KMSPARM environment file as follows:
   
      KDC_FAMILIES=SNA USE:N IP.PIPE USE:Y PORT:1918
   
      CT_CMSLIST=
   
   2. Private situations are defined using a XML specification in
   the following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_situations.xml
   
      The IFS directory path is created during agent installation.
   The user creates the a4_situations.xml file.
   
   3. EIF event destination server or servers and their
   configurations are defined using a XML specification
      file in the following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_eventdest.xml
   
      The IFS directory path is created during agent installation.
   The user creates the a4_eventdest.xml file.
   
   4. An optional EIF event mapping file configuration XML file can
   be used to customize the EIF events that are generated. If no
   event mapping file is provided, events are formatted by generic
   mapping.
   
      If you create a user defined event mapping file, store it in
   the following location:
   
         /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_eventmap.xml
   
         The IFS directory path is created during agent
   installation. The user creates the a4_eventmap.xml file.
   
   5. Private situation definitions are preserved during an
   uninstall or upgrade install in a save file format in the
   following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/ConfigData/eifpsit.sav
   
      The eifpsit.sav file containing the private situation
   definitions is restored if the agent is installed again or at
   the before an upgrade install completes.
   
   6. Sending private situation events by using TLS/SSL
   communication is not supported.
   
   7. For further information on EIF private situations,
   specifications, and examples, see Chapter 15 Agent-based
   Services in the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide,
