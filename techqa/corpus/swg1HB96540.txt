ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ABSTRACT:  infor warning and error message level are the same
   ....
   Update from DSA:
   Fred, please elaborate on this issue for me.  I talked to
   development, we edited the message file, by changing the
   Informational, warning, or error flags, the appropriate
   action occurred.  For example, if I changed the flag
   on an information message to E (Error), then the stop code
   could be issued, therefore, I am not sure of the problem.
   if you could please provide additional information
   for this PMR, I would appreciate it.
   Thank you.

   Hi Onkar,
   I rediscussed the issue with the customer.
   He admitted that there was a difference.
   His main concern was (and I can only agree) that
   he can not see why - when the level is set to error
   - all those
   Retrieve and Create messages (for each part ) are generated.
   They should only be produced when there is an error
   in retrieving or creating the part.
   When coupling big models this is generating a big report file
   even when msglevel is ERROR.
   When the level is set to error no Licence
   message is required, no Retrieve/Create,
   no Begin/End ...Initialization
   message except if there s really a problem.
   The USER OPTIONS and the
   STATISTICS, together with the errors is what he would expect.
   Let me know if you need any more details,
   Regards, Paul, Fred.
