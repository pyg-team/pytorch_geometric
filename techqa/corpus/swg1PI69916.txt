APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Admin Agent process (bipbroker) detects an MQ or RRS
   availability issue, it should shutdown cleanly and restart along
   with the integration servers after MQ/RRS is available again.
   It is observed that sometimes the Admin Agent is not shutting
   down cleanly and is abending with the following stack:

   This leads to bipbroker not restarting and the integration
   servers also not being restarted.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If the Admin Agent process (bipbroker) detects an MQ or RRS
   availability issue, it should shutdown cleanly and restart along
   with the integration servers after MQ/RRS is available again. It
   is observed that sometimes the Admin Agent is not shutting down
   cleanly and is abending.
   
   This leads to bipbroker not restarting and the integration
   servers also not being restarted.
   
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details
