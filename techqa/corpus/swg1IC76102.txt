APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Client GUI to restore a
   virtual machine with "Restore VM" option, the restore window
   does not display information about all VSTOR backups for virtual
   machines that were taken. This can happen if there are both, VCB
   and VSTOR backups for the same virtual machine stored on the
   Tivoli Storage Manager server using the same proxy node name.
   The VCB backups are displayed properly.
   
   Platforms and versions affected:
   Tivoli Storage Manager client 6.2
   
   Initial Impact:
   Low
   
   Additional Keywords:
   tsm client vstor vcb zz62 vm vstorage
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the dsmc command line interface to restore the desired
   machines.
   If the VCB backups are no longer required, delete them using the
   steps from DCF 1418136. Please note that for 6.2 VCB backup, the
   'delete group' command needs to be used.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Backup-archive client version 6.2 running    *
   *                 on all Microsoft Windows platforms.          *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: See ERROR DESCRIPTION                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply fixing level when available. This      *
   *                 problem is currently projected to be fixed   *
   *                 in level 6.2.4. Note that until the fixing   *
   *                 level is available, this information is      *
   *                 subject to change at the discretion of IBM.  *
   ****************************************************************
   The problem occurs because initial data from Java GUI query is
   being modified during VCB VM processing, so subsequent VSTOR VM
   processing uses incorrect data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem has been fixed so that it no longer occurs.
