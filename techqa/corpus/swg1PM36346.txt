   ****************************************************************
   The StackOverflowError was caused by ill-formed JSON text.
   The selection in the editor initiates code to find the
   immediate surrounding object or array. In the case of
   improperly paired brackets an offset in the editor was being
   returned that caused repeated searching through the same
   area of the document until the StackOverflowError occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code execution has taken into account the resulting
   offset for improperly paired brackets and now properly exits
   for this offset.
   
   The fix for this issue is included in Rational Application
   Developer version 8.0.3.
