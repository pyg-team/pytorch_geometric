ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Rational Application Develeoper (RAD) v9.5.0.2 based on
   Java 8.0, an unsecured or secured WebSphere Application Server
   (WAS) v8.5.5.9 (or earlier fixpack) and/or WebSphere Portal
   v8.5.x  server can be started in the Server view using the RMI
   protocol,  but the server never shows as [Started] and stays in
   [Starting,Synchronized] state. RAD 9.5 cannot detect that the
   server is started and cannot synchronize using RMI.
   
   A WAS 8.5.5.9 (or earlier 8.5.5.x) with a Java 7.0 server
   profile ( which is what Portal 8.5.x uses) can show this
   problem. In the Server overview editor , in manual mode you can
   choose RMI or SOAP with a Portal 8.5.x server (not IPC). On a
   WAS server IPC also works. IPC is not a choice with Portal
   
   Server:
   
   - Server connection types and administrative ports
   ( ) Automatically determine connection types
   (*) Manually provide connection settings
   
   ---
   Connection ...
   [ ] IPC
   [x] RMI
   [ ] SOAP
   ...
   
   
   
   When using RMI,
   you will also encounter a pop-up error like the following when
   trying to start a Portal 8.5 server:
   
   //---
   The connection failed due to the following exception:
   ADMC0017E: Could not create an RMI connector to connect to host
   localhost at port 100032
   For a Technote with details on the most common server connection
   problem, see
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21266028 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21266028]
   //---
   
   OR in the case of WAS 8.5.x
   
   //-- Problem
   'Starting WebSphere Application Server tradional at localhst
   v8.5 has encountered a problem
   
   Server WebSphere Application Server traditional V8.5 at
   localhost was unable to start within 300 seconds. If the server
   requires more time, try increasing the timeout in the server
   editor.
   ..
   //--
   
   Either way, even though the server is started, it will continue
   to incorrectly show as being in [Starting,Synchronized] state.
   If you choose automatic and RAD tries RMI then the same problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The SOAP protocol works with a WAS (secured or unsecured) or
   Portal server. WAS can also use IPC.
