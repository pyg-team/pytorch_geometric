Title: IBM Not able to configure OQ agent 64bit - United States

Text:
ITM TM KOQ SQL MSSQL GKSI; 5724B96MOTR TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Agent doesn't show instance in server list while configuring the agent locally via MTEMS. 

SYMPTOM
OQ_LocalConfig.log contains:

1382 Checking SQL instances for 64 bit

1472 ***Error: Registry : 'Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\Instance Names\SQL' not found, return code for RegOpenKeyEx is 2 
1396 OPEN_FAILED: Open key failed

1433 Scanning Done 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem occurs when OQ agent 64bit is being configured to monitor 32bit SQL server

Basically SQL Agent 32bit can monitor both 32 and 64bit SQL Servers, 
However 64bit SQL Agent can monitor only 64 bit SQL Server.
