LOCAL FIX
 *  Title:
   Compiling Micro Focus Net Express COBOL TXSeries application to
   produce output in native code with extension .gnt
   Abstract:
   TXSeries for Windows supports Micro Focus Net Express COBOL to
   build COBOL application. You can follow below procedure to
   compile an MF COBOL program in windows to produce the output in
   Micro Focus native code with extension .gnt
   Resolving the problem:
   The steps given below explain with an example program named
   example.ccp:
   1. Set COBCPY environment variable for linking the TXSeries
   cobol copy book path:
          set COBCPY= %CICSPATH%ﾾinclude
   2. The cicstran command in TXSeries converts the TXSeries COBOL
   file with extension .ccp to the MF COBOL extension file .cbl.
       C:ﾾoptﾾcicsﾾbinﾾcicstran -lCOBOL example.ccp
   You can refer TXSeries documents for more options about cicstran
   command
   3. The cobol command in Micro Focus COBOL can directly use the
   .cbl extension file to produce native code with extension .gnt.
   
       cobol example.cbl NOANIM OMF"GNT" /CALL-RECOVERY
   /DATA-CONTEXT
    To build TXSeries database applications, you can use different
   cobol commands and options explained in MF COBOL document. We
   have given an example to compile a TXSeries application
   involving Oracle database into .gnt format .
   
    The steps given below explain with a Pro*MF COBOL/TXSeries
   application program named sample.pco
     1. Rename the sample.pco file to TXSeries COBOL file with
   extension sample.ccp
          move sample.pco sample.ccp
      2. Execute the cicstran command to pre-process the TXSeries
   statement in the file sample.ccp and it generate the MF COBOL
   extension file sample.cbl
            C:ﾾoptﾾcicsﾾbinﾾcicstran -lCOBOL sample.ccp
       3.  Rename the file sample.cbl which is translated by
   TXSeries cicstran command back to sample.pco
           move sample.cbl sample.pco
       4.   The cobolw command in Micro Focus COBOL can directly
   use the .pco extension file to produce native code with
   extension .gnt with following option.
           cobolw sample.pco /gnt preprocess(cobsql) cstart cstop
   CSQLT=ORA end-c comp5=yes endp;
    We do not test all the options of above mentioned 'cobolw' MF
   COBOL command.It is left to the application programmer to
   evaluate the option from MF COBOL documentation and test in
   their TXSeries environment for its compatibility.
   From TXSeries perspective, it is recommended for customer to
   compile applications to a .cbmfnt format ( native dll format in
   windows for TXSeries) for production use.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  TXSeries documentation doesn't explain about the procedure to
   generate .gnt extension for TXSeries Mirco Focus Net Express
   COBOL program on Windows. This document APAR is to add the
   documentation, which explains the method of compiling a TXSeries
   -Micro Focus COBOL program on Windows to generate the output in
   native code with .gnt extension.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Required documentation changes will be available on next
   refreshed TXSeries info center. You can also find a technote
   which explains the same procedure in below URL,
