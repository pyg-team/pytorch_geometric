Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-3508 and CVE-2014-3509) affect the virtual machines deployed by IBM PureApplication System. - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Nine OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed in August 2014. This bulletin addresses the two vulnerabilities that are applicable to virtual machines which are deployed by IBM PureApplication System using the IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems and the IBM OS Image for AIX Systems. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-3508 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3508]
DESCRIPTION: 
OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in OBJ_obj2txt. If applications echo pretty printing output, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read information from the stack.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95165 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95165] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2014-3509 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3509]
DESCRIPTION: 
OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition in the ssl_parse_serverhello_tlsext() code. If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed session, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95159 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95159] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
