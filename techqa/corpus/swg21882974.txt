Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
This vulnerability affects IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
To fully mitigate these vulnerabilities, an additional fix (JR53201) is required for the following product versions: 

 * WebSphere Integration Developer V7.0.0.5 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FWebSphere+Integration+Developer&fixids=7.0.0.5-WS-IID-IFJR53201&source=SAR] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V7.5.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=7.5.1.2-WS-IID-IFJR53201&source=SAR] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.0.1.3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.0.1.3-WS-IID-IFJR53201&source=SAR] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.0.1-WS-IID-IFJR53201] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.5.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.5.0-WS-IID-IFJR53201] 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.6.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FWebSphere%2FIBM+Integration+Designer&fixids=8.5.6.0-WS-IID-IFJR53201]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If you are using any of the following products: 

 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.0.1 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.5.0 
 * IBM Integration Designer V8.5.6.0


then the following steps can be used to remove RC4 from the list of available algorithms: 

Prerequisite: Before removing RC4 from the list of available algorithms, you must first install the FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys fix. See this document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21700896] for more information. 

1. Ensure that the product is not running. 

2. Locate the java.security file used by the product from the following location: 
install folder/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security 

3. Edit the java.security file with a text editor and locate the line: 
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3 

4. Add RC4 to the list of disabled algorithms, for example: 
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4 

5. Save the file and restart the product. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
