PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Events are being missed because of the StateChange on the ObjectServer doesn't consider the milliseconds and Netcool Impact does. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue is the following: 

1. Increase the polling time of the EventReader on Netcool Impact by 12000 or 15000 and to use Impact flags. 

2. If option number 1 doesn't solve the issue, then you can add a new deviant field to the EventReader. The deviant fields by default the EventReader uses are: 
Serial,ServerName,ServerSerial,StateChange,LastOccurrence,InternalLast. 


To add a another deviant field to the EventReader you add to the 
$IMPACT_HOME/etc/<your-instance-name>_eventreader.props 

impact.deviantfields.compareselectedfields=true 

impact.deviantfields=<field names to compare including the standard 
fields> 

Other customers have add as a deviant field the "ImpactProcessed". 

Need to restart the Impact server for the changes to take effect.
