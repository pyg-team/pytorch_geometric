APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Under certain conditions SCLM/DT-user are not longer able to
   check-out or check-in members to SCLM after an unsuccessful
   check-in operation. This situation can be resolved only by an
   administrator or an experienced UNIX user.
   
   The title 'How to create a file(!) called EDIT in
   your /var/SCLMDT/WORKAREA/?userid? folder' might be a bit
   misleading because it tells about the result of the user's
   actions and not the intend of the user's actions. No one is
   really trying to create a file called EDIT but in the end he
   created such a file. This file is located in the SCLM/DT
   workarea in the USS part on the mainframe and is normally a
   directory under which SCLM/DT seems to store temporary data for
   transfer between the mainframe and an RDz client. If this
   directory becomes a regular file accidentally, no more transfers
   are possible. Users are not able to check-in or check-out files
   from SCLM. They all have a regular file. After directory named
   EDIT which has become a deleting the file in USS directly the
   problem is corrected.
   
   
   Recreate Scenario:
   1. Switch to the SCLM perspective
   2. Choose the SCLM Developer Mode, if you?re not already in that
       mode.
   3. Clear the view.
   4. In the SCLM Preferences create a language extension mapping
      for language ARCHDEF
   5. Add a new project filter
   6. Add a new member named EDITTEST to SCLM (no matter what
      content)
   7. Close the Editor and save the file, but DO NOT check that new
       member in to SCLM.
   8. Switch view mode and confirm the warning (this will clear
      your view)
   9.  Recreate the SCLM location (project filter)
   10. Open up the tree and double click your EDITTEST member
   11. The editor comes up with dummy member containing a warning
   12. Delete the contents of the member and type a new line
         (content does not matter)
   13. Close the editor and click YES when you?re asked to save
       your changes.
   14. Check in the member to SCLM, choose language ARCHDEF
   15. Refresh the project filtered view and notice that your
       member is still checked out.
   16. Try to check in your member again. An error occurs.
       From now on you?re totally stuck because the last action
       created a file(!) named EDIT in the USS in
       folder /var/SCLMDT/WORKAREA/?userid?/ . Until you delete
       that file
       manually, you won?t be able to checkout or checkin any file
       from or to SCLM any longer..
