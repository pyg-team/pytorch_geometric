APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following Attribute Groups for WebSphere monitoring are
   enabled for Historical Data Collection by PureApplication
   System WebSphere monitoring, but are not defined for
   Summarization and Pruning:
   App Server, Enterprise Java Beans, Garbage Collection Analysis,
   J2C Conection Pools, Request Analysis, Request Times and Rates,
   Thread Pools,
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The Monitoring Portal can be used to manually configure
   Summarization and Pruning for the attributes.  Copy values from
   other attributes where summarization and pruning are specified
   properly.
   
   Another workaround is to re-run the configuration commands:
   
   1. Go to hubtems VM, ''sudo -s" to root
   2. Go to /opt/IBM/ITMSS/bin
   3. Logon to TEPS by  "./tacmd tepslogin -s localhost -u
   sysadmin -p $PWD"
   4. Re-configure the kyn arrtibutes:
   "./tacmd histconfiguregroups -t KYN -o "Application Server"
   "Garbage Collection Analysis" "Thread Pools" "Enterprise Java
   Beans" "J2C Connection Pools" "Request Analysis" "Request Times
   and Rates" -d MWDH -p M=6m,W=6m,D=30d,H=7d,R=7d -m"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The historical collections were created without configuring
   these attribute groups correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The history collection groups have been configured to provide
   the missing attribute group function.
