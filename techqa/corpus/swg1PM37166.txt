APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You are running DFHWS2LS and the resulting cobol copybooks
   contain level 88 fields with names that are longer than 30
   characters. This will result in errors at compile time because
   30 characters is the max length a cobol field can have. This
   problem will occur even if you have specified
   NAME-TRUNCATION=RIGHT in DFHWS2LS.

   ****************************************************************
   DFHWS2LS is called to generate language structure in COBOL from
   a WSDL file. There are names over 30 characters in length in
   the WSDL file. These names are used in Level88 fields in the
   language structure and are not truncated. It results in errors
   at compile time as COBOL cannot handle names that are longer
   than 30 characters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHWS2LS has been changed to generate valid COBOL level 88 field
   names.
