PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Beginning with the release of Google Chrome 29, the underlying Dojo might cause issues in Coaches and Process Portal in IBM Business Process Manager. 

SYMPTOM
The underlying Dojo might result in issues such as the description and zoom slider disappearing from the process diagram viewer for the process document, and widgets not being drawn properly. For example, the height of the widget might be a size of 0.


CAUSE
This problem is caused by how Dojo queries what widgets are being used from the browser. The widgets receive unexpected data which causes the failures. The following links to the Dojo toolkit site provide more information:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To solve this problem, you can upgrade your version of Dojo as follows: 


1. Download Dojo 1.6.2 (dojo-release-1.6.2.zip) from http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.6.2/ [http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.6.2/]

2. Stop the server.

3. Decompress Dojo 1.6.2 to a temporary location..

4. Note: This step overwrites the existing files. Copy the 3 decompressed directories (dijit, dojo, dojox) into the ..\AppServer\profiles\StandAloneProfile\installedApps\nodename1Node01Cell\IBM_BPM_Portal_nodename1_server1.ear\process-portal-support.war\js\dojo\1.6.1 directory.

5. Restart the server.

6. Clear your Google Chrome browser cache.
