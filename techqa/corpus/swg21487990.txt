Title: IBM SPSS AMOS (11,4) error with .msi installation only - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have been shipped version 19 or IBM SPSS AMOS and when I run the following command in one line it installs and launches, but I get the activation error (11,4):

msiexec.exe /i "\\vs-software.marqnet.mu.edu\software$\Deployment\SPSS\Amos\Version 19.0\Win\Source\IBM SPSS Amos 19.msi" /qr /L*V "c:\logfile.txt" LICENSETYPE="Network" LSHOST="vs-licensing.marqnet.mu.edu"

If I run setup.exe, select network license and identify my license server, the application does launch properly successfully obtains a license. If I run it straight from the MSI, it runs through the same setup as setup.exe and lauches properly post install and activates.
Is there a limititation on the amount of codes we can add to our licensing server for Amos? Currently, we are running version 8.1.0 of the Licensing Manager. Would upgrading to 8.2.2 eliminate this issue? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available

The keyword for pushed Network license installations is "LICENSETYPE" in all products, but the AMOS 190 msi still wants looks for "SPSSLICENSE" instead. The workaround is to use SPSSLICENSE instead of LICENSETYPE:

msiexec.exe /i "\\vs-software.marqnet.mu.edu\software$\Deployment\SPSS\Amos\Version 19.0\Win\Source\IBM SPSS Amos 19.msi" /qr /L*V "c:\logfile.txt" SPSSLICENSE="Network" LSHOST="vs-licensing.marqnet.mu.edu
