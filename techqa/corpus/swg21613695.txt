Text:
BPM; Business Process Manager; Integration Designer; Process Center; cannot; log in; log in to; log into TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In the Process Center perspective in IBM Integration Designer (IID), when you provide the URL to connect to the Process Center, you might receive an HTTP 404 error stating that the Java Server Pages (JSP) file cannot be found. 

CAUSE
This error is caused by the JSP file type at the end of the URL. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not include login.jsp in the web address that you use. For example, enter http://<server_name>:<port_number>/ProcessCenter instead of http://<server_name>:<port_number>/ProcessCenter/login.jsp.
