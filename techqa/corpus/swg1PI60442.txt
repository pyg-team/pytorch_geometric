   01."Communications Failure on Read Req" trying to set an entry
      breakpoint and CODEPAGE is active in EQAOPTS. This update
      matches the fix for IBM Debug Tool APAR 51340.
   02.When using CA Endevor SCM R17/R18, an 0C4 abend may happen
      during internal special list processing.
   03.Abend during dataset processing in RDz Endevor CARMA RAM
      when using z/OS 2.2.
   04.In some cases an 0C4 abend may happen during internal
      special list processing.
   05."IBM APP DLIV FND" should be added to the existing product
      registration table.
   06.zUnit *.xsd and *.xsl files are in the wrong place with the
      wrong name. /usr/lpp/IBM/rdz/samples/xsdAZUXSD10.xsd should
      be /usr/lpp/IBM/rdz/samples/xsd/AZUXSD10.xsd. Similar
      problem exists with AZUXSD20.xsd, AZUZ2J20.xsl, and
      AZU20T10.xsl
   07.Rational Developer for z Systems sample setup job FELSETUP
      attempts to copy FEKTEP2 andFEKTIAD to hlq.SQL, but the
      actual member names are FELTEP2 and FELTIAD.
   08.The SMP/E receive job references a non-existing FEKSEQAL job
      in the comments.
   09.The Integrated Debugger was enhanced to include support for
      COBOL V6 applications.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Fixed coding error.
   02.RAM load modules compiled with Endevor R14-R16 libraries
      have API issues when working with Endevor R17/R18. RAMs
      compiled with Endevor R12 libraries do not have this issue.
   03.(Unsupported) Method used to access a control block no
      longer works on z/OS 2.2.
   04.The allocation for the return parameters must match the
      expected return parameters in the RAM definitions. The RAM
      code has been changed to ensure that the proper storage is
      allocated for the number of return parameters specified in
      the RAM definitions.
   05."IBM APP DLIV FND" has been added to the existing product
      registration table as the first entry.
   06.SMP/E definitions adjusted
   07.FELSETUP updated to use correct member names.
   08.Comments are updated
   09.This fix provides complete support for debugging COBOL V6
      applications.
