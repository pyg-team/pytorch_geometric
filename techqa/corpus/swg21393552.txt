PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The WebSphere Adapter for Siebel Business Applications version 6.1. cannot connect to the Siebel system and throws a codepage error: "Code Page "8859_1" is not supported. 

ENVIRONMENT
Problem appeared on HP-UX B.11.31, WebSphere Process Server V6.1.2.2, WebSphere Adapter for Siebel Business Applications V6.1.0.2

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Siebel adapter is not able to connect to the Siebel EIS. In the system logs of the application server, the following error message emerges: 

<com.siebel.common.common.r><Error><ErrorCode>8211</ErrorCode> 
<ErrMsg>Code Page "8859_1" is not supported. 
Use "-encoding" option to change the file encoding. 
(SBL-JCA-328) </ErrMsg></Error>


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
A recommended workaround to the codepage problem sets a valid codepage for the entire JVM of the system. At the application server level, change the Generic JVM Arguments from the administrative console: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21393552&amp;aid=1]

Add the following JVM Arguments to the server: 
-Dclient.encoding.override=ISO8859-1 -Dfile.encoding=ISO8859-1

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21393552&amp;aid=2]

After setting the JVM codepage, you should be able to successfully connect to the Siebel System.

Note: The JVM setting above does not lead to any performance degradation on the WebSphere Process Server environment. This applies also to a clustered environment. 

Please be aware of that, according to the Oracle Javaâ„¢ Data Bean documentation, the codepage of the Siebel server and client must be the same.
