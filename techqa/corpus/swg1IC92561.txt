ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I needed to test the process of getting the acknowledgement
   status sent back to SAP.  Understand that in my case, I have
   only one company division converting over to SAP and the others
   are being converted later.  So some of my EDI data needs to go
   to SAP and the rest continues to go to my legacy system which
   is JDE.  All of my existing processes use PRCTRNIN, but at some
   point I will have to replace the calls to PRCTRNIN with calls
   to SAPIN.  I had to reflag the one acknowledgement that I have
   received so far for an SAP originated transaction because when
   it came in it was processed with PRCTRNIN.  No, problem - I
   reset the status to RN and then invoked SAPIN.  Since it was a
   997, I did not need to specify an application.  However, SAPIN
   does not accept *NONE as a value.  Why is that?  I ended up
   specifying an existing non-SAP app, and of course it wasn't
   processed because there were no transactions for that app in
   the comm queue, but I am curious to know why we can't use *NONE
   for the APPID?
