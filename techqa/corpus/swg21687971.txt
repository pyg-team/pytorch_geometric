 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 WebSphere Process Server Hypervisor Edition might be vulnerable to CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278 (shellshock) vulnerabilities in bash delivered by UNIX-based platforms. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6271 

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, which is caused by an error when evaluating specially crafted environment variables passed to it by the bash functionality. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system. 

CVSS: 

CVSS Base Score: 10.0 

CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96153 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/96153] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) 

 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7169 

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, which is caused by an incomplete fix related to malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to write to files and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7186 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7186] 

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by an out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS: 

CVSS Base Score: 10

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-7187 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7187]

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by an off-by-one-error when handling deeply nested flow control constructs. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS: 

CVSS Base Score: 10

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6277 

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by an incomplete fix related to the failure to properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability using attack vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS: 

CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) 

 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-6278 

DESCRIPTION: 

GNU Bash might allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, which is caused by an incomplete fix related to the parsing of user scripts. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause a denial of service. 

CVSS: 

CVSS Base Score: 10.0
