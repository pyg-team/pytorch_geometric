LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An entry is expected in the database table
   LSW_STORED_SYMBOL_TABLE, which might temporarily not be present
   and might cause the result set to be already closed when the
   transaction tries to access it.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that ensures a missing entry in the database table
   LSW_STORED_SYMBOL_TABLE is accepted under certain circumstances
   and is interpreted as an empty symbol table for the
   corresponding task is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3 and will be
   available in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12.
