APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A HTTPRequest node configured to use the localenvironment
   override "RequestURL" ignores the override if the RequestURL is
   invalid syntactically or if it has an uppercase protocol. It
   logs a
   BIP2211 in the trace but continues to use the URL set on the
   node. The node must generate an exception and roll back.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   HTTPRequest nodes ignore the "RequestURL" LocalEnvironment
   override if the RequestURL is invalid syntactically or if it has
   an uppercase protocol identifier such as "HTTP://" or
   "HTTPS://". the node logs a BIP2211 error message in the trace
   but continues to use the URL set on the node. The node should
   throw an exception.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0.  For details
