Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM® SDK for Node.js™ (CVE-2017-3737 CVE-2017-3738) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on December 7, 2017 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM SDK for Node.js. IBM SDK for Node.js has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID:CVE-2017-3737 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3737]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the \"error state\" mechanism when directly calling SSL_read() or SSL_write() for an SSL object after receiving a fatal error. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the decryption or encryption process and perform unauthorized actions.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136077]for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

CVEID: CVE-2017-3738 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738]
DESCRIPTION:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078]for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
