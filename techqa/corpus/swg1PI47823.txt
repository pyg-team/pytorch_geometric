   group role is defined with group name in lowercase.. as

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server Liberty Profile - Security           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In Liberty profile ignoreCase=true is   *
   *                      not honored for administrator-role      *
   *                      entries                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The authorization decision of the administrative role mapping
   table and the application role mapping  was not consisitent,
   because the administrative role mapping table did not take into
   account of the setting of ignoreCase of the active user
   registry. As a result, there was a possibility that the
   administrative role mapping table rejected the authorization
   request even if it should be granted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this fix, all of the authorization tables uses the same
   algorithm for authorization decision.
