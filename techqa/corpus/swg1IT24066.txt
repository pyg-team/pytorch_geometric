APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  On a system where applications are using message handles,
   operating system
   commands to measure memory use show that amqrmppa processes
   consume large amounts of memory.  This memory use increases over
   a period of
   time.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users of IBM MQ v7.5 who use message handles may be affected by
   this problem.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When getting a message using message handles some memory was
   allocated by the IBM MQ queue manager's channel pool process,
   which was not freed.  If this problem was not corrected then the
   system may have eventually run out of available memory.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ queue manager channel pool process code has been
   corrected so that memory that was previously leaked is now
   freed.
