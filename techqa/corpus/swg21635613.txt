2) Explain here below the main elements in use, and steps to follow, for a RFT test script to be played back on ITCAM for Tx Robotic agent.


ANSWER
A) ENVIRONMENT DETAILS
##########################
- Rational Functional Tester (RFT) Workbench (WB) software was installed on a 'Recorder' system, as well as ITCAM for Tx Rational Integration Support (RIS) package (Tivoli Rational Integration brings RFT plug-in used to export RFT scripts to ITCAM4Tx Application Management Console (t3) agent).
check above Matrix wiki to install right version of RFT and RIS 


- Robotic Response Time (t6) agent was installed on a 'Player' system, with (same version of RFT both recorded and player systems, it's a best practice) RFT version software installed as well, for playbacks.

B) MAIN STEPS
#############
On the 'Recorder' system: 
- record the Application Under Test (UAT) script with RFT WB on the 'recorder' system
- play it back manually and verify all is ok
- export the script using File -> export -> Other -> "ITCAM for Transactions" option

On the 'Player' system:
- start the ITCAM for Robotic Response Time agent service.


Using IBM Tivoli Monitoring Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP) GUI:
- start the Application Management Configuration Editor (AMCe) GUI from the TEP
- create a robotic profile under Profiles, select the RFT test script application, select the robotic agent to deploy the profile to, save these settings.

C) MAIN ELEMENTS AND FILES
#############################
On the Application Management Console (AMC/t3) agent that stores the RFT scripts :
Once the RFT <test> script has been exported/ uploaded from 'Recorder' RFT WB,
each script is stored on AMC system in <ITM_HOME>\kt1depot\T3\RFT\<script name>.zip

On the Robotic Response Time (RRT/t6) agent 'Player' system:
Once the robotic profile has been enabled with script(s) and application(s) to monitor,
each script is downloaded into <ITM_HOME>\kt1depot\T6\RFT\<script name>.zip
each script's element is extracted automatically into <ITM_HOME>\TMAITM6\app\RFT\scripts\<script name>\ directory. 

 


If playback occurs normally, some log files (.xml, .html files) are created for each script : 

for Robotic Response Time (RRT/t6) agent 'Player' system v7.3.0.1 (7.3 fp1) or later, look inside 

%ALLUSERSPROFILE% \ibm\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\RFT\<script name>\ directory 

 

Example : C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\ibm\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\RFT\RFT_calc_Script1
