PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Long-running import operations for large imports can fail if they exceed the defined session timeout period. Import operations include import to staging, analysis, preview, and sharing to the repository. 

SYMPTOM
A long-running import operation fails to complete successfully. The error displayed might be a general failure message that indicates an error with saving the results, such as this for the preview operation: 

 * 
 * com.ibm.mmi.exception.PreShareReviewFailedException: PreShareReview 1a6c9.cc2b8166.04p344r20.svlv2dt.8dl46q.j1e31324ejtmog6deuqutk00 failed
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * Caused by:
 * 
 * com.ascential.xmeta.exception.ServiceException: Error saving the given EObjects to the persistent store.
 * 
 * ...
 * 

Further stack-trace details, which can be found in the WebSphere Application Server system log, show additional details of the cause of the error. When a session expiration has caused the failure, exceptions such as these are found:  * Caused by: com.ascential.xmeta.persistence.PersistenceException: Can't get current session!
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * Caused by: com.ascential.xmeta.session.SessionException: Session expired. Cannot get session information.
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * Caused by: com.ascential.asb.util.security.SessionExpiredException: The session [E747EDEC-17D8-4FEE-A1BD-927088EB1EAC] has expired or was not found.


CAUSE
Inactivity of the user session causes the session to expire.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Analyze stack-trace details that are contained in the WebSphere Application Server system log (SystemOut.log or messages.log depending on version of WAS being used) at the time of the error.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Avoid session timeouts during managed or express imports by keeping the import wizard dialog open for the duration of the import process. The periodic status updates that are performed by the dialog keep the session alive. Alternately, if you are running an individual action that fails due to a session timeout, increase the global session timeout setting on the Administration tab of the InfoSphere Information Server Web console to a value that ensures the operation can complete before the session times out. See http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZJPZ_11.5.0/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.found.moz.wc.admin.doc/topics/t_wdisad_Setting_session_limits.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZJPZ_11.5.0/com.ibm.swg.im.iis.found.moz.wc.admin.doc/topics/t_wdisad_Setting_session_limits.html] for details on how to change this setting.
