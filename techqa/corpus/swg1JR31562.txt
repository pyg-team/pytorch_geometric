APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following link to "Business Process Choreographer Explorer
   settings" in WPS v6.1 INFOCENTER document explains the BPC
   Explorer settings can be edited.
   
   
   To view this administrative console page, click Servers >
   Clusters > cluster_name or Servers > Application servers >
   server_name, then under Business Integration, expand Business
   Process Choreographer, and click Explorer Configuration. To
   create a new explorer configuration, click Add. To view an
   existing configuration, click an instance name, or select an
   instance and "CLICK EDIT."
   
   
   No as such EDIT option in the bpc explorer configuration page
   to edit the settings. We cannot modify the explorer
   configurations and search result value through Administrative
   Console in current versions.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The below workaround to modify the BPC explorer search result
   limit value,
   
   Change the value of Parameter : maxListEntries from the web.xml
   of bpcexplorer.war web application.
   
   Path to web.xml, where the bpcexplorer web application resides
   in profile directory,
   
   <WPS_root>\profiles\<profile_name>\config\cells\<cellname>\appli
   cations\<bpc explorer configration name>.ear\deployments\<bpcexp
   lorer configration name>\bpcexplorer.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
   
   Here the <bpc explorer configration name> maybe (for example)
   BPCExplorer_WPSNode_servre1.
   
   
   Modify the value in <param-value> which just under the
   <param-name>maxListEntries</param-name>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Process Server 6.1.2.x  and        *
   *                 earlier versions users who have configured   *
   *                 Business Process Choreographer Explorer.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After configuring the Business          *
   *                      Process Choreographer Explorer, it is   *
   *                      not possible to use the                 *
   *                      administrative console to change the    *
   *                      value for "Explorer search result       *
   *                      limit".                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When the user navigates to the Business Process Choreographer
   Explorer configuration page using the administrative console
   (click Servers->Clusters->cluster_name or Servers->Application
   servers->server_name, then under Business Integration, expand
   Business Process Choreographer, click Explorer Configuration,
   then click on the name of the instance you want to modify) the
   field "Explorer search result limit" is read-only, which means
   that the user can't change the value that was set when the
   instance was configured. This prevents the customer from using
   the administrative console to tune this aspect of the
   performance of the Explorer's database queries from the
   default value  of 10000.
