        The DateTime stamp showed up in FEM as March 15, 2005 @
   1am.
   
   2.  DateTime property entered for February 15, 2005 @ midnight.
        The DateTime stamp showed up in FEM as February, 2005 @
   midnight.
   
   3.  DateTime property entered for April 15, 2005 @ midnight.
        The DateTime stamp showed up in FEM as April 15, 2005 @

   3 tests adding document from FEM for the year 2007 DateTime
   property:
   All the 3 months like the above were showing up @ midnight.
   
   Results from Workplace:
   For the year 2005, 2006, and 2007, all the DateTime property
   were showing up correctly.
   
   However, when adding a document from Workplace, the DateTime
   property was showing up as 1am in FEM but in Workplace it showed
   up as midnight.
   
   
   Actual Results:
   Incorrect time.
   
   Expected Results:
   Should be the same time that it was entered.
