QUESTION
 How to calculate the number of requests that an InfoSphere Information Services Director (ISD) operation can respond successfully in time 

ANSWER
The number of requests an ISD operation can handle needs depends on several factors including:

- Operation Queue Size
- Operation Timeout
- Request Limit
- Number of Job Instances
- Time it takes for a Job to process a request

These values should be tuned so the ISD operation can handle the maximum number of requests expected at a given time and also be able to process them before they time out. 

To understand how these values work together let's use an example. Let's say an operation has been deployed using these values:

- Operation Queue is set to 10
- Timeout is set to 3000 ms (3 secs) 
- Minimum job instances is set to 2
- Request limit is set to 3
- Job takes 1 second to process a request

With these values, this operation can hold up to 16 requests at a given time, 10 request waiting in the queue and 6 requests being processed by the jobs (3 calls in the job queue * 2 job instances ).

If the operation is expected to get more than 16 requests at any point in time then the values of these parameters need to be changed to accommodate that. For example, you can either increase the number of jobs, or the size of the operation queue. 

In addition to the number of requests you also need to consider the time it takes to process them. In this example the job takes 1 second to process one request. 2 jobs can process 2 requests in one second (since they run in parallel), and so we can consider an average of 0.5 secs per request. Therefore it will take 5 seconds to process 10 requests. Since the Timeout is set to 3 seconds, then we will likely have some requests timing out. To prevent this we should increase the Timeout to at least 5 seconds.
