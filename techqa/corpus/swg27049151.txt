Enhancements to the IBM Datacap clients and services 

Support for Thai language 

Added support for Thai language for the OCR activities. To complete OCR activities for this language, you can use the ocr_a actions. 
Currently, the following applications support Thai language: 
 * IBM Datacap Navigator 
 * Application Manager 
 * Datacap Studio

You can now OCR, Validate, Verify, and Export the Thai text. You can also add and edit DCO object names and variables with the Thai characters in Datacap Studio, and use common action libraries. 

IBM ECM role-based redactions 

Added a new role-based redactions feature. You can use the role-based redaction feature to hide specific sensitive information in a document or image. Also, you can use the new feature to: 
 * Import redaction reasons (requires IBM Content Navigator Version 3.0, or later) into a Datacap application as redaction template fields. Each template redaction field defines a class of sensitive information that can be searched for and redacted. 
 * Search the OCR results for sensitive data and automatically create redaction fields over those results. Deploy the RedactFields action in your application to create redaction fields over data that was located using Locate or DocumentAnalytics actions, or any other method. 
 * Manually create or edit redactions in the Verify task. Resize, move, or delete any existing redaction. 
 * Make redactions either opaque or transparent while viewing a page. 
 * Assign and view the reason code for redactions. The reason identifies the type of sensitive content; for example, Social Security Number. 
 * Export redactions together with the documents to IBM FileNet® P8. These redactions are securely burned-in opaque rectangles when displayed to normal users. Users with role-based permission to view specific redactions can make those rectangles transparent.


Added new action in the FileIO action library 

Added an enhancement is added to create a .zip file to store recognition results for every page of the document by using the ZipOcrResults action in the FileIO action library. 

Annotator Enhancements 

The ExtractText action supports AQL external dictionaries, and allows you to compile AQL annotators exported from the IBM InfoSphere® BigInsights web tools.

Known Issues and Limitations 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  * When you use the PDFFREDocumentToImage action to convert a PDF file, which contains invalid embedded fonts, to TIFF format, the action fails to convert the PDF file to TIFF format. 
 * In Datacap Desktop, if you use a virtual scan (vscan) task with the Start Batch Panel option enabled, Datacap Desktop shows an exception or hangs. 
 * When you log in to an application in IBM Content Navigator using the Google Chrome browser with higher versions, the image is shown in the virtual viewer, and not in applet viewer even though you set an applet viewer for the application in IBM Content Navigator. 
 * Documents with redactions can be exported to FileNet as single page TIF images. Multi-page documents are supported but each page in Datacap must have a separate TIF file. Datacap 9.1 does not allow redactions on PDF documents, multi-page TIFF images, or other types of image files for upload to FileNet.
