ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  â ˜In IBM Doors Next Generation (DNG), importing a CSV to update
   existing artifacts may result in an error if an attribute has
   been deleted from the project's properties.
   
   CRRRW7571E  You might not have permission to import an artifact
   type that is in the file, a row or resource might be locked by
   someone else, or the file might not meet the requirements to be
   imported. For example, one or more rows might contain a type
   that is not in the type system. Update the file, the type
   system, your user permissions, or all of these items. To learn
   more about the CSV format or spreadsheets and importing CSV
   files or spreadsheets, see the product documentation.
   Errors were received while importing the CSV file or
   spreadsheet:
   
   Validation Errors:
   Row Number: 1
   Error Message: Propagated exception; original message
   [ForbiddenException: CRRRS8663E This attribute definition is
   unknown:
   https://<server>:<port>/rm/types/_cr2tIXlPEeeWo4OrO9sNoA [https://<server>:<port>/rm/types/_cr2tIXlPEeeWo4OrO9sNoA]
   
   
   To Reproduce the behavior:
   
   Start with a project where an enumerated list attribute exists
   (for example: "CustomAttr1") and is associated with artifact
   type: "ArtifactType1" , and there are artifacts of
   ("ArtifactType1") that have values for this attribute.
   
   1. In Manage Project Properties, remove the enumerated list
   attribute "CustomAttr1" from the artifact type (ArtifactType1)
   and Save.
   
   2. In Manage Project Properties, delete the attribute
   ("CustomAttr1") from the Attributes tab.
   
   3. In Manage Project Properties, create a new enumberated list
   attribute "CustomAttr2" and add it to the same artifact type
   "ArtifactType1" and Save.
   
   4. Create a view in DNG that shows artifacts of artifact type:
   "ArtifactType1"
   
   5. In the view, include to display the column for the new
   attribute: "CustomAttr2"
   Note: No artifact should have a value for the new attribute:
   "CustomAttr2"
   
   6. Export the view to CSV
   
   7. In the csv file, update the column for the attribute:
   "CustomAttr2" for the artifacts and save
   
   8. Import the csv file into the DNG project, selecting to Update
   Existing Artifacts
   
   
   
   Expected Results:
   - The CSV import completes successfully and the artifacts are
   updated with a value for the new attribute.
   
   Actual Results:
   - After updating the CSV file with new values for the
   Attributes, the import process is failing due to Artifacts RDF
   still contains information about deleted Attributes previously
   configured.
   
   The error message references the URL of the deleted attribute.
