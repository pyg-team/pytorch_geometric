ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The extraction of a password-protected Excel email
   attachment using Content Search Services appears
   to succeed but actually extracting garbage from the
   document.  The garbage extracted ultimately caused
   the following error:
   
   <message>IQQI0005E The document with ID {id}
   cannot be indexed. Causes of the problem:
   IQQP0028E The XML document {id} cannot be parsed
   because its format is invalid.
   Error details: The entity name must immediately follow
   the '&amp;' in the entity reference.
   IQQG0020E org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The entity
   name must immediately follow the '&amp;' in the entity
   reference.
