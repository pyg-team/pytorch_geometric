ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Monitor Data Security panel in the administrative
   console, when
   you attempt to search for groups to add to a monitor model (via
   <monitor_model_name> > Groups > Search), the search may fail to
   return
   any groups.  This issue has been observed in certain customer
   environments; in these environments, the group search initiated
   via
   Security > Users and Groups > Manage Groups (standard WebSphere
   Application Server security) works correctly.

   ****************************************************************
   The underlying filter used for group search in the Monitor
   Data Security needs to be modelled after what is used by
   WebSphere Application Server (administrative console panels
   that provide group search capability).
   This issue will be resolved in future maintenance releases of
   WebSphere Business Monitor Version 7.0, IBM Business
   Monitor Version 7.5, and IBM Business Monitor Version 8.0.
