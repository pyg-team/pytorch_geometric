APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  During a virtual machine (VM) backup, the VM backup may not
   complete successfully due to the
   following errors:
   ANS0328E The specified objects failed the merge test.
   ANS1228E Sending of object 'VM_NAME' failed.
   ANS1907E An error occurred while trying to perform an object
   merge operation on the server.
   TSM Server will show:
   ANE4174E (ANE4985I Session: 113559, ANE4986I Node:
   MYNODENAME)  Full VM backup of VMware Virtual Machine
   'VM_NAME' failed with RC=45 mode=Incremental Forever -
   Incremental, target node name='MYNODENAME', data mover
   node name='MYNODENAME_DM'
   RC=45 is a merge error on the server.
   This problem will only occur on -mode=IFFULL and -mode=IFINCR
   Initial impact: HIGH
   Platforms affected: Windows & Linux
   Versions affected: 6.4, 7.1, 7.1.1
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Rename the filespace on the TSM Server for the VM.
   If you are running TSM server version 6.3.5.x or 7.1.1.x
   it is no longer possible to rename an existing VM filespace due
   to apar IC92869 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC92869]. The VM itself would need to be renamed so a new
   filespace is created on the TSM server.

 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments versions     *
   * 6.3, 6.4 and 7.1 running on all Microsoft Windows and Linux  *
   * x86_64 platforms                                             *

   * See ERROR DESCRIPTION                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * This issue is projected to be fixed in the Tivoli Storage    *
   * Manager Client on Windows and Linux x86_64  in levels 6.4.3  *
   * and 7.1.2                                                    *
   * Note 1: The Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) Client is a         *
   * prerequisite to using the Data Protection for VMware. In     *
   * Data Protection for VMware environments, the TSM Client is   *
   * also known as the data mover.                                *
   * Note 2: This is subject to change at the discretion of IBM.  *
