DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify you can access each RPC and AMM. 

1. ping each RPC and AMM. 

 2. ssh or telnet to each rpc and amm


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
After heartbeat has started on each host execute the following command on the Active Host. 

heartbeat_admin.sh --enable-nps (this tells NPS to be managed by Cluster services.)
NPS should start normally.
