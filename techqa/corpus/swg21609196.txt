QUESTION
 How to mark pages for deletion in Taskmaster Web Verify? 

ANSWER
Using Taskmaster Web Verify, it is possible to mark pages for deletion. Marking pages for deletion will not necessarily remove files from the batch folder nor the page nor document node from the page file, however both of those functions can be performed through application rules. Post-Verify tasks need some application logic to handle pages marked for deletion during Verify. 

aindex.aspx 

Aindex includes a "Remove" button to mark pages for deletion:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21609196&amp;aid=1]

This button is hidden by default. In order to show this button to operators, locate \Datacap\tmweb.net\Task\aindex.aspx on the Taskmaster Web server. Backup the original file, open aindex.aspx, and locate the following lines of code near the bottom of the file:
<!--
<a title="Remove DCO node" onclick="OnBtnRemove()" href=""><IMG src="images/bndel.gif" align="middle" border="0">Remove</a><BR/>
-->

Modify the code to only include the middle portion:
<a title="Remove DCO node" onclick="OnBtnRemove()" href=""><IMG src="images/bndel.gif" align="middle" border="0">Remove</a><BR/>

Save changes and open Taskmaster Web Verify to see changes.

When a page is first marked for deletion, a red bar will be displayed on the image:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21609196&amp;aid=2]

When a page has been previously marked for deletion and Remove is clicked, the red bar will not display on the image.



averify.aspx
The averify.aspx user interface does not natively include a mechanism for marking pages for deletion. To delete pages, you may be able to use an alternate task profile (AltTProfile) or else a drop-down list choice, the value of which could be handled in the successive task. There may be inherent limitations for AltTProfile within this context. Implementation of either is beyond the scope of this document.

imgEnter.aspx
Similar to averify, the imgEnter.aspx user interface does not natively include logic for marking pages for deletion. However, the web page supports both AltTProfile and dictionary fields. If using APT for testing, note that fields marked with a Position value of 0,0,0,0 like Routing_Instructions will not be displayed. Assign a valid run-time zone to see the field.

prelayout.aspx
Prelayout natively exposes a Batch Tree view where pages can be intuitively marked for deletion.

Here is an example of a page not marked for deletion:

Here is an example of a page marked for deletion:

Statuses
As described inside the Taskmaster application development guide [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020926], the IPS settings stored within the Verify task's settings file are used to mark pages or documents with specific numeric values. The first value inside the IPS list is used to assign it to a document marked for deletion. The second value inside the IPS list is used to assign it to a page marked for deletion.
