PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to know how to collect relevant troubleshooting data to help the IBM Support team fix an error in IBM CICS Explorer. You are receiving incorrect output, an error in a log, or an error in a pop-up from CICS Explorer on Microsoft Windows or Linux. The problem might be with one of the CICS Tools plug-ins for CICS Explorer. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting Support, then it will expedite the troubleshooting process and might save you time. 

SYMPTOM
The CICS Explorer or one of the CICS Tools plug-ins for CICS Explorer is experiencing one of the following types of problem: 

 * Incorrect output 
 * Error in pop-up 
 * Errors in the log 
 * Unable to connect to CICS system


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collect this MustGather data before contacting IBM Support:

 * Collecting general information for all problems
 * Collecting data for an Explorer error or incorrect output
 * Troubleshooting hints and tips
 * Exchanging data with IBM Support
 * 
 * Collect troubleshooting data for CICS products - Read first [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21208053]










Collecting general information for all problems

If you have already contacted IBM Support, you can continue on to the component-specific MustGather information. Otherwise, go to Collect troubleshooting data for CICS products - Read first [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21208053]. Back to top







 

Collecting data for an Explorer error or incorrect output

Before calling IBM support, gather the following documentation if you are receiving incorrect output, an error in the log, or an error in a pop-up from the CICS Explorer or any of the CICS Tools plug-ins for CICS Explorer. 

Required (MustGather) data: 

 * Use the CICS Explorer integrated capability to create a zip file containing service data:  1. Select Explorer > Trace > Collect Service Data from the Explorer menu.
       
       
    2. Select where to save the zip file.
   
   
   This procedure is explained in detail in the Help that accompanies CICS Explorer, under "Preparing error data for IBM service".


 * If you think CICS Explorer is showing an incorrect output, images of the CICS Explorer screen are useful. Do the following to create the screen shots as image files (bmp or jpg): 
   
   On Microsoft Windows:  1. Use the print screen or alt-print screen keys to create an image on the system clipboard.
       
       
    2. Open a graphics application (for example, Microsoft Paint) and select Edit > Paste to copy the clipboard into the application.
       
       
    3. Select File > Save as to create the file as a bmp or jpg.
   
   
   On Linux, the procedure might be simpler depending on the desktop and packages you are using. The print screen or alt-print screen keys typically bring up an application window that directly asks you where to save a file. In other cases, you might need to use steps similar to those provided for Microsoft Windows.
   
   
 * When getting an error, you should gather the following additional data which is dependent on the type of 'connection' you are using:  * For a CICSPlex SM connection, the complete joblog (including CICS TDQ output) of the Web User Interface (WUI) Server and CMAS that the WUI Server connects. 
      
      In the case of a bad response from the CICS management client interface (CMCI) or the CICSPlex SM application programming interface (API), for example FAILED or EXCEPTION response, the unformatted auxiliary trace datasets from the WUI Server and the CMAS that the WUI Server connects.
      
      
    * For a single server (SMSS) version in a stand-alone CICS region, the complete joblog (including TDQ output). 
      
      
    * For the other types of connections, the needed documentation could vary. For example for CICS Performance Analyzer for z/OS (CICS PA), a copy of the input file used on the request would be useful.

Troubleshooting hints and tips

Diagnostic tips: 

 * Search the [http://www.ibm.com/software/htp/cics/tserver/support/]CICS support site [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Other_Software/CICS_Transaction_Server] for known problems using symptoms like the message number and error codes. 
 * Search the CICS Explorer Help. This is where you will find CICS Explorer messages. They are not document in the IBM Knowledge Center for CICS. 
 * If you find a fix, see [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21380083]Ordering maintenance for the CICS and z/OS Explorer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21380083] for the options that are available for ordering CICS Explorer maintenance. 
 * Gather the documentation and work with the CICS Support team to resolve your problem.
