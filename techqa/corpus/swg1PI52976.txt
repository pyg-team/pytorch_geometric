APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You work with IBM SPSS release 23 FixPack 2 on a Macintosh OSX
   computer, e.g. 10.10.5.
   You run below syntax to open Catalog.sav and export it first as
   Excel xlsx file to a folder on your Mac and then export as Excel
   xls format:
   GET
   FILE='/Applications/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/23/Samples/English/catal
   og.sav'.
   DATASET NAME DataSet1 WINDOW=FRONT.
   
   SAVE TRANSLATE OUTFILE='/Users/SPSS/Desktop/catalog.xlsx'
     /TYPE=XLS
     /VERSION=12
     /MAP
     /REPLACE
     /FIELDNAMES
     /CELLS=VALUES.
   
   
   SAVE TRANSLATE OUTFILE='/Users/SPSS/Desktop/catalog.xls'
     /TYPE=XLS
     /VERSION=8
     /MAP
     /REPLACE
     /FIELDNAMES
     /CELLS=VALUES.
   
   After that you would like to open both files in MS Excel for Mac
   (or Windows) application.
   You notice, the XLS file is zero KB. However, on output log you
   get no error message after SAVE TRANSLATE and not any hint that
   the file was created successfully (or not successfully).
   If you open this file in Excel you get:
   
   "The file you are trying to open, is in a different format than
   specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not
   corrupted and is from a trusted soutce before opening the file.
   Do you want to open the file now?"
   If you click yes I see the file is empty.
   
   The XLSX export shows as successful on output viewer log but
   when you try to open Catalog.xlsx in Excel you may get:
   
   "Excel found unreadable content in catalog.xlsx. Do you want to
   recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source
   of this workbook click yes".
   When you click on Yes you get a file in Excel but maybe you
   think the file is not exported correctly (In fact, the file IS
   exported correctly as XLSX, no data is lost).
   Another error you can get when you open the XLSX file in Excel
   may be:
    "The file cannot be opened, because the file format or the file
   type name is invalid. Please control that the file is not
   damaged, and that the file type name is concordant with the file
   format"
