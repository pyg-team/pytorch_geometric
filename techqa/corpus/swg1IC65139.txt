APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In DPF environments, After granting quiesce_connect on the
   database to the user and even to its group, if the instance is
   quiesced as follows "db2 quiesce instance <instancename> group
   cmodprod immediate", connect to the database by setting DB2NODE
   to another partition would  fail with SQL20157N error though
   theuser has quiesce_connect authority.
   
    For example:
   db2 "grant quiesce_connect on database to user usr1"
   db2 "grant quiesce_connect on database to group grp1"
   db2 quiesce instance <instancename> group grp1 immediate
   
   As usr1:
   export DB2NODE=1
   db2 terminate
   db2 connect to <dbname>
   SQL20157N  User "usr1 " does not have the QUIESCE_CONNECT
   privilege. SQLSTATE=08004
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Invoke the quiesce command using the user option instead for
   every user belonging to the group.
   db2 quiesce instance <inst_name> user usr1 immediate
