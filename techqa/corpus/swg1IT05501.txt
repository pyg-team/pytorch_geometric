APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to connect WebSphere MQ Explorer to a remote
   queue manager via a SSL configuration using a Channel
   Definition table (AMQCLCHL.TAB) file;
   If FIPS Required is set to Yes in the MQ Explorer preferences,
   MQ Explorer fails to connect and a dialog is displayed showing:
   
   An unexpected error (2393) has occurred. (AMQ4999)
   Severity: 10 (Warning)
   Explanation: An unlisted error has occurred in the system while
   retrieving PCF data.
   Response: Try the operation again. If the error persists,
   examine the problem determination information to see if any
   details have been recorded.
   
   2393 = MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR
   This error occurs after connecting to the same queue manager
   with a direct connection configuration in the same MQ Explorer
   session.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  In MQ Explorer preferences, set the SSL Option: FIPS Required =
   No, or only use one conection method (direct or via CCDT) but
   do not try to use both for the same queue manager.
   
   This problem only occurs with MQ Explorer v8.0, v8.0.0.1;
   previous versions of MQ Explorer do not have this problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the IBM MQ Explorer version 8, who
   wish to connect to a remote queue manager using a client channel
   definition table (CCDT) while MQ Explorer is configured to run
   with the "SSL FIPS required" preference set to "Yes".
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows, Linux on x86-64, Linux on x86
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When the "SSL FIPS required" property is set to "Yes" in the MQ
   Explorer preference pages, this property should apply to all
   remote queue manager connections. Due to an omission in the
   object definitions, this update was not correctly applied to
   CCDT connections. This was true for both existing CCDT
   connections, and CCDT connections created after setting the "SSL
   FIPS required" property to "Yes".
   
   Due to this omission, the appropriate FIPS parameters were not
   passed to the underlying MQ libraries, and so were not used
   during the connection attempt. This would in turn cause a JSSE
   error (2393) to be reported, if an existing FIPS-compliant
   connection was already established by MQ Explorer to another
   queue manager. The same error is also reported when attempting
   to create a FIPS-compliant connection to another queue manager
   after creating a non-FIPS connection using a CCDT.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM MQ Explorer has been updated such that the "SSL FIPS
   required" is honored when creating a connection to a remote
   queue manager using a CCDT, and the appropriate FIPS parameters
   are passed to the underlying libraries.
   
   Additionally, the "SSL reset count" and "Peer name" properties
   can now be configured for CCDT connections, using the connection
   details settings in the same manner as for direct client
   connections, so that these parameters are also passed to the
   underlying MQ libraries.
