APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With the Portal Admin interface, in the "Manage portlets"
   panel, for a given locale, title and description can be deleted.
   This can also be achieved with XML Access import if the profile
   variable "delete.empty.portlet.locales" is set to "true".
   
   However, if the the portlet is exported and imported, then
   instead of the deleted title the original title from the web
   application is restored.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Without this fix, after updating the portlet, deleted locales
   must again be deleted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 10 (PI55632 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI55632]) for Portal
   8.5.0.0 available from Fix Central:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix provided with this APAR corrects this situation. In
   order to prevent unexpected side-effects, the profile variable
   "delete.empty.portlet.locales" must be set to "true" during
   XMLAccess export and import of the portlet.
   
   In this case, during XMLAccess export, for each deleted locale
   information of a portlet appropriate XML elements are exported
   which during import assure that the deleted locales are handled
   correctly.
