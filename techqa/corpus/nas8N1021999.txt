 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 ISC BIND is vulnerable to several security vulnerabilities. IBM i has addressed these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-3138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3138]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error related to the processing of control channel commands. By sending a specially crafted command, a remote attacker with access to the BIND control channel could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124518 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124518] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3136 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3136]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of query requests when using DNS64 with "break-dnssec yes" option. By sending a specially crafted DNS request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124516 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124516] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-3137 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3137]
DESCRIPTION: ISC BIND is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of a query response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records in an unusual order. By sending a specially crafted DNS response, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure.
CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124517 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/124517] for the current score
