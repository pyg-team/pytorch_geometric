ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has a specific userid that is not associated with a
   password. The userid is defined to the security manager to allow
   access without a password. DFHSN1105 is issued when the userid
   is already known to the US domain.
     DFHSNUS calls DFHSNTU for SIGNON_TERMINAL_USER. The security
   manager is called and the userid is signed on appropriately with
   good return codes. DFHUSAD is called for ADD_USER_WITH_PASSWORD.
   Within ADD_USER_PROCESSING, a check is made to determine if the
   userid is already known to the US domain by checking for an
   entry within the Directory Domain. When an entry is found to
   already exist, AUTHENTICATE_PASSWORD_IF_SUPPLIED is called.
   Within this routine, if the password existance bit is not on
   (usad_password_x) or bit usud_verify_no_password is not turned
   on from a previous add_user_with_password then usad_response =
   usad_exception and usad_reason = usad_password_required is set
   and DFHSN1105 is issued.

   ****************************************************************
   RACF exit ICHRIX01 is being used to allow a signon with a
   specific USERID where password checking is disabled.
   There has been a previous non-terminal DFHUSAD
   ADD_USER_WITHOUT_PASSWORD call for this USERID which created
   an entry in the CICS USD1 directory.
   Later on there is a DFHUSAD ADD_USER_WITH_PASSWORD for
   a non-terminal signon with the same USERID where no password
   is present.
   This gets rejected by DFHUSAD with an EXCEPTION of
   USAD_PASSWORD_REQUIRED. CICS raises this exception without
   first calling the external security manager.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  DFHUSAD has been changed so that an ADD_USER_WITH_PASSWORD
   is not automatically rejected with a USAD_PASSWORD_REQUIRED
   exception when no password is present.
   Instead, DFHUSAD will call external security domain to
   invoke the external security manager for this signon.
