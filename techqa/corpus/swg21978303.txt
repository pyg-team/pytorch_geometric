QUESTION
 Is it possible to configure JazzSM Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) to support the primary admin user existing both in the local built-in file-based repository AND in LDAP? 

CAUSE
It is typical for the primary admin user to remain in the local built-in file-based repository to allow for access to DASH if an external repository is unavailable. However, there may be cases where the same ID must exist in LDAP as well to comply with business security policies. The VMM component (Federated Repository) in Websphere requires uniqueness for uid and/or cn login properties. Non unique IDs cannot log into Websphere.

ANSWER
As a workaround, the filter "(!(uid=smadmin))" can be added to the PersonAccount entity in the DASH LDAP configuration. This can be done by editing the wimconfig.xml as follows:

1. Create a backup of the wimconfig.xml located in the <TIP Home>/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/wim/config/ directory. 

For example, make a copy of the file called wimconfig.xml.bak

2. Change the filter value for the PersonAccount entity from:

<config:ldapEntityTypes name="PersonAccount" searchFilter="">

To:

<config:ldapEntityTypes name="PersonAccount" searchFilter="(!(uid=smadmin))">

3. Save the file and restart DASH.
