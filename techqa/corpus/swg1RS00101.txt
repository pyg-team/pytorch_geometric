APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1) The section "WebSphere ILOG JRules V7.0.2 > Rule Studio >
   Executing rules > Concepts > Rule Execution Server > Rule
   Execution Server persistence layer" states the following in the
   first sentence:
   
   "The persistence layer provides a JDBC solution for a file
   system (file persistence) or database (database persistence)."
   
   This phrasing is ambiguous and can lead customers to believe
   that JDBC is required when using file persistence.
   
   This should be rephrased to something like "The persistence
   layer provides a solution for a file system (file persistence)
   and a JDBC solution for a database (database persistence)."
   
   2) For each application server-specific installation
   instructions, the table in the section "WebSphere ILOG JRules
   V7.0 Installing on Sun Application Server Enterprise Edition 8.2
   > Installing Rule Execution Server > Introduction" for SunAS
   8.2, "WebSphere ILOG JRules V7.0 Installing on [ Application
   Server ] > Installing Rule Execution Server > Installing Rule
   Execution Server on [ Application Server ] > Before you start"
   for all other application servers, is incorrect.
   
   All the rows and subrows for "Creating a data source and
   connection pool [on Application Server]" are checked in the
   "File" column, whereas they should be marked as non applicable
   
   Reference (RETAIN): PMR 01701,004,000
