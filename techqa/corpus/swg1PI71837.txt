ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  BigSQL 4.2 running on RHEL6, Auto-Analyze did not running after
   upgraded  BigInsights from 4.1 to 4.2 due to missing table
   (SYSTOOLS.ADMIN_TASK_LIST) that auto-analyze require.
   From the upgrade logs, this is the message we found:

   ADM6073W The table space "SYSTOOLSPACE" (ID "3") is configured

   at this time. In the interim the table space will use buffer
   pool ID "4099". The inactive buffer pool should become
   available at next database startup provided that the required
   memory is available.
   Running this SELECT command:
   SELECT * FROM SYSTOOLS.ADMINTASKS WHERE
   PROCEDURE_NAME='BIGSQL_CHECK_ANALYZE'
   The table does not exist. Here is the output:

   DRIVER=3.71.24
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue is during migration we did not create the ATS task to
   create the auto-analyze master task.
   
   As a workaround, customer can create the master admin task and
   assign a schedule as documented here:
