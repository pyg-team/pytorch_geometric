ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Robot doesn't handle the shared resource execution correctly, bu
   t rather just passes the absolute share path to Robot for execut
   ion. It works when RQM server is on a windows machine, when the
   shared resource is accessible as a UNC share from the adapter as
    well.

   This defect created based on the resolution from the
   Escalation RATLC01491776.
   This has been verified as a bug in the Robot adapter. It
   doesn't handle the shared resource execution correctly, but
   rather just passes the absolute share path to Robot for
   execution. It works when RQM server is on a windows machine,
   when the shared resource is accessible as a UNC share from
   the adapter as well.
   
   Instead the Robot adapter should download the shared
   resource from RQM and pass the downloaded file details to
   Robot.
   
   
   Robot Environment:
   
   Processor: Intel Pentium Dual Core 1.6 GHz
   Memory: 1280 MB RAM
   Operating System: Windows XP Service Pack2
   Robot Version: 7.0.2.02
   Browser: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13
   
   RQM Environment:
   
   Processor: Intel Pentium Dual Core 1.6 GHz
   Memory: 1280 MB RAM
   Operating System: Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 ? Kernel
   2.6.16.21-0.25 (sem o SP2)
   Browser: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13
   A JVM/JRE is the default of RQM 2.0
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  RQM 3.0 API supports download file and folders. This is a
   regular API and not internal API. Robot adapter now uses
   this API and fix will be available in Robot 7034
