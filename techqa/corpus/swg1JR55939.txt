APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We are periodically having issues with Information Analyzer
   locking xmeta tables and holding those locks for 8-10 hours and
   eventually bringing all work on the metadata environment to a
   halt.  I am providing an email from our DBA with the SQL
   holding the lock as well as Oracle DB information pertaining to
   the session.  I am also providing Version.xmls for the Engine,
   Services, and Client tiers - there are two Client versions - 1
   for our standard client used for MIBSvcs and the other for
   customer clients where we haven't been able to roll some of the
   11.5 rollup patches out.  This system was upgraded in place
   from 11.3.  I am also providing SystemOut and Err logs from the
   time period when the lock started and from the time when the
   system was basically unusable.  I am making this a Sev 1
   because when this occurs the system becomes unusable and is
   down.  Once we clear the lock it becomes available again
   however this is impacting our IA users and then other users
   every night.  Please see related PMR 18471 which is related to
   issues saving certain rules and system slowness that seems to
   again occur on a nightly basis.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Clear  blocked sessions as DB owner or restart WAS .
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Information Analyzer appears to be leaving locks on database,
   when a data rule definition is updated and saved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  11.5 ru3 has the fixe
