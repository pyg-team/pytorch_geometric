APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading a ClearCase MultiSite VOB server to version
   9.0.0.x
   Requests for Mastership directed to the replica on the upgraded
   server
   produce oplogs that cannot be imported into other replicas.
   
   On ClearCase 8.0 VOB servers they generate the error
   multitool: Error: Operation not supported: **unknown oplog op
   value (217)**.
   
   On ClearCase 9.0 VOB servers they generate the error
   multitool: Error: Operation "v4 chmaster" not valid while VOB
   feature level is less than 9.
   
   
   The VOB family feature level cannot be raised to 9 until all
   replica VOB servers have been upgraded to 9.0
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Upgrade all VOB servers to version 9.0
   Then raise the replica and VOB family feature levels to 9
