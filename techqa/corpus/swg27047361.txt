 * Log Analysis processes partial (headless) transactions despite user settings. 
 * Cannot run Log Analysis in Minimum Recovery Timestamp (MRT) mode with a specific log range if the SLR exists. 
 * Add warning message if Log Analysis detects activity for column organized tables. 
 * Recovery failed with error ARY0181E “Internal error in file db2/DB2Page.cpp line <number>.”
