ERROR DESCRIPTION

   red.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  For packages and files with type definitions, empty .c files
   are generated. The value of the property
   C_CG::File::GenerateSpecificationOnly is ignored.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following workarounds are available for this issue: For
   files, you can add one source artifact (specification), and
   this will prevent the generation of the implementation file.
   For packages, you must add an implementation source artifact
   and set the value of its CG::File::Generate property to
   False.
