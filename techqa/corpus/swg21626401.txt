PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Upon upgrading db2 from version 9.5.0.3 to 9.7.0.7, users are not able to login to the Maximo Admin UI 

SYMPTOM
The following types of error were seen in the SystemOut log when logging in to the Maximo Admin UI after the db2 upgrade:

A. com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.EntityNotFoundException: CWWIM4527E The 
LDAP entry 'ou=SWG,o=IBM,c=US' was not found: 
'javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: [LDAP: error code 32 - No Such 
Object]; remaining name 'ou=SWG,o=IBM,c=US'; resolved object 
com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@6f076f07'. 

B. [1/10/13 19:33:04:157 EST] 00000036 SystemOut O [TpmUIThreadPool : 
0][ERROR][SR ] BMXAA0035E - The user name UNAUTHENTICATED is not 
recognized. Please contact your system administrator. 
psdi.util.MXAccessException: BMXAA0035E - The user name UNAUTHENTICATED 
is not recognized. Please contact your system administrator. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The client has two LDAP repositories configured in WAS: local IBM Tivoli Directory Server (ITDS) and Microsoft Windows Active Directory MSAD. 

Upon experiencing the error

om.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.EntityNotFoundException: CWWIM4527E The 
LDAP entry 'ou=SWG,o=IBM,c=US' was not found: 
'javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: [LDAP: error code 32 - No Such 
Object]; remaining name 'ou=SWG,o=IBM,c=US'; resolved object 
com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@6f076f07'. 

they disabled WAS global security by modifying the security.xml file, restarted the application, 
and then logged in to WAS console and deleted the local IBM Tivoli Directory Server from the federated repository list. After this, they re-enabled WAS global security and restarted the application. 

This resolved the initial problem, but then client started seeing another error:

[1/10/13 19:33:04:157 EST] 00000036 SystemOut O [TpmUIThreadPool : 
0][ERROR][SR ] BMXAA0035E - The user name UNAUTHENTICATED is not 
recognized. Please contact your system administrator. 
psdi.util.MXAccessException: BMXAA0035E - The user name UNAUTHENTICATED 
is not recognized. Please contact your system administrator. 

To correct this error, the client disabled WAS security from the WAS console UI, restarted the deployment manager, the Nodeagent and the MXServer from the command line. Following that, they re-enabled WAS security and restarted the application from the command line. This resolved the situation and users were once again able to login to the Maximo Admin UI.
