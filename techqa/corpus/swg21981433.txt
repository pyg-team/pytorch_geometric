 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM SDK for Node.js in IBM Bluemix are affected by a HTTP bearer token leak in the npm package management tool and two denial of service vulnerabilities in modules used by the npm package management tool. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2016-3956 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3956]
Description: npm could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the unintentional leakage of bearer tokens from the command-line interface. By setting up an HTTP server and collecting token information, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to impersonate the user and do anything the owner of the information could, including
publishing new versions of packages.
CVSS Base Score: 9.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112153 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112153] for more information
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID:CVE-2016-2515 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2515]
DESCRIPTION:Node.js hawk is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the regular expression implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an overly long header or URI to cause the application to hang.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110819 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110819]for the current score

CVEID:CVE-2016-2537 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2537]
DESCRIPTION:Node.js is-my-json-valid is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the regular expression implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a regular expression to block the event loop and cause the application to hang.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110870 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/110870]for the current score

The hawk and is-my-json-valid modules included in IBM SDK for Node.js are bundled dependencies of the Node Package Manager (npm). These module instances are not normally exposed to end users of IBM SDK for Node.js.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
These vulnerabilities affect all versions up to and including IBM SDK for Node.js v1.1.0.20 and v1.2.0.10 and v4.4.1.0 corresponding to open-source version v0.10.42, v0.12.12 and v4.4.1, respectively.

To check which version of the Node.js runtime runtime your Bluemix application is using, navigate to the "Files" menu item for your application through the Bluemix UI. In the "logs" directory, check the "staging_task.log". 

You can also find this file through the command-line Cloud Foundry client by running the following command:

cf files <appname> logs/staging_task.log

Look for the following lines:

-----> IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack _______

If the Node.js engine version is not v0.10.44, v0.12.13 or v4.4.2, your application may be vulnerable.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The fixes for these vulnerabilities are included in IBM SDK for Node.js v1.1.1.0, v1.2.0.11, v4.4.2.0 and subsequent releases.

To upgrade to the latest version of the Node.js runtime, please specify the latest Node.js runtime in your package.json file for your application:

"engines": {
"node": ">=0.10.44"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=0.12.13"
},
or 
"engines": {
"node": ">=4.4.2"
},

You will then need to restage (or re-push) your application using the IBM SDK for Node.js Buildpack v3.3.
