Title: IBM Toolbox JDBC Driver Issues a Commit When Processing setAutocommit(true) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Toolbox for Java JDBC driver issues a commit to complete any pending transactions when the setAutoCommit(true) function is called. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The IBM Toolbox for Java JDBC driver implementation of the setAutoCommit(true) method issues a commit, if needed. It will also report the following warning: 

SQLWarning: reason(The active transaction was committed.) SQLstate(01H30) vendor code(-99999)

This differs slightly from the Java specification. The Java specification states: When auto-commit is disabled, the user must call either the commit or rollback method explicitly to end a transaction. The behavior difference may mask application errors. For example, applications that do not issue a rollback or commit will have the work committed rather than receive an error.

Note: The Native JDBC driver also behaves in the same manner.
