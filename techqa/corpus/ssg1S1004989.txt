5. CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1544 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1544]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free error in the PK11_ImportCert() function when adding NSSCertificate structures. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

6. CVE-ID: CVE-2014-1545 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1545]

DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds write error in the sprintf and console functions. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.
Affected Versions: Mozilla Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) before 4.10.6
CVSS Base Score: 10.0 / 9.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93715 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/93715] for the current score
