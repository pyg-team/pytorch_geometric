Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in IBM WebSphere Application Server affects WebSphere Process Server and WebSphere Process Server Hypervisor Editions (CVE-2015-0138) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The â€œFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere Application Server Full Profile (and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition) that is used by WebSphere Process Server (and WebSphere Process Server Hypervisor Editions). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
