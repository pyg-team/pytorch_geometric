Title: IBM Cannot customize workflows for lifecycles in Rational Asset Manager because Rational Team Concert client and server cannot connect - United States

Text:
RN7.5; RN7.5.0.2; RN7.5.0.1; SRX; cannot connect to server; cannot customize workflows TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 To customize workflows for lifecycles in IBM Rational Asset Manager, the included IBM Rational Team Concert server must connect to a Rational Team Concert Eclipse client. If you use a Rational Team Concert V2.0.0.2 Eclipse client to connect to the Rational Team Concert server, the connection might work but then fail, and error messages are displayed. 

SYMPTOM
The messages might be like these messages: 

 * DSRA1300E: Feature is not implemented: javax.sql.PooledConnection.addStatementEventListener 
 * DSRA8230W: The application server is unable to determine if a transaction should be resolved because data source custom property nonTransactionalDataSource is configured but data source custom property commitOrRollbackOnCleanup is not configured
   
   In a typical SQL Server installation on IBM WebSphere Application Server V7, you might see the DSRA1300E message several times. The message is displayed every time a new connection to the SQL Server database is made. However, if you see a high number of these messages, the database connections are not being shared and are not being returned to WebSphere Application Server. 

ENVIRONMENT
This issue occurs in an environment that uses SQL Server 2008, WebSphere Application Server V7, and the Rational Team Concert server in Rational Asset Manager V7.5.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


 1. In the Rational Team Concert V2.0.0.2 Eclipse client, make sure that the repository connection is specified. For example: https://hostname_of_rtc_server:9443/jazz 
 2. 
 3. In the WebSphere Application Server administration console, add the defaultConnectionTypeOverride property, and set the value to unshared. If you are using the embedded version of WebSphere Application Server, you can add the property in the resources.xml file.
