QUESTION
 How do you configure the SiteProtector Web Server service to run as a local user as opposed to the default setting of Local System? 

ANSWER
The user account you wish to start the SiteProtector WebServer will need the following access rights to the directories under \Program Files\SiteProtector\Application Server\Webserver\IHS:


 * \conf - Read
   
 * \conf\ssl.key - Read
   
 * \htdocs - Read&Execute, List Folder Contents
   
 * \htdocs\XPU - Read, Write(Other permissions may get inherited from \htdocs)
   
 * \logs - Read, Write, List Folder Contents
   
 * \bin - Read, Execute, List Folder Contents


Once these permissions have been given, ensure your user has the permission Log on as a service which should automatically be added when changing the Log On As option in the properties of the service itself. If it is not automatically added it can be manually added via the Local Security Policy applet within the Control Panel.
