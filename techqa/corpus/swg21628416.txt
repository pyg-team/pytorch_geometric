QUESTION
 How can I isolate an Authentication Service failure to either an operational or authentication failure? 

ANSWER
 

ISOLATING A PROBLEM TO AN AUTHENTICATION SERVICE OPERATIONAL FAILURE
 Authentication Service operational (runtime) failures refer to configuration, installation, or internal server error problems that the Authentication Service encounters while it processes an Authentication Service client's request. Errors are logged to the Jazz for Service Management WebSphere application server profile's SystemOut.log file, and a fault is returned in the response to the Authentication Service client. The fault information is then logged by the application that embeds the Authentication Service client, referred to as the Authentication Service client application.

The Authentication Service client application might log an error that indicates that the Authentication Service responded with a fault reason of “(500)Internal Server Error”, for example:

ERROR: login failed:CTGES0039E The Authentication Client received a fault in the response from the Authentication Service indicating that the authentication request failed because of an HTTP error. This indicates a possible configuration problem on the Authentication Client, such as an invalid Authentication Service URL. The fault Reason should provide more information about the problem. Fault CodeLocalPart: "HTTP". Fault Reason: "(500)Internal Server Error". Fault DetailCode: "500".

You can check the status and validity of the Authentication Service configuration, collect data for the Authentication Service, and send to IBM Support.

ISOLATING A PROBLEM TO AN AUTHENTICATION SERVICE AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
 Authentication Service authentication failures refer to requests that the Jazz for Service Management application server rejects because the end user identification information, such as the user name/password or the LTPA token, is not valid.

If the user name/password authentication fails, the end user entered an ID or password that was not recognized by the Jazz for Service Management application server's LDAP federated repository, which was configured to use a central LDAP user registry.

If single sign-on (SSO) fails unexpectedly, the end users might see extraneous login prompts when they traverse across SSO-enabled applications. This problem might be caused by:

 * The LTPA token might have expired. The default expiration is 2 hours. 
 * The LTPA token might have been issued by an application server that is expected to participate in SSO with the Authentication Service, but the LTPA keys were not synchronized correctly between the participating application servers.
 * The LTPA token might have been issued by an application server on which the LPTA token timeout value has not been synchronized with the Jazz for Service Management application server. This means that the LTPA token might incorrectly expire before the actual timeout has been reached.
 *  A browser request might contain more than one LTPA token in its cookie header, and some LTPA tokens might be set by an application server that is not participating in SSO with the Authentication Service. In this case, the authentication failure is expected and can be ignored. 

In the event of an LTPA token validation failure, the Authentication Service client application should attempt to authenticate additional LTPA tokens that are provided by the browser. If there are no valid LTPA tokens, then the Authentication Service client application should prompt the end user to log in.

If the end-user or synchronization problems have been investigated and resolved, and there is still an authentication error, then collect data for the Authentication Service and send to IBM Support.
