ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer tried to test sample map for WebSphere FTP Adapter
   in WTX8.
   2.0.4 on Windows platform, but he encountered following
   exception:
   java.util.MissingResourceException:
   java.util.MissingResourceException:
   Can't find resource for bundle
   
   The error occurred on Japanese locale. The sample works
   flawlessly on
   English and Chinese locales. After investigating the issue,
   adapter L3
   stated the problem is because it is unable to find the
   LogMessages.properties for Japanese locale. Please refer to the
   response
   from adapter L3 on page 83, and add your comments to why
   resource bundle
   for Japanese is not getting loaded. Thanks.
   
   
   From AFC L3:
   ===-===
   I checked AFC code, and found LogMessages_ja.properties existed.
   This
   exception was caused by
   com.ibm.j2ca.extension.logging.internal.LogRecordFactory class.
   ===-===
