 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL that were reported on June 5, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project (CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-0198, CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2014-0076). 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0224 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, which is caused by the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. A remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted handshake to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt and modify traffic. 

CVSS Base Score: 5.8
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93586 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93586] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0221 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0221]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by a recursion error in the DTLS client. By sending an invalid DTLS handshake, a remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93587 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93587] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)


CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0195]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. By sending invalid DTLS packet fragments, a remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability to overrun the client or server and execute arbitrary code on a DTLS client or server.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93588 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93588] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0198 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0198]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the do_ssl3_write() function. If SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, a remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93000 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93000] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2010-5298 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-5298]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by a race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function. If SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, an attacker might exploit this vulnerability using an SSL connection in a multi-threaded environment to inject data into an SSL stream and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92632 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92632] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-3470 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3470]

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, which is caused by the implementation of anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93589 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/93589] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) 

CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0076 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0076] 

DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL might allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, which is caused by an implementation error in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). An attacker might exploit this vulnerability using the FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack to recover ECDSA nonces. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91990]

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SmartCloud Provisioning V2.3 and V2.3.0 Fix Pack 1

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The only component of SmartCloud Provisioning that is vulnerable to these CVEs is the Image Construction and Composition Tool bundle named "Enablement Bundle for Virtual Applications and System Plugins on Windows."

It is requested that you remove this bundle from the Image Construction and Composition Tool.

This bundle is not automatically included in images that are extended using the Image Construction and Composition Tool. The bundle is not needed for any of the officially supported IBM SmartCloud Provisioning functions.
