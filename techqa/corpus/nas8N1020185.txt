Support Extension Offering, if necessary: 
IBM WebSphere Application Server recognizes that there might be unique situations where a Client is not able to migrate to a supported product version prior to an End of Support date. Application Server may, at its discretion, extend customer technical support and defect support for a withdrawn release. Extended support for a product will be considered and provided on an individual Client basis. Information on how to pursue requesting and purchasing a Support Extension can be found in the IBM WebSphere Application Server Support Extension technote.
