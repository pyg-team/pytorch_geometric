APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: JdbcSQLException: General error:
   java.lang.RuntimeException: try to add a record twice pos:0 i:0
   Calculation involving addition, multiple right shifts and
   multiplication results in 0 always.
   .
   
   This problem may manifest itself as an infinite loop while
   matching a Pattern. A common traceback would look like:
   
   java/util/regex/Pattern$BnM.match   Pattern.java:4974
   java/util/regex/Matcher.search      Matcher.java:1116
   java/util/regex/Matcher.find        Matcher.java:546
   java/util/regex/Matcher.replaceAll  Matcher.java:825
   java/lang/String.replaceAll         String.java:1572
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  -Xjit:disableTreeSimplification
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Calculation involving addition, multiple right shifts and
   multiplication results in 0 always because of a bug in
   TreeSimplification optimization.
   This can result in incorrect results or unexpected exceptions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   6.0.0 SR7
   5.0.0 SR12
   .
   JIT has been updated to handle the scenario correctly and ensure
   right shift is done by correct number of bits.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20091117 or later
