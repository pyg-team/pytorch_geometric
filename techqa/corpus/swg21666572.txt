Text:
ICC Web Application; Websphere; certificates; SSL; isAlive.jsp; servlet; NullPointerException TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The attempted verification of the https: //<web_application_host>:11443/AFUWeb/isAlive.jsp URL after installation and configuration of IBM Content Collector (ICC) Web Application fails with a Null Pointer Exception. 

SYMPTOM
The exception; 

00000080 ServletWrappe E com.ibm.ws. 
webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service SRVE0068E: An exception was 
thrown by one of the service methods of the servlet [/isAlive.jsp] in 
application [afu_web]. Exception created : [java.lang. 
NullPointerException 


occurs when trying to verify the ICC Web Application configuration with the isAlive.jsp URL packaged with the ICC Web Application.


CAUSE
This issue is likely due to misconfigured Websphere certificates for external Websphere Application Server (WAS) and ICC Web Application. 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Verify that the Websphere Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates and ICC Web Application have been issued, and check if they are signed and issued to the correct URLs.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the certificates are invalid, remove the existing certificates from Websphere and ICC Web Application, reissue new, correctly configured certificates and re-import them into Websphere and ICC Web Application. This should solve the problem and the isAlive.jsp URL should return the expected results.
