QUESTION
 Why are my added Workflow buttons now appearing in a dropdown and how do I get them to appear in the toolbar next to each other? 

ANSWER
In 6.2.3 the functionality for added workflow buttons was changed. Any added buttons will appear in a drop down after the first two are displayed next to each other. This is working by design, but some users do not want to have this occur.
Here are the steps to make the work flow button appear in the toolbar side by side without the dropdown.

To make this change you need to modify the library.xml file. 

Launch App Designer and from the Select Action menu select Export System
XML 

Select the LIBRARY.XML file and save it to your desktop. 
Open the file with Word Pad or another text editor. 

Find the line: 
< 
dynamictoolbar id="workflowbuttons" label="Workflow" 
mboname="wfapptoolbar" 
npmboname="wftoolbar" align="left" keyattribute="processname" 
mxevent="ROUTEWF" 
/> 

add visibleicons="5" so that the end result is: 

<dynamictoolbar id="workflowbuttons" label="Workflow" 
mboname="wfapptoolbar" 
npmboname="wftoolbar" align="left" keyattribute="processname" 
mxevent="ROUTEWF" 
visibleicons="5"/> 

Save the file. 

Go back to App Designer and import your modified LIBRARY.XML file. 

In the example above the visible iconms was set to 5, you may need a higher or lower number to fit your specific needs.
