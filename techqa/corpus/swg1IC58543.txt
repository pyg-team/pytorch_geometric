APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WebSphere MQ Version 7 Java and Java Message Service (JMS)
   clients configured to share channel connections may not share
   the same connection if multiple connection attempts are
   attempted concurrently. This can result in multiple channel
   connections with a low conversation count.
   
   Also, if shared connections are being created and closed at the
   same time, it is possible that a connection attempt will return
   with either a 2009 (MQRC_CONNECTION_BROKEN) or 2059
   (MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE) error.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects WebSphere MQ Version 7 Java and JMS users
   who utilise shared connections.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows) +Java
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   There is a small timing window when a connection is created
   where it is not available to be shared. This results in the
   second connection attempt ignoring the connection in the process
   of being established, and could result in a new channel
   connection being created.
   
   A similar problem exists when connections are being closed. If a
   new connection attempt is made when the final conversation is
   being closed on a connection, it is possible that the channel
   connection is closed before the new connection attempt
   completes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The connection sharing code has been updated to wait for
   any "in-progress" connection attempt to complete, if no other
   connection is suitable for sharing.
   
   A similar change has been made to the connection close code to
   wait if the last conversation is being closed, and there is a
   connection attempt in progress.
