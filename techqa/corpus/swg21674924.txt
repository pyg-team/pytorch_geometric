QUESTION
 How do I change the default 'fit content by' behaviour of Daeja viewer in IBM Content Navigator, to fit content by height or width? 

ANSWER
In Content Navigator v2.0.2 

In the ..navigator.war/applets/filenetViewer_properties.jsp file, set the value of the parameter 'scale' as follows 

To fit content by width, specify - scale: "ftow",
To fit content by height, specify - scale: "ftoh",

Here's another way to modify the behaviour: 

 * make the same changes above to the filenetViewer_properties.jsp under ECMClient\configure\explodedformat\navigator\applets folder. 
 * Rebuild and redeploy the ear file. 
 * Restart the application server


Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.  

In Content Navigator v2.0.3 

The same parameter-value pair mentioned above can be added in the Additional Settings section of the Daeja ViewONE panel, of the admin desktop. Add the parameter-value pair to the Additional Settings section of 

 * the Professional tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Professional viewer 
 * the Virtual tab for modifying the behaviour of the Daeja Virtual viewer.


Click New in the Additional Settings section to add the parameter-value pair. Save the changes and they should get picked up when the viewer is re-launched.
