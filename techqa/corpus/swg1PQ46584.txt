APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Module EQQFJKRL tried to load module IEANTRT, but its CDE
   use count already reached the higher limit (X'7FFF').
   EQQFJKRL and a lot of Datastore modules does not contain
   the DELETE for IEANTRT, so the use count is never decremented,
   causing this abend.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All OPC users of the Data Store function.    *

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: OPC gets an  ABEND 906 RC=08, with      *
   *                      the following message:                  *
   *                      CSV002I REQUESTS FOR MODULE IEANTRT     *
   *                              EXCEED MAXIMUM USE COUNT        *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY THE PTF FIXING THIS APAR               *
   ****************************************************************
   The Abend 906  occurs  because  the  CDE (contents directory
   element) use count for a  module has reached value 7FFF, the
   higher limit.
   From the dump analysis it  is clear that the involved module
   is IEANTRT, loaded by EQQFJKRL.
   This module does not execute a DELETE for IEANTRT at the end,
   and this behavior causes the counter growing.
   Moreover, in all the other Datastore modules the  delete  for
   IEANTRT is missing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  The DataStore code change to handle the missing delete for
   the IEANTRT module will be include in the next OPC release.
