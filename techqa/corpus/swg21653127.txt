PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Initial error when running the FP install of the Tivoli Integrated Portal:
FAILURE: The overall installation fails. Check /TIPFPInstaller-00.log. Errors in the install log show the WebSphereUPDI didn't install, which was caused by a missing xlm file. 

SYMPTOM

In the <TIP_HOME>/WebSphereUndateInstallerV7/logs/log.txt: 

(Oct 11, 2013 2:19:19 PM), Install, com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.InstallNIFPackage, err, /aix/TivIntProILMT/2.2.0-TIV-TIP-AIXPPC64-FP0007/cdimage.fixpack/COI/PackageSteps/WebSphereUPDI/FILES/7.0.0.19-WS-UPDI-AixPPC64/UpdateInstaller/updi.primary.pak/repository/nif.componentmap.primary/properties/version/nif/componentmaps/componentmap.primary.xml (No such file or directory) 

Note: This exact wording of this error will vary depending on the platform and name of the CDIMAGE, the important aspect to note is the missing file on the cdimage, copied over from the Windows environment.


CAUSE
Primary cause of the install failure was the missing file: componentmap.primary.xml in the cd image. Because of a problem when transferring the unzipped directory structure from the Windows to UNIX server, the xlm file was not copied over.
The software doing the transfer issued a warning message "file name too long" .


ENVIRONMENT
Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.x installation on any UNIX platform



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Refer to the original zip downloaded from IBM to determine if the file listed as missing exists. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Remove the existing <TIP_HOME>/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7 directory. 

 2) Unzip the cdimage on the server where you are going to install the software to confirm the file and/or directory tagged as missing, exists on the original cdimage. 

 3) Reinstall the TIP Fixpack if the missing file exists.
