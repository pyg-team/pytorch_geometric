ABSTRACT
 IBM WebSphere Application Server provides connection pooling for Java™ Database Connectivity (JDBC™), Java Message Service (JMS™), and Enterprise Information System (EIS) connections. This session will focus on understanding the core principles of Connection Pooling for backend resources.

Ask the Experts session 
25 September 2014 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EDT 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:01 General introduction 03:02 Technical introduction 04:15 What is the difference between shared and unshared connections? 09:21 What are the causes and resolution steps for ConnectionWaitTimeoutExceptions (J2CA0045E)? 14:28 How can we avoid and resolve StaleConnectionExceptions(SCE)? 20:24 What is the impact and resolution steps for addressing long running SQL queries? 27:59 How can we configure a WebSphere Application Server data source to work with database failover? 34:32 How to calculate the total connection in the cluster setting. Assume that there is a cluster with 2 JVM™s and with default connection pool ( 10 connections) ? 35:26 What is the co-relation between web container threads, number of connections and the connections that the database can accept? 36:32 What is the recommended connection pool? What is the application criteria needed to test to decide that? 37:20 How can we detect if a group of connections over a CISC are being blocked? 39:00 What commands would show up in tne WebSphere Application Server Tuning Toolkit? 40:57 How do you monitor pool size against PMI? 42:01 If the loadbalance is off on JDBC, how does that work? 43:11 For the two DB servers defined with drivers for Loadbalancing,lets say there is a network connectivity issue with one of them. Will failover mechanism wait for firewall timeout to kick on to route all traffic to second db address? How long will it wait before throwing that exception? 44:27 When working with a Oracle RAC. Is the order of the servers in the connection url significant? We are experiencing problems with a Oracle Cluster in two CPDs, one online and the other offline 45:42 Does the connection pool maintain affinity, in that, does it try to connect to the same DB member, while configuring for Oracle RAC? 46:51 Is there a way for us to be able to restart our app servers before they hang? 47:44 Summary 48:40 Closing remarks 48:59 End of Call
