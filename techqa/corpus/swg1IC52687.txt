APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customers using runmqckm or amqtcert on Windows systems may
   find that they are unable to migrate or import some SSL
   certificates when WMQ 6.0.2.1 is installed.
   
   The most likely error message is "the specified database has
   been corrupted", for a certificate which can be imported
   using a version of WMQ prior to 6.0.2.1.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Customers using WMQ 6.0.2.1 for Windows who need to import or
   migrate certificates using keys over a certain size.
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   WMQ 6.0.2.1 for Windows uses a Java runtime environment to run
   the GSkit SSL certificate administration commands (amqtcert,
   runmqckm/gsk7cmd). The Java runtime has some JCE policy files
   which control what strength of cryptography is permitted for use
   with GSkit administration commands.
   
   6.0.2.1 erroneously shipped an incorrect set of JCE policy
   files. Instead of shipping the unlimited strength files (as with
   previous fixpacks), only the standard files were shipped. This
   prevents certain certificates with large keys from being
   imported or migrated.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WMQ for Windows has been changed such that the correct policy
   files will be shipped in future fixpacks. Meanwhile, 6.0.2.1
   users affected by this issue may use the following work-around:
   
      1. Download the unrestricted Java policy files (or obtain
   them from a WMQ 6 version before 6.0.2.1). The relevant files
   are local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar and they are
   installed by default in C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere
   MQ\gskit\jre\lib\security
   
      2. Replace the two 6.0.2.1 gskit\jre\lib\security policy
   files with the unrestricted ones obtained in step 1.
   
   The certificate administration command will then work the same
   as in previous versions.
