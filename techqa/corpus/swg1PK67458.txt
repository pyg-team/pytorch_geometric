APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While using the Web Services wizard to create a WAS51 JAX-RPC
   web services client project from
   a WSDL file, the web services Generate Client wizard failed with
   IWAB0014E Unexpected exception occurred.
   
   The proxy for WASv5.1 web service was not able to generated.
   WAS51 wsdl2java fails due to a name collision problem in the
   WSDL file.
   Specifically ,a name collision between the complex type name and
   the
   service name.  In this example where both names are "PNInfo":
   
   <xsd:complexType name="PNInfo"> and <wsdl:service name="PNInfo">
   
   The two PNInfo.java
   (com.cnh.ebom. and com.cnh.ebom.icp.service.)
   were in conflict.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A simple WORKAROUND, assuming you own the WSDL file,
   would be to change the Service name in the example from
   PNinfo to something else, such as PNInfoService.
   That is, change <wsdl:service name="PNInfo"> to
   <wsdl:service name="PNInfoService">
   and regenerate the web service,
   This workaround assumes you have control over the WSDL for this
   service
   and its is not already  used in production as is.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of WebSphere Application Server   *
   *                  Toolkit v6.1.1 and Rational Application     *
   *                  Developer v7.0                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The webservice Proxy generation fails   *
   *                      with a NullPointerException due to the  *
   *                      service name and complex type name      *
   *                      being the same in the WSDL.             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   If a WSDL contains a service that has the same name as a
   complex type then the JAX-RPC webservice proxy generation will
   fail with a NullPointerException.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The error was happening because the complex type name and
   service name were being used directly from the WSDL when it
   should come from the JAX-RPC mapping file since the underlying
   WAS webservice emitter will change the names.
