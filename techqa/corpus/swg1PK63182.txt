APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the sas.client.props configuration file the Quality of
   Protection property or in the left hand side of Admin Console
   navigation the SSL Configuration settings, the attribute
   "Security Level" can be set to Low, Medium, or High which
   should dictate the level of encryption used by limiting the
   selection of cipher suites.
   
   However, this setting is not taking affect, as specifying
   Security Level = HIGH should use only 128-bit encryption, but
   the following 56-bit ciphers are still used:
   
   SSL_RSA_WIT_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_DES_CB_SHA
   
   Also, specifying Security Level = LOW should use NO encryption,
   but ciphers with encryption are still used, such as:
   
   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

   ****************************************************************
   For WebSphere Application Server, an SSL configuration
   with STRONG or WEAK cipher groups has ciphers that are either
   not strong enough or the ciphers have encryption. A strong
   cipher must provide at least a 128-bit key whereas a weak
   cipher must not provide encryption.
   Examples of ciphers listed not meeting the strong criterion
   are:
   SSL_RSA_WIT_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
   SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_DES_CB_SHA
   An example of a cipher listed not meeting the weak criterion
   is:
   SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was modified to adjust the ciphers listed for an SSL
   configuration according to the STRONG and WEAK ciphers criteria.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix pack 6.1.0.21.  Please refer to the Recommended Updates
