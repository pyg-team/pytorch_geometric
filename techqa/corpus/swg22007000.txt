CPE Server: 

1. After installing CPE 5.2.1 Fix Pack 7 on a CPE 5.2.1.x server, you will find the newly installed Windows batch files in the "PE" directory, as seen highlighted in this screen shot: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=1] 

 

After the Fix Pack installation is completed, edit the "cpetoolenv.bat" file to include a viable JRE as the "JAVA_HOME=" value. 

The following screen shot is an example:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=2] 

 

2. Open a Windows command prompt in the "PE" directory and run the pedesigner.bat file to start the Process Designer stand-alone application. 

 

NOTE: depending upon your Windows Server version, you may be able to create a desktop shortcut which will run the Process Designer application directly, by including the Connection Point in the "Target" value:
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=3] 

 

3. At the logon screen, input appropriate user credentials: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=4]


4. The Process Designer stand-alone application includes a "Tools" menu option, from which you can launch Process Administrator:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=5] 

 

 

On a Windows Client PC (non-CPE server): 

In order to deploy the Process Designer stand-alone application on a non-CPE server, Windows computer, you must first install the "Tools" in the CPE 5.2.1 installer, and then install the "Tools" in the CPE 5.2.1 FP7 installer. 

 

NOTE: after following these instructions, all of the tools in the "PE" directory (i.e. vwtool, 

 

1. Copy both the CPE 5.2.1 base installer files, and the CPE 5.2.1.7 installer files on the target Windows computer.
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=6]

2. Run the CPE 5.2.1 installer, and select only the "tools" option during the installer setup:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=7]



3. Input the target CPE server URL to which the stand-alone application will be connecting, for example:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=8] 

 

4. After completing the initial setup pages, run the CPE 5.2.1 installation to install the required "Tools" on the Windows computer 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=9] 

 

 

5. When the CPE 5.2.1 installation is completed, then run the CPE 5.2.1 FP7 installer, again, choosing only the "Tools" option: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=10] 

 

 

6. When the FP7 installation is completed, you will find the two Process Designer application batch files in the "PE" directory: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=11] 

 

7. Edit the "cpetoolenv.bat" file to include a viable JRE as the "JAVA_HOME=" value. 

The following screen shot is an example: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=12] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=12] 

 

8. From the Windows command prompt, run the pedesigner.bat (including the Connection Point): 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=13] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=13] 

 

9. At the logon screen, input appropriate user credentials: 


[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=14] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&aid=14]


10. The Process Designer stand-alone application includes a "Tools" menu option, from which you can now launch Process Administrator:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007000&amp;aid=15] 

 


How to change target CPE servers:

In order to run the Process Designer application on a different CPE server, you must edit the WcmApiConfig.properties file

For example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\FileNet\ContentEngine\tools\PE\config\WcmApiConfig.properties


The following value must point to a valid CPE server:
RemoteServerUrl = http://<server_name>:<port>/wsi/FNCEWS40MTOM/ [http://ecmdemo1:9080/wsi/FNCEWS40MTOM/]


NOTE: an invalid URL will cause a runtime failure, for example:

Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error 500: com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCA0015E: API_INVALID_URI: An invalid URI was found for connection http://ecmdemo1:9080/wsi/api/pesendapi [http://ecmdemo1:9080/wsi/api/pesendapi].
