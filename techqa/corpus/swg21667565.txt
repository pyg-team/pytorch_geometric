Text:
tivoli eif probe postemsg posteifmsg I-JPR-104-000 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Events sent from postemsg to Tivoli EIF probe version 13 are not received. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is seen in the EIF probe log:

Information: I-JPR-104-000: [stderr] WARNING: Discarding Event : from /<IP address>:<port number> Check message header


CAUSE
The EIF message header was incorrect. The version of postemsg being used was from 2009 which is not compatible with the EIF probe version 13.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use the latest version of postemsg. Please note that postemsg is from Tivoli Enterprise Console which has gone End of Support since Sept 2013.


The alternative is to use the "posteifmsg" utility which is provided by OMNIbus EIF SDK package.
