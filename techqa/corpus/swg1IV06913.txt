COMMENTS
 *  Per the product designer, this works as designed.
   
   1. When user uses Select Action "Create Labor Inventory
   Location" in Labor application and enters the 4-element gl
   account, it creates a LOCATIONS record of LABOR type and copies
   the GLaccount entered to the LOCATIONS.GLACCOUNT.
   
   2. When in Labor Reporting, the logic uses
   LABORCRAFTRATE.GLACCOUNT to populate LABTRANS.GLDEBITACCT when
   labor code is entered.  It does not use the labor's inventory
   location gl account. When the work order is entered, it merges
   workorder's glaccount with the gl debit account.
   
   
   
   
   
   How the LABORCRAFTRATE.GLACCOUNT is populated? In the
   database,it is the value of the ACCOUNTDEFAULTS.GLDEFAULT where
   DFLTGROUP='LABRESCODE'. In Maximo GUI, you can(if it is
   suitable in the business practice):
   
   1.Go to Financial->Chart of Accounts
   
   2.With the organization selected, Select Action Resources
   Codes. A dialog displays.
   
   3.In the Labor Resources code section, change Internal(and
   External) accounts to be 4-elements.
   
   4.Click OK and sign out of Maximo.
   
   5.Return to Labor Reporting, upon entering the Labor, the
   GLDebit account will be 4-elements.
   
   
   
   
   
   According to the product designer, this is how it works today.
   Please contact the product design if you have any questions.
