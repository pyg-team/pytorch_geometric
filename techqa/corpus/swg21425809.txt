install location; v70rnotes TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 When installing WebSphere Process Server through the launchpad, the IBM Installation Manager install location is defaulted. Can I change where this gets installed? 

ANSWER
Yes. As long as there is not already an installation of IBM Installation Manager on the box, the default installation location for IBM Installation Manager can be changed by using the following procedure: 

Steps 


1. Modify the <imageLocation>/launchpad/content/userExtensions.js file, where <imageLocation> is the location of the installation image of WebSphere Process Server.

2. Replace the following lines within the existing writeIMInstallXML(was_home, cdLocation, isRoot) function:


+ "\<install\>"
+ "\<offering features=\'agent_core,agent_jre\' id=\'com.ibm.cic.agent\' version=\'" + IMversion + "\'/\>"
+ "\</install\>"


with the following lines updated with your preferred location, <NEW_INSTALL_LOCATION>. Note that it is required that the install location end with "eclipse":


+ "\<profile kind=\'self\' installLocation=\'<NEW_INSTALL_LOCATION>/eclipse\' id=\'IBM Installation Manager\'\>"
+ "\<data key=\'eclipseLocation\' value=\'<NEW_INSTALL_LOCATION>/eclipse\'/\>"
+ "\</profile\>"
+ "\<install\>"
+ "\<offering profile=\'IBM Installation Manager\'features=\'agent_core,agent_jre\' id=\'com.ibm.cic.agent\' version=\'" + IMversion + "\'/\>"
+ "\</install\>"


NOTE: Each new line of code within the userExtensions.js file that is being replaced starts with "+" symbol. You can just copy and paste the lines of code above into your copy of userExtensions.js and make the appropriate modifications.
