 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 The integration requirements for using SafeNet DataSecure with IBM Security QRadar. 

CONTENT
The SafeNet DataSecure DSM for IBM Security QRadar receives syslog events from your SafeNet DataSecure device. DataSecure maintains activity logs, such as record administrative actions, network activity, and cryptography requests. QRadar supports SafeNet DataSecure v6.3.0 and later.




Supported event types
SafeNet DataSecure creates the following event logs: 

 * Activity log - Contains a record of each request that is received by the key server. 
 * Audit log - Contains a record of all configuration changes and user input errors that are made to KeySecure, whether through the management console or the command line interface. 
 * Client event log - Contains a record of all client requests that have the <RecordEventRequest> element. 
 * System log - Contains a record of all system events, such as the following events:  *  Service starts, stops, and restarts SNMP traps Hardware failures Successful or failed cluster replication and synchronization Failed log transfers License errors 
   
   


Configur ation overview 
To integrate SafeNet DataSecure with QRadar, you must perform the following tasks:  1. Enable syslog on the SafeNet DataSecure device. 
 2. Configure a SafeNet DataSecure log source on your QRadar Console.


Enabling syslog on SafeNet DataSecure . 
Before you add the DSM for SafeNet DataSecure, enable syslog on your SafeNet DataSecure device. Procedure 

 1. Log in to the SafeNet DataSecure management console as an administrator with logging access control. 
 2. Select Device > Log Configuration 
 3. Select the Rotation & Syslog tab. 
 4. Select a log in the Syslog Settings section and click Edit. 
 5. Select Enable Syslog. 
 6. Configure the parameters: Parameter Description Syslog Server #1 IP The IP address or host name of the target QRadar Event Collector. Syslog Server #1 Port The listening port for QRadar. Use Port 514. Syslog Server #1 Proto QRadar can receive syslog messages by using either UDP or TCP. 
 7. Optional. Type an IP address, port, and protocol for a Syslog Server #2. When two servers are configured, SafeNet DataSecure sends messages to both servers. 
 8. Type the Syslog Facility or accept the default value of local1. 
 9. Click Save.



Add a log source 
QRadar automatically detects syslog events forwarded by SafeNet DataSecure. In most cases, QRadar automatically adds the log source after a small number of events are detected. If required, you can manually add the log source. Procedure 

 1.  Log in to QRadar. 
 2.  Click the Admin tab. 
 3.  On the navigation menu, click Data Sources. 
 4.  Click the Log Sources icon. 
 5.  Click Add. 
 6.  Select the SafeNet DataSecure option from the Log Source Type list box. 
 7.  From the Protocol Configuration list box, select Syslog. 
 8.  Configure the remaining parameters. Parameter Description Log Source Identifier The IP address or hostname to identify the log source. The value must be unique to the log source type. Credibility Indicates the integrity of an event or offense as determined by the credibility rating from the log source. Credibility increases if multiple log sources report the same event. Incoming Payload Encoding The character encoding that is required to parse the event logs. Store Event Payload Enables the log source to store event payload information. Automatically discovered log sources inherit the value in the Store Event Payload list from your system settings. When you manually create or edit a log source, you can override the default value by configuring this option.
     
     
 9.  Optional. Clear the Enable check box if you want to disable the log source. 
 10. Select any groups that you want this log source to be a member of. 
 11. Click Save.
