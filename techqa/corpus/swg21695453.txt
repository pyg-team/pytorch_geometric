PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 To prevent possible clickjacking attacks, in IBM Intelligent Operations Center the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header is set to SAMEORIGIN. If the web server and the application server are not on the same domain, the response header setting might prevent you from viewing the IBM Sametime web client page and the IBM Cognos reports. 

SYMPTOM
 If the web server and the application server are not on the same domain, you might not be able to view the IBM Sametime web client page and the IBM Cognos reports. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue, modify the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header in the httpd.conf file on the web server: 

1. Stop the HTTP server.

2. Log on to the web server and edit the following file:


 * /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/httpd.conf 


3. Remove or comment out the following line in the httpd.conf file: 
 * Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN


4. Save the file, and then restart the HTTP server.
