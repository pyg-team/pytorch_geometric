ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) coach is loaded in a
   newly created IBM BPM V8.0.13 cluster or four-cluster topology,
    the following errors are logged in the web cluster members'
   SystemOut.log file because the
   IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification application is not deployed
   on the application cluster:

LOCAL FIX
 *  manually change the app association back to app target.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IBM BPM V8.0.1.x, the IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification
   application was deployed on the support cluster in a
   three-cluster deployment environment and on the web cluster in a
    four-cluster deployment environment. Interim fix JR46347 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR46347] for
   IBM BPM V8.0.1.1, which is included in IBM BPM V8.0.1.2 and
   later releases, introduces a dependency from the
   IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification application on IBM BPM
   configuration files that are available only on the application
   cluster. This dependency causes an exception when
   IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification application tries to read
   these configuration files on the support cluster or on the web
   cluster where the application is deployed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3 that deploys the
   IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification application on the
   deployment environment's application cluster where the necessary
    configuration files are accessible.
   
   For existing deployment environments, follow the instructions in
   ?Profile upgrade instructions for IBM Business Process Manager
   Version 8.0.1 Fix Pack 3 (V8.0.1.3)?, specifically step 9 of
   the Upgrading clusters section at
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042246#upgradecl [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042246#upgradecl]
   usters to move the IBM_BPM_Process_Portal_Notification
   application to the application cluster.
