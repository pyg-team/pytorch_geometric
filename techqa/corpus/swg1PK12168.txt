PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: WebSphere Application Server HTTP Plugins    *
   *                 and IBM HTTP Server (IHS) users              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When the Plugin fails to parse          *
   *                      plugin-cfg.xml due to an XML syntax     *
   *                      error, the plugin crashes IHS           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When a syntax error exists in plugin-cfg.xml, the Application
   Server plugin fails to initialize since the configuration data
   cannot be read.
   The plugin sends an error return code that causes IHS to crash.
   The plugin logs a "failure to parse config" message to IHS and
   http_plugin.log as well as the the webserver host console.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been corrected to handle the problem without crashing
   IHS.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion
   in fixpack 6.0.2.5.
