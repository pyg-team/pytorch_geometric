QUESTION
 Why is there a VM backup of VMware Virtual Machine called 'Aggregate' in the activity log of the Spectrum Protect Server within the ANE4172I message. 

CAUSE
An example of the message logged in the Spectrum Protect server activity log follows :
ANE4172I Starting Full VM backup of VMware Virtual Machine 
'aggregate' mode: 'full_or_incr' target node name: 'target_node_name' data mover node name: 'data_mover_node_name' application protection type: 'application_protection_type' application(s) protected: 'application_list'


ANSWER
The Virtual Machine called 'Aggregate' is the total value of all VM Guests backed up per DataMover. 

Example:
You have 10 VM Guests to backup. 
> There will be 10 Entries for each VM Guest that is being backed up. 
> There will also be one Aggregate entry which is the total for all VM Guest backups for each dataMover.
