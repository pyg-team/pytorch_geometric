APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The below Exception is thrown when trying to start an
   application that uses the IBM MQ classes for Java OSGi
   Redistributable client:
   
   detailMessage     "JMSCC0091: The provider factory for
   connection type
   'com.ibm.msg.client.wmq' could not be loaded."
   linkedException  CSIException
        detailMessage             "A Messaging Provider component
   was not
   found."
   The connection is unable to be successfully established.
   
   Additionally, when using IBM MQ classes for Java to connect to a
   queue manager using the Java OSGi Redistributable client, the
   following Exception would be returned:
   
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   javax.transaction.xa.XAException not found by
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of:
   
   - The IBM MQ v8.0 OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar
   
   who use IBM MQ classes for JMS to connect to a queue manager.
   
   And users of:
   
   - The IBM MQ v8.0 OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar
   - The IBM MQ v9.0 OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar
   
   who use IBM MQ classes for Java to connect to a queue manager.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The problem occurred when an application used the
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar OSGi bundle and
   attempted to establish a connection to a queue manager. At this
   point, an exception would be generated indicating that the
   internal com.ibm.msg.client.wmqcomponent could not be loaded, an
   example of this exception for JMS applications is shown below:
   
   detailMessage     "JMSCC0091: The provider factory for
   connection type
   'com.ibm.msg.client.wmq' could not be loaded."
   linkedException  CSIException
        detailMessage             "A Messaging Provider component
   was not found."
   The connection is unable to be successfully established.
   
   This was due to the fact that the OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar only registered a
   single internal component to the MQ messaging provider component
   manager and therefore did not register all of the components
   required to run classes for Java and classes for JMS
   applications. Consequently, when there was an attempt to get an
   instance of the internal com.ibm.msg.client.wmq component for
   JMS applications to use, this failed, as the component had not
   been loaded.
   
   Additionally, if IBM MQ classes for Java were used to establish
   a connection to a queue manager, the following exception would
   be generated:
   
   java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
   javax.transaction.xa.XAException not found by
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient
   
   This was due to the fact that the OSGi bundle
   com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar did not import
   all packages required to run classes for Java applications.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The com.ibm.mq.osgi.allclient_<version_number>.jar OSGi bundle
   has now been updated so that it now registers all the internal
   components, and imports all packages, required to run classes
   for Java and classes for JMS applications with the MQ messaging
   provider component manager.
