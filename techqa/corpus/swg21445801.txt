PROBLEM
After migrating to IBM WebSphere Portal V7.0, you may not be able to navigate to or display the Web Content Manager (WCM) out-of-box page or the authoring portlet. In addition, some related functions in the user interface might not work or might generate exceptions when accessed. Clicking buttons in the authoring portlet may generate the following error in the log: 

 * 
 * IWKAP0009E: Servlet not enabled
 * 


If this occurs, you must re-enable these features manually after migration. 
CAUSE
The migration process can disable some new out-of-the-box features if the feature did not exist in the previous release or if it was updated. In particular, the Portal page required for the reserved authoring portlet is missing and the permissions on the AJAX proxy servlet are not set correctly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To re-enable the affected features manually after migration, do the following: 


1. Make sure that the page on which the WCM authoring portlet is installed uses a theme with client-side rendering such as the Page Builder theme.

2. Deploy the hidden Portal page on which the reserved authoring portlet is installed. 


3. Run the following task from the wp_profile_root / Config Engine directory. 
 * Cluster note:
 * 

 * Windows:
 *  
 * 
 * ConfigEngine.bat install-wcm-hidden-authoring-page -DWasPassword=
 * password
 * 
 * 
 * U
 * NIX:
 * 
 * ./ConfigEngine.sh install-wcm-hidden-authoring-page -DWasPassword=
 * password
 * 
 * 
 * i/S
 * y
 * stem
 * :
 * 
 * ConfigEngine.sh install-wcm-hidden-authoring-page -DWasPassword=
 * password
 * 
 * 
 * z/OS 
 * 
 * :
 * 
 * ./ConfigEngine.sh install-wcm-hidden-authoring-page -DWasPassword=
 * password
   

No restart of the Portal server is required.
