APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When typing the commands suggested in the Quick Beginnings for
   HP-UX manual, the following error messages are seen:
   > ulimit -d unlimited
   ksh: ulimit: exceeds allowable limit
   > ulimit -s unlimited
   ksh: ulimit: exceeds allowable limit
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This is a doc APAR.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   Users following the instructions in the Quick Beginnings for
   HP-UX manual, attempting to raise the limits on data and stack
   segment sizes.
   
   Platforms affected:
   HP-UX (Itanium),HP-UX (PA-RISC)
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Quick Beginnings for HP-UX manual suggests setting the system
   resource limit for data segment and stack segment to unlimited
   using the following commands :
   ulimit -d unlimited
   ulimit -s unlimited
   
   In fact the settings that must be investigated are the HP-UX
   Tunable Kernel Parameters maxdsiz, maxdsiz_64bit, maxssiz, and
   maxssiz_64bit.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Quick Beginnings for HP-UX manual will be corrected with the
   following information.
   
   The WebSphere MQ recommended minimum values for the HP-UX
   Tunable Kernel Parameters that pertain to data and stack segment
   sizes are:
   
     Parameter name  Recommended minimum (bytes)
     --------------- ---------------------------
     maxdsiz                          1073741824
     maxdsiz_64bit                    1073741824
     maxssiz                             8388608
     maxssiz_64bit                       8388608
   
   Shell settings for "ulimit" will not need to be made.
   
   Other software running on the machine may have its own
   recommended minimum settings for the above HP-UX Tunable Kernel
   Parameters.  If these are set higher than the WebSphere MQ
   recommended settings, this is not expected to harm operation of
   WebSphere MQ.
