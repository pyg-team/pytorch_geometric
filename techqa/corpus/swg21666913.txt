Title: IBM Inbound SSL inspection on the XGS appliance when operating in HA mode - United States

QUESTION
 Can the XGS be configured to perform inbound SSL inspection in an HA environment? 

ANSWER
In general, the XGS appliance needs to see the entire conversation in order to perform inbound SSL inspection.

Passive HA

If users fail over to another appliance (passive HA), traffic that was previously decrypted for inspection will no long be decrypted. This persists until the client/server for the connection perform a new TLS handshake. 

Active HA

For active HA deployments, where all the XGS appliances are seeing the same traffic, inspection should continue to work normally after a failover.

There have been some modifications in FW 5.3 that have slightly affected the behavior: 


 1. No special considerations are needed when you enable Inbound SSL inspection by using two XGS appliances in a HA configuration. 
 2. Inbound SSL works equally well in both primary/secondary (Passive) and clustering modes (Active HA). 
 3. Inbound SSL works equally well in symmetrically and asymmetrically routed networks as long as both sides of the SSL flow go through at least one of the nodes in the HA pair.
