PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Tivoli Storage Manager server will not start with messages ANR0172I and ANR0162W with return code -239. 

SYMPTOM
Tivoli Storage Manager server invocation will fail with the following errors: 


ANR0172I rdbdb.c(1410): Error encountered performing action ActivateDatabase. 
ANR0162W Supplemental database diagnostic information: -239:**No State Information Available (128)**:-239 (**No Other Information Available (206)**).


CAUSE
The filesystem or directory containing the Tivoli Storage Manager servers DB2 database is missing or not mounted.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Mount or recover the filesystem or directory which is causing this problem. This directory or filesystem must be known to the Tivoli Storage Manager server administrator, it is not possible for support to determine this information.

A database restore will not solve this problem if the directory or filesystem cannot be recovered, since one of the directories or filesystems is missing. The restore will fail with this message:

ANR2971E Database backup/restore/rollforward terminated - DB2 sqlcode -970 error.

If the filesystem or directory cannot be accessed or restored, using DSMSERV FORMAT may be the only option to recover the database. Note that it is required to have the devconfig and volume history files in order to restore the Tivoli Storage Manager servers database.

Note: The database, active log and archive log directories must exist in order for a database restore to work. The database directory locations must be known by the administrator, as per the Tivoli Storage Manager documentation. Make note of where the database directories exist prior to a situation where a database restore is required. The active log and archive log directory locations can be found in the dsmserv.opt file.
