RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the Target Object store , add #CREATOR-OWNER to the "Default Instance Security" tab in Other Classes -> Folder -> Base Case -> Case Folder -> CustomClass Properties and assign "View all properties" and "Modify all properties" rights. 

You can double check the class name using FileNet Enterprise Manager. Navigate to the Target OS -> Property Templates -> right click on Property_Name -> select properties. In the Property_Name properties window, click on Properties tab -> select All properties and scroll down to "Used in Classes" field. Clicking on this field value will show you which classes have this property and then you can check the Default Instance Security for those classes
