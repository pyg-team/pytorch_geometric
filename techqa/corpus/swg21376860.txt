Title: IBM Large file versions appear unsupported when running on ClearCase 7.0 or later - United States

Text:
CC; cleartool: Error: VOB schema; feature level; and element's type manager must support large file versions; Support for large files; support large file versions; Feature Level 5 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains how to resolve an error, cleartool: Error: VOB schema, feature level, and element's type manager must support large file versions., that can occur when using IBM Rational ClearCase (CC) and performing checkin or checkout operations in a VOB. 

SYMPTOM
 


The 2GB limit appears to have been reached even with CC 7.0.1 or later installed which should have included this support for certain file types. 

When working with files, actions such as checkins or checkouts result in the error: 

 

cleartool: Error: VOB schema, feature level, and element's type manager must support large file versions.



CAUSE
 

The VOB in question was itself created on a machine running an older (pre 7.x) version of ClearCase and the VOB is still at Feature Level 4 (or earlier). Feature Level 5 (introduced in ClearCase 7.0) is required in order to support large file versions. 


Refer to the IBM Rational ClearCase 7.0 Release Notes under the topic of Support for large files in VOBs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.help.doc/cc_ms_release_notes.htm]for further information.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 

Upgrade the VOB to Feature Level 5.
