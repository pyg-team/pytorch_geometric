APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The customer is using Netcool/OMNIbus v7.3.1 with an LDAP
   connection to a MicroSoft Active Directory LDAP Server.
   
   When a user attempts to login to the object server they are
   unable to and the object server logs;
   
   Error: E-AUT-102-007: Failed to bind to LDAP
   server for user udiederich@dt.ept.lu. (81:Can't contact LDAP
   server)
   Error: E-AUT-102-008: The LDAP Server is not reachable
   
   This appears to have been raised a bug in v7.3.0 but the
   solution does not appear to have been ported to the newer v7.3.1
   code, else there is a new issue.

LOCAL FIX
 *  The issue can be worked around by keeping the connection active
   or by adjusting the LDAP servers timeout setting.
   
   To keep the connection active write a script to login to the
   object server as an LDAP user periodically, then logout.
   This will ensure the connection is maintained.
