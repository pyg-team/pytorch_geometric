PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You install a new version of CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) but keep your old CICS TS environment to run in parallel until you complete your enterprise-wide migration strategy. You start your CICS TS CMAS address space and receive message EYUXE0014E indicating module EYU9Xxxx cannot be found. 

CAUSE
As part of the CICS TS installation activity, you update your z/OS linklist dataset to remove the previous release of CICS TS linklist library members and replace them with the new CICS TS required linklist members.

The CICS TS V5.2 documentation, in the section titled CICS- and CICSPlex SM-supplied modules required in the MVS linklist [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.installation.doc/topics/dfha13c.html], states the following:

Compatibility with earlier CICS releases
Unless otherwise stated, the CICS Transaction Server for z/OSÂ®, Version 5 Release 2 levels of the modules in SDFHLINK are compatible with earlier releases of CICS. The CICSPlex SM modules in SEYULINK are not compatible with earlier releases. CICSPlex SM modules in SEYULINK are release specific. If you plan to run multiple releases of CICSPlex SM on the same MVS image, you must have the equivalent modules specific to the releases you are running.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You can check to see if EYU9Xnnn is in the LNKLIST or STEPLIB by entering the following commands: 

 1. First determine which LNKLIST is being used by entering the following command:
    
    D PROG,LNKLIST
    
    CSV470I [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/iea2m4b0/17.131]10.38.32 LNKLST DISPLAY 142 
    LNKLST SET LNKLSTRN LNKAUTH=LNKLST
    
    
 2. Then use the LNKLST SET name displayed in a SETPROG command. In this example LNKLSTRN. The EYUXE0014E module to look for is EYU9X320.
    
    SETPROG LNKLIST,TEST,NAME=LNKLSTRN,MODNAME=EYU9X320
    
    If EYU9X320 is found in LNKLIST message:
    
    CSV502I MODULE EYU9X320 WAS LOCATED
    IN DATA SET SYS2.CPSM320.PROD.SEYULINK
    USING LNKLST SET LNKLSTRN
    
    If EYU9X320 is not in LNKLIST, the following message will be returned:
    
    CSV503I MODULE EYU9X320 COULD NOT BE LOCATED USING LNKLST SET LNKLSTRN

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Do not remove the EYU9cnnn modules (where c is 'A' or 'D' or X' or 'T' and nnn is 310, 320, 410, 420, 510 or 520) from the z/OS linklist if you need to continue to start your CICS TS CMAS from a previous release. Reference the table below for a list of required linklist members for your release of CICS Transaction Server CICSPlex SM environment.
