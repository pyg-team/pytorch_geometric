CHANGE HISTORY
 

What's new Removal of the IBM JRE installer for Windows clients: Starting this release, the Windows installer for the IBM JRE does not exist in the HOD publish directory. If needed, end users must contact their HOD administrators to get the IBM JRE installer for Windows. HOD administrators with a valid HOD entitlement can download the latest supported version of the IBM JRE from the IBM Fix Central web site.

Changes due to the removal of the IBM JRE install image from HOD:  * The link to download Java2 Runtime Environment Installation Image is removed from the HODMain.html page.
 * If the Java plug-in is not found on Windows clients, a pop-up message is shown to the user similar to that for non-Windows clients.
 * The JREInstall directory is removed from the HOD publish directory.
 * The HTML parameter ForceJREInstall does not work
