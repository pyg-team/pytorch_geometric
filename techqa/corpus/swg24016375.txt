ABSTRACT
 The WebSphere Business Integration Adapter for JText, version 5.6.4 has been updated 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The following fixes are included:

CR67282/JR22071
The adapter restarts for the number of times noted in the business object entry before the event file is removed from the event directory. If there are a lot of business objects in one file, this can be a serious problem, because the connector keeps restarting and leads to an OutOfMemory error.

CR68070/JR24097
If the target FTP disk is full and the outbound activity appends new business objects to the output file, the adapter might not return an error. 

CR84140/JR23530
When the adapter is used with the XML data handler, it fails to write files on request with the dynamic meta-objects. The following exception is generated: 

java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -27

The fix now correctly reads the dynamic meta-object from the application-specific information mentioned in the business object.

CR68261/JR24097
If the target MVS dataset is out of space and the adapter tries to append data to the dataset, no failed flows are reported back to InterChange Server, and no error messages are reported in the ics_manager.log file.

CR68477/JR24317
When the attribute FileSeqEnabled is set to true, the adapter writes an extra new line in the output file.
With the fix, an extra new line character is not written in the output file.

CR83930/JR23875
When the adapter tries to put a record to a file on the FTP server and the timeout has been exceeded, the first record always fails. The adapter then reconnects and proceeds with the remaining records.
The fix includes a check to ensure that the connection to the FTP server is available, and if not, it will obtain a connection and then process the records.

CR83283/JR23646
The adapter starts to process an event file before it is completely downloaded from the FTP server. 

CR87935/JR26049
Upgrading to JText v5.6.4 causes problems with remote event processing. 

CR88500/JR26346
When archiving is disabled, back to back files are not processed.

CR85494/JR24360
When the DataProcessingMode value is Binary, the adapter fails to archive processed files. 

CR87274/JR26002
The adapter reports exceptions as warnings. 

CR87686/JR25893
When the adapter is restarted in a SUN workstation, files are received twice.

CR88165/JR26767
The adapter fails to send requests to the remote FTP server. 

CR88375/JR26939
The IncludeEndBoDelimiter property of the adapter is not working as documented.

CR82997/JR23587
A java.io.FileNotFoundException exception occurs after applying the JText 5.6.2 fix pack.

CR85640/JR24813
When the adapter runs on an iSeries workstation and is polling for events, the following exception occurs and the CPU utilization goes up to 100 percent: FileNotFoundException:Resource busy

This exception occurs only occasionally.

CR88388/JR26948
The adapter crashes when JText polling is set with max event capacity.

Note: Clients on versions 5.6.3 and 5.6.4 can go directly to 5.6.5.
