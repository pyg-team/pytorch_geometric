QUESTION
 How to use the Application Integration mapper to create a file delimited with commas (a comma-separated output file, or .csv) for Microsoft Excel format. 

ANSWER
When creating a EDI Standard-to-flat file delimited map, do the following: 

 1. Create new map 
 2. Select Delimited (ANSI, etc) standard for the input side of the map 
 3. Select the option to Customize to select the appropriate standard 
 4. For the Output, select Delimited, but DO NOT customize

This creates an EDI to Delimited (flat file with delimiters) map. 

After the map is generated, to get commas (,) in the data, at the top of the OUTPUT side of the map:  1. Right-click, select Properties 
 2. Go to the Delimiters tab 
 3. Check specify delimiters 
 4. Place commas for all the delimiters
