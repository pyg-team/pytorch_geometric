PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Logon to IBM FileNet Workplace XT can fail if the server name of the IBM FileNet Content Platform Engine server it connects to has been changed but not properly reflected in IBM WebSphere Application Server 

SYMPTOM
When attempting to log on to WorkplaceXT, a generic logon error message can be displayed. IBM WebSphere Application Server SystemOut.log will indicate the following exception : 

com.filenet.wcm.api.RemoteServerException: com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;The JNDI cannot be accessed. Message was: Error getting WsnNameService properties [Code=null]; OMFC/TheNetwork/NoOp//API_UNEXPECTED_JNDI_ERROR

When inspecting the IBM WebSphere ffdc logs generated just prior to the logon failure, the following error is logged : 

org.omg.CORBA.TRANSIENT: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out:host=<nonexistent_host>,port=9100 vmcid: IBM minor code: E06 completed: No


CAUSE
This behavior can occur if the hostname of the server where Content Platform Engine (CPE) is deployed was changed but the IBM WebSphere Application Server configuration was not updated to reflect the new name. 

ENVIRONMENT
IBM WebSphere Application Server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM





 * Inspect the IBM WebSphere Administration Console on the host where CPE is deployed and navigate to Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > <<application_server>>. 
   
   Please note the hostname indicated. 
 * Next, click the <<application server>> entry and navigate to Ports. Please note the hostname indicated for all the various ports. 
   
   
 * Furthermore, inspect System administration > Node agents > node_agent > Ports and note if any hostnames are incorrect or reflect a prior value.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If any of the hostname fields listed above are incorrect, please refer to WebSphere documentation on updating the hostname. There are several methods documented, at least one of them referencing using the AdminTask.changeHostName Jython script. The hostname on the ports page may be updated in the WebSphere Administrative Console. 

After all hostnames have been updated, start the WebSphere instance where CPE is deployed and attempt to connect using Workplace XT.
