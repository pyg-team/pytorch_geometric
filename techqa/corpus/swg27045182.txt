 * Software requirements for WebSphere Application Server with WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition
 * All operating systems supported by Dynamic Workload Console are supported by IBM WebSphere™ Application Server, V8.5 Fix Pack 4. For more information about it, see: [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034969]http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034969 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034969]. In the information relating to hardware and memory requirements in this document, the application server is treated as part of Dynamic Workload Console, and its requirements are not listed separately. 
 * Before applying the WebSphere Application Server later fixpacks ensure that they are supported also by Jazz for Service Management extension for IBM WebSphere with Dashboard Application Services Hub.

 * 
 * 
 * Supported Browsers for mobile devices
 *  To use Dynamic Workload Console 9.3 on mobile devices, use the default browsers on the following mobile platforms:
 *  iOS based devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) with iOS V8.x Android-based devices with V4.4+ 
 * 
 * Software requirements for the Launchpad
 * The IBM Workload Automation Launchpad is supported for version 9.3 on all operating systems where IBM Workload Scheduler components can be installed. Starting from IBM Workload Scheduler, version 9.3, fix pack 1, the Launchpad is no longer supported. 
 * The Launchpad requires a supported Web browser. Alternatively, you can always install the product by using the installation wizard or the silent installation.
 * For the launchpad, use one of the following browsers:
 *  Firefox 2.0+ Internet Explorer 6.0+ Mozilla 1.7+ SeaMonkey 1.1.4+ 
 * These browsers are not all available on all platforms; some of them might only be available in a special version from the manufacturer of your operating system. See Table 1 for details:
 * Table 1: Launchpad browsers 
 *  Operating system Supported browsers Download Websites and other information AIX Firefox, Mozilla, and SeaMonkey

   SeaMonkey Download & Releases [http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/#1.1.13]
   
   On AIX 5.3 and AIX 6.1, at ML7 or later, if Firefox is installed you must run the launchpad from within a bash shell, whether you are running the launchpad on Firefox or Mozilla. However, if SeaMonkey is also installed, the bash shell is not required to use any browser.

 *  Note 
 * This information, plus other information about how to launch the launchpad, is provided, platform by platform, in a readme.txt file in the root of the Launchpad directory on each DVD or electronic download image. However, this document contains more up-to-date information than the readme files. 
 * 
 *  Supported LDAP Servers
 * For a list of the LDAP servers supported by IBM Workload Scheduler, go to the supported software for WebSphere Application Server website [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27045660], click the appropriate MDM/DWC platform link, and read the LDAP servers using Federated Repository Configuration section.
 * 
 * 
 * Support for Internet Protocol version 6
 *  Dynamic Workload Console supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in addition to IPv4. To help you in the transition from an IPv4 environment to a complete IPv6 environment, IBM Workload Scheduler provides IP dual-stack support. The product communicates using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols simultaneously with other applications using IPv4 or IPv6.

MEMORY REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLATION MANAGER
Dynamic Workload Console is installed by using IBM Installation Manager. Table 2 summarizes the memory requirements (MB) indicated for running the Installation Manager in interactive or in silent mode.

Table 2: Memory Requirements to run the Installation Manager (MB) Operating system Physical memory Temporary space
Windows 512 10 Solaris 512 10 Linux 512 10 AIX 1024 10 Note:


 * To run the Installation Manager GUI on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6 (64-bit), the following operating system libraries are required:  * libXtst+
    * compat-libstdc+
   
   
 * To run the Installation Manager GUI on AIX, ensure that the operating system has the required operating system libraries listed in the Required gtk libraries for Installation Manager on AIX [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631478]
 * These disk space requirements do not include the space required for the Tivoli Common Reporting, details of which can be obtained from their support documentation.
