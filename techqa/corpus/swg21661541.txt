QUESTION
 Error code E-OBJ-102-020: Failed to start the storage system. What is this error telling us? 

CAUSE
The ObjectServer is unable to run due to a problem with the ObjectServer db files under $OMNIHOME/db. The files may be corrupted, or too large, or may not exist at all.

ANSWER
Examples: 

"E-OBJ-102-020: Failed to start the storage system. (-490:Extent statistics mismatch)"

The ObjectServer was started with corrupted files under $OMNIHOME/db/<osname> due to an abnormal shutdown. Remove all files from this location other than the .tab files 

"E-OBJ-102-020: Failed to start the storage system. (-401:Failed to reserve swap space for region)" 

Hard limit exceeded for an ObjectServer db file. increase the hard limit using the nco_store_resize command 

"E-OBJ-102-020: Failed to start the storage system. (2:No such file or directory)"

$NCHOME/omnibus/bin/nco_dbinit has not been run. This is the utility responsible for creating the ObjectServer .tab files and populating them with a default clean set of data. 

Please refer to the online documentation for the above ObjectServer commands. See the link below.
