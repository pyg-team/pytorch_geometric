Title: IBM PureData for Operational Analytics â€“ Upgrading TSAMP 4.1.0.1 and RSCT 3.2.0.0 - United States

Text:
 FIX README

ABSTRACT
 PDOA v1.1 GA and v1.0 FP4 comes with TSAMP 4.1.0.1 and RSCT version 3.2.0.0 (3.2.0.4). This combination may present some TSAMP instability and resources hang 

CONTENT
 

Important: 

Upgrade Management and all core domains to RSCT 3.2.0.9 and TSAMP 4.1.0.2 

 

Download



Note: TSAMP 4.1.0.2 includes RSCT 3.2.0.9; therefore you can skip downloading RSCT 3.2.0.9. The instructions to download and install RSCT are optional, they are only here in the event you are installing RSCT only.

INSTALLATION

Note: By default in a PDOA's cluster the management nodes are the nodes with host names ending in "01" and "03". Some times by customer's request this could change.

1- Check HA Configuration Status and take a backup

1.1- Check HA configuration by running as "root" on one of the management nodes and one of the core nodes 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


1.2- Backup the HA policies by running the following command as "root" on one of the management node and one of the core node  * 
 * 


2- Stop All the Warehouse Tools, Performance Monitor and the core instance and all domains (MGT and cores)  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


2.1- Stop the core instance  * 
 * 


2.2- Stop all domains  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


3- Optional: If any of the following iFixes are installed TSAMP iFix4101 or RSCT IV74148 

3.1 List the iFixes installed  * 
 * 


3.2 Remove the iFix from all nodes where it is installed. (If needed)  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 



4- Install T SAMP 4.1.0.2 

4.1- Uncompress and untar file 4.1.0-TIV-SAMP-AIX-FP0002.tar.Z  * 
 * full_path_extract_dir
 * 


4.2- Check prerequisites for TSAMP 4.1.0.2  * 
 * 


4.3- If all prerequisites are met, install TSAMP 4.1.0.2  * 
 * 


Note: Step #5 can be skipped as the installation of TSAMP 4.1.0.2 install RSCT 3.2.0.9 

5- (Can be skipped to #6) Install/Upgrade RSCT to 3.2.0.9  * 
   pkg_files_path
 * 
 * 
 * log_dir_path
 * 


5.1 Install RSCT 3.2.0.9 on all core nodes by executing  * 
 * 


6- Check the installed TSAMP and RSCT version  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


7- Start all core domains  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 



8- Complete TSAMP and RSCT migration (in each domain). Run the following command on one node in each domain (i.e. on all standbys nodes)  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * list_of_node_per_domain=$list_of_node_per_domain$node, 
   dsh -n $node date 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * list_of_node_per_domain
 *  
 * 
 * 


8.1- Complete TSAMP migration  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

8.2- Complete RSCT migration 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

9- Recycle all domains (clear all resources after migration)  * 
 * 
 *  
   $ hadomain -mgmt stop 
   $ hadomain -core stop 
 * 
 * 
 *  
   $ hadomain -mgmt start 
   $ hadomain -core start 
 * 
 * 
 *  
   TSAMP version 
   
   $ dsh -n $list_of_node_per_domain 'lssrc -ls IBM.RecoveryRM | grep -i VN'| dshbak 
   
   RSCT version 
   
   $ hadomain -mgmt status 
   $ hadomain -core status 


10- Start All the Warehouse Tools, Performance Monitor and the core instance and all domains (MGT and cores)  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


10.1- Start the core instance  * 
 *
