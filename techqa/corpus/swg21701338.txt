VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange cipher suite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. 

This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.

The only mitigation is to apply the recommended fix. The fix must be applied if you are running the WebSphere eXtreme Scale server or Java client in stand-alone mode. If either the server or Java client is running under WebSphere Application Server or the WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile, then you must apply an interim fix as described here: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21698613]. The default WebSphere Application Server cipher suite configuration does not apply to WebSphere eXtreme Scale Connections. Therefore, an interim fix must be applied. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701338&amp;aid=1] 
It is possible to run WebSphere eXtreme Scale with a Java runtime not delivered with the product. IBM recommends that you ensure that the Java runtime you use has fixes for these vulnerabilities. 

Important note: IBM strongly suggests that all System z customers be subscribed to the System z Security Portal to receive the latest critical System z security and integrity service. If you are not subscribed, see the instructions on the System z Security web site [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/solutions/security_integrity.html]. Security and integrity APARs and associated fixes will be posted to this portal. IBM suggests reviewing the CVSS scores and applying all security or integrity fixes as soon as possible to minimize any potential risk. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
