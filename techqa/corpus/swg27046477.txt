ABSTRACT
 Members of the IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) technical support team shared information for optimizing the launch of ILMT or SUA (Software Use Analysis tool). After the presentation, attendees were given an opportunity to ask our panel of experts questions. Throughout the event, attendees commented and asked questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting group web chat. 

CONTENT
In order to deploy IBM License Metric Tool successfully, it is essential to know what your company's needs are, to be familiar with your environment, and to have a general understanding of what the asset tracking tool can do for you. 

For this open mic session, we discussed your preparedness, which means 

 * education and training 
 * prerequisites 
 * resources who have appropriate skill sets


This Open Mic session was the second webcast provided by the IBM License Metric Tool technical support team. Our goal is to provide insight on how ILMT works and to teach on-going sessions that help both users and administrators understand, maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with it. Throughout the event, attendees will be encouraged to comment or ask questions in the IBM Connections Cloud Meeting (formerly known as IBM SmartCloud Meetings) Web chat. This was an interactive and educational session.

 * Date: Thursday, September 24, 2015
