QUESTION
 Are System P Agents V6.2.2 supported with new Power8 systems ? 

CAUSE
When moving AIX LPAR on a new hardware, most often it is requested to maintain unchanged the applications running on the LPAR to avoid additional effort. 
But it in this case it is important to know if the application version running on current hardware is expected to work with no major issues on the new processors

AIX Premium Agent 6.2.2 FP2 IF4 

CEC Agent 6.2.2 FP2 IF3
