It is possible, though not recommended, to configure WebSphere eXtreme Scale to use the SSLv3 protocol. With this fix, if SSLv3 is still needed for compatibility reasons, it is necessary to specify a Java system property: 

com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3=false 

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
