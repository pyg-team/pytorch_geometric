You can track all active APARs for this component.



APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the ODBC API SQLError() is called to retrieve the error
   status of a database call that has returned SQL_NO_DATA on Unix,
   an unexpected return code is returned from the unixODBC Driver
   Manager resulting in the error not being handled as expected.
   The user is likely to see just the following error after the
   BIP2488E message:
   
   BIP2321E: Database error: ODBC return code '100' using ODBC
   driver manager
   
   The expected behavior would be to see both the following:
   
   BIP2321E: Database error: ODBC return code '100' using ODBC
   driver manager
   BIP2322E: Database error: SQL State '02000'; Native Error Code
   '100'; Error Text '[IBM][CLI
   Driver][DB2/AIX64] SQL0100W No row was found for FETCH, UPDATE
   or DELETE
   
   This can cause issues especially when users are trying to catch
   the SQL_NO_DATA return code in their code.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 or IBM Integration
   Bus V9.0 who use ODBC to connect to databases on Unix platforms.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX, HP-UX Itanium platform, Linux on Power platform, Linux on
   x86 platform, Linux on x86-64 platform, Linux on zSeries
   platform, Solaris x86-64 platform, Solaris SPARC platform

   or DELETE

   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now uses SQLGetDIagRec() when gathering error
   information which means the expected response is returned from
   the UnixODBC DriverManager.
