APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security
   caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function
   for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake.
   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using
   man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and
   obtain credentials.
