QUESTION
 How do you import null fields in a record in IBM Rational ClearQuest Import Tool? 

CAUSE
What happens if null fields are imported into a user database with the Rational ClearQuest Import Tool when updating existing records? Will the fields be overwritten with no value, or will the import leave the fields as they are?

ANSWER
The Import Tool will only update records with actual data. The data in existing fields would not be overwritten with null values. 



You can use the word "BLANK" in the applicable data column(s) and row(s). This will clear out the field in whatever records are updated by the Import Tool. This "BLANK" feature was introduced in ClearQuest version 7.0.0.0. 

 

Field Type "" " " "BLANK" ATTACHMENT_LIST *1 ignore ignore ignore DATE_TIME ignore invalid value clear value INT ignore invalid value clear value MULTILINE_STRING ignore insert one space *2 clear value REFERENCE ignore ignore clear value *3 REFERENCE_LIST ignore
(clear value *4*5) ignore invalid value SHORT_STRING ignore clear value clear value STATE ignore invalid value invalid value 
Note *1: There is no way to clear values in the ATTACHMENT_LIST field type. Note *2: It inserts one space as it is, not null value. 

Note *3: APAR PK73991 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK73991] was fixed starting in versions 7.0.0.5 and 7.0.1.4. 

 






Note *4: APAR PK71388 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK71388] was fixed starting in versions 7.0.0.4 and 7.0.1.3 

Note *5: APAR PM44971 [http://ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM44971] was fixed starting in versions 8.0.0.7. 

 

How to clear values in the REFERENCE_LIST field type : 

For version 7.0 :

For version 7.1 : 

The "Replace value" option in Import Tool preference has been added in Rational ClearQuest Eclipse RCP client version 7.1, however, "" does not clear value in reference_list field. 

For version 8.0 : 

The "Replace value" option in Import Tool preference works as expected in Rational ClearQuest Eclipse RCP client version 8.0.0.7 or later.
