Title: IBM Some of the documents in the P8 queue are not linked by Utility Client of IBM Content Collector for SAP Applications - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to link all archived documents that are in the P8 queue by using the document-linking process of Utility Client. However, the documents that are associated with a specific workflow, which makes the documents available in the P8 queue, are not linked. 

CAUSE
The workflow name is longer than 31 characters. The F_CLASS field, which is exposed in the P8 queue, accepts only a maximum of 31 characters.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The trace reflects a mismatch between the number of documents that are found in the P8 queue and the number of documents that are linked, as shown in the following trace example: 

10:05:05.214 05/06 [03486] P8-AGENT WORKER #0: BarcodeProcessor.getNumberWorkpackages: total number of entries in the queue: 2.
10:05:05.214 05/06 [03486] P8-AGENT WORKER #0: BarcodeProcessor.getNumberWorkpackages: entries of workflow 'XXX_YY_QUEUE' will be processed.
...
10:05:05.233 05/06 [03486] P8-AGENT WORKER #0: BarcodeProcessor.readQueueEntries: createQuery() successfully executed!
10:05:05.257 05/06 [03486] P8-AGENT WORKER #0: BarcodeProcessor.getNumberWorkpackages: 0 entries in queue found.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The workflow name has the following format: <sap_system>_<archive_id>_<p8_queue_name> 

Reduce the length of the workflow name to a maximum of 31 characters by shortening the name of the P8 queue. In the server configuration profile, specify a shorter value for the PE_QUEUENAME keyword.
