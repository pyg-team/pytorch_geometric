COMMENTS
 *  When we create the customized entities, it is
   important to provide the Relations in the metadata.
   The generic metadata should be reffered to view all
   the relations and the inverse relations.
   For customized Product Instance, the neccessary
   customizations are of Product Specification,
   VPMItemInstance. Please provide relationship of
   V_PRC in Product Specification entity in metadata
   and then publish the metadata.
   The problem is UR in R17 when customization is
   done as mentioned above.
   Please let us know if we need to resend the
   example of the Overloading mechanism.
