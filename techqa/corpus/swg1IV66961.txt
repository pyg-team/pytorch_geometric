APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The summarization and pruning agent reports no connectivity to
   the TEP.
   The TEP is reachable on all ports from the S&P agent. The TEP is
   listening on all relevant ports (1920, 15001, 15200, 15201)
   
   All infrastructure was upgraded recently to ITM v6.3.0.3. This
   includes TEP, TEMS, RTEMS, Warehouse agent, S&Y agent.
   
   The TEP has 'Enable SSL for TEP clients' configured
   
   Approver Initials: SM
   L2 Approver Initials: OR
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  On teps, open cq.ini (on UNIX/LINUX) or kfwenv (on Windows) and
   add this:
   KFW_ORB_ENABLE_LOCAL_MANAGER=Y
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Portal client and Summarization and Pruning agent are unable to
   connect to the portal server.
   
   
   The portal client and the summarization and pruning agent are
   unable to connect to the portal server.  The portal client log
   shows the following exception:
   
   EXCEPTION: org.omg.CORBA.NO_PERMISSION:   vmcid: 0x56422000
   minor code: 271  completed: No
   
   This only occurs if the portal client is using the IIOP
   interface, and that interface is configured to encrypt
   communication using SSL.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changed portal server code to enable the local IIOP manager for
   CORBA communication.
