APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the User Management console, when attempting to edit a user
   that is an LDAP user, the page shows an "Argument cannot be
   null" Java exception.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The cause of the issue is the missing content (NULL) of database
   field LOC in table RBAC_USRS.
   After filling the field with " C" (blank uppercase C) the user
   can be edited using the ECMSM User Editor.
   ?To update all user missing this entry following SQL query can
   be used (where FSMDB must be replaced by the ECMSM database
   name, FSMSCHEMA must be replaced by the ECMSM schema name):
   
   UPDATE [FSMDB].[FSMSCHEMA].[RBAC_USRS]
   SET LOC=' C'
   WHERE LOC IS NULL
   
   This would have to be done after any new LDAP user is used to
   login into the web console.
