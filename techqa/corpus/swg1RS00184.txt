APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the action column of a DT has 2 subcolumns (ie the action
   takes 2 arguments), and the DT is published to RSO, the Excel
   table contains 2 rows for the action column title instead of
   one.
   
   In addition, the second row of the condition column title is
   half blue (it should be grey). Only action columns should be
   blue.
   
   Also, when opening the Excel file, you see the error dialog
   saying "Excel found unreadable content in Destineo
   Prospection.xlsx. Do you want to recover the contents of this
   workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes."
   Once you click yes, another error dialog is displayed :
   "Excel was able to open the file by repairing or removing the
   unreadable content.
   Removed Records: Merge cells from /xl/worksheets/....xml.part"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Note that the error does not occur if
   - the action column has less than 2 arguments or subcolumns
   - the condition column does not have subcolumns
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Badly generated Decision table on RSO if an action contains more
   than 1 argument
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Decistion Table is now properly generated.
