Title: IBM PK47872: UPDATE MULTIPLE REFERENCE REFERENCE PROPERTIES IN A DWS CAUSES CLASSCASTEXCEPTION - United States

Text:
 
APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  WCM data import could cause a ClassCastException in the PLS
   layer of the JCR.  The ClassCastException would be generated
   from the ProcessAction class.
   
   The stack may include:
   Caused by: com.ibm.icm.da.DBAccessException: [B
     at com.ibm.icm.da.portable.data.ProcessAction.processJCRRI
               (ProcessAction.java:1799)
     at com.ibm.icm.da.portable.data.ProcessAction.processUpdate
               Actions(ProcessAction.java:1124)
      . . .
    Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: [B
     at com.ibm.icm.da.portable.data.ProcessAction.processJCRRI
               (ProcessAction.java:1661)
   In one environment this was encountered while creating /
   saving draft
   When attempting to create drafts the customer will see:
     Could not save            object in repository.
        javax.jcr.RepositoryException
   and the above snippet of the stack will follow.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ClassCastException was being thrown by
   the ProcessAction class in the PLS layer of the JCR causing
   WCM data import to fail
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Multiple Reference property handling
   was modified to prevent the ClassCastException from
   occuring
