APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  911 Lock Timeout errors, causing performance problems
   
   
   Observed many wait lock situation in their DB2 database around
   accessing  WOCHANGE/WOACTIVITY and WORKORDER
   
   This causes slowness in the Change application
   
   
   It seems that lock held during long running sqls when selecting
   from the view created on top of workorder keeps the updates to
   workorder table statements waiting.
   
   Solution
   
   A special "for read only" instruction when issuing sql select
   statements to the views can be used to alleviate this problem
   since maximo doesn't directly update views

   ****************************************************************
   Long running sqls to wochange and woactivity views can keep the
   update to workorder waiting on db2, which causes 911 errors.
