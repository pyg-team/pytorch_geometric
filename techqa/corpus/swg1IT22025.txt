APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The remote Integration Node is configured to use a cipher suite
   which is supported but not enabled by default. For instance
   SSL_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
   
   The toolkit fails to connect to the remote Integration Node with
   a 'no cipher suites in common' error. This change allows the
   toolkit to connect and automatically set the required cipher
   suite.
