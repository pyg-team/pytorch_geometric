QUESTION
 How can I improve the performance when working with Operational Decision Management Rule Designer or WebSphere ILOG JRules Rule Studio? 

ANSWER
 

When working with Rule Designer or Rule Studio, you can improve performance in a number of ways, depending on your use case: 

 * Make sure you provide adequate heap size to Rule Studio and Rule Designer. It is normal to set a maximum heap size of 1024MB . For large projects this value can be higher. In JRules 7.1 and earlier it is set in <install>/shared/bin/build.xml in the ant target runrulestudio in the property eclipse.memory.flag and it defaults to 1024m. In ODM 7.5 and later, it is set in the <install>/eclipse.ini file with a line such as -Xmx1024m. Also make sure you have set the initial heap size to a reasonable amount (such as 512MB), using the JVM argument -Xms. 
 * Improve the Build performance [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21430585] of the Rule Project. 
 * Improve the response time when editing a large decision table [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400593]. 
 * Improve ruleset parsing performance while debugging [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21444782]. 
 * Improve performance when synchronizing [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21425548] with WODM Decision Center or Rule Team Server (RTS). 
 * Improve performance when conducting Decision Validation Services (DVS) tests [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21588859]. 
 * Improve performance while migrating a rule project [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21504807] to a newer version of the product. 
 * Run Rule Studio with 64-bit Java SDK [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21427022] or Rule Designer with 64-bit Java SDK [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.decisions/pdf/wodm_installing.pdf], to help building large projects if memory runs scarce.
