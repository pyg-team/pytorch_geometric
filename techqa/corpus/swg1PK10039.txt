APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Connection is not removed once it has failed.
   I am testing our product's network reliability and failover
   support. Part of my testing is to have our client
   application (Workplace Client) operate when we lose the
   network or connectivity to our servers, or in this case a
   firewall blocking access.
   I am using our application as one would normally do, then
   enabling the Internet Lock feature of Zone Alarm which will
   prevent outgoing traffic.
   The ORB is correctly seeing this as a FAILURE, however,
   the ORB does not recover once the Internet access is
   re-enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Client side ORB Connections are not purged from the
   connection pool if the connection is blocked by the firewall
   Every time client tries to connect to the server same bad
   connection is received from the pool resulting in
   TRANSIENT Exception. The client needs to be restarted in
   order to communicate with the server.

 *  The problem has been fixed nad the fix will be available
   as a part of the Following releases
