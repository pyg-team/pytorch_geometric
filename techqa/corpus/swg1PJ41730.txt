APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In January 2014 (or shortly thereafter), Oracle and IBM will be
   releasing new JREs.
   The warnings concerning manifest attributes that currently
   appear in the java console will turn into hard errors and
   applets will cease to run.
   
   In addition, the applet signing should now be done with a newer
   JRE that uses SHA-2 digests rather than the older SHA-1 digests.
