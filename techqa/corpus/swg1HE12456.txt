APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After the Domino template is enabled for IBM Content Collector
   4.0, it is no longer possible to open another person's calendar
   although read access to the calender is granted. Instead, the
   error message "You are not authorized to perform this
   operation." is displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  n/a
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0, automatic document
   retrieval is also supported for delegate users. This function
   requires running a specific Java agent. If the delegate user did
    not have the required access rights to run the agent, the
   described error occurred.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with this fix, IBM Content Collector checks the access
   rights of delegate users. If they have only read access to the
   agent, the agent is not run, and automatic document retrieval is
    not enabled for those delegate users.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Fixed in 4.0.1.2-IBM-ICC-FP002
