Title: IBM Migration of the DB2 database during the upgrade to SUA 9.2 can fail because of insufficient transaction log size - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 During the migration of DB2 database from any previous version of SUA 9.x to SUA 9.2, the migration might fail due to an insufficient size of the transaction log. The issue affects only migration of the database and only on DB2. ILMT 9.2 is not affected. 

CONTENT
All customer who are using SUA 9.x (lower than 9.2) might be affected. In order to avoid the problem, triple the transaction log size. The transaction log size can be reduced after the migration succeeds. 

If you already started the migration of the DB2 database and it failed, you can verify whether this was caused by the size of the transaction log by checking the tema.log:

If the migration fails, the rollback will restore the previous schema of the database. However, in order to fully recover, triple the size of the transaction log and start the migration again.
