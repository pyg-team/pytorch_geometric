ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Murray included me on an email on the cc list.  At that point my
   address is
   fine.  Su-Ju then replied to all with Mime set as the
   preference.  My email was
   changed to
    Robert_W_Ryder/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS@us.ibm.com.   I was still
   able to receive
   the email.   I then replied to all and 2 things went wrong.
   
   When I sent the email my address was changed to
   Robert_W_Ryder/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS<CN=Robert_W_Ryder/OU=Lexingto
   n/O=IBM%IBMUS@us
   .ibm.com> after I hit send,  as was Paul Hantman so issue 1 and
   2 are not
   related.
   I then received an NDR
   
   Before I create an SPR can we talk about it and determine the
   root cause?
   
   Thanks

   I don't think we have this environment installed here now.  Jack
   Dam from
   Calendar team used do some Globalization test, since we no
   longer have him, so
   I don't know if anyone took over the task.

   To help figure out where this SEV 1 PMR belongs I need a system
   running
   Traditional Chinese Windows XP.    So does anyone know who might
   have a
   Traditional Chinese install of Windows XP or where I could get
   one?
   Thanks,
   
   Murray

   Reproducing step:
   Select the mail sent from Murray from the attachment db
   Suju has location set up to 'direct to internet' in 'Mail
   tab\Sent outgoing
   mail' field
   Suju Reply to All  --> Bob and Paul 's addr is still right as in
   Pic 1
   When Bob or Paul Open my mail --> Their addr will get changed to
   like
   'Paul_C_Hantman/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS@us.ibm.com, '
   When they reply my mail ---> Their addr will be like
   'Paul_C_Hantman/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS@us.ibm.com, '
                                                    --> then they
   will recieve NDR
                                                    ---> yet,  I
   can still receive
   the mail sent by Paul, when I open that mail it's display w/
   ''Paul_C_Hantman/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS@us.ibm.com, ' in CC field,
   Sender field
   is OK  ( as in Pic 2)
   
   *** I also sent new msgs to Paul, either using his Notes addr,
   or email addr
   'pchantma@us.ibm.com' through SMTP server as well, he can reply
   it successfully.
           Send a new msg to
   'Paul_C_Hantman/Lexington/IBM%IBMUS@us.ibm.com' will
   get NDR .
   
   I've attached the mail I received from Murray, and the msg from
   my Sent folder
   that I did 'Reply to All' on Murray's mail, into a Sample db
   'RyderNDR.nsf'.
   And attached this db to the spr attachement db.  The Addrss of
   Bob and Paul,
   looks right in those two mail.
