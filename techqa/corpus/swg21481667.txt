Title: IBM Where can I find logs? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I need to find logs for Deployment Manager, Modeler and C&DS/PES(3.5) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
INSTALL LOGS:
- log.txt: Install Shield places log.txt in root of installation directory
- Setup.log: spssinc/<install dir>/log/setup.log (creator is setup.bat that is run automatically after setup)
- setupinfo.xml: spssinc/enterprise repository/platform/setupinfo.xml (creator is setup.bat that is run automatically after setup)

C&DS SERVER: (Application dependant i.e. Jboss, Oracle, Websphere etc.)
a) When running a PES/C&DS job, and there is an SQL issue between the application server and the database this information should be logged as:
- Server.log: <JBoss installation directory>/server/default/log
- PES.log: This is the name for all other application servers located within the application install directory

b) When running a job and there is an issue between the Clementine/Modeler Server and the database, multiple places exist to review logs.
* The log (SQL) information should be logged in the job history.
* SQL trace information can be obtained from setting odbc trace on within Unix ODBC.ini or MS odbc administrator.
NOTE: ensure to restart your Modeler Server after applying these updates within UNIX.

PEM/Deployment Manager thick client:
- spssemgr.log: documents and settings\username\application data\spssinc\enterprise repository

DEPLOYMENT MANAGER: 
C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\SPSSInc\Deployment Manager
Win 2008
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\SPSSInc\Deployment Manager

CLEMENTINE/MODELER:
With the Clementine or Modeler Server /options/options.cfg file the following values can be set to Y in order to log information within /log/Messages.log file. If the /log directory does not exist, create it and logging will be enabled.

log_database_access, N
log_database_errors, N
log_directory, "" -> means default /log directory.
log_file_access, N
log_file_errors,
