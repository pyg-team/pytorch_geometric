If you intend to connect a CICS TS V5.2 CICSPlex System Manager address space (CMAS) to a previous version of CICS TS CMAS, you need to apply the PTF(s) for the following APAR(s) to each downlevel CMAS:  * PI17725 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI17725] and PM98212 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM98212] for CICS TS V5.1 
 * PI17724 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI17724] for CICS TS V4.1 and V4.2 
 * PI17723 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI17723] for CICS TS V3.2 
 * PI17722 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI17722] for CICS TS V3.1
   


The CICSPlex SM Web User Interface (WUI) can be used with browsers that support HTML V4. The WUI is stabilized and you are encouraged to use the CICS Explorer as noted in "Stabilization of support and discontinued functions" in the CICS TS V5.1 announcement letter [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS212-325].

The system requirements for CICS Explorer are listed at http://www.ibm.com/software/products/cics-explorer [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/cics-explorer]. If you are using the CICS Explorer V5.2.0.0 or later with CICS TS V5.1, V4.2, or V4.1, you need to apply the PTF(s) for the following APAR(s) to each previous version:  * PI15827 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI15827] for CICS TS V5.1
