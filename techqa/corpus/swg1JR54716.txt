APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) does not enable you to set
   the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header that allows administrators to define
   whether and how IBM BPM user interface content can be embedded
   in HTML iframes on either the same or other domains.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  No additional information is available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix that adds a feature for setting the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header
   in HTTP responses will be available in the IBM BPM V8.5.0.2 fix
   pack and is available in IBM BPM starting with V8.5.6.
   
   In V8.5.0.2, a per server Java Virtual Machine (JVM) custom
   property named "com.ibm.bpm.security.xframeoptionsheader" was
   added. The value of this property is injected as the value of
   the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header. Set this value to SAMEORIGIN to
   allow users to embed IBM BPM user interfaces in iframes from the
   same origin. For example, a coach can be embedded in an iframe
   within IBM Process Portal. If you must embed IBM BPM user
   interface content in other origins, add these domains to a
   whitelist by using the ALLOW-FROM notation.
   
   For more information about clickjacking and the X-FRAME-OPTIONS
   header, see "Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet" at
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet]
   .
   
   In V8.5.6.0, a deployment environment level custom property
   replaces the per JVM custom property. You can set this property
   by using wsadmin scripting as shown in the following example:
   
   AdminTask.setBPMProperty(['-de', 'De1', '-name',
   'ProcessServer.XFrameOptionsHeaderValue', '-value',
   'SAMEORIGIN'])
