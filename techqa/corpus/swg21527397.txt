PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 'Error: Message: Caught XML parser fatal error - The reference to entity "J" must end with the ';' delimiter' when importing an XML file through Resource Manager. 

SYMPTOM
Error: Message: Caught XML parser fatal error - The reference to entity "J" must end with the ';' delimiter' when importing an XML file through Resource Manager.


CAUSE
The import file contains characters that are pre-defined entities in XML and the characters are not in their entity format. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


There are five pre-defined entities in XML: Ampersand (&), Quote ("), Apostrophe ('), Less than (<), and Greater Than (>). These characters must appear in their entity format when used in an XML file and are not used as markup.

Modify the XML file and change the characters to the entity format.
