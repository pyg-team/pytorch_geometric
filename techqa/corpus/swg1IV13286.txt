APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "We use TPM 7.2.0.1 to provision servers in our VMware v4.1
   virtualization environment. Whole environment is managed
   under one virtual center 4.1.0 build 258902.
   All esx hosts are v4.1 as well.
   We have daily scheduled VMware Virtual Center Discovery to
   sync real world with DCM inventory. We use HostPlatform.
   CreateVirtualServerAndSoftwareStack to provision new VMs
   from existing VMware template. We use cluster's id as
   HostPlatformID parameter not ESX's.
   Sometimes (not always, non deterministic), we encounter
   such a problem:
   the provisioned server, being under the same cluster with
   the template, has the same mac address with the template it
   cloned from. In next discovery, tpm thinks this two
   distinct servers (one template and one virtual machine)
   as one.
   Then, the next time we want to provision a server from
   that template, it fails due to the fact that tpm does not
   see it as a template (err msg: Before deployment, you
   must convert the virtual server back to VMware template.)"
   
   So, in summary, our problem is the confusion of TPM
   inventory due to mac address conflicts in VMware environment.
   
   This effects us in three
   ways:
   
   i. Once there is a conflict for a vmware template, the
   computer definition for that template becomes corruptedon
   TPM, and then that template becomes unusable for provisioning.
   We need to convert it to a vm, change it' mac address,
   convert back to template and rediscover it again in order to
   fix. That results outages in virtual machine automation
   which cause both delays (low service quality) and need of
   extra manual work (high service cost)
   
   ii. As there may be duplicate mac addresses, there is no
   guarantee that we act on true server via TPM. As we have
   no trust, we are not able to automate any operation on
   existing systems such as deprovisioning or
   (un)installing software on (degraded capability)
   
   iii. After we provision a vm (using
   VMware_VI3_VirtualMachine_CloneAdvanced as we encountered
   so far), it may get same mac address of an existing
   template. The computer definition for that vm gets corrupted
   and TPM is not able to power up (using Device.PowerOn) just
   after provisioning the vm (instability)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  No Workaround
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is fixed and set to be available in TPM
   7.2.1-IF00001
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix will be in TPM 7.2.1-IF0001
