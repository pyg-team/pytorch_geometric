ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When attempting to select multiple contributors for the same
   mergepoint, the second selected contributor's lines will be
   concatenated into a a single line, and placed at the end of the
   first contributor's lines. If there are lines FOLLOWING that
   merge point, they will also be added to the end of the line
   until the next unresolved merge point is encountered.
   Steps to reproduce:
   1) use the (soon to be attached files for this)
   2) run cleartool merge -graphical -base basefile.txt -out
   outfile.txt file1.txt file2.txt
       (/main/1, /main/dev2/5, and /main/dev1/5 versions of the
   customer's test file, respectively)
   3) Go to the first merge point and select the "2" and "3"
   buttons in the merge tool, in that order.
   4) Go to the second merge point and select buttons "3" and "2",
   in that order (You could use the other order, but the order I
   mention will show the issue more dramatically)
   If you click around enough at step 3, the line between the
   merge points will also get added to the first mergepoint, and
   the infamous "<<merge needed>>" will be added to the file.
