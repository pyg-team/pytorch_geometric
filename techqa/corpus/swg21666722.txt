--------------


CAUSE
The probe is unable to connect to the target EMS Server due to the security constraints for the user defined by SAMServerUserName .

The probe uses the property JMSAuthentication to enable JMS Authentication, and the user given by SAMServerUserName needs to have the correct permissions within the Alcatel SAM's JMS Server to connect and read the data the probe requires.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You should verify with your SAM Administrator that the user has sufficient permission to the JMS session and there is nothing blocking the connection from the probe side.
