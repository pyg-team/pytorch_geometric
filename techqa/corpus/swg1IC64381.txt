ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The following exception is seen when using the SAP adapter
   wizard shipped with the WMB Toolkit on Linux
   
   com.ibm.adapter.framework.BaseException
   
   Reason:
   
   JCO.classInitialize(): Could not load middleware
   layer 'com.sap.mw.rfc.MiddlewareRFC'.....cannot open shared
   abject
   file: No such file directory
   
   CO.classInitialize(): Could not load middleware
   layer 'com.sap.mw.jco.rfc.MiddlewareRFC'
   JCO.nativeInit(): Could not initialize dynamic link library
   sapjcorfc
   
   [sapjcorfc (librfccm.so: cannot open shared object file: No
   such file or directory)].
   java.library.path

LOCAL FIX
 *  In order to use adapters on Linux, you have to set path for
   shared libraries using LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables and put the SAP
   libraries sapjco.jar, librfccm.so, libsapjcorfc.so in the
   directory pointed to by this path variable and invoke toolkit
   from the same window. You can verify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   setting by typing env in the window.
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/path
   
   type 'env' and you should see it set.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit users of the SAP adapter
   wizard on Linux.
   
   Platforms Affected:

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   exception generated when using the SAP adapter wizard shipped
   with WMB Toolkit on Linux
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The infocenter will be updated to state:
   
   In order to use adapters on Linux, a user has to set the path
   for shared libraries using LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables and put
   the SAP libraries sapjco.jar, librfccm.so, libsapjcorfc.so in
   the directory pointed to by this path variable and invoke
   toolkit from the same window.
   A user can verify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting by typing env in
   the window.
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/path
   
   type 'env' and the display should show it set.
