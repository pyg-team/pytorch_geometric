APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Have both upper case values of A, B and C as well as lower case
   values of a, b and c on the Oracle 11g database.  These values
   have different meaning and therefore a lower case "a" and an
   upper case "A" need to be distinguished.  Using the pick list
   filter in Query Studio will retrieve the correct value if you
   select lower case "a" but when you return to the filter it has
   upper case "A" checked off instead of the lower case "a".  It
   should have the lower case "a" checked off.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This UI behavior is due to limitations in the user interface -
   specifically, the inability of the interface to understand that
   it should differentiate between two similar letters such as 'A'
   and 'a'. In most circumstances this would not be an issue as the
   majority case is case insensitive data where 'A' = 'a'. At issue
   is a restriction that the UI does not understand that it should
   operate in a case sensitive fashion - as this is specified on
   the data source connection. Unfortunately, the data source
   connection information is not available at the UI layer due to
   the underlying architecture of the BI product ad therefore, we
   are unable to address this problem.
