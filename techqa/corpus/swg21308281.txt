QUESTION
 Can IBM速 Installation Manager be installed on a UNIX速 or Linux速 NFS mounted disk? 

ANSWER
Do not install the IBM Installation Manager on an NFS mounted disk. 

On AIX速 for example, some of the JRE folders are not being deleted when the IBM Installation Manager uninstalls but is deleted after waiting for 10 minutes. This causes the JRE folder to not be uninstalled during an uninstall operation. Other UNIX and Linux operating systems have similar issues. 

Only install the Installation Manager on a local disk.
