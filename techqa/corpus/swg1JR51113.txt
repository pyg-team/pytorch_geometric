   plug-ins in was_home/BPM/Lombardi/lib and was_home/plugins.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that uses the latest
   version of WebSphere Application server plug-ins for the
   DBUpgrade class path so that you no longer receive the
   ClassNotFoundException.
