   Description of Problem (full details)
   Customer is asking me if IDM Webservices is limited to only one
   IIS Worker Process and then manage the pool of threads itself
   or can he add up to 4 IIS Worker Process?
   This is mentioned in the performance guide sheet, however this
   guide is about IIS 5, and the customer is using Windows 2003
   SP2 and IDM WS 4.0.2 with IIS 6.
   I couldn't find any performance tuning guide for IIS 6.
