QUESTION
 
What causes RPT script playback to be irregular? For example, scripts that are scheduled to run every 15 minutes sometimes skip a playback interval. Other times, scripts sometimes play back 5 or 10 minutes after the last scheduled playback. 

ANSWER

Use the Application Availability Trend graph for a specific script to spot gaps in the script's response-time reporting. These gaps appear as white lines in the graph -- indicating that no response time metrics are reported during that aggregation interval.

A script skips the current iteration if it is running over into the next interval. Normally, HTTP RPT scripts start xx minutes after the start of the last playback, where xx is the playback interval configured in the profile.

If the number of retries is not zero in the profile, the script may try to restart the playback. In that scenario, when a retry occurs, the previous playback time is discarded. This behavior can result in the irregular playback intervals that you observe. As a side effect, this behavior may also explain why you do not observe timeout errors or high response time values for a given script.

Recommended Solution

1) Set the number of retries in the profile to zero.

2) Set the timeout value in the profile to a very high value that is less than or equal to the playback interval. This technique ensures that the RPT engine times out the script, if necessary, instead of ITCAM. You do not want ITCAM to timeout the script in the middle of a playback.

3) Increase the playback interval (for example, from 15 minutes to 20 to 30 minutes).

Note: If you observe that RPT scripts skip a playback interval or play back at irregular intervals, check the following conditions:

_ Ensure that the agent is not stopped.

_ Check whether a new copy of the script is exported from RPT workbench during the irregular playback interval.

_ Verify that there are no profile changes to the script playback criteria at the time the script skipped a playback or played back at an irregular interval.

Other Contributing Factors

If you observe that the response-time gaps appear to be regular, refer to the following technote:

If you observe random gaps in RPT playbacks on Windows 7 and Windows 2008 platforms under ITCAM for Transactions 7.3, this issue may be a product defect. Consider upgrading to ITCAM for Transactions 7.4, or to the latest interim fix under ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 FP01.
