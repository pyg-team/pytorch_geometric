 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you configure IIS to redirect http://server/ase [http://server/ase] to https://server/ase [https://server/ase] when accessing the console of IBM Security AppScan Enterprise? 

CAUSE
You change ASE configuration to be accessed through HTTPS instead of HTTP. 

However, your current users still the ASE console through HTTP, and you would like your users still get access without updating the URL. 

ANSWER
This needs to be configured in IIS as follows: 


 1. Add the "URL Rewriting" module to IIS 
 2. Add redirection on the "Default Web Site" level as described here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975341 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975341] 
 3. Uncheck the “Require SSL” option for the /ase folder as suggested here in step #4: http://ruslany.net/2009/04/10-url-rewriting-tips-and-tricks/ [http://ruslany.net/2009/04/10-url-rewriting-tips-and-tricks/]
    


As a result, the IIS will redirect the following URLs: 
- http://server/ase [http://server/ase] 
- http://server/ [http://server/] 
- https://server/ [https://server/] 

to: 
- https://server/ase [https://server/ase]
