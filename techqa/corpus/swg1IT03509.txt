APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IWD installation is failing the step "IWD Init" with the
   message:"Command Timeout Exception".
   This problem occurs when IPv6 (INET6) is disabled on the SCO
   system.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  IPV6 is not required for SCO. Changing the listener address in
   "overrides.config" file from "::" to "0.0.0.0" could be used as
   a workaround.
   Edit  /opt/ibm/rainmaker/purescale.app/config/overrides.config
   /config/kernelservice/url="https://127.0.0.1:9443"
   /config/http/port=80
   /config/https/port=443
   /config/http/ipAddress = "::"
   /config/zso/jvmargs = [     "-Xms1024M",     "-Xmx1024M"]
   and change to:
   /config/kernelservice/url="https://127.0.0.1:9443"
   /config/http/port=80
   /config/https/port=443
   /config/http/ipAddress = "0.0.0.0"
   /config/zso/jvmargs = [     "-Xms1024M",     "-Xmx1024M"]
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Smart Cloud Orchestrator 2.3 FP1 fails when IPv6 is disabled on
   Smart Cloud Orchestrator  system. Pattern Deployer component in
   such a case is not able to start properly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  IPV6 is not required for SCO. Changing the listener address in
   "overrides.config" file from "::" to "0.0.0.0" could be used as
   a workaround.
   Edit /opt/ibm/rainmaker/purescale.app/config/overrides.config
   /config/kernelservice/url="
   https://127.0.0.1:9443"
   /config/http/port=80
   /config/https/port=443
   /config/http/ipAddress = "::"
   /config/zso/jvmargs = [ "-Xms1024M", "-Xmx1024M"]
   and change to:
   /config/kernelservice/url="
   https://127.0.0.1:9443"
   /config/http/port=80
   /config/https/port=443
   /config/http/ipAddress = "0.0.0.0"
   /config/zso/jvmargs = [ "-Xms1024M", "-Xmx1024M"]
