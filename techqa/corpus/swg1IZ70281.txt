APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  "documentation - the header on the
   
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v31r1/index.js
   p?topic= [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v31r1/index.jsp?topic=]
   doc says ILMT Version
   7.2 - I will file this as a documentation defect."
   
   "As a follow on question, how do I control the hardware scan
   schedule
   if
   this is not a configurable parameter?"
   The parameter which allow to set this is called
   "sys_update_period" -
   and yes the name may be confusing, but it is called in this way
   from a long time (I believe from TLCM 1.1 release).
   But they checked the current infocenter for LMT 7.2 and noticed
   that
   there
   is no information what the 'sys_update_period' parameter means..
   They
   will
   open a defect for documentation and this param probably will be
   described in 'Agent settings'  section:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v31r1/index.js
   p?topic= [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v31r1/index.jsp?topic=]
   /com.ibm.license.mgmt.planinconf.doc/r_agt_parameters_in_databas
   e.html
   
   Below parameters:
   *hw_scan_enabled
   *hw_inv_start
   *hw_inv_rate_type
   *hw_inv_rate_value
   are used only in TAD4D, and this are setting for lets called it
   a "full
   hardware scan" (or 'hardware inventory scan') - this scan
   provides a
   lot more information that the normal hardware scan does (there
   are
   information e.g. about network devises connected to
   servers/details RAM
   information/BIOS information/Motherboard information/Storage
   information(logical/physical drives)/Media Adapters/Displays
   etc...).
   But again they noticed that in Agent settings section for LMT
   this
   parameters are listed - they will open another documentation
   defect to
   remove this params from that section.

   the  server database > Agent settings' contains incorrect agent
   parameters. The following parameters are applicable
   only for TAD4D and will be removed from documentation:
   *hw_scan_enabled
   *hw_inv_start_date
   *hw_inv_rate_type
   *hw_inv_rate_value
   *native_scan_enabled
   ********************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Refer to updated documentation (see
   Conclusions section).
   ********************************************************
