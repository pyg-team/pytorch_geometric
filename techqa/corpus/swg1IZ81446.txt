APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Netcool/Impact 5.1.1 (both base build and Fix Pack 1) attempting
   to replicate a DataType with a USERPARMETERS property value in
   excess of ~16,300 characters fails upon encountering the
   parameter and the Secondary ImpactServer DataType .type file
   is truncated and contains the line:
   
   Error=500: Mark invalid
   
   instead of the USERPARMETERS property.  This adversely affects
   both resilience and the operation of the Secondary ImpactServer
   in load balancing as the DataType is rendered useless on the
   Secondary ImpactServer and any drop and recovery of the
   Primary ImpactServer would lose the correct configuration all
   together.
   
   The USERPARAMETERS property is the record of the fields in the
   target database table that mapped by the DataType.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  A workaround, and best practice, is to only map the fields
   required by the DataType/Policy for Impact to perform its
   function.  However, this is vulnerable to edits of the DataType
   that require a refresh of the table mapping - the entire table
   is pulled in and unwanted fields would have to be removed again
   (tedious operation that increases the potential for
   misconifguration).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If The data type is configured with large number of fields that
   may cause USERPARAMETERS value to exceed 16K bytes, The
   secondary replication will not be able to copy the file.
   Instead, it will print "Mark Invalid" in the file.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue is fixed in IBM Netcool/Impact 5.1.1.1 Interim Fix
   0001
   5.1.1.1-TIV-NCI-IF0001
