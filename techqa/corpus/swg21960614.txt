Title: IBM Security Bulletin:  Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM Java shipped with IBM Notes and Domino (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Java is shipped as a component of both IBM Notes and Domino. The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol may affect IBM Java. The IBM Notes and Domino native implementation of TLS is not affected. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM Java shipped with IBM Notes and Domino (CVE-2015-4000) is also tracked as SPR# KLYH9Y7PWX. 


Refer to the JVM tabs in the technotes linked below for download links to a single standalone Java patch that addresses this vulnerability for 9.0.1 Fix Pack 4 (plus Interim Fix), and 8.5.3 Fix Pack 6 (plus Interim Fixes). 


 * Interim Fixes for 9.0.1.x versions of IBM Notes, Domino, iNotes & Notes Browser Plug-in [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21657963] (technote 1657963)

 * Interim Fixes for 8.5.3 Fix Pack 6 versions of IBM Notes, Domino & iNotes [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663874] (technote 1663874)



Customers on earlier releases may open a Service Request with IBM Support [https://www-947.ibm.com/support/servicerequest/Home.action]and reference SPR KLYH9Y7PWX for custom fix. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Set https.cipherSuites jvm property to exclude DHE cipher suites. You can add jvm property settings in the following locations: 



 * For Notes clients, <Notes Installation>\framework\rcp\deploy\jvm.properties 
 * For Domino server, <Domino Installation>\jvm\lib\security\java.security 


Example settings:  * vmarg.Dciphers=-Dhttps.cipherSuites=TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * https.cipherSuites=https.cipherSuites=
 * TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV


These settings disable DHE ciphers in HTTPSConnections. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
