ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  All ncp_* processes are installed on Win2008 except ncp_mib.bat
   or ncp_mib.exe. We used ncp_mib from another Unix Server in
   the same environment to point to the Win2008 NCIM database
   and load the $PRECISION_HOME/mibs to the database.
   Refer to the technote below for the workaround details
   Detail notes below:
   Note: No Service called ncp_mib
   No BAT or EXE for ncp_mib:
   C:\IBM\Tivoli>dir ncp_mib.bat /s
    Volume in drive C has no label.
    Volume Serial Number is C46E-30BB
   File Not Found
   C:\IBM\Tivoli>
   C:\IBM\Tivoli>dir ncp_mib.exe /s
    Volume in drive C has no label.
    Volume Serial Number is C46E-30BB
   File Not Found
   C:\IBM\Tivoli>

   From: KK
   
   That's because, you are on a distributed install
   and you are looking at core components server.
   The ncp_mib will go as part of GUI components...
   so look at TIP server for mib bat file.
   
   AND
   From ST
   &#65530; If you still have the installer files, you should
   be able to get ncp_mib from
   INSTALLER/\COI\PackageSteps\FIPS_server\FILES\
   FIPS_server-Win32-<version>.zip

   INSTALLER/\COI\PackageSteps\FIPS_server\FILES
   \FIPS_server-Win32-<version>.zip
   
   Well, first of all, note that "PackageSteps" does
   not exist under the current Web GUI 7.3
   install media directory.  And, 2nd note that
   neither does the
   "FIPS_server-Win32-<version>.zip
   file show up either.  Refer below.
   There is an eWAS ZIP file

   extracted
   package.

   Note: This BAT file does not look like a ncp_mib.bat file ...
   The contents show this BAT file to be related to JAVA
   Properties files and not to processing MIBs into the NCIM

   There is an eWAS/FILES directory and there
   is a eWAS-Win32-6.1.0.21.zip file there...
   but there is NO ncp_mib.bat file in the ZIP file
   There is an mb2mdb.bat file in the bin directory of
   the extracted files/directories, but it looks exactly
   like the one above and does not involve loading
   MIBs into NCIM ncmib database.
   Here are the download files as they exist on Xtreme Leve
   (and I assume Passport Advantage).

   Note: Installs on Win2003 seem to lay down ncp_mib.bat,
   but installs on Win2008 do not..  Customer rep has
   Win2008 and lighthouse is Win2008 as well ...and both
   exhibit the problem of the missing bat file.  I used
   DB2 and customer rep used mysql ...
   
   We have a workaround...we used ncp_mib from a Unix Serve
   and pointed it to the Windows database and loaded the
   MIBs that way...so we do not have to hurry on
   researching this at this point..but request an APAR
   to document fully how to install on Win2008 from the
   media (not using silent installs.. or special
   Installer media references ??)
   
   Action Plan: placing back on itnml3,13k for L3 comment
   and update on request for APAR for missing ncp_mib
   functionality on Windows.  Duplicated on Lighthouse.
