APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  No method profile data is seen when a "Data Collector
   Configuration"  that has an empty "Exclude (Classname)" list is
   used for the DC.   Though having no class names in this list
   would suggest all classes in the JVM are being monitored, the
   effect seems to be the oppposite.
   
   Note that this is the configuration that is selected when a DC
   initially joins the Managing server  to specify which classes
   need to be monitored. Examples of out-of-box configuration
   supplied are "J2EE Default", "J2SE Default",  "Tomcat Default".
   
   
   Users Affected:
   All ITCAM for WebSphere/J2EE Managing server users
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Local Fix/Workaround:
   Have the standard classes in the exclude list similar to J2EE
   Default configuration.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   *
   * ITCAM users using Method profiling at MOD L2 or MOD L3
   * monitoring level to view method-level data.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   *
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   *
   * If a custom data collector configuration that has empty
   * "Exclude(Classname)" list in the Managing server's
   * "Data collector configuration list" under Administration
   * menu, all classes are excluded from method profiling
   * and L3 data collection.
   *
   * This exclude list ignores method entry/exit events
   * generated by execution of the listed classes.  An empty
   * list would state that none of the classes would be
   * excluded.  However, the opposite was happening in that
   * all the classes were excluded and no method entry/exit
   * data was collected for the selected Data collector.
   *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   releases:
   
     | interim fix | 7.1.0.2-TIV-ITCAMAD-IF0006
     | interim fix | 6.1.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_MP-IF0001
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Use at least a single class specification in the exclude list,
   whose class is not likely to be present in the system.
