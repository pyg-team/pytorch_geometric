Title: IBM DataStage Designer screen hangs when Help button is used - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DataStage Designer screen hangs when Help button is used or when you use Infocenter URL or F1 (anyway of invoking the Information Center) 

CAUSE
Using the Help button from a DataStage client will open 6000 files in 8.1. So if the ulimit is set 
too low for nfiles, it will hang the client. The default for nfiles is generally set to 1024 as a default on Unix/Linux platforms. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Make sure you don't have any ulimit overrides set in dsenv in $DSHOME - if you do remove them. 

 2. Make the change immediately to resolve this issue and then follow step #3 for permanent solution.
a. Stop DataStage and Websphere as root 
b. Issue the command - ulimit -n 10240 
c, Verified nofiles in ulimit is set to 10240 
d. Start Websphere and then DataStage 
For Linux platforms, please follow Steps #4 and #5 otherwise, follow step #3.
3. Please have your system administrator change the the .bash_profile for 
root to include ulimit -n 10240. 
As long as you stop/restart WAS as root (not sudo, but the actual root user), this will propogate the 
ulimit setting to the process you are starting (WAS). If you do use sudo or a similiar command, then you will need to work with your system administrator to determine how the non-root user starting WAS can get the correct ulimit settings (i.e. you may need to also adjust that user's profile). 
4. Permanent change to ulimit -n for DataStage and Websphere
This solution is to implement the ulimit -n setting limitation on Linux. 
This solution will be used upon reboot: 
create a file <IS_HOME>/ASBServer/bin/MetadataServer_env.sh with content: 
ulimit -n 10240 
Or if such a file exists, add the above line in it. This file is source by the MetadataServer.sh script, if it exists, before starting WAS. 

You will not need to stop/start WAS to put this solution in place. It will take affect the next time that you reboot.
