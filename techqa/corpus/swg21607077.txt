Title: IBM SPSS Statistics 20 Save' and 'Save as' functions are not working on Mac 10.7 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have a faculty/student version of SPSS Statistics 20.0. I am using the software on a Mac OS X 10.7 operating system. There are times when the Save As function and the Save function are not working as expected. 

I just tried opening several data sets and some appear to execute the 'Save As' function just fine whereas others do not. When I click Save As, no dialogue box opens to provide the option of naming the file and saving. The Save function is also not working (it works occasionally but not always).

I am not running any firewalls or anti-virus software. I checked the Activity Monitor, and there is nothing there that should be interfering.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM SPSS Technical Support was unable to replicate this problem. 

It has been determined that if the customer switches their 'Look and Feel' setting from "Macintosh" to "SPSS Standard", this issue was resolved.

- Click Edit drop down menu, select Options.
- In General tab, change the "Look and Feel" setting from "Macintosh" to "SPSS Standard".
- Close the Options dialog window.

Save and Save as functions should now work as expected in all datasets.
