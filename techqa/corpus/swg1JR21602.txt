APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  * Cust reporting the installation failed because the path was  *
   * was larger than 1024. The path statement was actually less   *
   * than 1024 if the system variables were translated, such as   *
   * %snaroot% to c:\IBMCS which would be 8 vs 9 chars. After the *
   * error is acknowledged, the path statement is replaced with a *
   * colon leaving the system unusable.                           *
   *                                                              *

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  * InstallShield fails when it's told to pass a string > 1024   *
   * characters from function to function. This can happen if the *
   * IBMCS directory is added to the end of a very long path      *
   * (greater than 950 characters).                               *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  * Parts registry.rul and setup.ins updated to check for this   *
   * particular situation, so that if a path is already too long, *
   * we abort the installation.                                   *
   * NOTE: There is no apar fix available for 612 customers, but  *
   *       the problem will be resolved in 6.1.3 (CSD3), if there *
   *       is one.                                                *
