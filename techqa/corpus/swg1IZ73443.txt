APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The ITM sensor cannot discover ITM 6.2.2 Windows endpoints which
   do not have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on the ITM
   endpoint.  The error occurs when the TADDM server attempts to
   copy TaddmTool.exe to the Windows target.  The file is copied to
   the target as a Base64-encoded file, but it cannot be decoded on
   the target because there is no JRE to execute the decoder
   classes.
   
   The SessionSensor log contains error messages similar to the
   following:
   
   2010-03-04 15:51:35,107 DiscoverManager [DiscoverWorker-4]
   SessionSensor-10.128.4.103-[-1920] INFO cdb.STDOUT - Error

   - Error
   copying [/opt/IBM/cmdb/dist/lib/ms/gateway//TaddmTool.exe] to
   [C:/WINDOWS/temp/taddm.9pq060/TaddmTool.exe]:
   com.collation.platform.session.SessionClientException:
   CTJTP1308E Unable
   to copy the local file
   /opt/IBM/cmdb/dist/lib/ms/gateway//TaddmTool.exe
   to remote file C:/WINDOWS/temp/taddm.9pq060/TaddmTool.exe.tmp.
   
   No WindowsComputerSystemSensor is executed for this Windows
   target because of the failure to copy TaddmTool.exe.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Copy TaddmWmi.* and TaddmTool.* files from the Windows ITM
   deploy
   directory (e.g. C:\IBM\ITM\TMAITM6) to the TADDM gateway
   directory (e.g.
   C:\WINDOWS\temp\taddm.9pq060).
   
   OR
   
   Install a Java 1.5 Runtime Environment on the ITM endpoint by
   deploying
   an ITM component that requires Java as a prerequisite.  Examples
   of ITM
   components that require Java:
   - TEP Desktop client
   - Summarization and Pruning agent
   - any of the Agentless agents
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ITM 6.2.2 Windows endpoints do not contain a bundled Java
   Runtime Environment (JRE). The ITM Scope sensor relied on a JRE
   on the ITM endpoint to be able to run Java code distributed to
   the endpoint by the TADDM server. Failure to locate a JRE on the
   endpoint in the expected location prevented TADDM from running
   the Java code needed for Windows discovery.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  ITM Scope sensor no longer requires Java Runtime Environment
   (JRE) on target Windows systems.  Beginning in the next MDV,
   Microsoft .Net Framework 1.1 or later must be installed
   on windows targets in order to use the ITM Scope sensor.
