Title: IBM Using custom panels, DotEdit displays snippets inconsistently in IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture - United States

Text:
DotEdit; snippets TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DotEdit does not consistently display snippets when using a custom panel 

SYMPTOM
One or more fields do not have snippets displayed even if data is populated and other clients such as Taskmaster Web show them for the same batch.


CAUSE
This is applicable in certain versions of DotEdit.exe where DotEdit loads panels for multiple forms. Certain fields may be shared across forms, thus resulting in this behavior.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To ensure that your symptoms are applicable to this Technote, make zero changes after replicating the issue and then place the batch on hold. Re-run the batch one or more times and snippets should display every other batch or so. If snippets never display data, then it is likely a separate problem; auto-form all panels if possible to eliminate any customization as the root cause.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For performance reasons it is not desirable for DotEdit to unload and load panels dynamically. Thus to resolve this problem assign a unique Name for all dcimage (snippet) controls on custom panels being used. For example, pre-append the letter 'a' to all dcimage controls in form A, 'b' to those in form B, etc. Backup the DotEdit project files before making changes in case modifications need to be quickly reverted.
