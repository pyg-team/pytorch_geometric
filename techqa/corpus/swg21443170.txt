QUESTION
 How do you configure Microsoft IIS V7 on Microsoft Windows 2008 or 2012 (which includes both Microsoft Windows 2008 (32-bit) with IIS V7 and Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 (64-bit) with IIS V7.5 and Windows 2012) for IBM Rational Host On-Demand 11? 

ANSWER
Prior to installing Host On-Demand on a Microsoft Windows 2008 or 2012 with IIS V7 or V7.5, IIS must be configured to include the IIS 6 Management Compatibility role. 

To do this, follow these steps: 

 1. Select Start > Administrative Tools > Server Manager.
    
    
 2. Expand Roles on the left navigation bar. 
    
    
 3. Right click on Web servers (IIS) > Add Role Services.
    
    
 4. Scroll to Management Services
    
    
 5. Select subset IIS 6 Management Compatibility to install. 
    This will auto-select all sub-items in IIS 6 Management Compatibility and should remain selected.
    
    
 6. Complete the install of this service.
    


Additionally, the mime types need to be defined in IIS. Refer to Downloading clients from Host On-Demand server on Windows 2008 or 2012 servers results in error 'Page not found [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21423830] '.
