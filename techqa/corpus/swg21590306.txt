QUESTION
 
You created a simple RFT script. The script fails to play back, and you observe the following message in the trace-robotic log. What next steps do you need to take?

BWMGW0154E Script playback failed. User interaction with desktop detected. 

ANSWER

The TEP and the trace-robotic log flag this type of event as a 'Generic Failure'. The script fails to playback and fails to post response-time data in the TEP (Tivoli Enterprise Portal).

eventType=GENERIC_FAILURE, eventDetail=BWMGW0154E Script playback failed. User interaction with desktop detected.

The trace-robotic log appears in the Tivoli Common Logs directory. The following are the default locations:

Unix\Linux: /var/ibm/tivoli/common/BWM/logs

Windows: In ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 and prior releases:

C:\Program Files\IBM\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\*

In ITCAM for Transactions 7.3 FP01 and later:

%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\ibm\tivoli\common\BWM\logs\* 

Note: Enter the following command in a DOS command prompt to determine the directory pathname.

echo %ALLUSERSPROFILE%

This type of error can be averted by providing a default userid and password in the Windows registry on the Windows playback host. Refer to Related urls below

When you provide the default userid and password in the registry, the system reboots if it becomes unresponsive. Then, the system automatically logs in and unlocks the screen. 

Create the following keys if they do not already exist in the Windows registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon:


 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


For the DefaultUserName and DefaultPassword keys, add a default userid and password to allow the system to reboot, log onto Windows, and unlock the screen. 

For the AutoAdminLogon key, change the value from '0' to '1'. 

Note: User interaction with the desktop blocks Robot and RFT script playbacks when a Remote Desktop Connection has been established on the playback host. If you must log onto the playback host to observe playbacks, use a terminal emulator like VNC, or launch Remote Desktop Connection using the mstsc /console or mstsc /admin command, depending on the version of mstsc. However, you cannot minimize or close the remote desktop window. 

On VM clients, use the VM management tool to log into the VM client's "physical" screen. For VMware vCenter, this is the vSphere client's Launch Virtual Machine Console feature. For VMware workstation, it is the desktop workstation utility. Other VM management systems must have equivalents to log in to the machine directly. RELATED INFORMATION
