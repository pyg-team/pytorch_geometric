APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  LOB values that exceed the inline length are not stored in the
   base row of the table. Instead, they are stored separately in
   the LOB table object. LOB values in the LOB table object are not
   buffered but read by the DB2 engine directly from disk when
   requested. This is called a direct read operation.
   
   Reading and writing larger LOB values from and to disk can be
   time consuming. Therefore the DB2 agent decides based on the
   size of the LOB value if the direct read is performed by the DB2
   agent itself or if it is delegated to the DB2 prefetchers to
   benefit from the ability to read in parallel.
   
   If the LOB read is delegated to the prefetchers the agent has to
   wait for the completion of the prefetch work before it can
   continue. This can lead to a significant wait time if the
   prefetch subsystem is very busy and unable to service the LOB
   prefetch request.
   
   Customers on DB2 10.1 and higher are more likely to experience
   wait times during LOB prefetch during periods of high workload
   because of increased prefetch work from the smart prefetching
   capability. On these releases, NUM_IOSERVER=AUTOMATIC can be too
   low for large systems with high workload when many LOB values
   need to be read or written.
   
   The following changes are effective under DB2_WORKLOAD=SAP:
   1) NUM_IOSERVER=AUTOMATIC is changed to 104 to ensure that
   sufficient prefetchers and prefetch queues are available.
   2) The threshold for the size of a LOB to be prefetched has been
   changed from one extent to the fixed value of 96K.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually set the database configuration paramater NUM_IOSERVER
   to 104.
