ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Precondition:
   Create a prefix to the module in the DOORS. (I have used L2 in
   my example)
   1: Import requirement from DOORS to Rhapsody .
   2: Lets say the one of the requirement is L21
   3: Create a requirement in Rhapsody with same name (L21).
   4: Now create a link from the model element to the imported
   requirement L21.
   5: Export it to DOORS.
   6: Once successfully exported , check in DOORS module for the
   creation of the link.
   7: Come back to Rhapsody , delete the link  and save.
   8: Reload Gateway and export it again.
   9 This time it gives error as below .
       Failure: Can't find link typed '/_Shanu 1/Dependency' from
   'L274 'class_0' (/_Shanu 1/Module_1)' to '77' (/_Shanu
   1/Module_1)
   Failure: Can't delete link from 'GUID
   ed9f8a63-21a9-4d1b-91ef-b92a0c6847f6' to 'GUID
   3c639749-cafa-40b5-80b2-08f672f19368'

COMMENTS
 *  The defect is invalid since there is an improper usage of
   duplicate requirement identifier.
   Problem is in step 3:
   3: Create a requirement in Rhapsody with same name (L21).
