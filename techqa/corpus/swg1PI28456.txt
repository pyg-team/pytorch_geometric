APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed the Statistics 22 and FixPack 1 for release
   22 successfully on a Linux 64 bit distribution such as Debian 7
   or Ubuntu 14.
   The program is running fine with the temporary trial license.
   After that you licensed the product and the License
   Authorization Wizard reported the licensing procedure was
   successful.
   However, when you try to launch 22 FP1 on this Linux 64 bit
   distribution you get an error like the below:
   *** Error in `/opt/IBM/SPSS/Statistics/22/bin/STATISTICS':
   free():
   invalid next size (fast): 0x00007fc5ac009570 ***
   
   Also when you they to run SHOWLIC command you get a similar
   message:
   
   *** Error in `./showlic': free(): invalid next size (fast):
   0x0000000001d56e00 ***
   Aborted (core dumped)
   
   You are already aware of
   APAR PI07348 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07348]: License Authorization Wizard does not launch, and
   our installer says nothing about it
   
   So you installed the relevant 32 bit libraries for your Linux
   distribution as it is mentioned on the APAR text above that the
   licensing mechanism is 32 bit dependent and therefore on a 64
   bit OS you need to install the 32 bit libraries.
   
   After that on some Linux distributions Statistics 22 FP1 is
   running without issues. However, on others Statistics 22 FP1 is
   still not running with 32 bit libraries installed and you get
   the same errors as above.
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development.
   This issue will be addressed in the next Fix Pack. Please refer
   to the Fix Pack schedule at
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599157 for
   information on upcoming Fix Packs
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If you encounter the issue described above please open a Service
   Request with IBM SPSS Technical Support.
   An Interim Fix was developed for customers who need the fix
   prior to the next upcoming Fix Pack.
   
   Please contact Technical Support with reference to APAR PI28456
   and technote 1688405 about about Interim Fix 018
   for IBM SPSS Statistics 22 FP1.
   
   Note: Interim fixes are limited corrections to specific issues
   reported by one or more customers.
   They are normally sent only to customers who have reported one
   of the corrected problems, and who require
   an immediate correction. Interim Fixes do not address customer
   enhancement requests, and not all defect
   corrections can be delivered as Interim Fixes. Due to their
   urgency Interim Fixes undergo only targeted
   testing of specific fixes, not full regression testing. If the
   fix is not urgently required, you may prefer
   to wait for a scheduled Fix Pack Release, which will be fully
   regression tested. Interim Fix corrections, once fully
   regression tested, are automatically included in a future Fix
   Pack.
