Collaboration and Deployment Services (C&DS) 7.0 Issues corrected: Fix List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27046326]

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Use IBM Installation Manager to apply fix pack updates for SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services components. For information about using IBM Installation Manager with IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services, see the IBM Knowledge Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS69YH_7.0.0/cads/knowledge_center/product_landing.dita].

Important! If IBM Installation Manager cannot retrieve an update package automatically due to network connectivity or firewall settings, do the following: 
1. Download the update package from IBM Fix Central. 
2. Expand the archive to an arbitrary location on the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services host file system, for example C:\CDS70FP1. 
3. In the IBM Installation Manager Repository preferences, add the update repository using the location of the extracted update files, for example, C:\CDS70FP1\Repository_Server_Update_7.0.0.1\repository.config.

Important! If you made any manual, custom configuration changes to the existing IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services application (EAR) file that is deployed on your application server, those changes may be lost when an update, such as a fix pack, is applied. Maintain a record of your manual customization changes and be prepared to apply them again after the updated application has been deployed. Examples of the kind of application changes that might be lost include: 

 * Modification of the "session timeout" value for a web application (WAR). 
 * Modification of the "connection pool" values for a resource adapter (RAR). 
 * Modification of the "session pool" values for a Message Drive Bean (MDB) 
 * Modification of the "trace" values in the installed "log4j.properties' file.


Differences between application server products is also a consideration, as some application servers store these settings outside of the application (EAR) files, while other application servers store these settings inside the application (EAR) files. In general, J2EE application configuration changes that you have made should be reviewed and verified after the update has been applied.

Prior to installation  * 
 * 
 * 
 *   *  WebSphere standalone: The application server must be stopped. WebSphere managed: The application server(s) or cluster must be stopped; the Deployment Manager and Node Agent(s) must be running. JBoss: The application server must be stopped.

Notes:  *  You can install updates for IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services adapters, such as the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Scoring Adapter for PMML and the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Scoring Adapter for IBM SPSS Modeler, when you apply SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository updates. Select any returned adapter updates to apply in step 5. If IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 7.0 had been manually deployed (by using the "Manual deployment" option in the Configuration Utility), you must redeploy the application using the artifacts in <repository installation directory>/toDeploy/<timestamp>. For more information on manual deployment, see the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository Installation and Configuration Guide. If an error occurs while applying the fix pack, you may need to manually run the "patch" command after fixing the problem. However, due to the previous installation attempt, issuing this command can result in the message "No new patches found". To force the patch to be reapplied, run the patch command with the "-apply" parameter, followed by the patch folder name to be applied. For example: 
   <repository installation directory>\bin\patch -apply 7.0.0.1
