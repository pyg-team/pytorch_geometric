Text:
CVE-2015-3194; CVE-2015-3196; CVE-2016-0702 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL vulnerabilities were disclosed on December 3, 2015 and March 1, 2016 by the OpenSSL Project. OpenSSL is used by IBM Rational ClearCase. IBM Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
CVEID: CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108505] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0702 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover RSA keys.
CVSS Base Score: 2.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144] for the current score

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Rational ClearCase versions:



Version Status 9.0 Affected only by CVE-2016-0702 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.17 Affected 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x (all versions) 
7.1.2 through 7.1.2.18 Affected 
Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. 

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: 
 1. You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    
 2. You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
    Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
    
 3. On UNIX/Linux clients, you use the Change Management Integrations for base ClearCase with ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert (RTC), or for UCM with ClearQuest or RTC, or for Jira, when configured to use SSL to communicate with the server.
    Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
    
 4. You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Apply a fix pack as listed in the table below. The fix pack includes OpenSSL 1.0.1s. 

Affected Versions Applying the fix 9.0 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 1 (9.0.0.01) for 9.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042131] 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 11 (8.0.1.11) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042128] 8.0 through 8.0.0.17 Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 18 (8.0.0.18) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042126] 7.1.2.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.1.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.0.x (all fix packs) Customers on extended support contracts should contact Customer Support. Note: A fix for CVE-2016-2108 was provided in OpenSSL version 1.0.1o and a fix for CVE-2015-3196 was provided in OpenSSL version 1.0.1p. Both issues were previously addressed by the fixes listed in Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-1788, CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-1791) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960633]. 

For 7.0.x, 7.1.x and earlier releases, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.
