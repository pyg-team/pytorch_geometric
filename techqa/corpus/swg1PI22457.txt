APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z integrated debugger does not
   show program source when DD AQEV4LST (compile listing SYSPRINT)
   is a sequential dataset.
   
   The RDz user does not see the source code but (disassembled)
   assembler code. The message received is:
   "The zOS probe was unable to locate the listing file dated
   2014/06/13 07:50:28 for compile unit MYCBLPRG. Compile unit
   MYCBLPRG will be treated as non-debuggable."
   
   Steps to reproduce or if has been reproduced on VM image, link
   to image
   COBOL HELLO world sample
   Use a sequential dataset for the SYSPRINT DD on compile
   
   When using sequential datasets for the compile SYSPRINT DD the
   debug shows hex and disassembly information.
   
   The debug engine can not read the source listing in AQEV4LST DD
   when the dataset is sequential.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a PDS for compile listing DD SYSPRINT (AQEV4LST)
   or, instead of DD AQEV4LST, use
   //CEEOPTS   DD *
   ENVAR("AQE_DBG_V4LIST=<hlq>.MYCOBOL.MYLST")
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: 01.Integrated Debugger users who use         *
   *                    sequential data sets for listings.        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 01.The Integrated Debugger engine does  *
   *                         not show program source when DD      *
   *                         AQEV4LST (compile listing SYSPRINT)  *
   *                         is a sequential data set.            *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   01.The Integrated Debugger engine does not show program source
      when DD AQEV4LST (compile listing SYSPRINT) is a sequential
      data set.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Integrated Debugger has been updated to handle sequential
      data sets as listings.
