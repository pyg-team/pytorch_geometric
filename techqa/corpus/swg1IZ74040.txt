APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  steps to replicate:
   Utilities 7.1.0 with BS 7.1.1.5
   In CU Library, Material tab, You cannot select the 'Apply to
   Contracted Details' checkbox unless you first select the 'Direct
   Issue' checkbox. In our case, we supply the materials to the
   contractor for each job from our warehouse, so we cannot select
   'Direct Issue'. The 'Direct Issue' and 'Apply to Contracted
   Details' checkboxes must be independent to handle this scenario.
   
   cannot tick the 'Apply to Contracted Details' checkbox unless
   'Direct Issue' checkbox is ticked
   
   NOTE: unable to replicate in Utilities 7.1.2 with BS 7.1.1.6
   client is going live on 4/6 (already too late to put in any
