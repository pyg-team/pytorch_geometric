QUESTION
 What steps can be used to determine if a Tivoli Integrated Portal server is part of a High Availability server group? 

ANSWER
Use the HATool.{bat|sh} command located in the <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/ha directory. The usage for that command is:
HATool.{bat|sh} modules <db2 username> <db2 password>

If this returns a list of modules, then HA is configured and the server is joined.
If this returns empty, then HA is configured, but server is disjoined.
If this throws Database Connection errors, then HA has never been configured on this server.

See the following technical note for complete details on High Availability/load balancing configuration:
