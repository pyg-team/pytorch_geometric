Fix Central

 Fix Central is a new way to acquire fixes and, for this fix, it is the only option for downloading. The two main differences are that the FTP option will be replaced by HTTP and you will need to use an IBM registered ID to acquire the files, which allows us to update you on any critical issues with the fix. Privacy is always maintained.
