Title: IBM Importing data for a tenant into IBM Water Operations for Waternamics fails with a Node throwing exception - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Data about alerts, assets, measurement readings, and work orders for each tenant is imported into IBM Water Operations for Waternamics from XML files. If an error occurs during the data ingestion process, a Node throwing exception is generated. 

SYMPTOM
The data ingestion process fails to import data for one or more tenants, and a Node throwing exception is written to the tenant's data ingestion log file. 

The data ingestion log files are located in the corresponding tenant directory on the analytics server. For example, if you are importing data for a tenant named TENANT_1, then the data ingestion log files for TENANT_1 are in the /home/default_iib_ftp/execution_groups/TENANT_1/logs directory. 


CAUSE
If the data ingestion process fails with a Node throwing exception, the problem might be caused by one of the following issues: 

 * The data file is not in the correct data input directory for the tenant. 
 * The data file includes incorrect XML syntax.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To check if the data ingestion process failed with a Node throwing exception, examine the log files that are generated by the data ingestion process for each tenant. 

The following is an example of a log file containing a Node throwing exception that was generated during a failed attempt to import a file named TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml that contains readings data for a tenant named TENANT_1: 

 2016-12-08 13:44:17 DEBUG DBLogger:124 - Entering logFileError : 

TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml, description = Error in 

TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml : Node throwing exception 

2016-12-08 13:44:17 ERROR DBLogger:140 - Could not log for KPIs : 

TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml { Error in 

TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml : Node throwing exception} 

2016-12-08 13:44:17 DEBUG DBLogger:152 - Leaving logFileError : 

TENANT1_IN_IOW_Readings_BDQE_1-7_160712-0928.xml



 

 

 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the problem, complete the following steps before attempting to import the data: 

 1. Ensure that each XML file is in the correct location. For example, if you are importing asset data for a tenant named TENANT_1, the XML file should be in the /home/default_iib_ftp/execution_groups/TENANT_1/inputAssetsMT directory. 
 2. Ensure that the data in the XML is correctly formatted by opening the file in a tool that checks for XML syntax errors. For example, open the file using Notepad++.
