Title: IBM Unable to retrieve  documents - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Intermittently when viewing documents stored in ECM Centera the retrieval fails via FileNet Content Engine 

SYMPTOM
When viewing documents, intermittently, users receive the following error. If the error is received a second attempt may succeed. On occasion the document is retrieved but pages may be missing. For example a five page document is retrieved but only the first four pages display. 

The stack trace error is as follows: 

Getting document content has failed.<br>com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;Fixed Content Provider open operation failed. Provider: [com.filenet.engine.content.fcprovider.centera.CenteraFCP(21)]SeqN[0] Referral: [version(hex)=10001; checksum(hex)=170a; mode=1; flags=0;contentID={<GUID>}; clipID=<CLIPID>;numContentElements=2;Tag[0]=>ceSeqNum[1];][Code=null]...Object Reference [DOCUMENT:1]ID"{<GUID>}" in ObjectStore "{<OS GUID>}";OMFC/Document/GetContent//CONTENT_FCP_OPERATION_FAILED_ON_OPEN


CAUSE
This is a known Centera Device issue:

Cause: 

Internal memory leak. The memory leak results in a consumption rate of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 megabytes (MB) per day and affects only Gen4/Gen4LP nodes running CentraStar version 4.1.0-3343-0-0 or CentraStar version 4.1.1-3610-0-0. After a period of six to nine months of system uptime has elapsed at these microcode revisions, users may report incidents of application performance and/or nodes within the cluster will reboot in order to release Slab memory for internal and external operations.

Workaround: 

Reboot the Linix platform on each affected node to release the amount of slab memory actively being consumed.

Permanent Fix: 

Two CentraStar patches have been made generally available (GA) in order to resolve the memory leak; CentraStar 4.1.0p1 (4.1.0-3672-1-0) and CentraStar 4.1.1p1 (4.1.1-3673-1-0).



ENVIRONMENT
Specific to a Linux\Centera environment



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Users intermittently receive the following stack trace error or the full document is not downloaded. 

 Getting document content has failed.<br>com.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException;Fixed Content Provider open operation failed. Provider: [com.filenet.engine.content.fcprovider.centera.CenteraFCP(21)]SeqN[0] Referral: [version(hex)=10001; checksum(hex)=170a; mode=1; flags=0;contentID={<GUID>}; clipID=<CLIPID>;numContentElements=2;Tag[0]=>ceSeqNum[1];][Code=null]...Object Reference [DOCUMENT:1]ID"{<GUID>}" in ObjectStore "{<OS GUID>}";OMFC/Document/GetContent//CONTENT_FCP_OPERATION_FAILED_ON_OPEN


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * Short term resolution is to reboot the Linux platform on each affected node.
   
 * Long term resolution is to apply the following CentraStar patches 4.1.0 Patch 1 (4.1.0-3672-1-00 and 4.1.1 patch (4.1.1-3673-1-0)
