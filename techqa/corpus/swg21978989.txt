RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Instead of applying fix packs simultaneously with the base version of Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0.0, install Maximo 7.6.0.0 first, and then apply fix pack versions (7.6.0.2/ 7.6.0.3/ 7.6.0.4) afterwards. 

When installing Aviation 7.6.1/7.6,2 versions, follow these steps : 

1. Install IBM Maximo Aviation from the launchpad. 

2. On the Installation Manager offering selection panel, check the box "Show all versions", deselect "Aviation", and then select "Version 7.6.0.0 " under the "Maximo Asset management" tree. 

3. Complete the Maximo 7.6.0.0 installation. 

4. Once the Maximo 7.6.0.0 version installation is done, open Installation Manager and add the Aviation version 7.6.1 and Maximo 7.6.0.2 fix pack repositories, or the Aviation version 7.6.2 and Maximo 7.6.0.3 fix pack repositories. 

5. Select "Update" and complete the Maximo 7.6.0.2/ 7.6.0.3 fix pack installation first. 

6. Select "Install" and complete the Aviation 7.6.1 / 7.6.2 installation.
