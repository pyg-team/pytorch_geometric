ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Error Message: meta() callback request processing fails on the
   server with a BAD_PARAM exception, possibly after few fragments
   of the meta reply are sent to the peer.
   On the peer, a MARSHAL exception (org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL:No
   available data) is logged.
   .

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  On the server side, the meta processing fails with the BAD_PARAM
   because of a timing issue wherein, the FVD class value is picked
   up before the state has been setup.This exception may be thrown
   after a few fragments of the meta reply have been pumped out.
   Consequently, on the client side, the meta reply processing
   begins and when fragments stop arriving (coinciding with the
   time of the BAD_PARAM on the server), the client's marshalling
   engine throws a MARSHAL:no available data.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This defect will be fixed in:
   1.4.2 SR13-6
   1.4.2 SR13-6 (z/OS 64-bit)
   1.4.2 SR13-6 (Linux AMD64)
   1.4.2 SR13-6 (Windows AMD64)
   .
   The timing issue has been fixed in ORB marshalling engine.
   .
   To obtain the fix:
   Install build 20100912 or later
