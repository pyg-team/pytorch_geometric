DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE and JRockit related to the JCE component could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102339 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102339] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/101851 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/101851] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-1916 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1916]
DESCRIPTION: Server applications which use the IBM Java Secure Socket Extension provider to accept SSL/TLS connections are vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to an unspecified vulnerability.
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/101995 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/101995] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/99707] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects 3592 Enterprise Tape System (CVE-2015-2808) 

 

This attack, also known as “Bar Mitzvah” impacts SSL/TLS connections. 


CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5

Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects 3592 Enterprise Tape System (CVE-2015-4000) 


This attack, also known as the "Logjam Attack" impacts TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol.

CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score

Vulnerability in IBM Java Runtime affects 3592 Enterprise Tape System (CVE-2015-0138 


The “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" impacts TLS/SSL connections.

CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. 
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100691] for the current score
