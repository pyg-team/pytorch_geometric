Title: IBM FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office - Credentials Error - United States

Text:
FIMO Credentials Error add-in TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office (FIMO) login to FileNet Workplace XT fails 

SYMPTOM
After FIMO was installed, the WPXT Login screen from MS Word returns the following error: 


Credentials Error: 0x800c2efd - User Login Failed!

The error is only returned for MS Word. All other MS Office Integration logins were successful.

From MS Word, the IBM ECM tab for FileNet Integration was not displayed.

The FIMO COM Add in could not be enabled. Selecting the add-in returned the following error:
'C:\Program Files\IBM\FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office\P8WordAddIn.vsto' is not a valid Office Add-in.


CAUSE
The IBM FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office for Word option in the COM Add-ins for Word was not enabled.


ENVIRONMENT
CE 5.1.0.2
XT 1.1.5
MS Office 2007
WebSphere 7.0



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
he COM Add-Ins window displayed the following: 


Add-Ins available:
FileNet Application Integration
IBM FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office for Word

The "FileNet Application Integration" add-in was checked, but this was left over from a previous Application Integration installation. The old add-in was preventing the correct add-in from being enabled.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

To resolve the issue check if the COM Add-in for FIMO is enabled:



 1. Open MS Word and select the Office button (top left button)
    
    
 2. At the bottom of the screen, select the "Word Options" button
    
    
 3. From the Word Options screen, select "Add-Ins"
    
    
 4. In the Add-ins screen there is a Manage: "COM Add-ins" option in a pull down box. Select "Go".
    
    
 5. From the COM Add-Ins screen, verify that the "IBM FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office for Word" add-in has a check next to it. 




The issue is resolved by unchecking the "FileNet Application Integration" add-in and checking the "IBM FileNet Integration for Microsoft Office for Word" add-in.
