PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to start IBM Rational ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC) WAN server results in the errors "parser: handleLogEnd: Failed to open log file: 'c:\\Program Files\\IBM\\WebSphere\\Plugins\\logs\\http_plugin.log', OS Err: 3". 

SYMPTOM
Start CCRC WAN server on your machine and you will see errors on IBM HTTP Server (IHS) error.log file under the following folder. 


<IHS installed Directory>\logs\error.log



The full error message is as follows:

parser: handleLogEnd: Failed to open log file: 'c:\\Program Files\\IBM\\WebSphere\\Plugins\\logs\\http_plugin.log', OS Err: 3

[error] lib_security: logSSLError: str_security (gsk error 408): GSK_ERROR_BAD_KEYFILE_PASSWORD
[error] lib_security: initializeSecurity: Failed to initialize GSK environment
[error] ws_transport: transportInitializeSecurity: Failed to initialize security
[error] ws_server: serverAddTransport: Failed to initialize security
[error] ws_server: serverAddTransport: HTTPS Transport is skipped



CAUSE
Cause 1: The http_plugin.log file doesn't exist in the specified directory or exits in the different directory.

Cause 2: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is not configured properly. The SSL errors are supposed to be written on http_plugin.log. Since the http_plugin.log file doesn't exist, the messages are recorded on the error.log.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply one of the following solutions: 

 

 * Solution to Cause 1:
   
   Chose one of the following options to resolve the error message about the http_plugin.log.

 *  Create http_plugin.log file under the directory that is recorded in the message. In this example, create c:\\Program Files\\IBM\\WebSphere\\Plugins\\logs\\http_plugin.log.
   
   Change directory path in plugin-cfg.xml if the http_plugin.log file is already exist in another directory.
   Open the plugin-cfg.xml file under the directory <RationalSDLC directory>\common\ccrcprofile\config\cells\ 
   Change this line to your desired directory.
   
   Log LogLevel="Error" Name="c:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\Plugins\logs\http_plugin.log" 
   
   
 * Solution to Cause 2:
   
   Configure SSL to resolve the SSL error messages
