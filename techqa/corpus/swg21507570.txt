Title: IBM An empty decision table in the ruleset leads to ruleset parsing error: XU.ERROR.10014 - United States

QUESTION
 When you attempt to execute a ruleset with Rule Execution Server, ruleset parsing fails and logs an error message such as the following:

Compilation error in task MyRuleflow#MyRuleTask:
could not find the group MyRulePackage.MyDecisionTable, error code: XU.ERROR.10014

How can I prevent this error ? 

CAUSE
The ruleset parsing error happens because the rule task uses the group keyword to reference the Decision Table. Because the Decision Table is empty, no group is generated in the Decision Table, hence the parsing error. 

The following IRL code shows how the rule task references decision tables:
ruletask Test#emptyDT { 
property ilog.rules.business_name = "Test>emptyDT";
property ilog.rules.package_name = ""; 
algorithm = default; 
ordering = dynamic; 
body { 
group("emptyDT") 
} 
}; 

Note that emptyDT is the empty decision table.



ANSWER
To remove the error, you can move the Decision Table into a rule package and make sure that rule tasks no longer directly refer to the Decision Table but, instead, refer to its containing rule package. As a consequence, the generated IRL does not refer to the Decision Table directly in the rule task body and hence no error is thrown. 

Another solution consists in using an extractor to generate the ruleset. Typically, you keep the default validator and no query selected. When a ruleset extractor is in use, the engine is configured to accept a reference to a rule task body element even if that element is not defined within the ruleset.
