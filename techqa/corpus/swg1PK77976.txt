APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DUPLICATE OF ANOTHER APAR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I have been debugging this escalation through RATLC00571291 as t
   he symptoms (failure in PageUniqueness) and work around (remove
   manual explore URLs) are similar. And I can reproduce the proble
   m with RATLC00571291 here.
   
   The following events must happen before inserting a Page into th
   e Page_JII_ table:
   1) Insert the Documents contained in the Page into the Doc_JII_
   table
   2) Insert the Requests contained with the Page into the Request_
   JII_ table
   3) Insert the Page into the Page_JII_ table.
   
   The page inserted in the last step contains a reference to the R
   ootDocId. In order for the Page insert to be successful, this Ro
   otDocId must already be present in the Doc_JII_ table. If this I
   d is not present in the Doc_JII_ table, the insert will fail wit
   h the error 'FOREIGN KEY constraint FK_Doc_Page...', which occur
   s in both cases.
   
   The log entries for foreign key constraint error contain the Roo
   tDocId as a base64 encoded ID:
   'RootDocId = w9cync1gWCRtATYfxTVu/g==' 'Batch Accessor'
   
   I decoded the value and determined that the ID was not written t
   o the Doc_JII_ table. However, the ID was written to the Request
   _JII_ table (the DocId and RequestId are the same). In addition,
    records for the DocId were not written to the tables DocDirecto
   ryRef_JII_, DocMessage_JII_ and DocRequestRef_JII_. This narrows
    the problem down to a specific block of code.
   
   I have reproduced the problem on one of my development machines
   in an install environment. I am now working to reproduce it in a
    debug environment.
