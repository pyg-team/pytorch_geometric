APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem Description :
   
   The MS received zero value for max heap size of a data
   collector server. The JVM Memory Utilization % chart showed up
   as "Data not available" for this server.
   
   The Managing Server should store default non-zero value in the
   database for the max heap size of the server, instead of zero.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Data Collector sends a default non-zero value for Max and
   Initial heap size for the JVM to the Managing Server. However if
   for any reason, the Max or Initial Heap Size of zero is received
   for a Data Collector Server, the Managing Server updates the
   database with zero values.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Managing Server code was fixed as follows:
   
   If zero Initial Heap Size is received, then the non-zero value
   in the database is used. If database value is also zero, then
   Initial Heap Size will be defaulted to 50 MB.
   
   Following message will be printed in the kernel logs:
   
   [CYNK0072W Initial Heap size value of zero was received for
   Server: <ipaddress>:<Server Name>, setting it to: <Initial Heap
   Size>.]
   
   If zero Max Heap Size is received, then non-zero value in the
   database is used. If both values are zero then Max Heap Size is
   defaulted to greater of (256 MB) and <Initial Heap Size>.
   
   Following message will be printed in the kernel logs:
   
   [CYNK0073W Max Heap size value of zero was received for Server:
   <ipaddress:<Server Name>, setting it to: <Max Heap Size>.]
   
   This APAR is fixed in 6.0.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfWAS_SVR-IF0005.
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Restart of the Data Collector Server should correct any problem
   which led to Max Heap Size not being received by the Managing
   Server.
