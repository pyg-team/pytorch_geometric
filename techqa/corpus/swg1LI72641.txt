ERROR DESCRIPTION
 * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   
   HADR REPORTS "CONGESTION" AND TRANSACTIONS STALL
   ON PRIMARY DATABASE AFTER LOAD OPERATION IS PERFORMED THERE.
   
   HADR REPORTS "CONGESTION" WHEN IT IS UNABLE TO TRANSFER ALL
   DESIRED BYTES INTO THE COMMS LAYER (TCP/IP). HADR RECEIVES BACK
   A CODE ON ITS SEND ATTEMPT THAT INDICATES THAT NONE, OR ONLY
   SOME, OF THE SEND BUFFER WAS TRANSFERRED.
   
   FIX NEEDED: DB2 SHOULD ALLOW THE USER TO CONFIGURE IT TO
   AUTOMATICALLY DROP OUT OF PEER STATE WHEN CONGESTION IS
   ENCOUNTERED. TODAY, THE USER MAY AS A WORKAROUND MANUALLY BREAK
   THE HADR CONNECTION. BUT THIS REQUIRES MONITORING AND SPECIAL
   SCRIPTING OR HUMAN INTERVENTION.
   
   BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
   
   THERE ARE TWO MAIN CAUSES OF THIS IN AN HADR ENVIRONMENT:
   
   1. COMPETITION FOR THE COMMS LINE/NETWORK
   
   IN THIS CASE, OVERALL TRAFFIC OR SOME SPECIFIC NETWORK USER(S)
   CAUSED THE NETWORK TO SATURATE. THIS MAY BE ADDRESSED BY
   RECONFIGURING THE NETWORK, OR MAY BE TOLERATED BELOW A CERTAIN
   LEVEL.
   
   2. LOG SHIPPING BLOCKED AT STANDBY
   
   IN THIS CASE, THE HADR STANDBY STOPS RECEIVING LOG PAGES OVER
   TCP/IP BECAUSE IT HAS NO ROOM TO PLACE THEM IN ITS RECEIVE
   BUFFER. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, OTHER BUFFERING IN THE END-TO-END
   PIPELINE, E.G., OS OR COMMS SYSTEM DEFINED BUFFERING IN THE
   SENDER AND IN THE RECEIVER, MAY ALSO FILL UP. WHEN THE
   END-TO-END PIPELINE IS FULL, NEW SENDS FROM PRIMARY TO STANDBY
   OVER TCP/IP WILL FAIL. THE CONDITION SHOULD CLEAR UP, AT LEAST
   TEMPORARILY, WHEN THE STANDBY MAKES FORWARD PROGRESS ON LOG
   REPLAY, WHICH FREES UP SPACE IN ITS RECEIVE BUFFER.
   
   CONGESTION ON THE HADR PRIMARY IS ACCOMPANIED BY A NEGATIVE
   PERFORMANCE IMPACT. THE IMPACT MAY BE TOLERABLE OR INTOLERABLE,
   DEPENDING ON THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION, AND THE NEEDS OF A
   PARTICULAR INSTALLATION. IT IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN PEER
   STATE; IF THE PRIMARY CANNOT SEND DATA TO THE STANDBY, LOGGING
   WILL BE BLOCKED. THIS IS TRUE IN ANY SYNCHRONIZATION MODE; EVEN
   ASYNC MODE REQUIRES THE PRIMARY TO SUCCESSFULLY PASS THE LOG
   DATA TO THE COMMS LAYER BEFORE CONSIDERING A LOG FLUSH (AND THUS
   A TRANSACTION COMMIT) TO BE COMPLETE IN PEER STATE. DURING
   REMOTE CATCHUP STATE, CONGESTION CAN SLOW DOWN THE PROGRESS OF
   THE STANDBY BY INTERFERING WITH LOG SHIPPING, BUT IT IS UNLIKELY
   TO CAUSE MUCH DIRECT IMPACT ON THE PRIMARY'S PERFORMANCE, SINCE
   CURRENT LOGGING IS NOT WAITING FOR LOG SHIPPING TO OCCUR IN THIS
   STATE.
   
   THE SECOND TYPE OF CONGESTION IDENTIFIED ABOVE IS OFTEN
   ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPLAY AT THE HADR STANDBY OF A LARGE,
   GRANULAR OPERATION, SUCH AS LOAD OR OFFLINE (CLASSIC) REORG. THE
   REPLAY OF THESE OPERATIONS CAN TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
   TIME, AND THE STANDBY DOES NOT RELEASE THE ASSOCIATED LOG RECORD
   UNTIL ITS REPLAY COMPLETES. IF AT THE SAME TIME THE PRIMARY IS
   PERFORMING NEW LOGGED OPERATIONS, THIS CAN CAUSE THE STANDBY'S
   RECEIVE BUFFER TO FILL UP.
   
   HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW CONGESTION MAY OCCUR IN A LOAD COPY YES
   SEQUENCE:
   
   STANDBY DEACTIVATED (OR SIMILAR)
   LOAD PERFORMED ON PRIMARY
   ONGOING (DURING/AFTER LOAD) LOGGED OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON
   PRIMARY
   LOAD COPY IMAGE FILE TRANSFERRED TO STANDBY (E.G., VIA FTP)
   STANDBY RE-ACTIVATED
   STANDBY REPLAYS LOG RECORDS UP TO "LOAD" LOG RECORD
   STANDBY'S REPLAY GETS STUCK FOR SOME TIME ON THE "LOAD" LOG
   RECORD
   HADR PAIR MAY ENTER PEER STATE AS THE RECEIVE BUFFER CAN
   INITIALLY ACCEPT THE NECESSARY LOG RECORDS
   STANDBY'S RECEIVE BUFFER FILLS
   OS (TCP/IP) BUFFERING ON STANDBY FILLS
   OS (TCP/IP) BUFFERING ON PRIMARY FILLS
   PRIMARY NO LONGER ABLE TO SEND TO STANDBY (CONGESTION)
   PRIMARY BLOCKED UNTIL CONGESTION CLEARS
   STANDBY EVENTUALLY FINISHES WITH "LOAD" RECORD AND MOVES ON,
   FREEING RECEIVE BUFFER SPACE
   STANDBY AGAIN RECEIVES QUEUED DATA FROM COMMS SUBSYSTEM
   CONGESTION CLEARS
   STANDBY WORKS THROUGH RECEIVE BUFFER BACKLOG; SHORTER PERIODS OF
   CONGESTION POSSIBLE UNTIL SUFFICIENT FREE RECEIVE SPACE IS MADE
   TO STABILIZE ONGOING LOG SHIPPING
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 * THE USER FACES A CHOICE IN HOW TO RESPOND TO CONGESTION. IF THE
   USER PREFERS THAT THE PRIMARY NOT BE BLOCKED, IT IS POSSIBLE TO
   BREAK THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND STANDBY. FOR
   EXAMPLE, ONE CAN "BOUNCE" (DEACTIVATE AND RE-ACTIVATE) THE
   STANDBY DATABASE. THIS WILL CAUSE HADR TO ENTER REMOTE CATCHUP
   STATE, WHEREIN REPLAY OF THE BIG OPERATION WILL NOT CAUSE
   PUSH-BACK ON THE PRIMARY. HOWEVER, DOING THIS WILL CAUSE THE
   STANDBY TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND THE PRIMARY, INCREASING THE
   FAILOVER TIME AND INCREASING THE RISK OF TRANSACTION LOSS IN A
   FAILURE (ESP. WHERE SYNC OR NEARSYNC MODES WOULD APPLY IN PEER
   STATE). IF THE USER DESIRES THE PRIMARY AND STANDBY TO BE AS
   CONSISTENT AS POSSIBLE, THAT USER MAY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT
   TRANSACTIONS MAY BE BLOCKED DURING REPLAY OF SUCH BIG OPERATIONS
   IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PRIMARY FROM RUNNING AWAY FROM THE STANDBY.
   
   SOME THINGS THAT CAN HELP AND ARE AVAILABLE NOW:
   
   1. FOR LOAD COPY YES, REDUCE STANDBY OUTAGE TIME BY USING SHARED
   DISK FOR LOAD IMAGE FILE (PREFERRED) OR OTHER MEASURES
   (FASTER/WIDER COMMS TO SHORTEN FTP TIME; AVOID FTP TIME
   ALTOGETHER BY USING REHOSTABLE DISK). ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT PART
   OF THE CONGESTION PERIOD SHOWN IN THE STEPS ABOVE, IT CAN HELP
   REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE CONGESTION EFFECT. BY ALLOWING THE
   STANDBY TO RESTART SOONER, THIS ACTION MAY REDUCE THE LENGTH OF
   THE BACKLOG FACED BY THE STANDBY AFTER THE POINT OF THE "LOAD"
   RECORD.
   
   2. CONFIGURE DB2 TO SPOOL (AT LEAST A CERTAIN AMOUNT) OF THE LOG
   DATA IN MEMORY ON THE STANDBY, BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE
   STANDBY'S LOG RECEIVE BUFFER. THIS IS SET VIA THE DB2 REGISTRY
   VARIABLE DB2_HADR_BUF_SIZE. THE STANDBY INSTANCE MUST BE STOPPED
   AND RESTARTED FOR CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT. THE NEEDED SIZE
   DEPENDS ON THE ANTICIPATED LOG GENERATION RATE AND THE DURATION
   OF THE CONGESTION.
   
   3. STOP AN EXISTING CASE OF CONGESTION BY BREAKING THE HADR
   CONNECTION. THE PREFERRED METHOD WOULD BE TO BOUNCE THE STANDBY,
   THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO USE ANOTHER APPROACH (E.G.,
   BOUNCING THE NETWORK). THE RESULT IS HADR LEAVES PEER STATE AND
   WILL BEGIN LOG SHIPPING AGAIN IN REMOTE CATCHUP STATE, WHERE IT
   WON'T PUSH BACK ON THE PRIMARY. ONE CAN LOOK AT THIS AS
   ESSENTIALLY A TEMPORARY SPOOLING OF YET TO BE SHIPPED LOG ON THE
   PRIMARY'S DISK (OR, IF STANDBY FALLS FAR ENOUGH BEHIND, ON THE
   PRIMARY'S LOG ARCHIVE DEVICE). THE DRAWBACK IS THAT THE STANDBY
   IS ALLOWED TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND. THAT MAY LENGTHEN TAKEOVER
   (FAILOVER OR ROLE SWITCH) TIME, AND ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF
   TRANSACTION LOSS IN CASE THE PRIMARY SITE SUFFERS A
   FAILURE/DISASTER AND UNSHIPPED LOG DATA (ONLINE OR ARCHIVE LOGS)
   ARE DESTROYED OR NOT TIMELY ACCESSIBLE.
   
   4. REDUCE THE DURATION OF CONGESTION IMPACT BY DECREASING THE
   GRANULARITY OF REPLAY. CONSIDER USING ONLINE REORG. LOAD OR
   REORG SMALLER AMOUNTS OF DATA PER OPERATION.
   
   5. USE "LOAD COPY NO" AND REPAIR/REBUILD TARGET
   TABLE/TABLESPACE/DATABASE LATER.
   - WHEN AFFECTED SITE IS IN PRIMARY ROLE, E.G., AFTER FAILOVER OR
   ROLE SWITCH), OR
   - BY REINITIALIZING THE STANDBY VIA A BACKUP/RESTORE/RE-START
   APPROACH
