APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Active Directory SSL port 636 is the only port that
   allows IBM Content Collector to communicate with the domain
   controller, communication fails. As a result, no email can be
   processed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When using the IBM Content Collector Email Connector to process
   Microsoft Exchange email, using the SSL port 636 is not
   supported.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0 Fix Pack 3, the Email
   Connector can be forced to use the SSL port for Active Directory
    communications when processing Exchange email. To enable this
   setting, set the following variable for the Email Connector:
   
   ex.activeDirectory.ForceSSL=true
