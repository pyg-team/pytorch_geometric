Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in Network Time Protocol (NTP) implementation that is used by WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance. These vulnerabilities addressed include the ability to crash application and disable ntp service. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-7426 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7426]
DESCRIPTION: NTP is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the improper handling of invalid server responses. By sending specially crafted packets with spoofed source address, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 1.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119094 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119094] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2016-7433 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7433]
DESCRIPTION: NTP is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the inclusion of the root delay allowing for an incorrect root distance calculation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
CVSS Base Score: 1.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119095 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119095] for the current score
