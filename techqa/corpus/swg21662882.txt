QUESTION
 Is it possible to display an event list directly on a mobile device, without drilling down from an Event Dashboard or Gauge? 

ANSWER
Yes, it is. The URL can be entered in this format to display an event list in the Event Viewer on a mobile device:
[https]://<host>:<port>/ibm/console/webtop/m/eventviewer?filtername=Escalated&filtertype=global

Note: it is not possible to use a transient filter in the URL under these circumstances. The filter specified must be pre-defined via the Filter Builder.
