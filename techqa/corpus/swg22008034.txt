 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Numerical values from a choicelist in NMO with EDS are not selectable. 

SYMPTOM
After selecting a numerical value in an EDS choicelist, the field is not populated by the selected value.


CAUSE
Numerical values in NMO EDS should be enclosed with double quotes.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if the JSON choicelists used by NMO in EDS have double quotes for the numerical values. For example:
"choiceList": {

"displayName": "numbers",

"choices": [{
"displayName": "One",
"value": 1 },
{
"displayName": "Two",
"value": 2
}]

}}

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This issue can be resolved by adding double quotes for the numerical values in the following way:
"choiceList": {

"displayName": "numbers",

"choices": [{
"displayName": "One",
"value": "1" },
{
"displayName": "Two",
"value": "2"
}]

}}
