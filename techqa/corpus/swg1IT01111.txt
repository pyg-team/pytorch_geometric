APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using side channel timing based analysis it might be possible to
   decrypt a secret SSL/TLS session key of a sniffed session of a
   DataPower device.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower appliances might be subject to side channel timing
   based attacks resulting in the decryption of an SSL/TLS secured
   transaction.  This can only occur if the attacker is on the same
   LAN network as the DataPower device.  The attacker has to send
   several million requests to DataPower and monitor the responses.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.16, 6.0.0.8, and 6.0.1.4.
