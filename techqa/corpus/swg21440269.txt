Title: IBM Information Server DataStage ODBC Error while Job inserting records to Informix - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 DataStage job with ODBC stage inserts records to an Informix table generates a fatal error, KEY VALUE LOCKED.

Sample errors messages:
ODBC function "SQLExecute" reported: SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -271: Msg = [DataDirect][ODBC Informix driver][Informix]Could not insert new row into the table.

Message::Stage_Name,2: [IIS-CONN-ODBC-000004] ODBC functionn "SQLExecute" reported: SQLSTATE = HY000: Native Error Code = -144: Msg = [DataDirect][ODBC Informix driver][Informix]ISAM error: key value locked 


CAUSE
This is a timing issue and the error ISAM : key value locked is thrown from the Informix Server. This could be happening since the default setting at the Informix server end for handling multiple processes accessing the same resource could be "SET LOCK MODE TO NOT WAIT"

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Default setting at the Informix server end for handling multiple processes accessing the same resource needs to be changed to "SET LOCK MODE TO WAIT <number of seconds>"
