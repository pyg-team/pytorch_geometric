PROBLEM
Some requests may fail within a very short time period (less than a second) although IBM WebSphere Portal keeps on running and working.

SYMPTOM
If cache entries for the ClientList (which holds the supported clients for WebSphere Portal) are timed out in the cache, ClientList must reload the requested clients. During that time, a CC/PP profile cannot be created for clients that are found in the cache.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The cache expiration lifetime for the supported clients can be set to infinite. In other words, there is no need to invalidate this cache for its lifetime. This does not affect updating the list of supported clients. 

To configure the lifetime of the relevant caches, modify Portal's CacheManagerService properties in the WebSphere Application Server console. 

Set the following properties to a value of -1: 

cacheinstance.com.ibm.wps.model.impl.RuntimeClientMap.userAgent2client.lifetime

cacheinstance.com.ibm.wps.model.admin.client.ClientListCache.lifetime
