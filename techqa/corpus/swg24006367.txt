ABSTRACT
 MD05 is intended to address some of the challenges encountered in the design of MQSeries queue manager cluster solutions for large-scale MQSeries installations. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
This SupportPac is intended to address some of the challenges encountered in the design of MQSeries queue manager cluster solutions for large-scale MQSeries installations. It is based on work done with a major UK customer. 

For the purposes of the SupportPac large-scale is defined as: 
Any installation where, if a single cluster were used and all queue managers in the cluster needed to connect to a queue manager, the number of channels which that queue manager is required to run would be greater than the number which can be active simultaneously on that queue manager. 
Potential growth and expansion should be considered when deciding whether an installation is large-scale. 

The SupportPac addresses three main topics: 
1. Whether to use one large 'sub-divided' cluster or several clusters, each taking a sub-set of the queue managers in the cluster. 
2. Whether to use parallel processing or to implement a fail-over strategy 
3. How to manage the installation operations to ensure that the repository queue managers do not have too many channels active at the same time. 

POSSIBLE USES
The methodology proposed in this SupportPac will be of use to MQSeries system designers, system administrators and application developers considering the use of MQSeries Queue Manager Clusters in large-scale environments. 


SKILL LEVEL REQUIRED 
The SupportPac assumes some knowledge of MQSeries Queue Manager Clusters.
