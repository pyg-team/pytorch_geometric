APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When applying license upgrade jar to an installation and it
   fails due to incompatible edition, the terminal will return
   the following message:
   "The specified product installation is edition 8.5.5.9 and
   this product addon only applies to the editions 8.5.5."
   
   This happens because the version values were incorrectly
   being formatted into their invalid edition message instead
   of the edition value. After fixing the format issue, the new
   message will look like below:
   "The specified product installation is edition <edition A>
   and this product addon only applies to the editions
   <editions A,B C....>."

   When applying license upgrade jar to an installation and failed
   due to incompatible edition, the terminal will return the
   following message:
   "The specified product installation is edition 8.5.5.9 and this
   product addon only applies to the editions 8.5.5."
   This is incorrect as the edition values are some how being
   substituted with version number. The correct output should be
   "The specified product installation is edition <edition A> and
   this product addon only applies to the editions <editions A,B
   C....>."
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The problem is fixed by reordering some of the parameters used
   to construct the SelfExtract error messages, so that the edition
   variables will be correctly formatted into the 'invalidEdition'
   message template.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix
