QUESTION
 How do you install IBM Rational AppScan Source Edition on a Linux system without X Windows? 

CAUSE
AppScan Source only provides a graphical installer. There is no command line installer. 
When you run the installer on a Linux system that does not have X Windows installed, you receive the following error:

Graphical installers are not supported by the vm.

Note: See technote 1462180 [https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21462180&us=727] if you receive this error on a Linux system that does have X Windows installed.


ANSWER
Although AppScan Source does not have a command line installer, you can work around the problem by configuring a silent install. 

To do so, you will need to run the graphical installer to generate a .properties file that specifies the components to install. 

The graphical installer can be run on a Windows or Linux system to generate the .properties file. 

The full steps for doing so follow: 

 1. Open a command prompt
    
    
 2. Temporarily set the variable OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE to create a .properties file. 
    
    For example:
     * On Linux:
       
       Export OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE=/home/user/Desktop/custom_install.properties
       or
       set OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE /home/user/Desktop/custom_install.properties
       
     * On Windows, you can set this variable using the setx command
       
       
    
    
 3. On Linux, run the AppScan Source installer from the same terminal session
    
    On Windows, run the installer from a different command prompt
    
    Rather than launching the product installer, the Custom Installation Wizard will be launched.
    
    
 4. Specify that the installation will be silent
    
    
 5. Continue with the remaining pages of the wizard to specify your installation options
    When you complete the wizard, a .properties file will be created.
    
    
 6. Unset the OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE variable.  * On Linux, you can close your existing terminal and open a new one. 
       On either OS, you can set OUNCE_CONFIG_FILE to a blank value (e.g. "").
       
       
    
    
 7. Run the installer and point to the .properties file. 
    
    For example: 
    ./setup.bin -f /home/user/Desktop/custom_install.properties
