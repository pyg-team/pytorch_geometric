PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  WebSphere Application Server administrators *
   *                  of ws-security enabled JAX-WS web services  *
   *                  applications using CRLs                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a JAX-WS service's ws-security     *
   *                      config has a cert store that contains a *
   *                      CRL and a cert, a ClassCastException    *
   *                      will occur                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   When JAX-WS web services provider's ws-security policy bindings
   have a certificate store that contains both one or more
   certificate revocation list (CRL) and one or more intermediate
   certificate, the following ClassCastException may occur when
   starting the application:
   
   Exception: javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPFaultException:
   CWWSS7049E: Exception received while loading the web services
   security custom bindings:: java.lang.ClassCastException:
   com.ibm.xmlns.prod.websphere._200608.ws_securitybinding.
   X509Certificates incompatible with com.ibm.xmlns.prod.
   websphere._200608.ws_securitybinding.CRL
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The web services security component was updated to properly
   support both certificate revocation lists (CRL) and intermediate
   certificates in the certificate store.
