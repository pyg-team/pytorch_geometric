APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A delay is observed in delivering messages to a remote queue
   manager after message rerouting on HP NSS queue manager.
   The order of events would be similar to the following:
   19:21:04   CLUSRCVR on AIX#1 was stopped
   19:21:20   Qmgr on AIX #1 stopped
   19:21:54   CLUSSDR on NonStop Qmgr detected channel down.
   19:22:54   AMQ9002 Channel TO.X is starting
   19:23:14   AMQ9202 Remote host not available
                    (It took 20 seconds)
                    (No message was PUT during this period.)
   19:23:14   AMQ9999 Channel program ended abnormally.
   19:24:14   AMQ9002 Channel TO.X is starting
   19:24:15   A message was PUT from NonStop
   19:24:22   Appl on AIX#4 received the message.
                    (It took 7 seconds)
   19:24:34   AMQ9202 Remote host not available.
   19:24:34   AMQ9999 Channel program ended abnormally.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  gethostbyname() was not called in a thread aware manner. This
   resulted in MCAs being blocked whenever a dns lookup took place
   and which may have caused delays if the name resolution did not
   return immediately.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The WebSphere MQ product code has been changed to solve the name
   resolution in a more thread friendly manner.
