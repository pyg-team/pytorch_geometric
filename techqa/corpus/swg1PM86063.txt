APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A shareable edit lock exists on the item created by copy-pasting
   a Project, Folder or Module on the DOORS Explorer window.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   =============
   1. Login as user A and copy module 'TEST: and paste it, the new
   name would be 'Copy of TEST'
   2. Login as user B and open the newly created copied module in
   Exclusive edit mode. You will get the message: 'Item ?module?
   locked by 1 user ?user A?'
   
   If we check Tools ? Manage Locks, we would observe that there is
   a shareable edit lock for the newly created module 'Copy of
   TEST' for user A.
   
   Work around:
   =========
   1. Open the module by user A and close it.
   2. Try to open it by user B. This time you can open it.
   
   The shareable edit lock would exist for 'user A' if this user
   was  to copy-paste a Folder or Project on the DB Explorer and
   thus prevent any movement/deletion etc of these items by other
   users.
