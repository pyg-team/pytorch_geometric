ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TWProcessApp's snapshots property does not return the items in
   the documented order
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.5/com.i
   bm.wbpm.ref.doc/ae/doc/JSAPI.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.5/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/ae/doc/JSAPI.html]
   The product javascript documentation mentions the following for
   this property:
   snapshots - Returns a JavaScript array of all of the snapshots
    of  the current process app on a Teamworks Process Server or
    Process Center. If on Process Center, excludes archived
    snapshots. This list returns the snapshots in the order of
    oldest to newest based on the snapshot creation date.
   
   The observed behavior is that it sometime is in the creation
   order by track and sometimes it may appear to be somewhat
   random.
   .
   .---------------------------------------------
      The query that is run that returns the data is
   select t0.SNAPSHOT_ID,t0.CREATED_ON,t0.NAME,t0.ACRONYM,
   t0.DESCRIPTION,t 0.SEQ_NUM,t0.ERROR_COUNTER,
   t0.ORIG_CREATED_ON,t0.ACTIVATED_ON,t0.STATUS, t0.CAPABILITY,
   t0.ARCHIVED_ON,t0.LAST_MODIFIED,t0.REPOSITORY_BRANCH_ID,
   t0.CREATED_BY_USER_ID,t0.BRANCH_ID,t0.PROJECT_ID,
   t0.LAST_MODIFIED_BY_USER_ ID,t0.CHANGE_DATA,t0.IS_ACTIVE,
   t0.IS_BLA_ACTIVE,t0.IS_STARTED,t0.IS_INSTALLED,
   t0.IS_BLA_INSTALLED,t0.IS_TIP_DEPLOYED,t0.IS_DEFAULT,
   t0.TIP_DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS,t0.IS_ARCHIVED from LSW_SNAPSHOT
   t0 where PROJECT_ID = ? and
   IS_ARCHIVED = ? and NAME is not null order by SEQ_NUM ASC
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To workaround the issue you would want to ensure that you sort
   the array after obtaining it. You may want to use the
   dateCreated or dateInstalled properties for the snapshots.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem will be fixed in next release.
