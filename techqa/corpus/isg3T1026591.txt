Title: IBM Why PAC GUI cannot login after switch backend database from Oracle to MariaDB? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 As Oracle database is no longer officially supported by PAC 10.1 and above versions, user has done a database switch over. dbconfig.sh was been used to point to new Maria database and tests were successfully done. But user cannot login to PAC GUI. The error messages in PAC GUI log look like as following:
Error 500: javax.servlet.ServletException: Filter 
[springSecurityFilterChain]: could not be initialized

It seems JDBC driver error but perf has been working well loading data to MariaDB!

Why? 

CAUSE
The MariaDB JDBC driver needs to exist in two places for perf and GUI individually.

ANSWER
Please make sure there are MariaDB JDBC driver files are in bellow two places(assume /opt/pac is where PAC's installation): 

/opt/pac/gui/3.0/wlp/usr/shared/resources/platform/mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar 

/opt/pac/perf/1.2/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar 

So currently dbconfig.sh script only takes care perf connection to database. The solution is to manually copy driver file to GUI location.
