Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to publish a package in Framework Manager we get this error: BMT-MDC-0001 Unable to publish.
And when selecting the data source in the Metadata Wizard within Framework Manager we get this error: BMT-MD-6001 Connection to the data source 'name of data source' failed because a valid connection string was not specified. 

CAUSE
In the Framework Manager > Cognos Configuration, the Dispatcher URI for external applications was set to be the same as the Gateway URI. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 Change the Dispatcher URI for external applications in the Framework Manager > Cognos Configuration to be the dispatcher URI that is set in Cognos BI Configuration. Then save the Framework Manager Cognos Configuration with this change.
