ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the FEM 4.5.1 query builder to run a script against
   thousands of documents in CE, you would normally set the Maximum
   to Display value to 0 and check the "Process All Results"
   checkbox.  This way, the script runs against all the documents
   returned from the query, but doesn't cause out of memory
   problems since no results are displayed.
   
   When using FEM 5.1, this same procedure does not work.  Even
   though "Process All Results" is checked, the system will only
   process as many items as the Maximum Displayed value specified.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. In FEM, select New Search to launch the Query Builder
   2. Enter search criteria that will return a few documents (For
   this example, 5 documents.)
   3. Set the Maximum Displayed value to 1
   4. Check the "Process All Results" checkbox
   5. On the script tab, click Enable Script and use a simple
   script such as:
   Public Sub OnCustomProcess (CEObject)
     msgbox "Processing document:" + CEObject.Id
   End Sub
   6. Execute the search
   Notice that only 1 message box pops up instead of the expected
   5.
   
   Actual Results: The script only runs against 1 item (or however
   many items are specified for Maximum to display) instead of
   against all the items in the query.
   
   Expected Results: The message box pops up 5 times as expected,
   indicating that the script is run against all documents returned
   from the query.
