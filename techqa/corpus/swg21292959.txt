Title: IBM How DB2 Content Manager reports unsupported DB2 JDBC drivers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What version of the DB2Â® JCC driver are currently supported for connecting to a DB2 Content Manager V8.4 server? How do I know if I am using an unsupported version? What happens if I use an unsupported version? 

ANSWER
The initial release of DB2 Content Manager V8.4 supports DB2 JCC JDBC driver V3.5 (as of January 2008). 

Your first choice for JDBC drivers should be to use those shipped with DB2 Content Manager V8.4 and located in the DB2 Content Manager V8.4 installation directory. 

If you are using a different version of the JCC driver, the native API does not throw an exception simply as a result of choosing an unsupported version level. The native API does detect the version of the driver that you are using and logs the following statements to the API log (dklog.log), which is controlled by cmblogconfig.properties. The native API does not block you from using a version of your choice, but whether it works and how well it works is not guaranteed or supported.
