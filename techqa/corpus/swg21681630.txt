QUESTION
 The SOA KD4.dc.properties file does not get created successfully. 

ANSWER
If you integrated the ITCAM for AD / WebSphere Data Collector with ITCAM for SOA for applications servers within a profile, and restart the DC and agent, the KD4.dc.properties file will be created in the $ITM_SOA_HOME/KD4/config directory.

If the KD4.dc.properties file is not created successfully, you have to check several things:
* check the permissions of the user during the configuration, it must be able to write into the directory
* check the ulimit parameters on the system
* check the WebSphere DC integration with the SOA DC. Look in the logs directory for any errors in the configuration.
* restart the DC and agent, look in the agent logs for any errors during startup.
