Title: IBM Cannot start the manager or the management server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You cannot start the instance of WebSphere™ Application Server Community Edition that you have installed with Optim™ Manager or Optim Management Server, or you cannot start the instances of Optim Manager or Optim Management Server that you have deployed to WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. 

SYMPTOM
You try to start WebSphere Application Server Community Edition, but the console window closes and you are not able to access the administrative console. 

Alternately, you can start WebSphere Application Server Community Edition and access the administrative console, but the "optim" and "server" web applications do not start, and you cannot start these web applications from the administrative console. 

In either case, you cannot access the manager user interface.


CAUSE
There is a port conflict between the ports that are used by WebSphere Application Server Community Edition and the ports used by another application on the computer. The other application could be another instance of WebSphere Application Server Community Edition that was not shut down cleanly. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Restart the computer. After the computer restarts, start WebSphere Application Server Community Edition manually if the application is not set to run as a service or is not otherwise set to start automatically when the computer starts. 

If the problem persists, resolve the port conflict by changing the ports used by WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. To do this, open the config-substitutions.properties file, change the value in the PortOffset line, and restart WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. 

The config-substitutions.properties file is located in the {WASCE_HOME}\var\config folder, where {WASCE_HOME} is the folder to which you installed WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. The default folder for WebSphere Application Server Community Edition depends on the computer operating system and on the user who installed WebSphere Application Server Community Edition. 

 * Windows
   C:\Program Files\IBM Optim\shared\WebSphere\ 
 * AIX®/Linux/Unix  * Installed by root user
      /opt/IBM/Optim/shared/WebSphere/ 
    * Installed by user other than root
      /home/{username}/IBM/Optim/shared/WebSphere/, where {username} is the user who installed WebSphere Application Server Community Edition
   
   

If you change the value in the PortOffset line, you must also change the port number in the URL that you use to access the manager or the administrative console. For example, if the default port number used by WebSphere Application Server Community Edition is 8080, then a PortOffset value of 10 would set the port to 8090, and the connection URL for the manager would be http:// hostname :8090/optim/console. Alternately, you can locate the application that is using the ports needed by WebSphere Application Server Community Edition and either shut down the application or change the ports used by the application to resolve the port conflict.
