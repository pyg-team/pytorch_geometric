Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Under specific circumstances IBM® Db2® installation creates users with a weak password hashing algorithm  (CVE-2017-1571). - United States

Text:
password hashing; CVE-2017-1571; silent install SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 When installed in Silent mode Db2 creates users with a weak password hashing algorithm, which results in only the first 8 characters of the supplied password being used, and remaining characters being ignored. This does not happen if existing users are used during installation; it only happens when Db2 creates the user during installation. The users created during installation are: instance owner, fenced user, and Db2 administration server (DAS) user. 

This does not happen when Db2 installation is done in UI mode. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-1571 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1571]
DESCRIPTION: IBM DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes DB2 Connect Server) uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131853 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/131853] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS

V11.1.3 FP3 IT22415 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT22415] https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044630 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24044630] WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If installing Db2 in Silent mode, pre-create the users before the installation. This behaviour only occurs when Db2 creates the users during installation. Alternatively, perform the Db2 installation in UI mode.

If Db2 is already installed, you should change your password for the affected users (instance owner, fenced user, and Db2 administration server (DAS) user), which will use a stronger password hashing algorithm. Apply the special build if you will be performing Silent mode installation of Db2 without existing users.
