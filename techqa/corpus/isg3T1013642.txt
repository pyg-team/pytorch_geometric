 How do I configure fair sharing among queues? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
How do I configure fair sharing among queues ?Suppose a site wants the fair share control between queue priority and queue normal. The site can define the following in configuration files:

Begin UserGroup
GROUP_NAME GROUP_MEMBER
priority all
normal all
End UserGroup

Begin HostPartition
HPART_NAME = all_hosts
HOSTS = all
USER_SHARES = [priority, 50] [normal, 50]
End HostPartition

Jobs are submitted to queue priority with options:

-q priority and -G priority 

and jobs are submitted to queue normal with options:

-q normal and -G normal

Thus, jobs in queue priority use the shares assigned to group priority and jobs in queue normal use the shares assigned to group normal.

If a site wants to give queue priority higher priority to start jobs, more shares can be assigned to group priority. For example,

USER_SHARES = [priority, 5000] [normal, 1]

This guarantees jobs in queue priority always get started earlier than jobs in queue normal.
