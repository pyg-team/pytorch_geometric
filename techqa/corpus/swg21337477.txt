Title: IBM Altering an Oracle Impromptu Session using the cogdmor.ini file - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to set multiple session parameters via the ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS= sections or the Attach= lines in the cogdmor.ini file.

Only the first parameter added in each section is getting recognized.

For example if the following is used - 

; ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=NLS_LANGUAGE=FRENCH NLS_TERRITORY=FRANCE NLS_SORT=BINARY
ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING=100
ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=ALWAYS_ANTI_JOIN=NESTED_LOOPS
ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT=2
ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=SORT_AREA_SIZE=10000

Only the OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING=100 setting is changed 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To set multiple parameters via the codgmor.ini file use a single line for the ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS= or the Attach= and separate the actual parameters by a space.

Example Section from Cogdmor.ini file - 

;Oracle does not allow to execute a few sql statements at the same time!!!
;oexec function takes only one SQL statement.
[UDA USER OPTIONS]
;Attach=ALTER SESSION SET NLS_LANGUAGE=FRENCH;ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TERRITORY=FRANCE NLS_SORT=BINARY
Attach=ALTER SESSION SET OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING=100 DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT=2 SORT_AREA_SIZE=10000

;
; The Transparent Gateways for DB/2, SQL/400 and DRDA have, depending
; upon the version of the gateway, exhibited a problem with distinct
; clauses and aggregates. The backend databases have restrictions for 
; which the gateways should account, but sometimes do not. Setting
; the 'Distinct Restriction' entry to zero indicates that this problem
; has been corrected.
;
Distinct Restriction=1
;
;
; The entry 'Fetch Number of Rows' is used to determine how many rows to fetch
; per fetch operation. Increasing this number can provide better performance
; on some systems. Note that the OCI currently limits this number to 32767.
; Also note that numbers larger than 100 may actually degrade performance on
; some systems.
;
; The entry 'Fetch Buffer Size' is used to determine the size of buffer to 
; use when fetching. Larger values can provide better performance on
; some systems. Note that on 16bit Windows platforms, this is restricted
; to approximately 64k.
; 
; If both 'Fetch Buffer Size' and 'Fetch Number of Rows' are set, the latter
; will take precedence and the former will be ignored.
;
; By default, the buffer size used is 2048 bytes, to change this default,
; uncomment one of the following entries and set it accordingly.
;
;Fetch Buffer Size=2048
;Fetch Number of Rows=10

; The entry 'Not Support Scaled Integer' is used to change the Oracle scaled
; integer type from integer types to sqlDecimal type. The default of this entry
; is 0 for 'Not Support Scaled Integer' is FALSE. Set the value to 1, users will
; get sqlDecimal for all the non-zero scaled integers.
;
Not Support Scaled Integer=0

; This flag allows the user to alter the session details as required.
; Please make sure that the user enters the valid parameters ( specific
; to Oracle ) to be altered. Please do not put double routes around
; each parameter , however, user can put single quotes around some
; of the parameters like :- NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-DD-MM' . Check
; Oracle SQL reference manual for details for usage.
;
; ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=NLS_LANGUAGE=FRENCH NLS_TERRITORY=FRANCE NLS_SORT=BINARY
ALTER_SESSION_PARAMETERS=OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING=100 DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT=2 SORT_AREA_SIZE=10000
