Title: IBM How to merge license keys with *.dat format with *.upd format - United States

Text:
merge telelogic licenses TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The usual way of setting up a License Server using Rational products is different from Rational Telelogic products.

The difference being that Rational License Keys (which are generated as *.upd files from the License Key Center) need to be imported through the Rational License Key Administrator and which are in turn imported to the rational_server_perm.dat file. 

SYMPTOM
The license file format differs for IBM Rational products 

Rational licenses disappears from the license file and disconnected mode on LKAD (License Key Administrator) 


ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft Windows 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The usual way of setting up a License Server using Rational Products is different from Rational Telelogic Products.

The difference being that Rational License Keys which are generated as *.upd files(from License Key Center) need to be imported through the Rational License Key Administrator and which in turn gets imported to the rational_server_perm.dat file. 

 

This file by default resides in the following windows directory. 

 * 
 * 


Where as Telelogic Products do not use the License Key Administrator, they are directly hosted as *.dat files from LMTOOLS(in Windows) and lmutil (in UNIX), which gets installed in the following directory: 

 * 
 * 


Telelogic products use the "telelogic.exe" Daemon and Rational products use "rational.exe" or "ibmratl.exe" daemon's appropriately. 

 

Now the latest version of Rational License Server v8.1.1 has all three daemon files installed (telelogic, rational & ibmratl). which was not the case before. 

 

In the following example, consider Rational RequisitePro for a Rational Product (using rational daemon) and Telelogic Publishing Engine (now Rational Publishing Engine, using telelogic dameon): 

 

 

1. Import the Rational Requisite-Pro license (*.upd file) using the license key administrators, it will import the key to the 'rational_server_perm.dat' file as follows, example given below: 

 * 
 * 
   /* Automatically added packages in the beggining*/

 *  0000000000 for The XXXX Company" ck=000 SN=0000000
   
 * 


 

2. Later just add the telelogic daemon file location as follows: 

 

 * 
 * 
   SERVER <hostname> <hostid> 19353 VENDOR ibmratl
   
   
   


3. Now just copy and paste the Rational Telelogic System Architect keys (excluding the server line) to this file (rational_server_perm.dat) , as follows: 

 

 * 
 * 
   ################################################ # IBM Rational software

4. and rest of other features including any packages 

 

5. Go to the LMTOOLS -> Config Servoces tab and change the license file location to 'rational_server_perm.dat' and restart the server. 

 

Note : default location for 'rational_server_perm.dat' , in windows is 'C:\Program Files\IBM\RationalSDLC\common' when the Rational license server is installed. 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE: The latest version of Rational License Server v8.1.1 has both('telelogic' & 'rational' )daemons merged into one and now available as 'ibmratl' daemon. Hence installing two different license servers can be avoided with this version. 

 

 

Port details: 

------------------- 

 

Telelogic product licenses uses the port 19353 as a default lmgrd port, while Rational product licenses use port 27000 as default generated in the License Key Center website.
And when we are merging the both files to be served by the same license server , you need to use either 27000 or 19353 for all Rational/Telelogic products.

In other words, all Rational & Telelogic product clients should either use 27000@servername or 19353@servername.This steps helps simplify and streamline the license management fro All IBM Rational products.
