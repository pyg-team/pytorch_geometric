QUESTION
 How do I set DASH's trace level from the command line? 

ANSWER
Make a backup copy of the server.xml file located under:

<JazzSM Home>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/nodes/JazzSMNode01Node/servers/server1

For example, make a copy called "server.xml.bak" 

 1. Start an interactive wsadmin session using the wsadmin script found under <JazzSM Home>/profile/bin:
    
    Windows: wsadmin.bat -lang jacl
    Unix: ./wsadmin.sh -lang jacl
    
    When prompted, log in as the primary administrative user (usually "tipadmin") 
 2. Enter the following wsadmin commands:
    
    Type:
    set myServer [$AdminConfig getid /Server:server1/] 
    
    Output:
    server1(cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/nodes/JazzSMNode01Node/servers/server1|server.xml#Server_1308167523961)
    
    Type:
    set ts [$AdminConfig list TraceService $myServer]
    
    Output:
    (cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/nodes/JazzSMNode01Node/servers/server1|server.xml#TraceService_1308167523967)
    
    Unless directed to use other trace strings by IBM Support, the recommended trace for DASH are as follows:
    *=info: 
    com.ibm.isc.*=all: 
    com.ibm.isclite.*=all: 
    com.ibm.iscportal.*=all
    
    Type the following all on one line:
    $AdminConfig modify $ts {{startupTraceSpecification *=info=enabled:com.ibm.isc.*=all=enabled:
    com.ibm.isclite.*=all=enabled:com.ibm.iscportal.*=all=enabled}}
    
    Type:
    $AdminConfig save
    exit
    

You must restart the server for the new tracing level to take effect. Once tracing is enabled, reproduce the DASH runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. Collect the logs from: 

 <JazzSM home>profile/logs/server1 

and attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR). Please include the time the issue was reproduced in the PMR update.
