ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer request for the Resource Reservation database to have
   the ability to disable a room/resource based on a start and stop
   date.  This way users can reserve the room on the dates when it
   will be available, and likewise, not be able to reserve the room
   on the dates that it's not available.  For example.  Today is
   8/15.  I like to disable a room from 9/8 - 9/12.  So clients can
   make reservation for before 9/8 and after 9/12 today.
   
   Secondly, if I need to disable a room but the rooms have already
   been scheduled then I need to be able to send an email
   notification to these people notifying them to change their
   reservation.
