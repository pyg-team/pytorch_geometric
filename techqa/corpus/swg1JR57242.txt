APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the JavaScript abort() function is used in the current
   process instance against itself, there are limitations its
   intended use is against other process instances.
   For example, if you use
   tw.system.currentProcessInstance.abort() in an activity that
   was started manually, the open tasks change to closed, but the
   process instance remains in the active state.
   
   This limitation is not documented in "JavaScript API for IBM
   Process Designer"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ibm
   .wbpm.ref.doc/ae/doc/JSAPI.html).
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Model a Terminate End Event instead, which immediately
   terminates a process instance.
   If there are multiple branches of control within the process,
   the first branch that reaches a Terminate End Event will cause
   the immediate termination of all branches, closing all
   outstanding tasks and canceling any timers.
   
   For more information, see "REST interface for BPD-related
   resources - Process Instance Resource - PUT (suspend, resume,
   terminate, or retry) Method"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.6/com.ibm
   .wbpm.ref.doc/rest/bpmrest/rest_bpm_wle_v1_process_instanceid_pu
   t_suspend,_resume,_terminate,_or_retry.htm).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using the abort() process instance JavaScript API does not
   always work for the current running process instance it is being
   called from.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The content will be updated the next time the documentation is
   refreshed.
