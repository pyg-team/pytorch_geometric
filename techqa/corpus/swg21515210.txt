Title: IBM Tables may display incorrect results when working in Locale mode and producing tables with non-English characters, (i.e., SPSS Statistics is not running in Unicode mode) - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 An issue has been identified in IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 where, when working in Locale mode and producing tables with non-English characters, tables may display incorrect results. Table values may be reported in the wrong cell or not reported at all.

The following products are affected: 

PID Product Name 5725A54 SPSS Statistics Desktop 20.0 (Including Grad Packs) 5725A58 SPSS Statistics Developer 20.0 5725A56 SPSS Statistics Server 20.0 5725A55 SPSS Statistics Faculty/Author 20.0 These are the conditions that can cause this issue to occur: You are using non-English characters for variable names, variable labels, value labels or string values. 

In the Edit->Options->General tab, under “Character Encoding for Data and Syntax” you have selected “Locale’s writing system” instead of “Unicode (universal character set)”. 

If the results then include a table with row or column headers that are strings or variable names with non-English characters, it is possible that the table will be incorrectly displayed. The exact problem may vary, but the most common scenario is that if you have a table with rows "X" and "Y", the "X" row's values will be overwritten with the "Y" row's values, and the "Y" row will be missing. 

For example, instead of: 

Descriptive Statistics [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21515210&amp;aid=1] N Mean 연령[단위:세] 6400 42.06 결 6400 .50 Valid N (listwise) 6400 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21515210&amp;aid=1] 

You will see: Descriptive Statistics [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21515210&amp;aid=1] N Mean 연령[단위:세] 6400 .50 Valid N (listwise) 6400 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21515210&amp;aid=1] 
APAR PM47177 [http://www.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1PM47177] has been logged for this issue and an interim fix is available for download [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030902] with installation instructions. 

NOTE: This problem does not occur when working in Unicode mode. Launch the application and before opening any data, go to Edit->Options->General tab, and in the lower right select “Unicode (universal character set)” instead of “Locale’s Writing System”. You should then have no issue.
