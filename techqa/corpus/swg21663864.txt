PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a problem with the Business Rules component in IBM Business Process Manager Advanced. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the IBM Business Process Manager Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
 

 1. Collect general information from the Collect troubleshooting data for installation or upgrade problems with IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] page including the following information:  * Results from the versionInfo command 
     * Project Interchange for the scenario 
     * Detailed problem description
       
       
    
    
 2. Set the trace string and reproduce the issue.
    
    
    For general issues that are related to Business Rules, set the trace string to the following values:
    *=info:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.brules.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.common.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.customization.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiservers.common.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiservers.customization.*=all
    
    
    If your problem involves the administration of Business Rules, such as using the Business Rules Manager, set the trace string to the following values:
    *=info:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.brules.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.common.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiserver.customization.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiservers.common.*=all:
    com.ibm.wbiservers.customization.*=all: 
    com.ibm.ws.sca.management.*=all:
    com.ibm.ws.sca.*=all:
    SCA.Core=all 
    
    
    Note: Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction time-outs and errors.
    
    
    To set the tracing and generate a new set of logs and traces, complete the following steps:  1. Under ​Troubleshooting​ ​>​ ​Log and Trace​, select the server where you want to change the settings. ​
        
        
     2. Click Change Log Detail Levels​.
        
        
     3. Select the ​configuration tab to set the tracing. This change takes effect after the next server restart and a completely new set of log files can be collected. Optionally, select the Runtime​ tab to dynamically set the tracing.
        
        
     4. Enter the trace string and click OK.
        
        
     5. If you selected the configuration tab, stop the server.
        
        
     6. Archive and delete the current logs, traces, and ffdc from the following directories:  * <install​​_​​root>​​/​​profiles/<profile​​_​​name>​​/​​logs​​/<​​server​​_​​name> 
         * <install​​_​​root>​​/​​profiles/<profile​​_​​name>​​/​​logs​​/ffdc
           
           
        
        
     7. Start the server and check the trace.log file to make sure that the correct tracing is set.
        
        
     8. Reproduce the problem and gather the complete server log files and ffdc directory.
        
        
     9. Delete the trace string from the Log Detail Level for your server.
        
        
        Note: Ensure that you have set the Maximum trace file size (recommendation: 20MB) as well as the number of historical trace files (recommendation: 10) to an appropriate value. You can find those values at Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service. 
        
        
    
    
 3. Export the business rules and settings that are used by the runtime server. Complete the following steps in the administrative console to export the rules:  1. Click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server_name > Business Rules > Business rules.
        
        
     2. Select the check box beside one or more business rules and click Export.

GENERAL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
Changes to Service Component Architecture (SCA) modules, such as re-wiring, might trigger a redeployment of the module. The redeployment process overwrites any customization of the business rules for that module. Export any customized rules prior to deployment or a change. Then, re-import the rules back into the system after the deployment to preserve the customized rules.



WHAT TO DO NEXT
 1. Review the logs and traces at the time of the problem to try to determine the source of the problem.
    
    
 2. Use IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to search for known problems in the information center, forums, and technotes.
    
    
 3. If you cannot find related problems or cannot solve the problem, send the information you have collected to IBM by following the instructions in Exchanging Information with IBM Technical Support. [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/exchangeinfo.html]
