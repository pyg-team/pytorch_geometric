Title: IBM PDF to Image conversion creates images that are too large - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When PDFs are converted to images, the created images visibly look correct but the pixel size is too large. For example, a 200 dpi image of an 8.5" x 11" page should have a pixel size of 1700 x 2200. Instead, the resulting image could have a pixel size similar to 7842 x 10133. 

SYMPTOM
The physical page size will be incorrect, making the physical size of the image much larger than it should be. For example, an 8.5" x 11" page might now have a physical size of 39" x 50". 

 * The large image will prevent fingerprint matching against the same images of the correct size. 
 * Field zones created with the large images will not have the correct page locations when the correct size images are used. 
 * Subsequent actions that use these incorrectly sized images might fail. For example, barcodes might not be read, recognition can have characters omitted, or an action that uses the image might fail because it is too large.


CAUSE
The following actions can cause this problem: 

PDFDocumentToImage dcpdf_CreateTiffFromPDF dcpdf_CreateTiffFromPDF_CreateDocs Using the FastDoc Scan panel to import a PDF file into a batch 
These instances can create images that visibly look correct, but are much larger than they should be.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


In Datacap, versions 9.0 Fix Pack 3 through Datacap 9.1, use the action "PDFFREDocumentToImage".

The action "PDFDocumentToImage" has been corrected in Datacap V9.1.1, and later. Upgrading to this version or later resolves the issue.

Fingerprints that have been created with the incorrectly sized images will need to be recreated with the correctly sized images. The correctly sized images will not match fingerprints from the large images. Additionally, zones created on the large images will not match, and will need to be corrected by creating zones using the correctly sized images.
