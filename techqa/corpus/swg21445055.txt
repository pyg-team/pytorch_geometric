QUESTION
 What data needs to be collected to diagnose SDMS related problems? 

ANSWER
This page contains links (URLs) to the data collecting instructions for SDMS (SOA Domain Management Server) log/trace and the related product information.

Collecting SDMS log
Collecting SDMS log and trace 
Collecting SDMS related TEPS log (that is helpful to diagnose SDMS issue)
Collecting TEMA log (SOA Agent log)







Collecting SDMS Data 
Collect and send the following SDMS log information From TEPS * Windows : 
<ITM-Home>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\logs\ITMServer\trace*.log 
(if it exists)
<ITM-Home>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\logs\ITMServer\system*.log

* Unix :
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/trace*.log 
(if it exists)
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/system*.log
From TEP GUI Screenshot of TEP with the Topology View that shows the problem.

Collecting SDMS log and trace 
1. Enable SDMS Trace Procedure to Enable SDMS Trace 1. Change the directory to the following location
* Windows : <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin 
* Unix : <ITM_Home>/<platform>/cq/Products/KD4/bin 

2. Run the kd4ChangeTraceLevel script with the -sa option:
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -sa (Starts tracing always for SDMS)

3. Restart the TEPS (for the new trace setting to take affect).

4. Make sure that the current directory is the same as specified in step 1.

5. Run the kd4ChangeTracelevel script with the -ra option:
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -ra (Starts tracing for the current runtime)

6. Allow the system to run for a minimum of 5 minutes, and then reproduce the issue (problem). This will ensure that the trace includes a full interrogation of all agents. 
2. Collect and send the following information From TEPS * Windows : 
<ITM-Home>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\logs\ITMServer\trace*.log 
<ITM-Home>\CNPSJ\profiles\ITMProfile\logs\ITMServer\system*.log

* Unix :
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/trace*.log 
<ITM-Home>/<platform>/iw/profiles/ITMProfile/logs/ITMServer/System*.log
From TEP GUI Screenshot of TEP with the Topology View that shows the problem. 
3. Disable SDMS trace setting Procedure to Disable SDMS Trace 1. Change the directory to the following location
* Windows : <ITM-Home>\CNPS\Products\KD4\bin 
* Unix : <ITM_Home>/<platform>/cq/Products/KD4/bin 

2. Run the kd4ChangeTraceLevel script with the -sd option:
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -sd (Starts tracing always for SDMS)

3. Restart the TEPS (for the new trace setting to take affect).

4. Make sure that the current directory is the same as specified in step 1.

5. Run the kd4ChangeTracelevel script with the -rd option:
kd4ChangeTraceLevel -rd (Starts tracing for the current runtime)
