QUESTION
 How to disable the low level encryption along with the use of SSL v2.0 for ITM components? 

ANSWER
 

To disable the security vulnerability in OpenSSL version 2, follow the below technote:

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21315078 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21315078]

To disable the low level encryption, add the below variable in monitoring server (TEMS), TEPS or agent server and enable a specific cypher

for example, to strengthen the RSA (256)and DES encryption add the below variable in the ITM components configuration file

Windows : GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS=350A
UNIX/Linux : GSK_V3_CIPHER_SPECS='350A'

The strings "35" and "0A" is described here in the GSKit documentation. 

01 = NULL MD5 
02 = NULL SHA 
03 = RC4 MD5 EXPORT 
04 = RC4 MD5 US 
05 = RC4 SHA US 
06 = RC2 MD5 EXPORT 
09 = DES SHA EXPORT 
0A = Triple DES SHA US 
2F = TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA 
35 = TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA 
NULL = Default cipher specs are used (may change in future) 
For AC3 = '04052F350A090306' 
For AC2 = '090306' (AC2 is supported but no longer shipped)
