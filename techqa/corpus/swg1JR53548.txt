APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An SCA module in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
   sends a message to an intermediate message event inside a
   business process definition (BPD) that listens for that SCA
   message. However, sometimes the message cannot be delivered to
   the waiting intermediate message event and disappears, keeping
   the intermediate message event waiting.
   
   To identify the issue, turn on the trace function and use
   criteria WLE.*=all. Search for message CWLLG1110W inside the
   trace. A trace entry like the following trace entry identifies
   the problem:
   &#196;2/6/15 10:37:34:165 EST&#220; 00000141 wle_engine    1
   com.lombardisoftware.bpd.runtime.engine.BPDEngine
   processNotificationRegardlessStatus CWLLG1110W: Ignoring
   notification com.lombardisoftware.bpd.runtime.engine.
   message.BPDMessageDeliverySCAEventNotification&#167;8392b914
   for which a node could not be found.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When an SCA module sends a message to an intermediate message
   event, IBM BPM first searches the BPD instance. Inside the BPD
   instance, IBM BPM uses the corresponding event ID and the name
   of the SCA service to find the intermediate message event that
   receives the message. When the receiving intermediate message
   event is activated, it stores its event ID and SCA service name
   in the execution context of the BPD instance.
   The problem occurs because IBM BPM uses an event ID that is not
   persisted in the BPD in the database but is created each time
   the BPD is retrieved from the database. Therefore, if the
   intermediate message event is activated on a server and the
   message is delivered on a different server, the two servers use
   different event IDs and the message cannot be delivered.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM BPM that uses an event ID that is
   persisted in the BPD in the database. In this way, all servers
   use the same event ID for the same intermediate event.
   On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
   for JR53548:
   1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
     the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
     level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
   2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR53548, and click Continue.
   When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
   the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
   additional installation instructions and information about the
   fix.
   NOTE: Messages sent or tokens which arrived at an IME before
   the APAR is installed cannot be processed. This would include
   cases of upgrades to a product version which has the fix. The
   token on the IME would need to be moved again and the message
   sent a second time.
