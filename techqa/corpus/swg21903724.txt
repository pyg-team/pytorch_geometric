QUESTION
 I download the IBM SPSS Modeler 17 trial version. but when I try to open it after setting up, it always show "No License Key Found". 

How do I enable the 14-day trial license? 

ANSWER
The trial license is copied to the local hard drive as part of the IBM SPSS Modeler installation. To enable this license, please follow the steps below: 
* Please ensure that you don't have any open windows of IBM SPSS Modeler running.
* Restart the License Authorization Wizard as an Administrator and select the Enable Trial option.
* You would now need to point to the location of the trial licence file (located in the installation directory of the Demo version of Modeler), do this by clicking on the ‘Open Folder’ icon and selecting the ‘temp.txt’ file.
- By default, the installation directory for Windows would be: C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\xx\bin (where ‘xx’ is your version number)
* Complete the rest of the wizard and restart IBM SPSS Modeler, you should now be able to use the application for 14 days.
