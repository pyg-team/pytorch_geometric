 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 In Workplace XT 1.1.4, a feature was implemented to allow an entry template to block the creation of multiple files with the same name. However, this setting is not supported for form data entry templates, even though it is available in the user interface. 

CONTENT
The feature was documented for entry templates in the "Set the object properties" topic. But in Workplace XT, even after setting this flag in the Form Data Entry Template, the template can be used to create multiple document policies with the same name. 

On a Workplace XT 1.1.4 Entry Template, there is a setting called "Allow duplicate file names:" under Options from the Set Properties page added to the Entry Template creation. However, creating duplicate file names feature will not work in eForms.
