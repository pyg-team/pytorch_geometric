APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For a multi-value string property, if configured inside a custom
   view as a TextArea and placed inside a PropertyTable container,
   a user will see the following issues during runtime:
   1) Trying to add a carriage return or line feed to wrap the text
   inside the TextArea does not work.  Pressing the [Enter] key
   will just result in an edit complete action on the TextArea.
   2) Trying to wrap the text inside the TextArea if the contained
   text is longer than the configured width of the TextArea does
   not work with Internet Explorer.  If the 'wrap' setting is
   configured on the PropertyTable container, the user will not be
   able to edit any properties on a new row.  Using FireFox or
   Chrome does not have this issue.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.1.5-ICM-FP005 or later.  With the fix, long strings
   entered in a property table where a text area is defined will
   now wrap correctly.  Pressing return inside the text area will
   also insert a carriage return.
