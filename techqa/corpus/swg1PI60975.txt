APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When importing a Rhapsody model into Eclipse with the Rhapsody
   Platform Integration plugin installed, the user encounters an
   error stating "Invalid Project Description" and "<Project_name>
   overlaps the location of another project <same project_name>"
   
   This error can appear for a variety of different scenarios but
   it is not an accurate error in the following scenario:
   
   1) The name of the folder that contains the Rhapsody model is
   different from the name of the Rhapsody model itself, e.g.
   C:\MyRhapsodyProject\HelloWorld.rpy instead of
   C:\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.rpy
   2) The user copies this folder into their workspace prior to
   importing it, e.g. C:\MyWorkspace\MyRhapsodyProject
   
   In this scenario, the user should be informed that the folder
   name should match the project file name.
