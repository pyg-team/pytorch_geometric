APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When the MS SQL Agent db_password is configured using the TEP,
   the
   password is written with DES encryption rather than AES256.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   Setup Windows Domain user as administrator on all machines.
   Install TEMS 6.2.2 FP3 on Windows box A.
   Install TEP 6.2.2 FP3  on Windows box B.
   Install TEMA 6.2.2 FP3 on Windows 2003 Server Endpoint
   Add MS SQL Agent 6.2.1 to TEMS Depot
   Execute "Add Managed System" on TEP
   Specify MS SQL Server Password as "abcd"
   Examine the MS SQL Agent configuration file on TEMA.
   Observe that the db_password text is preceeded by the string DES
   and not
   AES256.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All TEMS users.                              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: WRONG PASSWORD TYPE IS USED ON A 64-BIT *
   *                      MACHINE.                                *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   When configuring the MSSQL agent via remote deploy, the 64-
   bit version of the cryptographic routines are used with the
   32-bit agent and the MSSQL agent configuration fails.  The
   problem occurs on a 64-bit Windows system running a 64-bit
   NT agent and a 32-bit MSSQL Server agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code has been added to make sure that the correct
   cryptographic routines are always invoked.
