APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  I reproduced it most of the time in 8.0.2 and 8.0.2 FP1
   When using shortcut keys to navigate mail in Notes,  seeing
   inconsistent behavior.
   STEPS:
   - In Notes mail, use the enter key to open a new message (that
   hasn't been opened yet).
   - I was able to reproduce this just by sending a new email to
   myself.
   - with message open, hit Alt-A keys.   This should highlight the
   Actions menu and show the drop down.
   RESULT:  the word "Actions" in the menu is highlighted but it
   does not show the drop down list.   Even using the arrow down
   key will not show the list.  Tried using the mouse at this point
   and that too will not shot the list.
   
   Close the message and reopen with the same actions.   Now Alt A
   will show the correct drop down choices.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  close and reopen the message.
