 DETAILED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ABSTRACT
 This document describes the system requirements for IBM InfoSphere Data Replication V11.3.3 

CONTENT


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
InfoSphere Data Replication consists of three technologies:

 * Change data capture (CDC)
 * Q Replication
 * SQL Replication

As the system requirements for each technology differs, you should pay close attention to the notes for each requirement to verify that they apply to your chosen technology.

The Q Replication, SQL Replication and CDC Replication Engine for z/OS software was not updated in V11.3.3. Use the following links to view the system requirements for the most recent versions of the Q Replication, SQL Replication and CDC Replication Engine for z/OS software:

 

 * V10.2.1 [https://ibm.biz/BdxwE7] (Linux, UNIX, and Windows) 
 * V10.2.1 [https://ibm.biz/BdxwXB] (z/OS) 
 * For more information about InfoSphere Data Replication, see the [<a href=]" target="_blank">product overview.
 * Table of supported system requirements
 * The links in the table below are located in the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool and go directly to the supported operating systems, prerequisites, system requirements, and optional supported software for the specific operating system. Because the report is dynamically generated, it might take a moment to open.
