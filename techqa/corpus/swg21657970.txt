Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When you have problems with WebSphere eXtreme Scale that require IBM Support, first collect the information in this document for support to review. This is the general documentation needed to perform the initial review and diagnosis of most issues. Some problems might require more detailed traces after the initial review has been completed. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


 1. 
 2. Provide a detailed problem description, which includes:  1. A detailed explanation of the behavior seen that indicated there was a problem
        
     2. Any exceptions or errors being logged at the time the problem occurs
        
     3. The time the problem occurred
        
     4. The steps to recreate the problem
        
     5. The steps taken to recover from the problem
        
    
    
    
    
 3. Provide a detailed description of the environment and the eXtreme Scale topology, which includes:
     1.  The version of eXtreme Scale, including Fix Pack and the current interim fix level
        
     2.  The server names of the catalogs and containers 
        
     3.  The node or physical server names that have eXtreme Scale processes running
        
     4.  Which catalogs and containers (from part b) are running on each node or server
        
     5.  The host name and IP address of the nodes where each eXtreme Scale process is running
        
     6.  Any configuration details on zones, multimaster replication (MMR), or quorum if these are implemented
        
    
    
    
    
 4. At the time the problem occurs, collect the output of the following xscmd commands:
     1.  xscmd -c showPlacement
        
     2.  xscmd -c routetable
        
     3.  xscmd -c showMapsizes
        
     4.  xscmd -c showQuorumStatus
        
     5.  xscmd -c revisions
        
    
    
    If running with multimaster replication (MMR) add:  6.  xscmd -c showLinkedDomains
        
     7.  xscmd -c showLinkedPrimaries
        
     8.  xscmd -c showLinkedPrimaries -hc
        
    
    
    
    
 5. Collect the eXtreme Scale configuration files:
     1.  Provide any server properties files for the containers, catalogs, and clients
        
     2.  Provide any security properties files for the containers, catalogs, and clients
        
     3.  Provide the objectGrid descriptor XML file (objectGrid.xml)
        
     4.  Provide the objectGrid deployment policy descriptor XML file (objectGridDeployment.xml)
        
     5.  Provide any client override xml files
        
     6.  Provide the splicer.props file or files (if this is an eXtreme Scale HTTP session data grid issue)
        
    
    
    
    
 6. Collect the eXtreme Scale logs:
     1.  The complete logs directory from all the catalog and container processes
        
     2. Collect the eXtreme Scale client side logs, if the problem requiring troubleshooting is on the client side
         * 
         * For problems with eXtreme Scale as the dynamic cache provider, collect the logs from all the clients
           
         * For eXtreme Scale session grid issues, collect the logs from all the clients involved in the problem 
         * For eXtreme Scale data grid issues, collect the logs from a couple of clients that are experiencing the error
           
            * 
            * 
            * 
            * For eXtreme Scale processes (including clients) running in a WebSphere Application Server process, provide the contents of the following directory:
              <WebSphere_Install_root>/profiles/(profile_name)/logs
              
              
            * For stand-alone eXtreme Scale processes, provide the contents of the following directory:
              <WXS_Install_root>/ObjectGrid/bin/logs
              
           
           
        
        
    
    

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Ensure all of the files, not a subset of files from the logs directory are collected
   
 * Ensure the ffdc directory for each eXtreme Scale process is always included in the logs
   
 * Ensure the logs from all eXtreme Scale server-side processes are always collected regardless of the eXtreme Scale issue
   
 * Ensure that the eXtreme Scale logs not just the application logs are loaded if client logs are needed
   
 * If any heap dumps, javacore files, or system cores are generated for the issue, such as in the case of OOMs or crashes, include these for each process
   
 * Routinely clean and rotate logs to avoid an overabundance of old logs
