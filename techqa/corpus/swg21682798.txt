Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation application authenticity bypass (CVE-2014-0888) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation application authenticity verification can be bypassed under certain conditions. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-0888 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0888] 

DESCRIPTION: The application authenticity feature in IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation enables the Worklight server to validate that the Worklight client application has not been tampered with. Under certain conditions, a third party might be able to bypass the application authenticity validation and modify the client application. 

CVSS Base Score: 3.5 

CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91239 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91239] for the current score 

CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined 

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The application authenticity validation feature has been strengthened in IBM Worklight Foundation Version 6.2.0.0. You can upgrade the Worklight server and Worklight client applications to version 6.2.0.0.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
The application authenticity validation feature might be bypassed more easily if the Android versions of the Worklight client application are shipped with debug mode enabled. The debug mode is specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file with the android:debuggable attribute of the application element. Ensure that this attribute is not set to true. 
Utilizing only official mobile application stores for application distribution and installation reduces the chances of client application tampering.
