QUESTION
 How can the CMOD Trace Level be configured for FileNet Content Federation Services for CMOD ? 

CAUSE
In FileNet Enterprise Manager, the Fixed Content Device properties for an IBM Content Manager OnDemand ( CMOD ) repository includes a setting for CMOD Trace Level. What values can be configured for this setting and where is the output generated? 

ANSWER
 

The CMOD Trace Level setting should only be altered when advised to do so by IBM Support. 

The following values may be set : 


0 Tracing disabled
1 ERROR tracing. Only errors are reported. 
2 WARNING and ERROR messages are reported. 
3 INFO messages are captured along with the ERROR and WARNING. 
4 FULL TRACE. All messages are captured, including function trace. 

The trace files will be named arswww.trace and will be located in the J2EE application server directory structure as follows: 


 * IBM Websphere
   <WebSphere_home>\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\<profilename>\FileNet\<app_server>\content\{GUID}
   
 * Oracle Weblogic
   <WebLogic_home>bea\user_projects\domains\<domainname>\FileNet\<app_server>\content\{GUID}
   
 * JBoss

<Jboss_home>\bin\FileNet\<app_server>\content\{GUID} 

where {GUID} is the ID of the Fixed Content Device ( as displayed in the Fixed Content Device properties in FEM).
