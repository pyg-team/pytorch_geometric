APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A web server receiving HTTP traffic that we are proxying, where
   the client is using an HTTP method that we label as "Custom",
   might either fail to interpret the request correctly or reject
   the request with a 400 return code.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are services issuing HTTP or HTTPS requests with custom
   method names.
   
   Such HTTP requests might have a duplicate space between the
   method verb and path in the request line. This will cause such
   requests to be treated as malformed by most backends and
   responded to with a HTTP error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.5 and 7.1.0.0.
