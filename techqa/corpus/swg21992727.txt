PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Many CBR_TS_INDEXING_WARNING messages appear in CPE logs when using IBM Content Collector (ICC) for archiving email. 

SYMPTOM
Typical warning seen in CPE logs: 

CBR FNRCB0078W - WARN Object Id: {10F629C2-0E98-521E-27D1-5E30A796FFB5} ObjectStore Id: {94A9FFEE-676C-4432-85BB-C2FFA1C69829} is indexed with a warning into ... ncom.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCB0078E: CBR_TS_INDEXING_WARNING: IBM Content Search Services generated a warning while accessing the ...
index for an otherwise successful indexing operation. The following warning applies to a Content Engine object within the "829" batch: "IQQP0008W Unable to index document 3P3105488471-ASSYST-CN.zip/design/SVEN/3P3105488471 because the binary filter was not found or the MIME type [unknown] is unsupported.". at com.filenet.engine.cbrspi.cssimpl.CSECascadeIndexProcessing.listen(CSECascadeIndexProcessing.java:911)


CAUSE
These warning message are part of normal behaviour of CSS indexing and may be ignored. 

See technote here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21668934] for more details.


ENVIRONMENT
IBM Content Collector (ICC) 

IBM Filenet Content Process Engine (CPE)
IBM Filenet Content Search Services (CSS)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
While the system is working as designed, there is an option to at least separate out these messages into a different log file. 

See APAR PJ42775 here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PJ42775] for more details. 

As of CPE versions 5.2.0.2-P8CSS-IF002 or 5.2.1.2-P8CSS-FP002 or higher, there is an option to move these warning messages to a different log file. 

The file ecmts_logging.properties can control properties including the filename of the new traces. 

ie:
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = C:/Program Files/IBM/Content Search Services/CSS Server/log/trace%g.log

It is not currently possible to completely remove the warning messages (e.g: to configure indexing based on mime type.) Indexing is configured by document class.
