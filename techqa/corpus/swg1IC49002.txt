ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Hello,
   I am creating an APAR following the defect RATLC00058861.
   I have an Ericsson Requisitepro user who was using the
   workaround of disabling asian language till lately as he
   receives Word doc from Japan...
   Now the problem is that when he wants to export to a Word
   document an attribute matrix view with Asian Languages
   (Chineese, Japanese and Korean)
   the export document looks a mess compare to the WOrd document
   while the same Asian languages are disable.
   It is easily reproducable with a Sample project.
   -MS Word 2003 or Word 2002
   -Reqpro SR5.
   -From one machine go to the Microsoft Office tool/ Microsoft
   Office language Settings/Add Japanese, Chineese and Korean to
   the enabled languages.
   -From another machine do not set those languages.
   -Create an attribute matrix view and export to Word and both
   machine.
   The difference is big and messi.
   Export to CSV works fine with both settings.
   The customer needs to have those languages enables, is there
   another workaround or could a fix be delivered for such issue?
   Thank you for your help.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This issue happens when Microsoft office has enable Asian
   Languages in an English machine and then you try to export a
   attribute matrix into a Word document, as result the word
   document is not showed correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To fix this issue I modified the Word Macros to be smart
   enough to determinate when Asian Languages are enabled and
   make some changes to show correctly the exported file.
