Title: IBM How can I order my SPSS bar chart by the statistic? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I am using IBM SPSS/PASW Statistics for Windows and am trying to use syntax to order the bars in a bar chart based on the statistic. I know that I can make this change to the chart after I've created it, but I'm not sure how to make this modification prior to chart creation. Can this be done? 

ANSWER
Yes, it is possible to modify the Graphics Production Language (GPL) so that the chart is sorted based upon the statistic at creation time. You will change the SCALE variable to sort.statistic(summary.mean)(Varname))). Note that the varname will be your variable name as defined in the GPL. 

Below is an example using the "Employee Data.sav" dataset. 

* Sort bars by statistic before chart creation.
GGRAPH
/GRAPHDATASET NAME="graphdataset" VARIABLES=educ MEAN(id)[name=
"MEAN_id"] MISSING=LISTWISE REPORTMISSING=NO
/GRAPHSPEC SOURCE=INLINE.
BEGIN GPL
SOURCE: s=userSource(id("graphdataset"))
DATA: educ=col(source(s), name("educ"), unit.category())
DATA: MEAN_id=col(source(s), name("MEAN_id"))
GUIDE: axis(dim(1), label("Here is the new title on the X-Axis"))
GUIDE: axis(dim(2), label("Mean Employee Code"))
SCALE: cat(dim(1), sort.statistic(summary.mean(MEAN_id)))
SCALE: linear(dim(2), include(0))
ELEMENT: interval(position(educ*MEAN_id), shape.interior(shape.square))
END GPL
