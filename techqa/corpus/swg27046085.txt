2. Select View > Inventory > VMs and Templates
3. Select the StoredIQ for Legal virtual machine
4. Right click
5. Select Power
6. Select Restart Guest

7. Right click
8. Select Open Console
Result: A console window is displayed that shows the guest OS is rebooting. When the reboot completes, a login prompt is displayed in the console window.

Alternatively, you can use the following steps:

1. Log in to the VMWare vSphere client
2. Select View > Inventory > VMs and Templates
3. Select the StoredIQ for Legal virtual machine
4. Select Inventory > Virtual Machine > Power > Restart Guest

A console window is displayed that contains a login prompt.

Step 11. Click Select Custodians. If you do not see Select Custodians, click Edit Notice Contents to collapse the section. 
Each entry in the list of custodians includes the given name and surname of the custodian, user ID, email address, and department name. You can select custodian groups and search within them to add entries to the selection list.

Addition: 
In the Select Custodians pane, under the Groups heading, there is a list of all of the custodian groups that you can select to populate the custodians list for the notice. Each entry in the list is a web link. The web link label contains the group name and the count of the number of custodians in that group. The entries under Groups include both user-defined and predefined groups.

When you click a group name under Groups, the list of custodians in that group is displayed. For instance, if a custodian group with the name "My Group" was created in the Custodians page, an entry for "My Group" appears under Groups. When you click "My Group", the list of custodians in "My Group" is displayed and you can select custodians from the list for the notice. 

In addition to the user-defined groups that are defined in the Custodians page, the following predefined custodian groups are listed under Groups: 

 * All People 
 * Matter Custodians


When you click the All People link, a list of all custodians in the IBMÂ® StoredIQ for Legal system is displayed. The All People link is selected by default when you open the Select Custodians page. When you click the Matter Custodians link, the list of custodians that are selected in other hold notices for the same matter is displayed. The Matter Custodians list and count are updated automatically when custodians are added to or removed from hold notices for the matter. 

You can use the Matter Custodians link to quickly see which custodians are selected in other notices for the matter and select them as custodians for the notice you are editing. 

Each entry in the list of custodians includes the given name and surname of the custodian, user ID, email address, and department name. You can select custodian groups and search within them to add entries to the selection list.
