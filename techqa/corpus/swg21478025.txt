Title: IBM Importing tab-delimited .txt file breaking lines in the middle - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have a tab-delimited .txt file saved from Excel 2007 and it looks fine in NotePad -- one line per record -- but when I import it into Statistics via the Text Import Wizard some records are broken into 2 and 3 lines. Viewing the same .txt file in a non-Microsoft text editor such as Programmers File Editor displays the same "breaks" in the lines as those created in Statistics.

The "breaks" seem to be where I inserted a line break in a particular cell in Excel using <alt>-Enter. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you open that .txt file in a Hexadecimal File Editor, you can see that the <alt>-Enter action is creating a 0A character -- a Line Feed. Microsoft applications only fully break lines when they encounter a Carriage Return/Line Feed -- which would be 0D 0A. And that's why NotePad or WordPad displays the file as you might expect it to look -- as it does in Excel.

But most, if not all, non-Microsoft applications will break a line on a plain Line Feed because that's all non-Windows platforms such as Unix use to designate a line break -- they do not use Carriage Return Line Feed. 

This behavior isn't new to Statistics v17 -- v15, for example, behaved the same way
