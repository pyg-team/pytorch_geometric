PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 From the SCLM Perspective in IBM Rational Developer for System z, why are copybooks in COBOL source code flagged with exclamation marks indicating that they can not be found? 

SYMPTOM
If not flagged, attempting to browse COBOL copybooks will also result in the following error:

"Open Copy Member Problems. The Copy file cannot be found in the SYSLIB library. Verify that both the file and the library are allocated properly."

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ability to open copybooks using the SCLM Development Toolkit is currently under development for a subsequent release of Rational Developer for System z.
