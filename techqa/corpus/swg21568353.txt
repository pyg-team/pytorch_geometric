QUESTION
 How do I generate an SVCDUMP for an Optim zOS problem? 

CAUSE
Below are instructions for getting an SVCDUMP when requested by Optim Support. Please note that, since Optim zOS 7.1 is LE-based, certain additional steps are required. 

ANSWER
If you are running Optim zOS 7.1.0 or above, please start at step 1. If customer is running Optim zOS 6.1.1 or below, please start at step 3:


1. When reproducing the problem in batch, add the following to the JCL within the Optim step: 


//CEEOPTS DD *
TRAP(OFF)
/*

2. When reproducing the problem online, please do the following:

a. Create an FB-80 file that contains the following statement: 

TRAP(OFF) 

b. Allocate the file created in step (a) to your TSO session: 

TSO ALLOC FI(CEEOPTS) DSN(‘dsn.trap.file’) (where the DSN name is the name of the file created in STEP a). 

3. Issue a SLIP SET command on the system console:

SLIP SET,A=SVCD,JOBNAME=XXXXXXX, 
C=yyy,SDATA=(PSA,SQA,LSQA,CSA,LPA,RGN,TRT,SUM,NUC,SWA),ML=1,ID=PST1,EN,END 
where XXXXXXXX is the jobname (for batch job), or TSOID (for online session) and yyy= the abend code (such as 0C1, 0C4, U4038, etc.) that the customer is receiving.

4. The dump should be tersed, ftp'ed in binary format, and uploaded to ECUREP.

Note: Level 3 or development may request that dataspaces be included. If so, then the format of the SLIP command is as follows:

SLIP SET,A=SVCD,JOBNAME=XXXXXXX,DSPNAME=('XXXXXXXX'.PSTTDB*), 
C=yyy,SDATA=(PSA,SQA,LSQA,CSA,LPA,RGN,TRT,SUM,NUC,SWA),ML=1,ID=PST1,EN,END 
(actual names of dataspaces are PSTTDB00, PSTTDB01, PSTTDB02, etc.).
