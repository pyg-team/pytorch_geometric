TPAEWORK; task; status TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When I change the status of my work order and the task work orders are set to inherit the status, the application does not track the status history for the task work order. 

SYMPTOM
Go to the Activities and Tasks application in the Changes module 
Recall the originating work order, Select Action | View | 
Work Order History. Note the status changes: List is empty.


CAUSE
Available setting is not configured

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Work Order Tracking application, insert a new work order and fill in the required 
Fields. 
2. Go to the Plans tab, insert a new task work order and save.
3. Change the status of the parent work order to APPR. 
4. Select Action | View | View Work Order History. Note the 
status changes : WAPPR, APPR. 
5. Go to the Activities and Tasks application in the Changes module. 
Recall the originating work order from above, Select Action | View | 
Work Order History. Note the status changes: NONE.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There is a setting that tells the application 
whether or not to record status history for work order tasks. This is based on the Work Type for a work order. 
Confirm the Work Type for the work orders then check that there is an entry for the work type in 
question by going to Administrator/Organizations/Work Order 
options/Work type and that the check box Record Status History for Work Order Tasks? is checked.
