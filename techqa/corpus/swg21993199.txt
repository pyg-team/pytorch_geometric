Title: IBM Case Manager Knowledge Center documentation clarifications and corrections - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document serves to contain clarifications and corrections for specific topics from the Knowledge Center documentation for IBM Case Manager components. 

CAUSE
Due to unspecified reasons we are unable to correct/amend/refresh the current information from Knowledge Center. The intention is to have the latest clarifications and corrections contained in this technote.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Using a Date/Time property as a filter condition is not generating the correct result set. 

The documentation example from the documentation page shows that a Date value is to be added to the Filter payload:
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.1.0/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmwd076.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.1.0/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmwd076.htm] 

However, this generates an uncaught TypeError as seen via Firebug. 

==> Uncaught TypeError: currentValues[index].substring is not a function 

 

 In order to resolve this issue the Date property must to be converted to JSON as shown below.

"name":"Filter4",
"value": new Date().toJSON() 

 

 

2. Known Issue: List of add-ons that are required to create IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine are incomplete in knowledge center. 

The list of required add-ons in step 2 of Creating IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmin048.htm] is incomplete. 

To create IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine, you must configure the following add-ons:


 * Content Engine Base Extensions, which are required for all Content Engine configurations. 
 * Base Application Extensions, which are a prerequisite for Search Extensions and the Workplace Base Extensions. 
 * Search Extensions, which are required to browse and search for content in IBM Content Navigator. 
 * Workplace Base Extensions, which are required to browse and search for content in IBM Content Navigator 
 * Workplace Template Extensions, which are required to open folders in IBM Content Navigator.



3. Passing a payload to the 'Search with values' event for the Content List widget is not returning the correct results. 

The incoming events page [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.help.doc/acmwc110.htm] for the Content List widget has the following information regarding the payload:

An array of JSON objects in which each object contains a property name and value pair that is used as criteria for the configured stored search.:
name
A string that contains the symbolic name of the property.
value
A string that contains the value of the property.

However, the JSDocs for icm.pgwidget.contentlist.ContentList [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.development.doc/jsdoc/symbols/icm.pgwidget.contentlist.ContentList.html#handleICM_ReceiveSearchValuesEvent] class which contains a sample JSON for the payload to be passed for the 'Search with values' event shows the following:

Parameters:
{Array} payload
A list of properties each with name and value pair to be used as criteria for the configured stored search.
A sample payload is: [{"AT_companyName": "IBM"}]

With the above payload passed in, the values will be ignored, and the search result will return more items than expected.

The correct sample payload should be:
[{name:"AT_companyName",value:"IBM"}] 


4. After logging into Case Client, a delay is encountered before the user is presented with the solution work page. This delay may exceed 20 seconds in duration.

Make sure that the recommended performance indexes documented in the following Knowledge Center location have been created on the Target Object Store database.

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.design.doc/acmtn204.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.design.doc/acmtn204.htm]

The documentation is missing one additional index: 

 * I_CLID_PRE_OID on Container (OBJECT_CLASS_ID, UF978_CMACMSOLUTIONPREFIX, object_id)


5. The payloads for Case List widget incoming events "Select a row" and " Sort by property" are incorrect. 

The following payloads in Case List widget incoming events [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.3.2/com.ibm.casemgmt.help.doc/acmwc102.htm] are incorrect. 

The "Select a row" event payload can contain one of the following values: 


Parameter Description caseID A string that contains the identifier of the case that is to be selected. rowNumber A string that contains the number of the row that is to be selected.  * 

The "Sort by property" event payload is: 

Parameter Description symbolicName A string that contains the symbolic name of the column that is to be
used to sort the case list 

6. Clarifications needed for redeployoment restrictions. 

The following table clarifies the impact of three types of changes that are listed in Redeployment restrictions for modifying a solution [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.3.2/com.ibm.casemgmt.design.doc/acmdc024.htm]: 


Type of changes Result Comments Delete an item, such as a property, a business object, a document class, a case type, a task, or a role No issues. The item is removed only from the solution definition. The item is not removed from the target object store or the Content Platform Engine.

Remove any unused roles or in-baskets by using the Process Configuration Console.

When you redeploy the solution, IBMÂ® Case Manager does not remove properties or business objects from the case type definition class in the target object store. As a result, these items continue to appear in existing cases and are available when case workers create new cases of the case type. All active work items that reference case properties also continue to display the property values.

If you remove a property or business object from the case type definition class, it is removed from all existing cases and is not available for new cases. This action is destructive, data is loss on existing cases and can result in errors with running work items for properties. This action might require detailed review from all stakeholders of the cases. Task start changed from Manual or Automatic to Discretionary Not supported for all use cases If there are any existing regular task items with IBM Case Foundation process in waiting state, or in manual and ready state, the task process might not start, so the change is not recommended. Create new repeatable (File or Property update) task New cases are affected. Existing cases do not have the new task.  *
