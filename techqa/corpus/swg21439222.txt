ANSWER
Access to Installation and Configuration Assistance Tool (know as ICAT or CICAT) 

 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=1]

Select Option Configure Products 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=2] 



The choose option Select Product to configure 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=3]

Now select IBM Tivoli Omegamon XE for Messaging on z/OS v7.0.1 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=4] 



Pick the RTE where the agent reside 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=5]

Select the Option for Omegamon XE for Websphere MQ Configuration 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=6]




Now, select the Specify Agent Address Space Parameters option 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=7]

You will get the following screen, check the values of Connect to TEMS in this RTE and Name of Primary TEMS. Set the First one to N. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=8]
Press F10 for TEMS LIST 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=9]

Now Press F5 for Advance settings 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=10]




You need to configure the following 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=11] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=11]

Where 
Primary TEMS name: The Name of the TEMS on Distributed side 
IP protocol: You must specify the name of the TEMS (check the name resolution using TSO PING). If you could not reach the Machine via name resolution, you can specify the IP of the machine 

Hostname 
Specify the network address of the z/OS system on which the primary 
TEMS to which the Agent connects is running. 
A network address may be specified as one of the following values: 
1. Fully-qualified hostname 
Example: "sys.ibm.com" 
2. First qualifier of the fully-qualified hostname 
Example: "sys" from "sys.ibm.com" 
3. IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation 
Example: "9.67.1.100" 
If the primary TEMS is running on a z/OS platform, then to get this value, issue the TSO HOMETEST command from the system where the primary TEMS is running. If you will specify the hostname value for network address, use the first qualifier of the fully qualified hostname if the z/OS domain name resolver configuration specifies a search path that would include the target domain suffix. Otherwise, specify the fully-qualified hostname when using a Domain Name Server (DNS). If you will specify the IP address value for network address, use the assigned IPv4 address written in dotted decimal notation. This scheme is numeric and consists of four groups separated by a period (.). 

Port number: Considerations and Usage 
The Port number field represents the primary TEMS port number(s) that the non-secure or the secure IP.PIPE and IP.UDP protocols will use for transport. Each port number value is used in the KDE_TRANSPORT environment variable in the primary TEMS's environment file or member, as well as in the Agent's OMXE.HERCZ111.RKANPARU(KMCENV) member. 
The port number(s) specified on this panel must match the port number(s) of the primary TEMS to which this Agent connects to. 
If the Agent requires IP.PIPE and/or IP.UDP support, enter the following primary TEMS values accordingly. 
Note : 
The IPV6-related (IP6.*) protocols and the secured IP.PIPE (*.SPIPE) protocols may only be enabled by Agents built under the TMS:Engine framework. For applications that do not meet this condition, 
these protocol fields below display as read-only automatically. 
IP.PIPE port number - Non-secure NCS RPC 
Specify the IP.PIPE port number of the primary TEMS. This port number is used by the non-secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.PIPE protocol. The default is 1918. 
Note: Port numbers for non-secure IP.PIPE protocols must match. 
IP6.PIPE port number - IP.PIPE for IPV6 
Specify the IP.PIPE port number of the primary TEMS if IPV6 is installed and operational. This port number is used by the non-secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.PIPE protocol. The 
default is 1918. 
Note: Port numbers for non-secure IP.PIPE protocols must match. 
IP.SPIPE port number - Secure IP.PIPE 
Specify the IP.PIPE port number of the primary TEMS if the minimum z/OS version on this mainframe system is V1.7. This port number is used by the secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.PIPE protocol. The default is 3660. 
Note: Port numbers for secure IP.PIPE protocols must match. 
IP6.SPIPE port number - Secure IP.PIPE for IPV6 
Specify the IP.PIPE port number of the primary TEMS if the minimum z/OS version on this mainframe system is V1.7 and IPV6 is installed and operational. This port number is used by the secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.PIPE protocol. The default is 3660. 
Note: Port numbers for secure IP.PIPE protocols must match. 
IP.UDP port number - Non-secure NCS RPC 
Specify the IP.UDP port number of the primary TEMS. This port number is used by the non-secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.UDP protocol. The default is 1918. 
Note: Port numbers for non-secure IP.UDP protocols must match. 
IP6.UDP port number - IP.UDP for IPV6 
Specify the IP.UDP port number of the primary TEMS if IPV6 is installed and operational. This port number is used by the non-secure Network Computing System (NCS) IP.UDP protocol. The default is 1918. 
Note: Port numbers for non-secure IP.UDP protocols must match. 

Navigate for the next pages using ENTER and checking the ports values. 
When you finish you will get the Agent Configuration screen 
[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=12] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439222&aid=12]

Now you can enter again to Option 5 to check the values 
Look at the Name of Primary TEMS, here you will have the name of the TEMS on distributed side.
