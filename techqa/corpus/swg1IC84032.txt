APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In a scenario where a WebSphere MQ Explorer is closed, any MQ
   FTE
   transfers that take place are not shown in the transfer log when
   the WebSphere MQ Explorer is re-opened. Once it is opened, any
   new transfers are shown in the transfer log. In the preferences,
   for Websphere MQ File Transfer Edition, the transfer log
   subscriber type is DURABLE. This should mean that the
   subscriptions should be retained for the next time the Explorer
   is opened and the transfers should then be visible in the
   plug-in.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None <br/>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition Version MQ
   Explorer plugin
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   If the MQ Explorer was closed when files are being
   transferred, some transfers would not appear in the transfer
   log. This was due to a race condition during the startup
   procedure of the MQ Explorer FTE plugin. Additionally, if
   transfer audit messages arrived out of order for transfers which
   occurred whilst the MQ Explorer was not running, they would
   remain in 'In Progress' state, despite having completed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been altered to resolve the race condition and
   ensure that out of order messages from the SYSTEM.FTE topic
   are correctly catered for.
