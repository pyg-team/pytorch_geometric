Title: IBM Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere Portal Java API Documentation Frame Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2013-1571) - United States

Text:
vulnerability; frame injection; API; Javadoc FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 Java API Documentation contains a frame injection vulnerability. 

CONTENT
VULNERABILITY DETAILS: 

CVEID: CVE-2013-1571

DESCRIPTION: HTML documentation generated by the Javadoc tool contains a security vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious link to the documentation which injects arbitrary content into the main
frame. The injected content appears to originate from the site hosting the documentation, but in fact it is hosted elsewhere, and may contain malicious links or content. This type of attack is known as "clickjacking".

The attack does not require authentication and may be exploited remotely if the html page is network available, but some degree of specialized knowledge and techniques are required. An exploit would not impact the confidentiality of information or the availability of the system, but data integrity could be compromised.
