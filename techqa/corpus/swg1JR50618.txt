PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM)          *
   *                  Advanced                                    *
   *                  IBM BBPM Advanced - Process Server          *
   *                  IBM BPM Standard                            *
   *                  IBM BPM Express                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Installing the launchpad interim fix    *
   *                      fails because the IBM WebSphere         *
   *                      Application Server version does not     *
   *                      match the IBM Business Process          *
   *                      Manager (BPM) requirement.              *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The launchpad can't find the correct WebSphere Application
   Server version during the interim fix installation, which
   causes the WebSphere Application Server version not to match
   the IBM BPM requirement and the installation fails.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A launchpad interim fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.0.0 that
   sets the matching WebSphere Application Server version. The fix
   will be installed automatically when you next open the launchpad
   opens if you have internet access. The fix has also been
   uploaded to the Launchpad lsite
