HOW CAN CAN YOU TELL HOW MUCH EPS/FPM IS LEFT BEFORE REACHING OUR LICENSE LIMIT?

To determine how close you are to your limit, monitor the "Event Rate (Events Per Second Raw)" graph on the System Monitoring Dashboard in QRadar. This will show you the current data rate, and then compare that to the per-appliance license configuration in your deployment.

HOW CAN CAN YOU TELL HOW MUCH EPS/FPM IS LEFT BEFORE REACHING OUR LICENSE LIMIT?

When you hit your Event or Flow license limits, data is buffered in memory, and then out to disk, depending on the size and duration of the bursts over your license. After the event rate drops below your license limit, QRadar will continue to run at the maximum licensed rate, which allows QRadar to reduce the events and flows in the burst (buffer) queues. 

For example, if your license was 5000 EPS, and your normal rate was 4000 EPS, a burst to 10,000 EPS for 5 seconds would leave 5 x (10000 - 5000 eps), or 25000 events in the buffer. With a normal rate of 4000 EPS, giving you 1000 EPS "overhead" capacity, it would take around 25 seconds to catch up again, assuming no subsequent bursts. 

Note: events are always processed in the order they are received in, that does not change. This is described in more detail here: QRadar Event & Flow Burst Handling. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21687020]
