QUESTION
 Each field indexed by a z/OS Insight Pack has attributes in the index configuration that specify, among other things, whether that field should be filterable and sortable. Sometimes you need a field to be filterable or sortable that is not. This article explains how to create a copy, or clone, of a source type from a z/OS Insight Pack that is functionally equivalent to the original source type except for different sortable and filterable attribute values in the index configuration. 

ANSWER
As an example, consider the zOS-SYSLOG-Console source type from the z/OS SYSLOG Insight Pack. Let’s assume that we’d like to make the UserExitFlags field filterable for this source type.
In the Log Analysis Administrative Settings UI: 

1. Select the Data Types tab, expand Source Types, select zOS-SYSLOG-Console and click on the Clone icon. The Clone Source Type page is displayed as follows: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=1] 

2. Change the name of the source type to something unique but meaningful and click Edit Index Configuration. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=2] 

3. A table view of all the fields in the index configuration is displayed as follows: 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=3] 

4. Check the Sortable or Filterable boxes as needed to enable sorting and filtering for each field that you want to be able to sort or filter. There is a performance impact on indexing for each field that is filterable or sortable, so only add filtering and sorting for fields that you really need to be able to filter and sort on. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=4] 

5. Click OK on this page, on the Clone Source Type page and again on the Confirmation dialog. The Data Types tab should now have the new source type listed. 

6. If you have the z/OS Log Forwarder configured to automatically create data sources some changes need to be made in the data configuration file also. 

a. For all data gatherers except for the z/OS SYSLOG gatherer and the WAS HPEL gatherer, simply update the dataSourceType value for the appropriate data gatherer definition to replace the original source type with the new cloned source type. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=5] 

b. The z/OS SYSLOG gatherer and the WAS HPEL gatherer have a hard-coded dataSourceType that cannot be updated. For these data gatherers, remove the dataSourceName property from the data gatherer definition. When there is no dataSourceName the z/OS Log Forwarder does not create the data source automatically (and you don’t want it to since it would use the wrong data source type). So you will need to use the Log Analysis Administrative Settings UI to create the data source manually. Make sure that the new data source has the correct host name and file path values. If these values are incorrect the z/OS Log Forwarder will not be able to find the data source and will terminate with an error. 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=6] 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21987101&aid=7] 

The source type of a data source definition cannot be changed, so if you have already defined a data source with the original source type you will need to delete that data source before a new one can be created with the cloned source type. Two data source definitions cannot exist with the same host name and file path values.
