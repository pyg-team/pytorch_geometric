PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 TSO Command Server Installation Verification test fails with RC 1004 EIBMIUCVERR IUCV error in IBM WebSphere Developer for zSeries (WDz) and IBM Rational Developer for System z (RDz) 

CAUSE
SECACPT=NONE has been specified in the APPL definition for the LU against which this APPC transaction FEKFRSRV was going to run. 

Possible options are NONE, CONV, or ALREADYV. 

NONE means no password is needed. 
CONV indicates password is required. 
ALREADYV indicates a password is required or if the password has already been verified and the already-verified bit is acceptable. 
Both CONV and ALREADYV will require a conversation level password.

When running the fekfscmd from OMVS/USS to verify the configuration for the TSO command server, the following result is seen:
