APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center console mode
   install process will miss the 'next' option when the free disk
   size prerequisite is not met instead of stopping the
   installation with an error message explaining the problem.
   
   The last install step will look like the following :
   
   =====> IBM Installation Manager> Install> Shared Directory>
   Location> Features
   
   IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Operations Center
       1. [X] Operations Center
   
   
       B. Back,      C. Cancel
   -----> [C]
   
   The GUI install process will show the error message that the
   space requirements are not met.
   
   Customer diagnostics :
   
   In order to find where the disk space is lacking, enable DEBUG
   output for Installation Manager and repeat the Operations
   Center installation following these instructions:
   go to the agent data's log directory
   '/var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs'
   Make a copy of the sample.properties and rename that file to
   log.properties; this will enable debug mode and provide more
   information into the log files.
   
   **Note: please consider that running in Debug mode will slow
   down the IM response when going through the console mode
   panels.**
   Repeat the Operations Center installation and collect the
   installation logs by using the following command:
   /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imutilsc
   exportInstallData /tmp/InstallLogs.zip
   
   The logs will mention the filesystem where the disk space is
   not enough to proceed with installation.
   
   This behaviour is addressed by the Installation Manager APAR
   PI39285 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI39285] for which the fix is included in version 1.8.3
   
   Initial Impact: Low
   
   Tivoli Storage Manager versions affected : 7.x on Unix and
   Windows
