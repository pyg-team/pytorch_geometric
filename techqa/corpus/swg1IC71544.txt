ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  IBM WebSphere DataPower Appliance
   
   Firmware 3.8.1.4
   
   When a SLM statement is added at the port-operation level of a
   WSDL attached to a Web Service Proxy (WS-Proxy), the SLM
   statement will be moved all the way up to the proxy level.
   
   Steps to recreate:
   1. Add a WSDL to a WS-Proxy.
   2. Click on the 'SLM Policy' tab.
   3. From the 'Auto Generated SLM Statements' section, drill down
   to the WSDL port-operation level.
   4. Click on Request. This will give you a popup window to enter
   the interval (seconds) and Limit (# of requests) and action
   (throttle).
   5. Enter some values for the Interval and Limit fields then
   click Apply.
   6. Click Apply at the service level to apply the changes to the
   WS-Proxy.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WSP generates internal IDs that are too long if the WSDL name is
   long.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WSP ID naming scheme fixed to handle long WSDL names. Fixed in
   3.8.1.
