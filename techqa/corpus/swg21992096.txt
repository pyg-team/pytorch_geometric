PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error Runing TI Process When Importing Csv File.
Preview displays the correct data. 

SYMPTOM
Error: Prolog procedure line (0): Unable to open data source "\\data\s\prod\tm1\Data\Loadfiles\test.csv"


CAUSE
The path specified for Data Source Name on Server is incorred

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
NOTE: 

 
The values for "Data Source Name" and "Data source Name on Server" should be different.

Data Source Name - this is the path used by the architect client - the full path is required to where the csv exists. (click the browse and select the csv file.

Data Source Name on Server - this is the path used by the TM1 server - it should be "relative"to the TM1 data directory. (the folder where the tm1 objects are in)

Also it's important to understand that TM1 has only access to files which exist under the TM1 data directory.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Confirm the directory where all the tm1 objects? 

This is our starting point.

STEPS:
The following steps are assuming the objects are in the data directory under tm1.

1. If one you want to use file xxxx.csv on tm1 server ...I would first create a folder named "loadfiles" under S:\prod\tm1\data\
Thus, any files you need to load are all in one folder under the data directory.

2. The paths would be as follows:
Data Source Name: \\data\s\prod\tm1\data\loadfiles\xxx.csv (if the Preview displays data then this path is correct.

Data Source Name on Server: .\loadfiles\test.csv 
(here we remove all directories up to where the objects exist...ie: data) or take the .\ out and just be: loadfiles\xxx.csv
Note there is a dot and a backslash for the second path. (the dot \slash relates to the data directory where all the objects are stored)

3. Make sure to SAVE each time you make a change to the path or the error will continue as it is picking up the last saved change

NOTE:
If the preview works and displays data, this means thee first box in TI process is fine and no changes required, change the second box path only.
