 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 OpenSSL and Xerces-C are used by IBM Netezza Platform Software. IBM Netezza Platform Software has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2107 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt traffic.
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112854] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-2105 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2105]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. By sending an overly long argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112855] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) 

CVEID: CVE-2016-0729 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0729]
DESCRIPTION: Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by improper bounds checking during processing and error reporting. By sending specially crafted input documents, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the library to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code on the system.
CVSS Base Score: 7.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111028 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111028] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
