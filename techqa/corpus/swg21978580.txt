PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Backup of a virtual machine is failing after upgrading the vCenter server to version 5.5.0 U3b. This is caused by a change in the vCenter server that disables SSLv3. 

SYMPTOM
Backup VM is failing with following error message: 


03/08/2016 01:17:14 ANS1228E Sending of object 'VIRTUAL_MACHINE' failed.
03/08/2016 01:17:14 ANS5283E The operation was unsuccessful.



CAUSE
This issue is caused by a change in the VMware vCenter server after the upgrade to version 5.5.0 U3b. After upgrading the VMware vCenter server, SSLv3 is disabled and TLSv1 must be used for communication with the VMware vCenter server.
TLSv1 requires VMware VDDK 5.5.4, which is currently not integrated with Tivoli Storage Manager - Data Protection for VMware 7.1.0 or 7.1.1


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Review a trace of the failing Backup VM operation. The root cause can be found here:
