Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I see various errors on the IBM Content Analytics with Enterprise Search (ICAwES) admin console after successfully logging in. 

SYMPTOM
Errors:
FFQEP0002E An error occurred when processing a remote API. The reason is : FFQC4823E Session Controller (node1) [controller] is not running. FFQO0262E Session Controller (node1) [controller] is not created yet.

Not enough memory is configured for this component. See the collection log file for details.


CAUSE
Unable to create threads

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check to see if java cores and heap dumps are created in the ES_NODE_ROOT/logs directory.


You should find the following in the java core :
1TISIGINFO Dump Event "systhrow" (00040000) Detail "java/lang/OutOfMemoryError" "Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11" received


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * As the root user, edit the Linux file /etc/security/limits.conf and increase the soft nproc value to 32768 for the userid that you are using. 
 * Verify the setting by logging in as the admin_user_ID and running "ulimit -aS". 
 * Restart ICAwES by running "esadmin system stopall" and "esadmin system startall". 
 * For AIX and Solaris operating systems, see the Related Information URL link.
