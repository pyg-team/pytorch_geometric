APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Even if administration security is enabled, you should not have
   to explicitly grant permissions for the following administration
   interfaces, authentication is provided only by the system
   login; no additional authentication is carried out by the
   integration node:
   
   . IBM Integration Toolkit
   . IBM Integration API
   . IBM Integration Bus commands
   
   However, on z/OS, this is not working as expected. For example,
   attempting to use the Integration API calls in a Java compute
   node when file based administration security is enabled,
   results in authentication errors, for example:
   
   BIP2852E: The role 'WMQI20' is not authorized to perform the
   requested  operation 'view' against the object 'MQ20BRK' of
   type 'Broker'. The  role 'WMQI20' needs to have 'Read'
   permission on the object 'MQ20BRK' of type 'Broker'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  As a work around, you can create a role named for your brokers
   started task id and grant it the necessary permissions,
   depending on what actions you want to perform on the
   administered objects.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus v10 on z/OS who use file mode
   security.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   If using file mode security, you should not have to create a
   role for the integration nodes user and grant permissions when
   using the following administration interfaces:
   
   IBM Integration Toolkit (when making a local connection,
   specifying only the integration node name)
   IBM Integration API
   IBM Integration Bus commands (when making a local connection,
   specifying only the integration node name)
   
   In these cases, authentication is provided only by the system
   login; no additional authentication is
   carried out by the integration node.
   
   However, on IIB z/OS, if a role had not been created and the
   appropriate permissions granted for the integration nodes user
   id, then the following types of errors may be reported:
   
   BIP2852E: The role 'WMQIxx' is not authorized to perform the
   requested
   operation 'view' against the object 'MQxxBRK' of type 'Broker'.
   The
   role 'WMQIxx' needs to have 'Read' permission on the object
   'MQxxBRK'
   of type 'Broker'.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has been modified to remove the need for a role to
   be defined for the integration nodes user id when using file
   mode security.
