DOWNLOADING JAZZ FOR SERVICE MANAGEMENT ELECTRONIC IMAGES
You can download images by using the IBM Download Director applet or HTTP. If possible choose Download Director; because it automatically verifies the completeness of each image that it processes.

Tip: If you use Download Director to download the software; then you can also use it to extract the contents of all the compressed files that you downloaded in the session.


 1.  Before you start the installation; check the Jazz for Service Management Technotes [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?q=jazzsm1130relnotes] for late breaking issues or updated installation instructions.
 2.  Determine the set of platform-specific images to download for the installation scenario or integration services to install; as summarized in the following table. Scenario Images Full installation; all integration services and middleware  * Jazz™ for Service Management 1.1.3.0
      * IBM® Tivoli® Common Reporting 3.1.3.0
      * IBM® WebSphere® Application Server 8.5.5.9
      * IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition 10.5
     
     Custom installation; Dashboard Application Services Hub  * Jazz™ for Service Management 1.1.3.0
      * IBM® WebSphere® Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed
      * IBM® WebSphere® Application Server V8.5 Supplements; for high availability environment only
      * IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; for high availability environment only
     
     Custom installation; Reporting Services  * Jazz™ for Service Management 1.1.3.0
      * IBM® Tivoli® Common Reporting 3.1.3.0
      * IBM® WebSphere® Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed
      * IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; optional if already installed
     
     
 3.  Create one or more of the following temporary directories in the same file system:  * JazzSM_Image_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of the Jazz for Service Management platform-specific image.
      * Image_Imgs_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of platform-specific images for middleware. Tip: You only create this directory if you intend to install IBM DB2®; IBM WebSphere® Application Server.
        
        
     
     
 4.   Navigate to the IBM Passport Advantage web site [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm]. 
     Note: You require an IBM Customer ID to sign in and continue.
 5.  Select the Find by part number search option under Download finder options.
 6.  Search for each downloadable image by part number; as outlined in the relevant Operating_System tab in this download document.
 7.  Select and download only the images for your platform that you need.
 8.  Extract the downloaded images into directories that you created in step 3. 
     
     Important: If you have downloaded the middleware and you want to perform a full installation; ensure that your Install_Imgs_Home directory is set up as follows:
     |-ESE (Windows) [extracted DB2 installation image on Windows] 
     |-ese (UNIX) [extracted DB2 installation image on AIX; Linux; or Linux for System z] 
     |-WASRepository [extracted WebSphere Application Server installation image]
     |-TCRCognos [extracted Tivoli Common Reporting Cognos® installation image] This directory structure is not required for a custom installation; for example; installing a subset of integration services by using the launchpad custom workflow or IBM Installation Manager GUI.
     
     
 9.  To perform a full installation; download the Quick Start image with a part number of CNC1MML. It contains quick start guides for these installation scenarios.  * CNC1MML_JazzSM_lang_code.pdf - Quick start guide for the full installation scenario; to install all Jazz for Service Management integration services; IBM DB2®; and IBM WebSphere® Application Server on a single server for evaluation and development purposes. 
     
     
 10. If you want to perform a custom installation; for example; install only a subset of Jazz for Service Management integration services or use existing supported installations of WebSphere Application Server or DB2; see Custom installation scenario [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/install/psc_c_install_advanced_opt.html] in the Jazz for Service Management documentation.
