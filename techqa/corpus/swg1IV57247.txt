ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Despite the documentation here:

   em.doc_9.1/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcadminboundconnect.htm [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v26r1/topic/com.ibm.tem.doc_9.1/Remote_Control/RC_Admin_Guide/rcadminboundconnect.htm]

   l
   
   the property  PassPhrase  is incorrect and will not be parsed by
   the application, hence why the log files show
    Gateway.Gateway1.Passphrase = .
   The property Passphrase
   is case sensitive and incorrectly defined in the
   documentation and sample files.
   Documentation wrongly report PassPhrase
   The parameters as are case sensitive and Passphrase is the
   correct name
   for the parameter. Please change doc accordingly
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In certain sections of the documentation the property PassPhrase
   is incorrect. The correct name of the property is Passphrase.
   The property name is case sensitive therefore if PassPhrase is
   used in the gateway configuration file, it is not parsed by the
   application. The result is that any defined pass phrase
   properties are shown with a blank value in the gateway log. For
   example, Gateway.Gateway1.Passphrase =
   
   The default TLS certificate pass phrase property is also
   incorrect in the broker configuration section of the
   documentation. It is written incorrectly as
   DefaultTLSPassPhrase. The correct value for the property is
   DefaultTLSCertificatePassphrase.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Changes have been made to the IBM Endpoint Manager for Remote
   Control version 9.1.0 and version 9.0.x documentation.
   
   The following changes were made to the IBM Endpoint Manager for
   Remote Control Administrators Guide.
   
   Accessing targets on different networks > Configuring the
   gateway support > Configuring inbound connections.
   
   Changed: PassPhrase to Passphrase.
   
   
   Accessing targets on different networks > Configuring the
   gateway support > Configuring gateway connections.
   
   Changed: PassPhrase to Passphrase
   
   
   Broker configuration > Default configuration parameters
   
   Changed: In table 12. changed DefaultTLSPassPhrase to
   DefaultTLSCertificatePassphrase
