Text:
jnlp jws javawebstart webstart TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Running the TEP Java Web Start Client causes a "Download Error" to appear. 

SYMPTOM
"Unable to launch TEP - <IP Address>" appears, where <IP Address> is the host or IP Address of the TEP Server that you are trying to connect to.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The error message that is displayed only shows a "Download Error". Clicking the "Details" button on that error window shows additional tabs: 

"General" tab: shows "An error occurred while launching/running the application.

Title: TEP - <IP Address>
Vendor: IBM Corporation
Category: Download Error

Bad MIME type returned from server when accessing resource: http://<IP_Address>:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/tep.jnlp - null

"Launch File": displays the full tep.jnlp file.

"Exception" tab: shows an error stack trace similar to the following:

One possibility is that the TEP Server is simply not started, and needs to be started ("itmcmd agent start cq" on a UNIX/Linux TEPS, or start the TEPS from the "Manage Tivoli Monitoring Services" GUI). 

Another way to confirm this is to simply connect to the indicated URL (http://<IP_Address>:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/tep.jnlp) via a Web browser; if the following appears, then the TEPS is most likely not started:
