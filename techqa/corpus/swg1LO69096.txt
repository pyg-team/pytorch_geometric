ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is the same as APAR LO66136 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO66136] except for a configurational
   component involving Linux Thin Clients. The fix for APAR LO66136 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO66136]
   doesn't work when Linux Thin Clients are used in the
   configuration
   
   ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   Notes/Domino 8.5.x on various platforms.
   
   Tested using 8.5.3 and Citrix XenApp 6.0 Windows 2008 R2 64-bit
   (Notes 8.5.3 is installed on Windows 2008 R2 OS)
   
   Users access Notes 8.5.3 on the Windows 2008 OS from a
   Linux Thin Client (connecting via Terminal Servers or RDP as
   it's known from Win2008 R2 onwards). The difference of accessing
   via a Linux Thin Client is enough for the fix for APAR LO66136 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO66136]
   to fail. The reason is that these Linux Thin clients are
   returning the timezone in another timezone format (in
   a "short" timezone format) compared to the format when returned
   when Windows is used without Linux Thin Client access.
   
   The further details of the issue are as contained within APAR
   LO66136 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1LO66136]
   
   For various reasons, the Notes JVM can return the wrong timezone
   value which causes the calendar view in a Notes Client to
   display
   calendar entries some hours out from what is should be.
   
   There is a need to be able to reset the Notes JVM timezone
   value,
   or set it forcibly as a parameter. The parameters below should
   work but do not:
   
   1. The jvm.properties file in the JVM plug-in
   directory to be updated (XPD, Sametime, Symphony)
   
   XPD e.g.[xpd install
   path]\rcp\eclipse\plugins\com.ibm.rcp.j2se.win32.x86_1.6.0.20100
   930a-201101061900\jvm.properties
   
   2. Notes e.g. [notes install
   path]\framework\rcp\deploy\jvm.properties
   
   for either: add the line (without inverted commas)
   "vmarg.timezone=-Duser.timezone=Europe/London"(for London time
   to be put in).
   
   3. Updating the rcpinstall.properties in the product [workspace
   path]\.config\rcpinstall.properties
   
   e.g.add the line:
   
   -Duser.timezone=Europe/Moscow
   
   
   However, this using step 2. for example doesn't work, Further
   debugging produces the following output when attempted:
   
   java.util.TimeZone.setDefault(java.util.TimeZone) line: 695
   com.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone.setDefault(com.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone)
   line: 717
   com.ibm.workplace.noteswc.locations.Location.getTimeZone() line:
   83 [local variables unavailable]
   com.ibm.workplace.noteswc.locations.jobs.RetrieveCurrentLocation
   Job.run(org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor) line: 181
   org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run() line: 55
   
   It should be permitted to be able to edit the jvm.properties
   file in this way so as to allow a timezone parameter to be
   forcibly put into the Notes JVM that
   will now be overridden, as in the above case by
   com.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone.setDefault(com.ibm.icu.util.TimeZone)
   line: 717
   
   LOCAL FIX:
   None
