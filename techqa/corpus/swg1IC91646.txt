APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Running the checkHA command returns a command error:
   
   PureApplication>checkha
   High Availability Health Check:
   /usr/bin/checkHA: line 19: onstat: command not found
   PureApplication System does not appear to be started
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the IBM service representative account access is enabled, the
   service representative can run a more detailed checkHA command
   to get the high availability status. In addition, in Fix Pack 4,
   there is a "High availability status" that can be accessed
   through System Console > Hardware > Management Nodes.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In IBM PureApplication System version 1.1.0.0 the high
   availability architecture has changed and there is no checkHA
   command. The problem has been eliminated by a design change.
