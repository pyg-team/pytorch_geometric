ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In process admin console, BPD instance migration displays
   results showing 0 migrated instances when it finishes. Although
   from the logs or database you would be able to tell that there
   were several instances which got migrated successfull.
   
   You may noticed that one of your BPD instances has a null name.
   
   In the SystemOut.log you may see that this exception happens at
   some point prior to the behavior related to the
   getSnapshotProcessInstances method.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ERROR DESCRIPTION -
   After you migrate inflight instances successfully, the summary
   screen incorrectly displays that zero instances were migrated.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED

   LOCAL FIX -
   None
   
   
   PROBLEM SUMMARY
   Although the instance migration result screen shows zeroes,
   instance migration might have completed successfully. After the
   process instances have been migrated, you see a
   NullPointerException in the SystemOut.log file while retrieving
   the migration results:

   napshotProcessInstances(RuntimeServicesCore.java:1794)
   
   This exception occurs when IBM BPM prepares the migration result
   after all the instances are migrated because the instance name
   field is  empty in IBM Process Designer.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  An interim fix is released on IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that handles the
   empty instance name properly and displays the results
   accurately.
