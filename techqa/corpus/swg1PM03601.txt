APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PERMANENT RESTRICTION.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Sometimes when generating code the full path to the include is n
   ot generated. This only happens rarely, but when it does we have
    no way of resolving the issue. This is a complete showstopper a
   s this prevents compilation of the code when it happens.
   
   A typical scenario is that we use a 'usage' dependency to anothe
   r class/package in the model. The code is then generated to look
    like this:
   
   
   #include ?nameofpkg?
   
   
   It should look like this:
   
   
   #include ?parentPkg/nameofpgk?
   
   
   We have no idea what causes this, so we cant reproduce the probl
   em consistently. Code that builds fine one day can suddenly stop
    working.  Typically when this happens we have to rebuild the en
   tire module from scratch as we have never been able to find the
   cause.
   
   ============================================
   
   I've noticed after changing this property, that the code view do
   esn't
   always update correctly. So to all intent it looks as though the
   
   property has not had an effect on the re-generated code. Right-c
   licking
   the class and selecting the edit code option opens a new code vi
   ew
   window this time showing the correct include path.
   
   
   
   It may be that at some point this property was disabled in your
   project
   and when re-enabled, rhapsody failed to properly re-generated th
   e code.
   Of course as you say this would then not compile, because you ha
   d the
   directory structure for the packages (created when the property
   was
   enabled) but no paths in the include statements (removed when th
   e
   property was disabled).
