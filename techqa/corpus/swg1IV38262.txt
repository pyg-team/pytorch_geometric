APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using ITCAM for Tx V7.3.0.1 + LA0002 (needed to support RPT
   V8.3 script environment), with content capture option set to
   TRUE, both in the robotic profile used to playback RPT script,
   and in RRT T6 configuration (Enable screen and content capture
   during playback),
   when attempting to display content capture details from TEP
   Robotic script verification point failures workspace, it fails
   with "An error occurred during the application/request process"
   message , in a window titled "downloading archive".
   
   Checking on RRT T6 agent, all zip archive files located under
   C:\IBM\ITM\kt1depot\T6\CONTENT
   are all with file size  = 22 bytes (on a Linux RRT T6) and when
   trying to open them, they are actually empty.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: RPT 8.3 users who view content capture data
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The T6 agent fails to decode RPT 8.3
   * content. This causes empty content zip files to be generated.
   * Which in turn results in an error page when attempting to
   * view the content capture in TEP.
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply fix pack 2 when available
   ****************************************************************
   A change in RPT 8.3 runtime causes content decoding to abort.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The T6 agent decoding of RPT 8.3 content was fixed.
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
   packages:
               | fix pack | 7.3.0.0-TIV-CAMRT-FP0002
