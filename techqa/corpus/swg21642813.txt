Remote Technical assistance (Q&A, usage) as well as fixpack support provided through the IBM firmware services and support organization was withdrawn for the 4.0.1 firmware level on 30 June 2014. 



Customers running 4.0.1 (or any earlier version) are advised to plan to upgrade to the latest supported releases of WebSphere DataPower firmware in order to continue receiving technical support as well as proactively avoiding problems that are already resolved. 



Refer to Supported Firmware versions and recommended upgrade levels [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631] for more information. 



IBM recommends that users consider applying the 5.0.0.8 latest fixpack version (or later) of the firmware. Of course, in the case of upgrading firmware for any critical embedded system, IBM recommends that users test their configurations and surrounding applications before moving into production.
