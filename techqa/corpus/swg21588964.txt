 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How to apply the fix pack 7.5.0.x to an existing deployment of the Decision Event runtime?
How to apply the fix pack 7.5.0.x to a WebSphere Application Server profile augmented with an earlier release or fix release of WebSphere Operational Decision Management Decision Server Events 7.5.0?
How to apply the fix pack 7.5.0.x to an existing deployment of Business Space Event Widgets? 

ANSWER
The fix packs 7.5.0.x do not introduce any change to WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere eXtreme Scale and Business Space. So it is not necessary to un-augment/re-augment existing profiles for these to apply the fix pack to an existing profile. 

Concerning an existing event runtime, it is sufficient to deploy an up to date version of wberuntimeear.ear, found in wodm_install_dir/director/lib/wberuntimeear.ear after the installation of the fix pack. For example if the profile was augmented with "WebSphere Operational Decision Management Decision Server Events" then redeploying the wberuntimeear.ear will bring the profile to the new fix pack level.

Concerning testing event logic with an existing deployment of the WBETester, it is sufficient to deploy an up to date version of WBETesterEAR.ear, found in wodm_install_dir/director/lib/WBETesterEAR.ear after the installation of the fix pack.

The Business Space Event Widgets should also be updated by following the same instructions as in Installing event widgets in a stand-alone Business Space environment [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.wbe.install.doc%2Fdoc%2Fbs_installingwbewidgets.html] to update the widgets through wsadmin with AdminTask.updateBusinessSpaceWidgets(), using the widget .zip files found in the directory wodm_install_dir/widgets after installation of fix pack 7.5.0.x.

It is also possible to create a new profile from scratch after the installation of fix pack 7.5.0.x and follow normal instructions for Configuring Decision Server Events [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.wbe.install.doc%2Fdoc%2Finstall.html]. The resulting new profile will have all 7.5.0.x level components.

Note that the Sample server profile is created upon first launch of "Start Sample Server": 

 * With WODM 7.5 a profile is created with the name "WODMSample750" 
 * With WODM 7.5.0.x a new profile is created named "WODMSample750x" (with x=1,2 or 3 for example). This profile has all its components up to date and corresponding to fix pack installed (including the event runtime EAR file and the business widgets).
