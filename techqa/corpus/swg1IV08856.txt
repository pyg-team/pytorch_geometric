APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After IZ88094 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88094] has been applied, when they drag the topology
   widget
   onto a view in the TEP workspace, they do not get a "Select
   Topology
   Source" table and therefore cannot choose whether to create an
   aggregate
   topology or an instance topology.
   
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   We have noticed that this problem also occurs in ITM 623 build
   1228.
   The effect of this problem is that a customer cannot create a
   new
   transaction topology.
   
   When they drag the topology widget onto a view in the TEP
   workspace,
   they do not get a "Select Topology Source" table and therefore
   cannot
   choose whether to create an aggregate topology or an instance
   topology.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  After IZ88094 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88094], the topology widget on the Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal client no longer lists the ITCAM for Transactions
   applications topologies.
   
   
   IZ88094 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88094] added filtering to prevent the ITCAM for Transaction
   topologies from showing up as selectable navigator views in the
   User Administration dialogs. This additional filtering was too
   inclusive and prevented the ITCAM for Topologies Selection
   dialog from displaying because no ITCAM for Transaction
   topologies were returned.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code was changed to remove the Topology
   ID as one of the filtering criteria, so that the only filtering
   is by agent type and topology type.
   
   
   The fix for this APAR is contained in the following maintenance
