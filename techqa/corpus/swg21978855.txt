QUESTION
 Why do HR and Matter loaders fail with an exception after upgrading to Atlas 6.0.3.3? 

CAUSE
When the HR and Matter loaders run, you will see an exception - "CUSTOMFIELD15": invalid identifier" in the person_adapter.log and matter_adapter.log files respectively. This is because of missing columns CustomFields (6 to 15) introduced as part of Atlas 6.0.3.3 in both atlas_person and atlas_matter tables
