Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects IBM WebSphere MQ Internet Pass-Thru (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM WebSphere MQ Internet Pass-Thru. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM WebSphere MQ Internet Pass-Thru - SupportPac MS81

REMEDIATION/FIXES
Replace/upgrade MQIPT installations to IBM WebSphere MQ Internet Pass-Thru 2.1.0.2 [http://www.ibm.com/services/forms/preLogin.do?source=passthru] or later.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
IBM strongly recommends immediately changing any routes that use any of the following RC4 CipherSuites or do not explicitly specify a CipherSuite to use a stronger encryption algorithm; 

 * SSL_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 
 * SSL_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 
 * SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_ECDH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_ECDH_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 
 * SSL_KRB5_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_SHA 
 * SSL_KRB5_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 
 * SSL_KRB5_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 
 * SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 
 * SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 
 * SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA 

Note that IBM may need to deprecate the use of weaker algorithms in response to a security vulnerability. 

You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
