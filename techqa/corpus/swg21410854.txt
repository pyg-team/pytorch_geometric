PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A Rational Team Concert for System z language definition can contain translators that are associated with an MVS module. If a REXX exec needs to be executed as a translator, there is no way to define a translator associated with it. 

SYMPTOM
Rational Team Concert for System z language definitions can contain translators. Translators are associated with an MVS module. Rational Team Concert for System z does not provide a way to define an associated translator if you need to run a REXX exec as a translator.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As a workaround, instead of using the Ant with extensions for z/OS compile task, use the Ant apply task to call a REXX script. To do this, perform the following steps: 

 1. Create a dummy translator called "REXX," and then associate it with a nonexistent MVS module. 
 2. Create a dummy language definition called "REXX" and include the new dummy REXX translator. 
 3. Associate zFiles with the new "REXX" language definition. 
 4. Use the tso shell command to write a shell script that invokes a REXX script in a partitioned data set extended (PDSE). The following shell script example invokes "MYHLQ.JAZZ.EXEC(TEST)" with the parameters specified when the shell script is invoked:


==== 
#!/bin/sh 
tso "EXEC 'MYHLQ.JAZZ.EXEC(TEST)' '${@}'" 
==== 5. Edit the build.xml file to add a target to invoke the shell script: 

<!-- Process source files with a REXX exec. -->
<target name="rexx" description="invoke rexx">
<apply executable="/u/username/callrexx.sh" relative="true">
<restrict>
<antz:buildableset 
buildableList="${teamz.scm.fetchDestination}/buildableFiles.xml"/>
<antz:langdefselector name="REXX" caseSensitive="false"/>
</restrict>
</apply>
</target>
