QUESTION
 RZ agent subnode names gets trundated on TEP at the hostname bit, e.g.
RZ:namir-namir-HHW-RGNMDB01:RDB instead of RZ:namir-namir-HHW-RGNMDB01-T:RDB
Why does it happen, and how to display the hostname entirely? 

CAUSE
By default, the structure of the RDB Managed System (and subnode) name is as follows
RZ:<DBConnectionName>-<Instance>-<HostName>:RDB

If the total length of this string exceeds 32 characters, the <HostName> portion will be truncated due to a well known limitation of ITM framework for the length of a Managed System Name.


ANSWER
Starting from IF1, the following environment variable has been introduced as an enhancement: 

KRZ_SUBNODE_INCLUDING_AGENTNAME 

which can help in cases like this. 

The KRZ_SUBNODE_INCLUDING_AGENTNAME setting controls whether the agent instance name is added to the subnode name. The default value is YES. 

If you set: 

KRZ_SUBNODE_INCLUDING_AGENTNAME=NO 

in the agent configuration files (agentdir/config/rz_<instance>.config for Unix/Linux TMAITM6\KRZENV_<instance> or TMAITM6_X64\KRZENV_<instance> for Windows), then restart the agent, you will see on TEP that the structure of the subnode's name is re-organized as 

 "RZ:<DBConnection>-<HostName>:RDB" 

that is the <Instance> portion is dropped. 

This allows a greater number of characters available for the <HostName> string, and it will probably be enough to prevent the latter from being truncated.
