Title: IBM Logging large numbers of users using RPT scripts into RTC application hangs the WAS server - United States

change rate; WAS freeze; RTC login TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to login large numbers of users using IBM Rational Performance Tester (RPT) script into IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) application configured on IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) results in hanging the IBM WebSphere Application Server. 

SYMPTOM
The following exception messages are seen in the logs:

0000004a SSLHandshakeE E SSLC0008E: Unable
to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or
security settings have expired. Exception is
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during handshake

CAUSE
The Server hangs because the change rate has been set to "0" in RPT scripts forcing all users to Login at the same time into the WAS Server.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue modify the Login change rate in the RPT Script to a higher value:


Examples: 

 * 1 user/per 3 seconds for 25 users 
 * 1 user/per 6 seconds for 100 users


The document Staggering users start times [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21390098] has detailed steps to modify the change rate in RPT.
