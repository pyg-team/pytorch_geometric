Text:
populate; ncmonitor; gw; gwevent; gateway TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

THIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):
 English 

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 At installation, the ncmonitor database tables for gateway plugins should be populated. Unpopulated the ncp_g_event could core 

ENVIRONMENT
The tables populated at installation are under the ncmonitor database 

 gwEventFieldMap 
gwPluginConf 
gwPluginEventMaps 
gwPluginEventStates 
gwPluginTypes 
gwPlugins 
gwSchemaFiles 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Execute the script 

root@server # $PRECISION_HOME/bin/ncp_perl /space/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/scripts/perl/scripts/ncp_gwplugins.pl -domain NCOMS

Your output should look something like
|------------------|------------|
| Plugin name | Is enabled |
|------------------|------------|
| Adaptive Polling | true |
| Disco | false |
| Failover | true |
| RCA | true |
| SAE IP Path | true |
| SAE ITNM Service | true |
| SAE MPLS VPN | true |
| zNetView | false |
|------------------|------------|

If not, these tables may not have been populated at installation.

For mysql it would look like

./mysql ncmonitor -u root < /opt/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/scripts/sql/data/populateMonitorConfigDb.sql

For other databases, review the format for executing the sql by looking at the 'populate' script
in /space/IBM/tivoli/netcool/precision/scripts/sql/typeofdatabase where typeofdatabase is
oracle, db2, informix, or mysql. Looking at the populate_oracle_database.sh for oracle, populate_db2_database.sh for db2, populate_informix_database.sh for informix.
