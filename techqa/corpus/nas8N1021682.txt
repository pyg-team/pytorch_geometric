 Informational APARs are not web friendly due to line wrap. Moving Information Apar content into technote for readability. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
V7R1 - II14493 

. 
**** Last Updated 10/14/2013 **** 
*****
ALERT: Recently an issues has been encountered with E1 Tools
release 8.98.4.xx with the latest JDK 1.5 ptfs which updates
the JDK to SR16 FP3. This does not affect E1 Tools release
9.1.x as that release uses JDK 1.6 version. If you are at
the affected level please do not install the latest java
group ptf until this issue has been resolved. Also you
can reference Oracle Alert document Doc ID 1590851.1 on the
Oracle support web site for JDE products.

V7R1 Specific Release Note: 

The Oracle/JD Edwards World and EnterpriseOne solutions require 
program conversion when upgrading from V5R4 or ealier releases 
in order to run on V6R1 or V7R1. Customers should refer to the 
"What's New for V7R1" information on Installing, upgrading i5/OS 
under IBM i and related software in the Info Center as well as 
the Program Conversion redbook for more information on planning 
for program conversion: 

http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/?topic=/rzahc/rzahc1.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/?topic=/rzahc/rzahc1.htm] 

http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/redp4293.html?Open [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/redp4293.html?Open] 

For customers upgrading an existing World or EnterpriseOne 
solution from V5R3 or V5R4, the redbook is a good reference on 
the steps of analyzing the system and planning for the program 
conversion as part of the upgrade. For those customers that are 
installing World or EnterpriseOne on V7R1 instead of upgrading, 
use the redbook as a reference on best practices for doing the 
program conversion and focus on Chapter 4 which describes the 
ways to perform conversion on a V6R1 or V7R1 system. The 
recommended approach is calling STROBJCVN to perform the 
conversion prior to starting the application, as this will most 
efficiently use system resources. The "first touch" method of 
conversion as discussed in the redbook is the most likely to 
cause problems because the conversion on first touch can cause 
timing / locking problems when the application is starting. 


+ on the left marks changes since the last update 

This entire Info APAR has been rewritten to assist in 
addressing specific problems. Information pertaining to 
specific maintenance levels has been removed. 

The future changes to this APAR will be specific PTFs and 
additional information if needed. 
PTFs will be removed when they are included in the latest 
Cumulative package or Hiper group. 

Note: In multi-tier environments all i5 systems and 
partitions involved should be at the same ptf 
levels.
