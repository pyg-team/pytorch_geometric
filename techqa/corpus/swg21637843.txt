relnotes TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 IBM® Cognos® Planning macros do not run. They always have a status of "Pending". 

SYMPTOM
Macros have a status of "Pending" in IBM Cognos Planning Administrator when they are executed in IBM Cognos Connection. They never run.


CAUSE
In IBM Cognos Planning version 10.1.1 and later, there is no longer a Planning Monitor Service that runs tasks. Instead, Cognos Planning tasks are controlled by the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence server's Monitor Service.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, you must create new parameters in IBM Cognos Administration. 

Procedure


 1. In IBM Cognos Administration in Cognos BI, on the Configuration tab, click Dispatchers and Services. 
 2. Click the Cognos BI dispatcher that you want to configure. The list of services is displayed. 
 3. Find the MonitorService service. You may have to click the Next Page icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637843&amp;aid=1] to find the service in the list. 
 4. Click the Set properties - MonitorService icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637843&amp;aid=2]. 
 5. On the Settings tab, for the Advanced settings of the Environment Category, click Edit. 
 6. Select Override the settings acquired from the parent entry. 
 7. Create a new parameter named enable.session.affinity. Set its value to true. 
 8. Create another new parameter named session.affinity.services. Set its value to serviceName=planningAdministrationConsoleService. 
 9. Click OK, then click OK again.


Attention : there must be no trailing spaces when defining these parameters, otherwise they won't work. 

What to do next 

It might take 20 minutes or more for the services to reset. If you want the change to take effect immediately, stop and restart the IBM Cognos service in IBM Cognos Configuration.
