ANSWER
Protocols and Ports used by Tivoli Remote Control 

Components 

Component Managed Mode P2P Mode Description Server Yes No Management (users, targets, groups and policies) and end-user portal Controller Yes Yes Client to take control of a remote system Target Yes Yes Agent installed on the system to be remotely controlled CLI Yes No Command-line interface to launch remote control session and execute remote commands Gateway Yes No Provides support for NAT and Firewall traversal on the Intranet Broker Yes No Provides support for remote control of out-of-sight target endpoints on the Internet Player Yes Yes To playback session recordings Protocols 

HTTP(S) 

All components in TRC use HTTP(S) when connecting to the TRC server. The TRC server runs on top of IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS or eWAS). 

Connect from Connect To Description Controller Server Upload audit events, upload session recording, ... Target Server Register, heartbeat, authorize session, download policies, upload audit events, upload session recording, update trust store Target Gateway Connect to server via gateway tunnels Broker Server Authenticate endpoints, update trust store Broker Gateway Connect to server via gateway tunnels Player Server Download recordings for playback FORTHv2 FORTHv2 is TRC's native protocol for remote control sessions. It is used for the following types of connections: 

Connect from Connect To Description Controller Target Remote control session Controller Controller Joint collaboration session CLI Target Launch remote control session on remote system Controller Gateway Locate and connect to endpoint via the gateway system Gateway Controller Locate master controller for collaboration Gateway Target Locate endpoints Gateway Gateway Gateway control connections FORTHv2 over TLS For connections to the broker over the Internet, FORTHv2 is used on top of the industry standard Transport Security Layer protocol (TLS), the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 

Connect from Connect To Description Controller Broker Initiate session via broker Target Broker Accept session via broker Broker Broker Broker control connections Default Ports 

Component Protocol Default Port Can be disabled Can be configured Comments Server (with embedded WebSphere) HTTP 80 Yes Yes Can be overridden in trc_server_setup Server (with embedded WebSphere) HTTPS 443 Yes Yes Can be overridden in trc_server_setup Server (with full WebSphere) HTTP 9080 Yes Yes Configured in WebSphere Administrative Console Server (with full WebSphere) HTTPS 9443 Yes Yes Configured in WebSphere Administrative Console Controller FORTHv2 8787-8781 Yes Only for P2P Used for collaboration, which can be disabled via policy Target FORTHv2 888 No Yes The gateway and broker do not have default ports. All ports need to be chosen by the Administrator and configured in the configuration file. FORTHv2 Encryption 

FORTHv2 connections are always encrypted. Originally, IBM's MARS cipher was used to encrypt FORTHv2 traffic but support for AES was added in version 5.1.2. From version 8.2.0 onwards, AES is used by default and MARS is only supported when connecting to a system that hasn't been upgraded yet. 

5.1.0 5.1.2 8.2.0 8.2.1 Default Cipher MARS MARS AES AES FIPS Cipher N/A AES AES AES Backwards Compatibility Ciphers N/A N/A MARS MARS Broker Connections N/A N/A N/A TLS
