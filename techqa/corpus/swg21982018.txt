ABSTRACT
 Limited Support Announcement for Internet Explorer (IE) 8, 9, and 10 when used with IBM Maximo Asset Management. 

CONTENT
Effective immediately, compatibility support between Maximo Asset Management and older versions of Internet Explorer will be limited. Any problems that are encountered on older versions of IE must be reproduced on IE11 (in standard mode), Firefox, or Chrome to be considered as a defect. Any fixes will be implemented in IE11 only and may not be compatible with older IE versions.

In January 12, 2016, Microsoft discontinued support for older IE versions. IE users must upgrade to IE11 in order to continue receiving security updates and technical support. Maximo Asset Management added full support for IE11 in versions 7.5.0.8 and 7.6.0.0. Customers who are running Maximo Asset Management 7.5 with IE clients are encouraged to update to Maximo Asset Management 7.5.0.8 or a later version in order maintain compatibility with IE.
