APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem has been isolated to the W3SVC perfmon counters
   being incorrectly setup, which caused the agent to think
   that a new instance of the 'Default Web Site' needed to be
   created every polling cycle.  The agent should be able to
   handle invalid counters and not leak memory.  The fix will
   be to not collect data from counters that are in a 'failed'
   state on the machine and to log those counters that have
   been excluded.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable the W3SVC counters.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Corrupt perfmon counters caused memory leaks in the agent
   because new instances for the corrupt counters were created each
   cycle.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This APAR has been fixed and delivered in a limited availability
   fix 6.1.0.6-TIV-ITM_WIN-LA0050. This maintenance delivery
   vehicle is a limited availability patch and therefore is in a
   "hidden directory." Level 2 Support can provide down load
