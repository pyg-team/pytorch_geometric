APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This happens to me sporadically -- maybe once every one or two
   weeks.   I
   believe it happens when I restore my Thinkpad from standby and
   Notes was
   running (don't know 100% whether related to that or not).
   
   It might be related to the current date changing.
   
   Scenario:
   
   1) I started up my PC this morning (restoring from standby) --
   today is Monday,
   March 22.
   2) Switch to calendar view (which was already opened in a tab)
   -- showing
   weekly view for last week March 15-March21 (because last I was
   there was
   yesterday on Sunday).
   3) Click on "Today" button on calendar picker in top left of
   Notes.    I do not
   remember whether the today text has updated to "March 22" or
   not.   NOTHING
   HAPPENS
   4) Keep clicking on today -- nothing happens -- it does not move
   the calendar
   to March 22-March 28.   BUG
   5) Then I click on some date in the calendar picker forcing the
   week to move,
   like March 4 or something like that.  Works fine.
   6) After that, the Today button works fine.
