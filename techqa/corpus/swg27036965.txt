Title: IBM Known issue: Global hold reminder fails with HTTP status of 302 - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT README

ABSTRACT
 Some single sign-on solutions can interfere with the background processing of certain IBM Atlas Suite user interface pages. For example, the My Holds page can show an error message when you open a hold notice to view. 

CONTENT
Some single sign-on systems use HTTP redirect commands to help manage user authentication. While most direct interactions with IBM Atlas Suite, like displaying a page or submitting a form, tolerate these HTTP redirect commands, some of the dynamic web pages in IBM Atlas Suite are disrupted.

To resolve the error: 

 1. Try to configure your single sign-on system to authenticate users without HTTP redirect commands. You can also try to configure the frequency with which these HTTP redirects occur. 
 2. Try the command that failed again. For example, in the case of the My Holds page, click OK on the error message and re-select the hold notice that failed to display.
