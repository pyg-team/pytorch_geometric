QUESTION
 I am planning to use Microsoft® Active Directory as the directory service for my FileNet P8 Platform. I am also planning to install FileNet P8 with CPIT. Can I incorporate Microsoft® Active Directory into a CPIT P8 installation? 

ANSWER
 Microsoft® Active Directory cannot be installed with CPIT. CPIT only supports the installation of the products that are the prerequisite downloads. See the list of these downloads in the following tech notes: 

 * Downloading software packages for a single-server installation of IBM FileNet P8 [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028379] 
 * Downloading software for a single-server installation of IBM® Case Manager [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24028378]


For a directory server, CPIT supports IBM Tivoli Directory Server.
