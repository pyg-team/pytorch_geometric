PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are setting up a standalone CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) region (SMSS) to allow CICS management client interface (CMCI) connections from CICS Explorer. When trying to connect to the region from CICS Explorer, you see error message IZE0106E Connect failed with "CMAS, NOTAVAILABLE, CPSMAPI". 

SYMPTOM
In CICS Explorer you receive error message:

IZE0106E Connect failed with "CMAS, NOTAVAILABLE, CPSMAPI".

The stand-alone CICS TS region JESMSGLG shows messages similar to:

EYUNX0013E applid TRANSACTION COD1 has invalid value: 001 for option: PRIORITY
EYUNX0013E applid TRANSACTION COD1 has invalid value: xxxxxxxx for option: PROGRAM
EYUNX0013E applid TRANSACTION COD1 has invalid value: USER for option: TASKDATAKEY
EYUNX0014E applid The definition for TRANSACTION COD1 is invalid. MAS initialization is terminating


CAUSE
The CICS TS stand-alone region has a transaction definition that clashes with the stand-alone SMSS region's required transaction definitions.

ENVIRONMENT
CICS Explorer V5.1.0.1; CICS TS V5.1 standalone CMCI region.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Examine the CICS TS region JESMSGLG log to first determine if the region is a CICSPlex SM Web User Interface (WUI) server region. If you see the following message in the JESMSGLG, you will know that it is a WUI server region:

EYUVS0001I applid CICSPLEX SM WEB USER INTERFACE INITIALIZATION STARTED.

If the region is a WUI server, check for this message to ensure startup was successful:

EYUVS0002I applid CICSPlex SM Web User Interface initialization complete.

If message EYUVS0002I is missing, review the WUI server joblog and the CMAS joblog for errors related to the applid.

If the CICS TS region is not a WUI server and is intended to be a standalone CMCI region and the SEYUAUTH and SEYULOAD are in the region's STEPLIB and DFHRPL respectively:




 * check for any DFHXSnnnn security error messages 
 * refer to the CICS TS V5.1 information center topic Setting up CMCI in a stand-alone CICS region [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.clientapi.doc/topics/clientapi_setupcics.html]

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In this specific instance, the conflicting transaction definition for COD1 was removed from their RDO group list in the stand alone CICS TS region. Afterwards, CICS Explorer connection completed successfully using CMCI.

Also in this instance, after removing the conflicting COD1 transaction definition, the standalone SMSS region issued message: 

EYUXM0508E [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/EYUXM/EYUXM0508E.html] Message Service initialization has failed - unable to generate messages via CICS message services. 

The CICS TS region specifies LPA=YES and the English language message module EYUMCT1E has not been moved from SEYUAUTH to SEYULPA. In this instance, adding the SYUELPA data set to the STEPLIB and DFHRPL DD statement concatenation will allow the standalone CMCI to initialize and process the request.
