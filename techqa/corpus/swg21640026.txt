Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 What information should I collect when I am experience issues with the IBM Case Manager installation program v5.2.0.x? 

SYMPTOM
When using the IBM Case Manager installation program, an error occurs or the result of the task is not as expected.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collecting Data for the Case Manager installation program 

For every problem, collecting data can aid in problem determination and save time resolving Problem Management Records (PMRs). Gathering this data before you call IBM support can help you understand the problem and save time when you analyze the data.

Collecting MustGather data early, before opening the PMR, helps IBM® Support quickly determine if: 

 * Symptoms match known problems (rediscovery). 
 * There is a non-defect problem that can be identified and resolved. 
 * There is a defect that identifies a work around to reduce severity.


Locating the root cause of a problem can speed development of a code fix, if necessary. 

Gathering General Information 

For IBM® Case Manager, gather:  * Screen shot of the problem 
 * Version of software 
 * Operating system versions 
 * Settings for the pertinent servers or client machines 
 * Web Browser version information 
 * Type of database and LDAP servers used



Then, gather the following information that is specific to a Case Manager installation program problem or issue:  * How often does this problem occur? 
 * What has changed? 
 * Can the problem be reproduced? 
 * How many users are affected by this problem? 
 * What is the business impact of this problem? 
 * Is there a work around?



Gathering Operating System Versions and Settings 

These commands collect:  * OS Version 
 * OS Environment Variables 
 * OS Kernel parameters 
 * OS system logs


Run the following commands on the IBM Case Manager server and collect the output: 

AIX users Command Collects uname -a or oslevel -q OS Version /usr/sbin/instfix -ivq OS Patches or Maintenance level env OS Environment Variable errpt OS Configuration and Error Reporting /usr/sbin/lsattr -E -l sys0 OS Kernel parameters /var/adm/syslog/syslog.log OS System log 
Windows users Command Collects systeminfo
inmsd 
(and do a file -> “export” menu choice to create a text file) OS Version, Patches and Maintenance level set OS Environment Variables Start > All Programs > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer
Save the following event logs:  * Application 
 * Security 
 * System


If there is a large number of events that are irrelevant (perhaps months or years old), use the filtering capability to limit the data gathered. OS Event Logs Linux users 

Command Collects uname -a OS Version /usr/bin/showrev -a OS Patches or Maintenance level env OS Environment Variable /usr/sbin/prtdiag -v OS Configuration and Error Reporting /usr/sbin/sysdef -D 
/usr/bin/getconf -a OS Kernel parameters /var/log/messages.* OS System logs 
Gathering Installation Program Version Information Provide the name of the installation program (e.g. 5.2.0.0-ICM-WIN.EXE). The installation program name identifies the version. 

In addition, gather the version.txt file from the installation disks. In some cases, the version.txt file might also be found in the root installation directory. 

 

Case Manager Installation Log Files

Case Manager Install log files are located in subdirectories under the Case Manager install directory or in temp folders.

The default Case Manager installation directory is

Case Manager Installation Program Log File

- IBM_Case_Manager_5.2.0.0_InstallLog.txt 

The installation program log file is normally located in the logs subdirectory under the Case Manager installation directory, but on cancelled installations it will be located in the user home or desktop. 

Debug Log Files for Installations

- cm5200_install_stderr.txt 
- cm5200_install_stdout.txt 

The debug log files (standard error and standard out) for installs will be located in the logs/InstallDebug subdirectory under the Case Manager installation directory, but on cancelled installations they will be located in the system TEMP directory. 

Debug Log Files for Uninstallations

- cm5200_uninstall_stderr.txt 
- cm5200_uninstall_stdout.txt 

The debug log files (standard error and standard out) for uninstalls will be located in the system TEMP directory. 


Case Manager Platform Installation Tool (CMPIT) Log Files 

Gather the following log files if the Case Manager Platform Installation Tool was used: 

Case Manager Platform Installation Tool Installation log file 

- cmpit520_install_log.txt 

The installer log file is normally located in \Program Files\IBM\cmpit on Windows and in /opt/ibm/cmpit on AIX or Linux, but on cancelled installations it is located in the user home or desktop. 


Standard Error File

- cmpit520_install_stderr.txt 

The standard error file is normally located in \Program Files\IBM\cmpit on Windows and in /opt/ibm/cmpit on AIX or Linux, but on cancelled installations it is located in the system TEMP directory. 


Standard Out File

- cmpit520_install_stdout.txt 

The standard out file is normally located in \Program Files\IBM\cmpit on Windows and in /opt/ibm/cmpit on AIX or Linux, but on cancelled installations it is located in the system TEMP directory.
