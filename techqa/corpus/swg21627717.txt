Procedure:

Note: Existing Floating licenses for IBM Rational Software Architect can be used for IBM Rational Software Architect for Macintosh Operating System.

 2. Select the IBM Rational Product, then choose the "configure floating license support" option
    
    
 3. Click Next
    
    
 4. Click Enable Floating license enforcement.
    
    
 5. Configure one or more license server connections.  1. Click an empty field in the Servers table or click Add. 
     2. If your administrator provided you with information for a redundant server environment, click Redundant Server. Fields for the primary, secondary, and tertiary server names and ports appear. 
     3. Enter the host name of the license server in the Name field. 
     4. Enter a value in the Port field for environments where a firewall is used. Do not assign a value to this port unless your administrator instructs you to do so. 
     5. For redundant server environments, enter the names and ports (as required) for the secondary and tertiary servers. 
     6. You can click the Test Connection button to confirm that the connection information is correct and that the server is available. 
     7. Click OK.
        
        
    
    
 6. Click Next.
    
    
 7. Configure the license usage order for your shell shared or custom packages. The order of packages in the list determines the order in which the components in your installed packages attempt to obtain access to license keys. The license keys are from the pool of available floating license keys.
    
    
 8. Click Finish.
