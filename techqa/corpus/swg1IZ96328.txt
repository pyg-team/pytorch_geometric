ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TAM ESSO v8.1-Citrix -Web Client issue
   
   Citrix is not working in Private desktop. Only one user is able
   to
   login to citrix and use the published application and other
   users try
   to launch Citrix it doesnt launch nor does it give any error
   messages.
   We are using the web interface for Citrix (ICA) version
   10.200.2650 . I
   have tried adding wfcrun32.exe and wfica32.exe as a single
   instance
   application but that did not make any difference in the
   behavior.
   Also the passthrough autherntication for Citrix is not working
   for the
   Private desktop either. We have tested it on Personal mode and
   it works
   fine but in Private desktop mode the domain is filled but the
   username
   and password does not get filled.
   Citrix Server is on the same domain.
   
   On the other hand, customer has no issue with Citrix ICA web
   client
   version 12.0
