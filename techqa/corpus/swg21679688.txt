QUESTION
 How to include URI resources while deploying from Decision Center to RES? Why is "Managed URIs" empty after deployment? 

CAUSE
URI reference is missing or incorrect in Decision Center.

ANSWER
URI is stored to a file named deployment.xml after a first deployment to a Decision Server. The deployment.xml file is taken into account during the synchronization process and enables further deployment to the specified Decision Server from Decision Center. 

Here is a sample tutorial on how to include URI resources in Decision Center:
- Import a project to Rule Designer
- Deploy XOM to the RES from RD 
- Publish/Synchronize project to Decision Center from Rule Designer 
- To check if deployment.xml has been succesfully synchronized to Decision Center, define a smart folder where the condition is "Find all resources". Once the smart folder is defined, you should be able to see a file named "deployment.xml". This is where the URI reference is stored in Decision Center. 
- Now create a new Ruleapp and ruleset for the project and deploy it to RES from Decision Center. 
- Go to RES console and check the Ruleapp you just deployed and you will find the URIs information is already included with the project. 
- Now you can try to make some changes in DC and redeploy the project to RES. You will find the URI will always be included. 

Note: The URL used to deploy and that in deployment.xml must match with each other. For example, if you have http://localhost:9080/res in deployment.xml, the same URL must be used when deploying from DC to RES. Otherwise, if you are using a machine name or 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost when deploying the ruleapp, the managed URIs won't be synchronized to RES correctly.
