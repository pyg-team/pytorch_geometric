APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a Gateway node is removed from an IBM API Management
   environment, there are some scenarios where the configuration
   of the Gateway node might not be successfully cleaned. If the
   administrator tries to add the same Gateway node back in to
   the environment, the following error is displayed.
   
   error message key:
   error message text: "An error ocurred while adding the gateway
   appliance ''${0}'' to the loadbalancer group used for internal
   traffic. The error was: ${1}: ${2}"
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This issue can be resolved by manually removing the load
   balancer configuration from the Gateway node (DataPower
   appliance). To manually remove the load balancer, run the
   following CLI or GUI commands:  (where your
   DataPower appliance is configured to use the network interface
   "eth0", and the load balancer group is "123")  By
   using the CLI:  * ssh <datapower hostname> *
   enter your login credentials * co * int eth0 * no
   standby 123 * exit * write mem  By using the
   DataPower user interface:  Open the Network and
   Interface folders in the navigation tree. * Click "Ethernet
   Interface". * Click the relevant interface row in the
   table. * Select the "Standby Control" tab. * Click X
   on the relevant table row to delete the load balancing
   group. * Click "Apply". * Click "Save Config" in the
   page header.  Also, to prevent any port conflicts,
   remove all IBM API Management domains from the Gateway node
   (DataPower appliance) too. The IBM API Management related
   domains have the format of "APIMgmt_<10 alphanumeric
   characters>". Otherwise, adding the Gateway node appears to
   complete successfully but when APIs that are created by using
   the recreated Management node are accessed, you see 404 errors.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When a Gateway node is removed from an IBM API Management
   environment, there are some scenarios where the configuration of
   the Gateway node might not be successfully cleaned. If the
   administrator tries to add the same Gateway node back in to
   the environment, an error is displayed.
   
   In particular, this occurs if the Management node(s) of the
   environment is deleted and recreated without first removing
   the Gateway node (the Gateway node was never actually removed
   from the environment).
   
   The external symptom of this problem is the error message that
   is displayed when adding the gateway node.
   
   error message key: FAILURE_ADDING_APICALL_LOADBALANCER
   error message text: "An error ocurred while adding the gateway
   appliance ''${0}'' to the loadbalancer group used for internal
   traffic. The error was: ${1}: ${2}"
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The IBM API Management code has been updated to resolve this
   error.
   
   The update has been addressed in IBM API Management V2.0
   cumulative ifix 002 and will be officially included in IBM API
   Management fixpack V2.0.0.1
