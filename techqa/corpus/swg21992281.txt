QUESTION
 In IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for UNIX, how do you code a RUN TASK step in a process to run on a UNIX node, that performs a move ('mv') command on files that have names containing special characters, for example $file1? 

CAUSE
The $ in the filename will cause the UNIX shell in which the RUN TASK step runs to interpret $file1 as a variable rather than a file called $file1, unless enclosed in single quotes.

ANSWER
Enclose the file's name in single quotes in the RUN TASK step's sysopts statement, for example as in this example which renames a file from $file1 to $file2:


sysopts="mv path/to/'$file2' path/to/'$file1'"
