 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes the possible errors returned by the HMC during a firmware upgrade from 01AH730 or earlier to 01AH760. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This document describes the possible errors returned by the HMC during a firmware upgrade from 01AH730 or prior to 01AH760. The two errors are as follows: 

o Message HSCF0999 if the server supports a maximum partition value less than 1000 and a dual HMC is connected and active.
o Message HSCF0161 when the HMC is not at the minimum level.




 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] HSCF0999: Dual HMC and Server maximum partition value less than 1000 
   
   Note: This issue is resolved with 7.7.6 Service pack 2 or later (including base HMC 7.7.0). If the server is dual HMC managed, both HMCs must be updated prior to performing the server upgrade. 
   
   POWER7 9119-FHB servers with a maximum partition value less than 1000 partitions need to disconnect any redundant (Dual) HMC temporarily before performing a server firmware upgrade from 01AH730 (or earlier) to 01AH760. If the redundant HMC is not powered off or disconnected prior to the upgrade, the upgrade will fail shortly after the retrieving updates stage with the error HSCF0999 - Disconnect or power-off the sibling management console(s) from the following list and retry the update. After the update is complete, reconnect or power-on the sibling. 
   
   The requested update level can not be applied on the following server from this management console (<HMC performing the upgrade>) while the server is managed by multiple management consoles. management console(s). 
   9119-FHB*026BB46: Sibling console(s) [<dual/redundant HMC that needs to be powered off>]"
   
   To check the maximum number of partitions, the server must be in standby or operating state. Select the server and the task Properties, then select the General tab:
   
   CLI: lssyscfg -r sys -F "name,max_lpars"
   Partition properties; general tab [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010706&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010706&aid=1]
   
   To check if a dual HMC is connected, select the server and then click the task Connections > Disconnect Another Management Console. Any dual HMC that is connected will appear in the list. After checking, Click Cancel to exit. Note: The Disconnect Another HMC task cannot be used to perform the upgrade, only to check for the presence of another HMC:
   
   Disconnect another HMC [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010706&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1010706&aid=2] 
   
   The recommended resolution is to update the HMC(s) to V7R7.6.0.2 (Service Pack 2). If the server is dual HMC managed, both HMCs must be updated prior to performing the server upgrade.

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] HSCF0161: Downlevel HMC 
   
   The 9119-FHB firmware upgrade to 01AH760 requires a minimum HMC level of 7.7.6 Service Pack 1. If the HMC does not meet the minimum level, the upgrade will fail shortly after the retrieving updates stage with the error HSCF0161 - The requested Licensed Internal Code is not compatible with the current management console level. 
   
   To resolve the issue, you should apply HMC Service Pack 1. To apply Service Pack 1, refer to the Rochester Support Center Knowledgebase document 648421988, Update(s) for HMC 7.7.6.
