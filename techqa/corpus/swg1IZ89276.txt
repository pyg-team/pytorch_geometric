ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM: Customer getting these errors in the View Catalog
   Requests app:
   CTGRC5503E - Service Request not created.
   BMXAA4198E - Organization needed for GL attribute GLACCOUNT on
   object {1}.
   
   Environment:
   MBS 7115  (7.1.1.5-LA20100618-0656)
   CCMDB 7115
   SRM 7104
   WAS 6.1 on Windows 2003 SP2
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Update the 'seqnum' for the following records:
   
   select * from maxlookupmap where target = 'TICKET' and
   lookupattr = 'GLACCOUNT'
   
   in order to force like entries (TARGET,LOOKUPATTR,SOURCE) to be
   adjacent in the cache.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Maximo users of Service Catalog              *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: BMXAA4198E - "Organization needed for   *
   *                      GL attribute GLACCOUNT on object  1"    *
   *                      encountered in Service Requests when    *
   *                      trying to set the GLAccount before the  *
   *                      AssetOrgId has been set.  This error    *
   *                      would be expected if user tries to type *
   *                      the GL Account directly into the ui     *
   *                      without first setting the AssetSiteId   *
   *                      (which in turn sets the AssetOrgId      *
   *                      needed for the GL Account validation).  *
   *                      However, this problem occurs when using *
   *                      the GL Account Navigator (which         *
   *                      requires the user to choose an OrgId).  *
   *                      When the GL Account Navigator dialog is *
   *                      used, the GL Account should be set      *
   *                      without seeing this error.              *
   *                                                              *

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *

   *                                                              *
   *                                                              *
