APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If connections abruptly terminate between MQ and DataPower due
   to a network issue it can cause instability to the appliance and
   cause a restart.  This issue only happens in situations where
   there are factors beyond the normal communications of DP and MQ,
   such as a network failure from a switch.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Avoid abruptly terminating connections.  If MQ must be restarted
   then shut down the MQ Queue Manager and listeners manually.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are customers who use an MQ QM object under stress test
   and the network is not stable.
   
   The appliance might restart when the idle MQ connection
   encounters a network error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix is available in 3.8.2.12, 4.0.1.10 and 4.0.2.6.
