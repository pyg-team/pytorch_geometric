Usage documents for IBM Integration Designer 

You cannot see long descriptions in dialog boxes and wizards in IBM Integration Designer (1499353) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499353&acss=dakc] 
Version: 7.5 
In some dialog boxes and wizards in IBM Integration Designer, the entire description text might not be visible in the white description area. For example, the full description for a dialog box in the new integration solution wizard is "Organize related projects such as modules, mediation modules, and libraries to view the project relationships in the Solution Diagram or to perform common actions on a group of projects." However, the text in the white description area below the title bar seems to end at the word "perform" because the area is too small, and it is not obvious how to see the rest of the text.?This problem might particularly occur in locales where the text is longer in a translated language than in English. 

Workaround for testing a process application module when it is disconnected from the IBM Process Center (1499982) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499982&acss=dakc] 
Version: 7.5 
When a process application is disconnected from the Process Center, you cannot test its modules in a local test environment.

Performance considerations for Human Task Management list widgets with IBM Integration Designer (1499983) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499983&acss=dakc] 
Version: 7.5 
If you are familiar with the performance characteristics of WebSphere Process Server, you might experience an out-of-the-box performance degradation. This degradation might occur when you use Human Task Management list widgets, such as Tasks, Processes and Task Definitions, in Business Space on a new installation of IBM Business Process Manager Version 7.5 run time. The same performance considerations apply if you use the Human Task Management widgets with only business process defintion (BPD) processes and human services on a single application server, or a cluster.
