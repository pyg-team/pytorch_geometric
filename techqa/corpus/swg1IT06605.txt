APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  While using new Virtual System patterns, behavior seen for
   default values of script package parameters and locking of the
   parameters in the pattern is different from what is seen in
   Virtual System classic patterns.
   
   A script package that runs on deployment and on demand uses
   expected values set and locked in the pattern during initial
   deployment.  When run on demand, the locked values from the
   deployment are ignored when showing which values will be used
   in the GUI and the default values for the script package are
   used instead.
   
   Actual execution of the script package shows that the default
   values were actually used for all parameters during the 'on
   demand' execution (instead of the desired values locked in the
   pattern).
   
   Script package parameters that have been locked in the pattern
   can be changed when using the "on demand" option within a new
   Virtual System pattern (this is not allowed in Virtual System
   classic patterns, as expected).  All parameters are offered in
   the GUI for update when a new Virtual System pattern is used,
   even if locked.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A coding error prevented the new architecture virtual system
   pattern script package parameters from being handled
   correctly.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided in PureApplication System version
   2.1.0.0.
