Title: IBM BasicTroubleshooting for incorrect time display in Lotus Notes Calendar - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
Sometimes the time of a meeting is reported as incorrect when compared to the expected time of the meeting, the time of the Operating System etc. 

To help locate the source of the problem, these guidelines apply: 

Calendar entries should appear correctly once the following three component rules are adhered to:

1. The Operating System time zone rules. These are the rules that are used when composing the contents of the StartTimeZone field and EndTimeZone fields, as well as the core time/date fields on the calendar invites. 

2. ICU4J data. This effects how the calendar invites fall into the proper slots in the grid in the various calendar views. 

The ICU4J data can be viewed in the systemsummary.txt: file and takes the following format:

================ICU4J Info================= 
ICU4J TZ Data Version is 2010j 
XPD ICU4J Data Update Patch version is 3.8.1.v20100526_2010j 
Current TZ is: GMT+0100, offset: 1, In DST=false, Time in this 
Timezone 14:01:1

The data version indicated in the above example would be: 2010j. This indicates that the timezone data is derived from 2010 so if there has been a timezone policy change for the relevant country affected since that time, the ICU4J data would need to be updated.



The systemsummary.txt file is contained within the files collected when selecting (in the Notes Standard Client) Help > Support > Collect Support Data.

If you find that the ICU4J data is too old for the relevant country affected, then it is recommended to contact IBM Support to ascertain whether there is a relevant fixpack or other resolution available to update the ICU4J data version.

3. JTZU data. 

Similarly to ICU4J data, the JTZU data can be checked in the systemsummary.txt file. It is recommended to search for the string: 'tzdata' in this systemsummary.txt file. This controls the Java timezone information used by the Notes JVM. It will appear with such an example format: tzdata2014j.

If an issue appears, for example, where hovering a mouse icon over a calendar entry displays the time incorrectly, then this will relate to Java timezone information deployed. 

The JTZU is especially important for examining DST changes and their effect after issues have been reported. The tool is available here:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/dst/index.html [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/dst/index.html]

All three of these time zone data stores must be updated for any situation where a time zone changes its time zone rules. 




SYMPTOM
The timezone on a calendar entry or on a calendar view is not as expected. 


CAUSE
This problem can arise if either the Operating System, ICU4J or JTZU rules are not synchronised correctly.



ENVIRONMENT
Notes/Domino 8.5.x



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Checking whether the Operating System rules, ICU4J rules and JTZU rules are all correct should be the first items to check.
