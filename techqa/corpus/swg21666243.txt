QUESTION
 While accessing ISM Configuration GUI via Java web Start, I notice that on one user environment, all ISM existing profiles are displayed, but on another admin user environment, no ISM profile is displayed. What can be the cause? 

CAUSE
Possible cause is that you have installed recently a new ISM agent support on TEMS/TEPS, but you have not yet cleared the Java cache on the problematic admin user machine.

ANSWER
ISM fixpack or interim fix potentially includes new .jar binaries for the ISM configuration tool accessible via TEP JavaWebStart (JavaWS) client. So the Java cache needs to be cleared on all machines from which one admin user is accessing the TEP ISM Configuration GUI via Java web start. On the problematic environment, it's very likely that old .jar files are still in use, while ISM agent support is at higher level on TEPS side. 


See details below on how to clear the Java cache on the problematic client machine
