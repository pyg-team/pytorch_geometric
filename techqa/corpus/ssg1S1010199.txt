AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SONAS 

The product is affected when running code releases 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.5

REMEDIATION/FIXES
A fix for these issues is in version 1.5.2.6 of IBM SONAS. Customers running an affected version of IBM SONAS should upgrade to 1.5.2.6 or a later version, so that the fix gets applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Workaround(s) :
Normal operation of IBM SONAS does not require or call for customers to use Firefox to access the Internet. Although IBM recommends that you install a level of IBM SONAS code with a fix, you can avoid these vulnerabilities by not using Mozilla Firefox within your IBM SONAS system to access the Internet.

Mitigation: None
