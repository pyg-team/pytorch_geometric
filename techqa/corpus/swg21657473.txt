PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In 5.2.0.0-P8CPE, 5.2.0.1-P8CPE-FP001, 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002 and 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003, when using the Administration Console for Content Platform Engine (ACCE) to create Index Areas, the default value for the Index Maximum Size of a CSS index is 250 MB which is lower than recommended for optimal search performance. The default value should be 262,144,000 KB (which is the equivalent of 256,000 MB or 250 GB).

When an Index Area is created for Content Search Services the default value for the maximum index size is persisted with it unless explicitly changed. Accepting the default value will configure the index areas so that the maximum size of each full text index will be smaller than recommended for best performance.

The default value for the Index Maximum Size in ACCE is corrected in 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003a.

Note that although FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM) also allows setting the Index Maximum Size when creating Index Areas, the default value is correct. Consequently, using FEM to create Index Areas does not have the same problem as in ACCE.


SYMPTOM
Depending on the volume of data being indexed, using the smaller maximum index size value might create an excessive number of full text indexes for an index area and could result in slower search performance over time. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

If Index Areas do not exist
1) Use FEM to create Index Areas.
or
2) If using ACCE to create index areas, upgrade to 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003a which contains the updated default value for Index Maximum Size in ACCE.
or
3) If using ACCE to create index areas in 5.2.0.0-P8CPE, 5.2.0.1-P8CPE-FP001, 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002 or 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003, change the default Index Maximum Size to 256,000 MB (or the equivalents, 256,000,000 KB or 256 GB).

If Index Areas already exist
For customers that have already created Index Areas with 5.2.0.0-P8CPE, 5.2.0.1-P8CPE-FP001, 5.2.0.2-P8CPE-FP002 or 5.2.0.3-P8CPE-FP003, verify the size of the existing indexes. In the event that indexes marked FULL are smaller than 256,000 MB, then it is recommended that these indexes be reindexed. First increase the Index Maximum Size value on the Index Area to 256,000 MB, then reindex the small, full indexes so that their content is reindexed and incorporated into the currently open index. This will allow the index to grow appropriately larger once the limit value is updated. The desired result is fewer, larger indexes. The process of reindexing is described in the FileNet P8 5.2 Information Center. Please contact IBM Support with additional questions.
