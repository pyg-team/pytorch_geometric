APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Configured  ObjectPoolManager resources at the cell level and
   when they trying to map resource references to resources during
   deployement process got the following message on the
   adminconsole.
   
   ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope.  Resources are within
   the deployment target scope if they are defined at the
   cell,node, server, or application level when the deployment
   target is a server, or at the cell, cluster, or application
   level when the deployment target is a cluster. Assign resources
   that are within the deployment target scope of the application
   or confirm that these resources assignments are correct as
   specified.
   
   From the traces noticed the following error.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
   *                  Server V6.0.2 and V6.1.                     *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Customers trying to map resources of    *
   *                      the types ObjectPoolManagerInfo and     *
   *                      ObjectCacheInstance to the  resources   *
   *                      declared inside their applications      *
   *                      get the following message even          *
   *                      thought the resources have been         *
   *                      declared at an appropriate scope.       *
   *                      "ADMA8019E: The resources that are      *
   *                      assigned to the application are         *
   *                      beyond the deployment target scope."    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Customers trying to map the resources of the types
   ObjectPoolManagerInfo and ObjectCacheInstance to the resources
   declared inside their applications get the following message
   even thought the resources have been declared at an
   appropriate scope.
   "ADMA8019E: The resources that are assigned to the application
   are beyond the deployment target scope."
   
   This validation error prevents the customers from
   installing their applications successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code changes have been made to ensure we pick up the resources
   of the types ObjectPoolManagerInfo and ObjectCacheInstance at
   the appropriate scope and display it during the deployment.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   fix packs 6.1.0.19. and 6.0.2.31.
