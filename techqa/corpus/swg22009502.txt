PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error in People application while trying to update Supervisor field on Person records. 

SYMPTOM
The error is thrown while trying to save the record:

BMXAA4214E - An unknown error has occurred. 
Please contact your system administrator for assistance. 
Gather the logs from the <HOME> directory and determine where and why the error is thrown. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Run the query below against the database to try to find a Person being the Supervisor of itself:
SELECT PERSONID, SUPERVISOR FROM PERSON WHERE PERSONID = SUPERVISOR;

2. Run the query below against the database to try to find a Person being a Supervisor of a Person who is the Supervisor of the original Person. 
SELECT PERSONID, SUPERVISOR FROM PERSON;
The idea is: take the Person record with the issue and check who his/her Supervisor is. Then check who the Supervisor of that Supervisor is. Keep doing this until to reach the top. Ensure that a Supervisor doesn't loop back to a Person record.

If the problem still persists even after trying these suggestions, please contact IBM Maximo Support.
