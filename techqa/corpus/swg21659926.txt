Title: IBM Custom DotEdit verification panels behave differently after applying IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1.0 fixpack 2 - United States

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After applying fixpack 2 (fp2) for Datacap 8.1.0, controls on custom DotEdit panels are not reset like they were in previous versions and code in the form_load event is not executing. 

CAUSE
Prior to fixpack 2, whenever navigating to a new page in Verify, the verification form was unloaded and then reloaded completely. This caused some memory problems and DotEdit crashes in cases where many page types existed. 

As a result of the fix for APAR IO19832, when navigating between pages if the page type is the same or both pages use the same DotEdit panel, the form will not be unloaded. Instead, only the text property of the controls will be updated with data from the new page. So, if any other properties of a control such as BackColor, Enabled, etc. were changed, those properties will not be automatically reset when navigating to a new page. Also, any custom code in the form_load event will not be called when navigating between like page types.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If any changes to the controls' properties were made, manually reset the controls by overriding the LoadData event. 

Similarly, if any custom code was being run in the form_load event, that code should be moved to the LoadData event as well. 

The LoadData event is called every time when navigating to a new page. 


For instance: 

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
   bRetn=base.LoadData(xPage); 
 * 
   if(dcedField1.Enabled=false)
   dcedField1.Enabled=true; 
 * dcedField2.BackColor=Color.White; 
 * 
   //insert other custom code that should be run every time a new page is loaded 
 * return bRetn;
   }
