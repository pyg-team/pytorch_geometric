PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a hang, crash, or out of memory error problem in WebSphere Process Server. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the WebSphere Process Server Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collect the MustGather information for problems with relationships in WebSphere Process Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support helps in understanding the problem and saves time when analyzing the data. You can use ISA Lite [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24020510] to automate this process.



IBM Support Assistant Automated data collectors are available in IBM Support Assistant to improve the accuracy of complete data collection. You can use ISA Lite to automate the gathering of the required log files. 

Note: When you use ISA Lite, also gather a detailed problem description, environment description, and other requested materials.

Manual Collection of Data The collection for these scenarios are identical to those from WebSphere Application Server. Refer to the specific document that matches your scenario: 

Collect troubleshooting data for WebSphere Application Server (main page) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21145599]  * Crash [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?tc=SSEQTP&tc1=SSCYP8L&q=MustGatherDocument] 
 * Hangs/Performance Degradation/High CPU [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?tc=SSEQTP&tc1=SSCMPB9&q=MustGatherDocument] 
 * Out of Memory [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?tc=SSEQTP&tc1=SSCMPCY&q=MustGatherDocument]


Include a written report with observations of what occurred and what data was collected. 

What to do next The following commonly encountered suggestions may resolve the problem:  * Check for available updates Issues are often resolved through available updates. In addition to updates for WebSphere Process Server, review available updates that are available for WebSphere Application Server and for the Javaâ„¢ software development kit (SDK). 
   
   The updates for WebSphere Application Server and the Java SDK are obtained from the WebSphere Application Server support site [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/WebSphere/WebSphere_Application_Server].
   Refer to the document Certified supported software for WebSphere Process Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006205] for hardware and software prerequisites
   Stay current with your maintenance by referring to the document Recommended WebSphere Process Server Fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27006649]. 
   
   
 * Tuning guidance:
   Issues often times end up having solutions in Tuning and Performance. Check that your environment is properly tuned and best practices are followed. Note: IBM Support cannot provide assistance with tuning. Refer to the following Guide specific to your version of the product: WebSphere Business Integration V6.0 Performance Tuning Guide [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/redp4195.html] 
   
   IBM WebSphere Business Process Management V6.1 Performance Tuning Guide [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4431.html] 
   
   IBM WebSphere Business Process Management V6.2 Performance Tuning Guide [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/abstracts/redp4551.html] 
   
   
   WebSphere Business Process Management and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus V7 Performance Tuning [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4664.html]
   
   
   Review the Java Diagnostic Guide [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/diagnosis/] as an additional resource for memory tuning. This is also linked in each of the above guides. 
   
   Review the document Collecting troubleshooting data for performance issues [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269374] for additional information about Performance.
   
   

Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between the different problem types?  * Crash The process for the server exits abruptly. A javacore or other dump file may be generated. 
 * Hang The process for the server continues to run, but is unresponsive, or does not process new work. The System.out log may have messages detecting a thread as hung. This may or may not also exhibit High CPU usage. 
 * Out of Memory An "Out Of Memory" error message is found in the logs or javacore file.
