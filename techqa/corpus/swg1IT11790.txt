APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When running the iib command on AIX, parameters are not passed
   to the mqsi command and hence the command fails.
   
   For example, iib mqsiservice -v
   
   This only runs mqsiservice and does not pass in the parameter
   (-v) to the mqsiservice command.
   
   Parameters are passed correctly on Linux and Windows.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When running the iib command on AIX, parameters are not passed
   to the underlying 'mqsi' command and hence the command fails.
   
   For example, iib mqsiservice -v
   
   This only runs 'mqsiservice' and does not pass in the parameter
   (-v) to the mqsiservice command.
   
   Parameters are passed correctly on Linux and on Windows.
