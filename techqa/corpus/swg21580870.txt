QUESTION
 How do you combine a Hold with an Interview? 

ANSWER
In order to setup a Hold with Interview Notice you will go through the same process as creating a normal Hold Notice. The only change is that you need to add the $interviewurl into the Notice content. One restriction of creating a Hold with Interview Notice is that you are required to check the "Confirmation Required" option. Once you save the Hold Notice you'll see an "Add Virtual Interview" button now displayed next to the "Recipients" button.

When you click on "Add Virtual Interview" you'll be taken to the standard screen where you create an Interview. You can create the Interview questions from scratch or use a pre-existing Interview Template from the Questionnaire tab. The only restriction here is that the choices for Interview Templates include only Templates which have one question set to the type "Confirmation - Select One". This is because Confirmation is required for the Hold with Interview Notice.

Configuring the Recipients and publishing the Hold with Interview Notices is the same as with a regular Hold Notice. The main difference will be with the end Custodian experience. Instead of responding yes or no to the Confirmation question directly in the Hold Notice email, the Custodians will click on a link from the Notice to view the Interview. They will then fill out all the Interview questions including the Confirmation question and submit their responses. Another difference is that the paralegals and attorney will be able to look at the Interview Results to see how people responded to questions and also to see the Confirmation responses to the Hold.
