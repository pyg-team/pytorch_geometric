APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition commands may report an
   agent's status as "unreachable" when the agent status cannot be
   determined from the information currently available on the
   coordination queue manager. This is inaccurate, as these
   commands do not attempt to communicate with the agent, and so do
   not offer any indication of whether the agent is contactable.
   More information on common causes of this situation is available
   in the following technote:
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616381 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616381]

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   The APAR affects all users of WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition
   and all users of WebSphere MQ Managed File Transfer.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The WebSphere MQ Explorer FTE/MFT plug-in and the
   fteShowAgentDetails and fteListAgents commands used to report an
   agent's status as "unreachable" when the agent status could not
   be determined from the information held on the coordination
   queue manager.
   
   This was inaccurate, as these mechanisms did not attempt to
   communicate with the agent, and so were unable to determine if
   the agent could be contacted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product has has been changed to alter the UNREACHABLE state
   to UNKNOWN.
   The previously defined UNKNOWN status has been changed to
   UNDEFINED.
   
   UNKNOWN status now means that agent status updates were not
   received at the expected time intervals by the coordination
   queue manager. The agent might have stopped running due to an
   error, or have been shut down abruptly, or be running but
   experiencing communication problems. If an agent's status is
   shown as UNKNOWN, run the ftePingAgent command to determine if
   the agent can be contacted and is running.
   
   UNDEFINED status means that the agent's status cannot be
   determined. It might have published a status which is not
   recognised.
