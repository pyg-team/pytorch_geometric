ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PMR: 49272,111,000
   
   ESR: We are attempting to update the .ks file on a Websphere
   server
   running the AM for WAS Component.  Here is the command followed
   by the
   error output:
   csctws10:/# /opt/WebSphere4/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java
   com.tivoli.pd.
   jcfg.SvrSslCfg -action replcert -admin_id sec_master -admin_pwd
   ***** -
   cfg_file /opt/WebSphere4/AppServer/java/jre/PdPerm.properties
   Replace application server certificate failed.
   Exception in thread "main"
   com.tivoli.pd.jutil.PDExceptionjava.lang.
   reflect.InvocationTargetException
           at com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.SvrSslCfg.main(SvrSslCfg.java:585)
   java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException:
   com.tivoli.pd.jutil.
   PDException[
   0x1005b38a
   Invalid parameter supplied to API function
   2]
   
   Note that the certificate is not expired, and only happens when
   the certificate was created by "pdwascfg -action config"
   
   the workaround is to use "pdwascfg -action unconfig" and
   "pdwascfg -action config" to create a new key file.
