QUESTION
 What ports are used by IBM Security AppScan Standard? 



ANSWER
AppScan Standard is a desktop standalone application. 

AppScan Standard operates as a traffic proxy on a randomly open port number from the range: 

 * 1025 - 65535 
   You can check the port number of your specific AppScan Standard instance at Tools > Options > Recording Proxy > AppScan proxy port. 
   You can configure a static port number by deselecting option Let AppScan choose the port automatically. 
   
   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988815&amp;aid=1]
   
   You may use this proxy port to record traffic from a third party browser as described in How to record the traffic from an external browser in AppScan Standard [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21287443].



AppScan Standard connects to the following applications: 
 * Target web applications by default accessed on port 80 for HTTP scanning, and on port 443 for HTTPS scanning. However web applications can be accessed on other ports as well, for example 8080 or 8443, via "http://domain:8080/" or "https:/domain:8443/" . 
   
 * License Key Server (if having Floating license keys) on port 27000 and 27001; check port information below *).
   
 * Enterprise Console (if exporting reports or scan configuration to AppScan Enterprise) on port 9443.




*) License Key Server:  * The license Key Server uses by default the 27000 port for the License server manager (lmgrd) and another port from the range 27001 - 27009 for the Vendor process (ibmratl). 
   If you deal with a firewall, we strongly suggest to change the ibmratl port to a static port 27001 as described in What ports to open when License Key Server is behind a firewall [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21454410] and open ports 27000 and 27001 in the firewall.
