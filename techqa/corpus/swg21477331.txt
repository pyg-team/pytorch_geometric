Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have SPSS Base licensed with a Sentinel RMS License Manager and purchased an additional module.
Do I need to re-install all my SPSS clients to be able to use the additional module? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
No, once the license for the new module is in the license file the application will launch with the additional module.
This applies to standalone client licenses as well
