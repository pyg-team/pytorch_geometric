PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error BMXAA6478I -The value for database version (MAXUPG) is not the same as either Last release database build or Current release database build when starting up the Maximo application server and the server fails to start. 

SYMPTOM
The Maximo application server fails to start with Error BMXAA6478I in the System logs.


CAUSE
The causes for this error could be various. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The reasons for this error could be various. One of the reasons are the following :


 In a WebSphere environment where Maximo authentication is done using LDAP , this problem could happen when the LTPA tokens have expired and the WebSphere nodes are out of synch . 

To fix the issue, 
1. Stop Deployment manager 
2. Stop all nodes in cell 
3. Stop all Application Servers in the cell 
4. Delete all old logs, workspace 
WAS_HOME\profiles\dmgr_profileName\logs and 
WAS_HOME\profiles\dmgr_profileName\wstemp directory content. 
5. Copy the ltpa.jceks file from deployment manager 
config/cells/<cellName>/ltpa.jceks file to temp directory and delete 
from path 
6. Start the Deployment manager - it will generate new file ltpa.jceks 
since security is enabled. 
7. Run manual sync using syncNode.bat script: 
eg: C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\ctgAppSrv01\bin 
\syncNode.bat <dmgrHost> <dmgrSoapPort> -username <username> -password 
<password> if security is enabled ( on Windows )

8. Start the nodeagent 
9. Start the appserver - MXServer 

This should refresh the LTPA keys and should get updated across all nodes in the cell.
