APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  As of DB2 V10 certain group buffer pool ( GBP ) statistics are
   recorded as 64 bit numbers. When these numbers get very large
   they may display as negative in the TEP and in the E3270
   display.
   
   In the TEP display entitled ' Group Buffer Pool Statistics Table
    View ' attributes
   GBP Reads No Data sourced from QW0254RD and
   Register Page List Requests sourced from QBGLAX
   may display as negative.
   
   In the E3270 attribute
   Read Miss Diretory Hit Counter is sourced from QW0254RD which is
   used on screens
   KDPGBOP5
   KDPGBPDT
   KDPGBPOL
   KDPGBPO5
   KDPPGBPD

LOCAL FIX
 *  Copy these members from the RKANWENU to the UKANWENU library
   The members are
   KDPGBOP5
   KDPGBPDT
   KDPGBPOL
   KDPGBPO5
   KDPPGBPD
   KDPPGBPO
   In each member find the section of code that begins
   DISPLAYCOLS=
   locate in the DISPLAYCOLS section the following attributes
   QW0254RH,
   QW0254RD'
   Change them to read
   QW0254RH(BKMG),
   QW0254RD(BKMG)'
   Be careful to maintain the punctuation as it existed before
   inserting the display edit mask after the attribute name.

   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Negative data may be displayed in Group *
   *                      Buffer Pool Statistics in TEP and       *
   *                      Enhanced 3270 UI. DB2 messages may end  *
   *                      with many dots in Enhanced 3270 UI.     *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the provided PTF.                      *
   ****************************************************************
   Negative data may be displayed in Group Buffer Pool Statistics
   in TEP and Enhanced 3270 UI when the data is too big. DB2
   messages may end with many dots in Enhanced 3270 UI.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Converted Group Buffer Pool statistics data to K (divided by
   1024) in TEP.  Group Buffer Pool data are expressed in bytes
   to kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, as appropriate in
   Enhanced 3270 UI.  Added logic to remove the dots at end of
   DB2 message in Enhanced 3270 UI.  The following fields in
   Group Buffer Pool statistics under DB2plex node in TEP are
   converted to K (divided by 1024)
   CROSS_INVALIDATE\READS_WITH_DATA (K)
   CROSS_INVALIDATE\READS_NO_DATA (K)
   GBP_READS\WITH_DATA (K)
