RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the Initial heap size and Maximum heap size settings are blank it defaults to a minimum of 50MB and a maximum of 250MB. Changed the settings so the minimum was 2048MB and the maximum was 4096MB Websphere restarted the Websphere server and the sever came back up and was running without any problems. ****Note these settings are not always going to be the same depending on things such as context pool settings these number may need to be different. In this particular case the customer had a context pool setting of 100.
