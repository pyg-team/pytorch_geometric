Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 Samba is supported on IBM i. IBM i has addressed the applicable CVEs. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2017-12163 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12163]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak over SMB1. By sending specially crafted SMB1 data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause portions of server memory contents to be written to a file and obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132351 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132351] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-12151 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12151]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could provide weaker than expected security, caused by the failure to properly sign and encrypt DFS redirects when the max protocol for the original connection is set as ''SMB3''. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to read and alter confidential documents.
CVSS Base Score: 7.4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132350 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132350] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2017-12150 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12150]
DESCRIPTION: Samba could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to require SMB signing in SMB1/2/3 connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to hijack client connections and obtain sensitive information.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132349 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/132349] for the current score
