Title: IBM Custom groups in Query Studio against Netezza display garbage characters. - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Our data source is Netezza. When defining a Custom Group in Query Studio, the query is being generated with a &acirc;€œCast&acirc;€ function asking Netezza to return the group value in an nvarchar format. As a result of this we got back all kinds of funky characters (like music notes). When we change the &acirc;€œCast&acirc;€ function in Report Studio to return varchar instead, we get the correct results. Why is Query Studio casting the custom group names as nvarchar(30)? 

CAUSE
Cognos is a Multi-Lingual environment, so when we create custom groups, the user is able to enter any kind of value. In order to send this information to the database, we need to use NVARCHAR (which supports the unicode UTF-8 codepage). The default installation of Netezza 3.0 drivers installs an ODBC driver that only conforms to the 3.0 ODBC standard. This version of the driver doesn't support unicode code pages.

ENVIRONMENT
Windows server against Netezza database using ODBC driver

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Uninstall the Netezza driver and perform a custom install, ensure that the ODBC 3.5 specification driver is selected
