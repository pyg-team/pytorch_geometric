PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
There are various places where timeouts come into play with TM1, whether it be idle connection timeouts or request timeouts. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here are a couple of the key places where idle timeouts occur, please see attached doc for other place to set timeouts. 

A) To modify the Web session timeout:
1. Edit Web.config. 
2. Locate the following code: 

<!-- SESSION STATE SETTINGS
By default ASP.NET uses cookies to identify which requests belong to a particular session. 
If cookies are not available, a session can be tracked by adding a session identifier to the URL. 
To disable cookies, set sessionState cookieless="true".
-->
<sessionState 
mode="InProc"
stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:42424"
sqlConnectionString="data source=127.0.0.1;Trusted_Connection=yes
cookieless="false" 
timeout="120" 
/>
3. Change the timeout value (in minutes). 
4. Save Web.config. 
5. Log in to TM1 Web. 

This web.config file can be found under c:\inetpub\wwwroot\TM1Web path

B) On TM1 Server
To set a timeout for the TM1 Server :
1. Edit the tm1s.cfg file for that server. 
2. Add the IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds parameter and set to appropriate value. 
This parameter specifies a timeout limit for idle client connections, in seconds. 
For example, if you include the line IdleConnectionTimeOutSeconds=900 in TM1s.cfg, 
the server disconnects idle client connections after 900 seconds
