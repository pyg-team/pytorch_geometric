 FAQ for IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription 

ANSWER
Q. How to I cancel the auto-renewal of my IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription? 
A. Auto-renewal will be available a few days after your subscription starts. Please check back after a few days to change your subscription level. Changes to auto-renewal will take affect at the end of the month long subscription period. 

Q. I have installed the Subscription and when I attempt to login all I get is a big white screen. How do I get my subscription started?
A. The most likely cause of this issue is installation of the 32bit IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription software on a 64bit machine. To fix the issue, please uninstall the 32bit and download and install the 64bit application from your Products & Services window on IBM.com. If you find that this does not resolve your issue, you have a new issue.
