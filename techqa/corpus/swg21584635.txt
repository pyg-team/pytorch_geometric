QUESTION
 Is it possible to disable the username prompt from the Tivoli Integrated Portal stopServer command? 

ANSWER
The following procedure can be used to suppress the login prompt from the stopServer.sh command: 

 1. Make a backup of the following file:
    
    <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/properties/soap.client.props
    
    For example, make a copy of the file:
    
    /export/home/netcool/tip/profiles/TIPProfile/properties/soap.client.props.bak
    
    
 2. Edit the original file as follows:
    
    com.ibm.SOAP.securityEnabled=false <-- set to "true"
    
    com.ibm.SOAP.loginUserid= <-- set to your primary administrative user ID (Usually "tipadmin")
    com.ibm.SOAP.loginPassword= <-- set to the primary administrative user password
    
    
 3. Save the file and verify the stopServer.sh script does not prompt for the admin user credentials
    
    
 4. Optional: The following command can be used to encode the password so it is not in plain text. 
    
    ./PropFilePasswordEncoder.sh <TIP HOME>/profiles/TIPProfile/properties/soap.client.props com.ibm.SOAP.loginPassword
    
    


Note: If the password for the primary administrative user is changed, you'll need to manually update the soap.client.props file to reflect the change. Otherwise, the stopServer.sh command will fail.
