Title: IBM Access for Web 5250 Interface Session URL - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document is written as an example to configure a 5250 session object to obtain or create a URL to provide for client(s) usage. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The objective of this document is to assist you with creating an Access for Web 5250 session to allow a user or group to access a configured session using a specified URL. In this example, we will assume that the Web serving environment and System i Access for Web application has been installed and confirmed tested to work. 

In the screen shots shown below, the following environment was used:

System i Access for Web: v6r1m0 5761XH2

Profiles:

o Admin profile: JRTALAMA
o Test profile: JTTEST (can be a user or group profile, as desired)

Note: These exact steps can be performed using any of our currently supported releases of Access for Web (r6.1, r7.1 and r7.2). The approach also applies to IBM i Mobile Access, though the URLs may be slightly different.

Creating/configure session and Edit Policies:


 * Sign on to Access for Web homepage with administrative profile:

The last bulleted item above, Configured Session to use for Defaults, allows you to control the user or group profile if you only provide a standard URL such as: 
o http:// <system name or ip adddress> :port/webaccess/iWA5250 (without any parameters) 
o if you allow the user/group profile to configure sessions, this allows you to control their session defaults. 

URL Information 

A basic configured 5250 session URL is http:// <systemname or ip address> :port/webaccess/iWA5250. The purpose of this function is to e-mail the URL, link the URL to a custom homepage and/or distribute the URL to allow the user/group profile to access the System i with your configured/assigned 5250 session, configured in the previous section. 

In order for you to direct your clients to the proper configured or assigned 5250 session, you would want to specify the following necessary parameters: o /webaccess/iWA5250 = basic URL o Then you would add session parameters, such as: 

&sessname= (value is the name of the session or shortcut to session.)
?access= (if a shortcut, value is the user profile or group profile that was specified when creating/assigning the shortcut.) o You will end up with something similar to the following URL:

http:// <systemname> :43012/webaccess/iWA5250?access=jttest&sessname=Shortcut%20to%20Working 
?access = in my example above, this is my test profile called: jttest
&sessname = in my example above, this is my shortcut name called: Working

These URLs can be hand typed as above or to prevent typographical errors or confusion with URI parameters. 
Below is another option to obtain the URL and parameters: 
 * Sign on with Access for Web with specified User profile:
   

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] http:// :port/webaccess/iWAHome

 * Select 5250 tab
   

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Select Configured Sessions 
   
   
    1. Select Configured Sessions 
    2. Under the Session column, you should see the 'Shortcut to <name>'. Select the icon/option to Start it.
   
   
   Screen shot of the Configure Sessions, we're seeing the shortcut that was assigned by the admin profile in previous steps. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013204&aid=9] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013204&aid=9] 
   


 * Copy URL for specified session
   

 *  - [http://www.ibm.com/i/c.gif] Copy/paste URL to distribute, link, and so on 
   
   Screen shot of the session created and started. We're using this to get the full URL to use to deploy or send out to user/group profile. [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013204&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013204&aid=10]
