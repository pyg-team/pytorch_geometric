ABSTRACT
 The operating systems and platforms
that are supported for the provisioning server (Version 7.2.2 Interim Fix 2) are listed. 

CONTENT
This technote lists the operating systems and platforms that are supported for 
the provisioning server Version 7.2.2 Interim Fix 2.

Tivoli Provisioning Manager supports specific operating systems and is compatible with other products that are installed together with the base services. Tivoli Provisioning Manager
is installed on the same computer as the application server, or J2EE
server. If you are using a multiserver topology, verify the supported
operating systems and platforms for the software components that you
are installing on each server in the topology.

IBM Software Support provides support for all fix pack levels for the versions and releases that are identified in the tables.


Supported Windows operating systems and platforms

Note: Cygwin 1.7.7 or later is required on the provisioning server.
You can install Cygwin either as part of the Tivoli Provisioning Manager installation
or manually before installing Tivoli Provisioning Manager.
Because Cygwin cannot be installed correctly in a XEN environment,
installation of Tivoli Provisioning Manager in a XEN environment is not supported.
