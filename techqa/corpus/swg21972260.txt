QUESTION
 Is using the ITCAM for AD Managing Server (MS) v7.1.0.4 with RHEL7 supported? 

ANSWER

The Managing Server MS v7.1.0.4 is supported with RHEL7 if using the GUI install with default MS_HOME values or by using the silent install to install the product.

Defect 214904 has been opened for the MS v7.1.0.4 MS_HOME display input variable that cannot be changed on RHEL7. If you use the silent install, this is not an issue or if you use the default values in the GUI, this is not an issue, the product installs just fine on RHEL7.

So.. for now the RHEL7 OS is supported using the silent install or using the default MS_HOME values if using the GUI install.

In addition to RHEL7, we are now supporting Centos 7. However, you might get this pop-up warning during the install, which can be ignored for now.
