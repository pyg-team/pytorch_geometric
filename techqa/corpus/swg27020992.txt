Text:
 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 This technical support document contains significant documentation corrections for the Application Programming Guide for Version 8.4 and later that could affect product configuration. 

CONTENT
Documentation corrections 

Constraints for linking hierarchical items [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmcm150.htm]
In the section "Moving a link," the privilege checking information for the ItemRemoveLink, ItemLinkTo, and ItemLinked privileges is not accurate. These statements should read as follows:
ItemRemoveLink: The privilege checking is on the original source folder to move the document to another folder.
ItemLinkTo: The privilege checking is on the new source folder to verify that the user can link to it.
ItemLinked: The privilege checking is on the target item in a linking relationship.


IBM Content Manager event formats [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmbp030.htm]
IBM Content Manager events used in IBM Case Manager integration [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmce103.htm]
IBM Content Manager event formats for IBM Case Manager integration [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmce104.htm]
For these topics, the documentation should contain the following additional text:

The reindex action is equivalent to moving an item from one item type to another. The reindex item event format, event code 306, is equivalent to the Add to Item Type event that is displayed on the Event Subscriptions page of the Item Type Properties window of the system administration client. The reindex from item event format, event code 311, is equivalent to the Remove from Item Type event that is displayed on the Event Subscriptions page of the Item Type Properties window of the system administration client.


Defining a resource item type [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmcm052.htm]
This topic should contain the following additional text:

If a resource item is enabled for version support and you want to change its attributes in a new version, you must create a copy of its content when you update its attributes.

This documentation problem is resolved in the Version 8.4.3 Application Programming Guide.


Supported document types and conversions in Java viewer toolkit [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmjv028.htm]
The CMBSnowboundEngine engine should be added to the list of supported document types for all three tables (Windows, AIX and Solaris, and Linux) as follows: 

 * MIME type: application/pdf 
 * Engine: CMBSnowboundEngine 
 * Paginated: Yes 
 * With Annotations: Yes 
 * Page Manipulation Supported: No 
 * Converted To: image/png


This documentation problem is resolved in the Version 8.4.3 Application Programming Guide. 

Office support information in Supported document formats [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.administeringcm.doc/gsi00017.htm] 
The Microsoft Office 2010 is supported in Content Manager V8.4.3.3 and the MIME type information in updated in V8.4.3.3 readme. 

Turning on replication for objects that have already been stored [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.administeringcm.doc/mos10013.htm] 
The restriction that appears before the procedure in this topic should read: 

Restriction: This procedure applies only to Content Manager Enterprise Edition and works only for primary objects. It is not possible to tell only from resource manager data if an object is a primary or replica object. You must be able to use some group of attributes to determine which objects you have replicated and which objects are primary objects that have yet to be replicated. 

VWAttachment object [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.programmingcm.doc/dcmbp045.htm] 
The VWAttachment object in the Process Designer format in this topic should read: 

attachmenttype  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Document 
   The value of attachmenttype is 3. 
   VWAttachmentType.ATTACHMENT_TYPE_DOCUMENT 
   You must set the value of attachmenttype to 3 for searchForMany and searchForOne APIs, which can return either folders or documents. 
   
   Folder 
   The value of attachmenttype is 2. 
   The attachmenttype of 2 is not supported by Content Manager for searchForMany and searchForOne APIs. 


searchForMany.  *  
   This attachmenttype of 2 is not supported by IBM Content Manager. These input parameters are not supported by IBM Content Manager Object type, itemIds, and values. 
   
   searchForMany searches for one or more documents or folders in IBM Content Manager. The query for this method is specified in a VWAttachment object. For each library server, the default value for the maximum results that are returned is 50, which can be modified by specifying the queryMaxResultsList option for the IBM Content Manager login module. 
   
   Parameters 
   
   search 
   The VWAttachment object that specifies the search. The following fields in the VWAttachment object must be set: 
   
    * attachmenttype
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 
    *

searchForOne  * This attachmenttype of 2 is not supported by Content Manager. These input parameters are not supported by IBM Content Manager Object type, itemIds, and values. 
   
   searchForOne searches for a document or folder in IBM Content Manager. This method uses a query that is specified in the VWAttachment object. 
   
   Parameters 
   
   search 
   The VWAttachment object that specifies the search. The following fields in the VWAttachment object must be set:  * 
    * attachmenttype
