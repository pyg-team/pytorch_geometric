APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In some cases DataPower will log the following error message in
   the system log:
   
   "Error in stream. Descriptor number unavailable. Additional
   information: Read error (7)"
   
   Once this error occurs, the transaction will be lost
   or corrupted.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It may be possible to eliminate the errors or reduce the error
   frequency by setting the persistent timeouts on HTTP(S) FSHs to
   a value higher than the usual interval between the requests.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected are customers using services with HTTP or HTTPS front
   side handlers processing POST requests over persistent
   connections configured with short persistent connection timeout.
   
   On rare occasions, if the overall duration of a POST request is
   comparable to the persistent connection timeout, the processing
   of a properly received, complete HTTP POST request may be
   aborted, which might result in an incomplete request sent
   to
   the backend. This is accompanied with a confusing error message
   similar to this:
   
   Error in stream. Descriptor number unavailable. Additional
   information: Read error (7) Descriptor is Ok (0)
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix will be available in 4.0.1.16, 4.0.2.12 and 5.0.0.6
