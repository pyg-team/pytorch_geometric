WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You can change the configuration file by the following steps to disable the SSLv3. 

Note: bfinstall is used below to represent the installation directory you have chosen to place Build Forge. 

Procedure:


 1.  Open Build Forge console in browser
     
     
 2.  Go to Administration > Security-SSL
     
     
 3.  Change all the SSL_TLS/SSLv3/SSL to TLSv1 and save
     
     
 4.  Backup the bfclient.conf file  * By default the bfclient.conf is under \bfinstall on Windows 
      * By default the bfclient.conf is under /bfinstall/<platform> on Linux and UNIX
        
        
     
     
 5.  Go to Administration > Security
     
     
 6.  Click Update Master BFClient.conf
     
     Note: The bfclient.conf is used for Communication between Build Forge Service Layer and UI&Engine. It is also used by Build Forge API when you use the secure connection to Build Forge.
     
     
 7.  Stop Build Forge
     
     
 8.  Change the Apache ssl.conf config file  * By default the ssl.conf is under \bfinstall\Apache\Conf\ssl\ on Windows 
      * By default the ssl.conf is under /bfinstall/server/apache/conf/ssl/ on Linux and UNIX
        
        
     
     
 9.  Update the following line for you version of Build Forge  * For Build Forge 7.1.x:
        From: SSLProtocol -ALL +SSLv3 +TLSv1
        To: SSLProtocol -ALL +TLSv1
        
        
      * For Build Forge 8.0.0.x:
        From: SSLProtocol -ALL +SSLv3 +TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2
        To: SSLProtocol -ALL +TLSv1 +TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2
        
        
     
     
 10. Change the Tomcat server.conf config  * By default the server.conf is under \bfinstall\Apache\tomcat\conf\ on Windows 
      * By default the server.conf is under /bfinstall/server/tomcat/conf/ on Linux and UNIX
        
        
     
     
 11. Find the sslProtocol="SSL_TLS" line and change the SSL_TLS to TLS and save
