ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Execution of an IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) Test Suite
   fails with an error  "Deferred Operation failed&#65411;    when it has
   multiple  Execution Variables.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Create a Test Suite with two Test Cases with  Test Scripts.
   2.  Create two or more  'Execution Variables" on the Test Suite.
   3.  Run the Test suite and check the option "Create Result
   without Execution".
   4.  Click finish.
   An error  is reported in the web  "Deferred operation failed".
   
   Firebug shows that  following POST  request  gets  500 Internal
   Server  error :

   ice.rest.ITestSuiteExecutionRecordRestService/execute  (Error
   500 status code)
   
   The response contains an error "The statement was aborted
   because it would have caused a duplicate key value in a unique
   or primary key constraint or unique index identified by
   'VARIABLE_NAM_NM_DX' defined on 'VARIABLE_NAME'."
