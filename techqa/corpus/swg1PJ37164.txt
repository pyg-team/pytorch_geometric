ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Users experience excessive delays during failure recovery of CE
   in a WebLogic managed node cluster
                 2
   Solaris Zones
   WebLogic 9.2 SP3
   8 managed WebLogic nodes (4 managed nodes on each Zone)
   1 cluster for the 8 managed nodes.
   1 Admin server on different server.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   Setup 1 - WcmApiConfig.properties has all the nodes defined:
   Scenarios:
   1.  All nodes running - System works as expected, all nodes are
   connected.
   2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is still available
   on the network - No slow down and system working as normal,
   onlynodes on the running server is connected.
      3.  Disconnect one server from the network (it is hard to
     determine which node WL will go to next, but usually it
   follows the order specified in WcmApiConfig.properties)
    a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes 2-3
   minutes to log on
       b.  next node WL will go to is on the disconnected
   server -    takes 2-3 minutes and gets an error.
   
      Setup 2 - WcmApiConfig.properties has one node on each
   server  defined:
    Scenarios:
          1.  All nodes running - System works as expected, all
   nodes are connected.
     2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is still
   available on the network - No slow down and system working as
   normal, onlynodes on the running server is connected.
       3.  Disconnect one server from the network -
       a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes a
   little less  than a minute to log on
         b.  next node WL will go to is on the disconnected
   server -    takes 2-3 minutes and gets an error.
       4.  All nodes specified in WcmApiConfig.properties is
   down, the rest are up - Destination unreachable error
   
    Setup 3 - WcmApiConfig.properties has all nodes defined.
    In    addition, 4 more dummy nodes are defined (i.e.
   non-existing  nodes but pointing to an existing machine)
     Scenarios:
           1.  All nodes running - System works as expected,
   all available nodes are connected.
         2.  All nodes on one server are down, system is
   still available on the network - No slow down and system working
   as normal, onlynodes on the running server is connected.
          3.  Disconnect one server from the network -
          a.  next node WL will go to is still up - takes
   3-5 minutes to log on
           b.  next node WL will go to is on the
   disconnected server -  takes 3-5 minutes and gets an error.
