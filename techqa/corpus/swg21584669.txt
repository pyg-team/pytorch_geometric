2012-02-06 17:00:03.037+01:00 : STDERR : 
/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2/_uninst/TIPInstall2201/plan/checks/MachinePlan_localhost/000

/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2/_uninst/TIPInstall2201/plan/checks/MachinePlan_localhost/000
01_TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1/TIPInstall_PreCheck-FP1.xml:935:
TIP server is stopped, but other unknown running java process from /opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2 must be shut down. 


CAUSE
More than one Java process is running from the Java install in <TIP Home>/java



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
With the TIP server process shut down, check if other Java processes are running: 


Unix:

Run the following command to list all running Java processes: 

ps -ef | grep java

ps -ef | grep tip


Windows: 

The Windows Task Manager program can show you if other java processes are running. Unfortunately, Task Manager does not indicate which program started the process. Windows Process Explorer is available for download from Microsoft, and can be used to identify which Java processes are running from the TIP Java installation.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Any TIP Java process need to be stopped prior to attempting any fixpack or feature pack install. 

 Once you have stopped these Java processes, please retry the TIP fix pack 2.2.x.x install.
