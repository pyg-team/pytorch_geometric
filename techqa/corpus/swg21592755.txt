PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Some customers may receive a "Content Manager" error when launching Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) from the TIP portal.



SYMPTOM
Customers may receive the following error in the cogserver.log file 

CM-CFG-5065 A Content Manager configuration error was detected while attempting to execute the content initialization script. Content Manager cannot access the configuration file "{File}".; Resource=/WEB-INF/cm/cmMetadata.xml 
CAUSE
There are not enough file descriptors available for TCR to launch this file. 

 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you get this error in the cogserver.log, then you need to check the ulimit to make sure its value is set high enough. Enter "ulimit -a" on the server to see if the value is less than 8192 (maximum per user). 

 

 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the ulimit value returned from the "ulimit -a" is less than 8192, then increase the ulimit for open files to 8192 using the following command: 

 

ulimit -n 8192
