 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Setup.log shows configuration and installation went without errors.

I am working on installing a new instance of C&DS 4.1 on Windows 2003 Server 64bit (Virtual Machine) with JBoss 5.1.0 and Java 1.6 on our Windows 2003 Server. According to the documentation this is a supported configuration, but we are getting the errors when starting the C&DS server. When we switch to JBoss 4.2.1 on the same server, it works fine. Why is C&DS working with Jboss 4.2.x and not with 5.2.0?

CAUSE
The JVM being used is 32bit. The limitation encountered is the memory needing to be occupied must be contiguous. This contiguous requirement exists with 64bit JVM however, the bandwidth of memory management using 64 bit JVM is broader. This allows JVM to better find and occupy requested memory that is open as well as contiguous. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Java 32bit is selected during the setup of C&DS. Remove 32 bit Java 1.6, and reinstalling 64 bit java. Then run setup again for C&DS to resolved the issue.
