Text:
ICR/P -2147418113 ICRP Parascript TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The ICR/P Parascript option gives an error when recognizing a field and the batch aborts. The error text is:

ICR/P error #-2147418113: ICR_P: Incorrect field type, or this field type is not registered in a system. 

CAUSE
Taskmaster cannot locate field type information.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve: 

 1. 1. Edit the registry by adding a new Key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Parascript\FieldScript 3.0 (Parascript should already exist; do not name the key FieldScript 4.0; or FieldScript 4.1). 
 2. Edit the registry by adding a new Key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Parascript\FieldScript 3.0\FieldTypes. 
 3. Edit the registry under the newly created key Field Types by adding a new String Value called Directory. 
 4. Update value of (STRING) Directory to point to C:\Datacap\dcshared\ICRP\FieldScript4.1\FieldTypes 
 5. In Command Prompt (use Run as Administrator to start the program if UAC is enabled) the following command:
    C:\Datacap\dcshared\ICRP\FieldScript4.1\BIN\FieldTypeInstaller.exe /ia
    /d"C:\Datacap\dcshared\ICRP\FieldScript4.1\FieldTypes"


Note: A valid SoftKey must be installed on the machine running ICR/P recognition.
