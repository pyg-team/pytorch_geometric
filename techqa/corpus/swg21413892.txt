Title: IBM Image Services: Oracle user password expires on Oracle version 11g - United States

Text:
image services; oracle; 28002; password; expire TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Oracle 11g creates a more secure configuration than in previous releases of Oracle Database, in which it automatically assigns a default profile called DEFAULT to all users that do not already have a profile assigned explicitly. This default profile requires passwords to be changed every 180 days or the passwords will expire and the user will be locked out of Oracle.

The Oracle 11g default security configuration may be turned on in the following two situations:

Create a database using Oracle Database Configuration Assistance (dbca): choose “Keep the enhanced 11g default security setting” which is the default during creation of a new database; It invokes the new password expiration policy. 

Upgrade a database using Database Upgrade Assistant (dbua) or other tools: choose to upgrade a database from a previous release in which the existing users do not have a profile assigned.

The Oracle 11g default security configuration can be reverted to pre-11g security configuration with either one of the followings:

dbca: During creation of a new database, choose “Revert to pre-11g default security settings” option.

dbca: If the database is already created or upgraded to 11g, run dbca -> Configure Database Options -> Revert to pre-11g default security settings.


SYMPTOM
When a user password is about to expire, IS returns logon error 121,1,28002. 

$oerr ora 28002
28002, 00000, "the password will expire within %s days"
// *Cause: The user's account is about to about to expire and the password
// needs to be changed
// *Action: change the password or contact the DBA
//


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Below are steps to take if Oracle 11g secure configuration is turned on:

Resetting the password before it expires

Use Xapex -> Applications -> Database Server Connect or Xdbconnect to change the password before it expires. 

What to do if the password does expire and IS is locked out of Oracle

In the case where the password does expire, Xdbconnect will not work since it relies on the current password to connect to the database, you need to recreate a new password file.
- Move /fnsw/local/sd/rdbup.bin to a different file,
- Use the following command to create a new password file:
fn_util create_rdbup "f_sw_password" "f_maint_password" "f_sqi_password” "f_open_password"
