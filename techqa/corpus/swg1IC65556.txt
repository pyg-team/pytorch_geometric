ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After generating history charting data for a single day,
   graphing data defaults to three days, causing more data
   generated into the report. the default for absolute time is 3
   days, but if user wants to generate report for only 1 day, then
   the report should be for 1 day, instead of 3 days
   
   Recreation steps:
   one example is to generate Storage Subsystem Performance by
   Volume report, specify 'Display history performance data using
   absolute time' to 1 day. Result will be 3 days of data report

PROBLEM SUMMARY

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Problem:
   Default time range too large in performance graphs
   
   This is a suggestion to change the design of how performance
   graphs are displayed.  Today, we always display a default of 3
   days worth of historical data in the graph, regardless of the
   time ranges that had been entered by the user on the tabular
   report that was used to invoke the graph.  Depending on the
   device, 3 days worth of data can still be a lot, causing the
   report display to be delayed while the DB is queried.  The
   unwanted data clutters the view and forces the user to
   re-enter the same time range parameters a second time.
   
   Feedback on this topic is being reviewed for possible
   inclusion in a later release.  There is no commitment to change.
   
   Update:
   A fix has been provided in TPC 4.2.0 and 4.2.1.
