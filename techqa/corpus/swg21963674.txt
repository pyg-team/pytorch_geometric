Logout; user; session timeout TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How do you set the session timeout at foundation application level in IBM Sterling Selling and Fulfillment? 

CAUSE
Non-admin user are getting auto logged off from GUI after few minutes (2 to 5 minutes) of not using the GUI.

ANSWER
Steps to resolve: 

 1. Modify the timeout details for specific user using the modifyUserHierarchy API. 
    
    
 2. Sample Input XML:
    <User Activateflag="Y" Localecode="en_US_EST" Loginid="USER1"
    OrganizationKey="DEFAULT" Password="USER1" Username="USER1"
    SessionTimeout="8000"></User>
    
    At the Websphere level: 
 3. Login to the WAS console.
    
    
    
 4. Go to the server where the application is installed 
    
    
    
 5. Go to Container Settings - Web Container Settings - Web Container - Session Management -Session Timeout.
    Here set the time to as required. Out of the Box it is set to 30 minutes 
    
    
    
    At the Sterling Application level 
 6. To have a global session timeout value based on web.xml setting you can add the following to your web.xml file: 
    <session-config> 
    <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> 
    </session-config> 
    <context-param> 
    <param-name>scui-suppress-user-level-sessiontimeout-override</param-name> <param-value>Y</param-value> 
    </context-param> 
    
    This is necessary to tell the application to not pick up the session timeout specified for each user in the YFS_USER table, but to pick up the configuredsession-config entry in the web.xml file. 
    This should be done for the web.xml found in theEARFILE/WARFILE/WEB-INF path. So different session timeouts are possible for the various modules. 
    
    NOTE:
    Session timeout value for each user is stored inYFS_USER table. This value overrides the web.xml session timeout setting.
