Title: IBM Max. database connections exceeded - United States

Text:
connections database alerts TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 MaaS 2.4 provides with some alerts when critical events occur. In this article we explain how to temporarily increase the threshold for maximum database connections. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following SQL statement allows to increase the threshold of maximum database connections when run on vpn2 database: 

update config_ui.app_db_details set max_conn=(max_conn+(max_conn*0.3)) where app_name in ('producer','datacopy','payload-upload-server','bulk-consumer')

Note that increasing the max_conn may hide some problems and IBM Support should be involved in the troubleshooting. The SQL statement allows you to alleviate the problem by moving up the threshold.
