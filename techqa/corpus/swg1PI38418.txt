APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have installed SPSS Statistics on a recent Mac OS X release.
   You notice that on launch the product icon bounces several times
   on the Dock before the user interface appears.  Similarly, on
   exit, both the SPSS Statistics menu item and the product icon
   linger long after the user interface has seemingly shutdown.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  This problem is most often associated with orphaned preferences
   hives in the "~/Library/Preferences/com.ibm.spss.plist" file.
   The act of the crashing creates these orphaned preferences hives
   in the .plist.  The problem is exacerbated by using the Force
   Quit option once you've seen startup/shutdown times increasing.
   Using Force Quit is itself a form of "crashing" the product.
   You should avoid doing this.
   
   To 'clean up' the .plist, the simplest solution is to just
   delete it and allow it to be recreated on your next launch of
   the product.  Please see the process in Technote #1640411
   (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21640411) for
   deleting the .plist file.
