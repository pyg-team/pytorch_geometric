PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In IBM速 Rational速 Application Developer, the WebSphere速 Test Environment fails to re-start when Microsoft速 Winsock Proxy Client is running. 

SYMPTOM
WTE can be started in the first startup, however, when restarting WTE, exceptions will be thrown:

[x/y/z 11:33:26:742 CST] 0000000a WsServerImpl E WSVR0009E: Error
occurred during startup com.ibm.ws.exception.RuntimeError: com.ibm.ws.exception.RuntimeError:
org.omg.CORBA.INTERNAL: CREATE_LISTENER_FAILED_4 vmcid: 0x49421000
minor code: 56 completed: No

CAUSE
Microsoft Winsock Proxy Client forwards the packets of WTE to unknown destination and the packets cannot route back to the host machine.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Disabling the Winsock Proxy client with a wspcfg.ini


 1. To prevent WebSphere Test Environment from accessing Winsock Proxy, create a file called wspcfg.ini with the following text in it:
    
    [java]
    Disable=1
    
    
 2. Place the wspcfg.ini file in the same directory as the java.exe executable for WebSphere Test Environment (For example, C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\runtimes\base_v6\java\bin & C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\SDP\6.0\runtimes\base_v6\java\jre\bin ). 
    
    
 3. Restart the machine. If the root issue is caused by Winsock Proxy, WebSphere Test Environment should be able to restart at this stage.
