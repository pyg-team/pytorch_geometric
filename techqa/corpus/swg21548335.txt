PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving 'NullPointerException' error after logging in to the Gentran Integration Suite Dashboard (SCI86904) 

SYMPTOM

CAUSE


Insufficient database space - Transaction log in MS SQL Server is full

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Please see Microsoft's web site for procedures on how to configure and truncate the transaction log. In MS SQL Server, the recovery model determines database transaction logging behavior. When the recovery model is set to FULL (default), everything is sent to the database transaction log and must be explicitly cleared during the backup process. The recovery model can be set to SIMPLE, which allows SQL Server to automatically truncate inactive parts of the database transaction log. This should prevent this condition from happening in the future.
