From the More Actions menu, select the "Work Order Options" and select "Other Organization options".

2. Go to the Cron Task Setup application.

Change the Work Order's status to Approved.

When changing the status to Approved, the system evaluates whether or not the requested Materials are available or not. If the Materials are not available, the status of the Work Order is set to "WMATL".

7. Go back to Work Order Tracking application. Bring up the same work order (e.g. 'MAY1').
