[2/2/YY 8:34:17:679 PST] 000008ab IscTaskProvid E IscTaskProvider provideServerInstallExtentions CWLAA1031E: Exception=org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.commonarchivecore.internal.exception.OpenFailureException: IWAE0037E Could not open /tmp/app3583178992861716215.ear 
CAUSE
It is required to have the same user who starts the J2EE application server to execute the deployment script.


ENVIRONMENT
Linux



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Scenario: 

 * User A is responsible to run the J2EE application server 
 * User B is responsible to execute the deployment script


After User B executed the script, the file "app3583178992861716215.ear" is generated under %tmp% folder and it's permission is set as read and execute only by User B. As a result, the application server is not able to read the file as it's run by User A.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Login as the same user who starts the application server to execute the deployment script.
