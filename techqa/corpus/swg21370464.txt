Title: IBM Parsed whitespace in the IBM Integration Bus or WebSphere Message Broker XMLNSC domain - United States

Text:
xml parser whitespace white space TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) XMLNSC parser claims to not parse whitespace into the message tree but you see parsed whitespace (such as '/n' '/t' or ' ') in your message tree within the XMLNSC domain? 

CAUSE
The input message does not conform to XML specification with regards to empty elements and white space.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
According to specification, an empty element can either be represented as:

<element></element>

or

<element/>


If your message shows an empty element as:

<element>
</element>

then the XMLNSC parser [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ad21074_.htm], as well as XML specification, regard this element as non-empty, containing the new line character '/n'. IIB or WMB then sees this character as valid text for the message. Thus, you will see a '/n' in the message tree for the fieldvalue of this element. Similarly, if the element is indented with either spaces or tabs, those characters will be visible as well.


It should be noted that this structure will cause all non-empty, childless, elements to display whitespace characters, even if it does contain other text, as in the following example:

<element>
value
</element>

This will appear as '/nvalue/n' in an XMLNSC message tree.
