PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Upgrade from earlier Impact versions carries legacy setting in the PolicyLogger properties file 

SYMPTOM
An unexpected error handling Policy is launched when none should be.


CAUSE
The legacy properties, which should be ignored, can cause confusion and have been known to interfere with the desired setting. Generally this is caused through the use of nci_import to bring in an exported configuration from a previous version of Impact.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
FailedEvent DataItems being created unexpectedly and the build-up is impinging upon performance.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the file:





 * 
 * 


look for the two lines: 

 * 
 * 
 * 


Remove the line: 

 * 


so that there is only the line: 

 * 


Making these manual changes to the [ImpactServerName]_ policylogger.props file will require an ImpactServer restart to enable. 

Of course, latterly, one might wish to develop a more active response to errors and there are suggestions on this point in the TechNote "Variables reporting error and Policy name in ExceptionHandler" [ link below]. 

For further information on the reasons for and handling the build-up of FailedEvent DataItems please see the TechNote "Memory growing diskspace used up" [ link below].
