Title: IBM DataPower ethernet ports report a no-link Status - United States

no-link port Ethernet DataPower TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When connected to the network, the IBM DataPower Gateways Ethernet port status reports no-link. 

SYMPTOM
The appliance does not appear to have network connectivity despite being physically connected to the network cables. The CLI commands "show int mode" and "show ethernet" indicate a no-link status.


CAUSE
The no-link status can be caused by any of of the following: 

 * Firmware upgrade using incorrect firmware 
 * Network Switch settings mismatch 
 * HSRP configuration problem

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check each of the following steps to isolate this problem: 

 1. Confirm that there are no hardware issues by running DataPower Ethernet port test [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21307258]. If the Ethernet port test is successful, then the issue is unlikely to involve a failure of the DataPower hardware. 
 2. Try connecting the cable that runs from the DataPower appliance to a different port on the switch. If this test works, then the issue might involve a network configuration issue. 
 3. If connectivity was working before a firmware upgrade, the problem could be caused by using the wrong firmware. Confirm that the correct firmware is being used:http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015333 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27015333]http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631] 
 4. Gather a network packet capture. The packet capture might show some network entity such as a network switch removing the DataPower ethernet port from the network. This type of problem can occur if Rapid Spanning Tree on the network is not configured correctly. The technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21456124] should be useful in identifying if this is problem..

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Depending on the test results, one of the following actions should resolve the problem: 

 * Configure the network switch properly. 
 * Configure Rapid Spanning Tree properly. 
 * Use the correct firmware.
