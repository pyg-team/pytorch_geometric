Title: IBM Characters truncated from the output of the xmllib->XSLT() function, if the string contains UTF-8 2-byte sequences - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Using the xmllib->XSLT() function in an IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) map with UTF-8 strings can result in missing characters and/or string truncation. 

SYMPTOM
Extended (UTF-8 multi-byte) characters missing from the output and/or character truncation of the output string.


CAUSE
The xmllib->XSLT() function command line expects Native character strings, and when passing in UTF-8 strings one potential symptom is missing characters and/or truncation due to an incorrectly calculated data length. This has been identified as a product defect under APAR PI24655

ENVIRONMENT
All IBM WebSphere TX execution methods.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Truncation is resolved by removing the UTF-8 multi-byte characters from the source.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Obtain and apply APAR PI24655 from IBM WebSphere TX Client Support
