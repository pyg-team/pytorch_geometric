PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Tivoli Integrated Portal FP15 failed with "Java 2 security" SECJ0314W exceptions. WebSphere may not have the necessary Java 2 security API's in place, enabling Java 2 security in WAS, may result in WebSphere throwing Java 2 security access control exceptions. 

SYMPTOM
The TIP FP15 silent overall upgrade failed at the Post configuration step.


CAUSE
Java 2 security enabled in WebSphere, which caused the TIP FP install failure, indicated by Java 2 security exceptions in the SystemOut.log file.

ENVIRONMENT
Tivoli Integrated Portal upgrade.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Errors in the TIPFPInstaller-00.log:

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To fix this you have to disable the Java 2 security from the WebSphere Console:

1) Login to WebSphere administrative console

2) Go to "Security" -> "Global security" 

3) Uncheck "Java 2 security"

4) Select "Apply"

5) Retry the TIP FP15 upgrade.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because java 2 security is not necessary for TIP, please do not re-enable this feature.
