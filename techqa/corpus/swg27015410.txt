CONTENT
IBM Content Collector uses log messages to record information about events.




The table includes the log files for the most important IBM Content Collector services. 

Service Location Description Task route service log files Default: ICC-install-directory\ctms\Log Monitors all archiving processes. All errors that occur in any subcomponents are mentioned here, except for errors that occur when crawling a mailbox. Begin viewing these log files to resolve archiving problems in the system.

Back-end log files of the email server connectors Default: ICC-install-directory\ctms\Log\ If the environment variable AFU_NO_SUPPORT_INFO is not set, a subdirectory called "support" is created in the ICC-install-directory\ctms\Log directory that contains information packages listing the email that were involved in error situations. This occurs in addition to the logs that are written to the default directory. 

You can send these packages to IBM Software Support for faster problem determination, however, remember that email in these packages might contain confidential information. 

To avoid generating these support packages, set the environment variable AFU_NO_SUPPORT_INFO to true.

Monitors Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino mailboxes and other collection sources in your email system. Web application log files  * Web application log files default directory: ICC-install-directory\webapplication\afu\logs. The afu-logging.properties file lists the number of log files that are produced and the names of these files created under \logs. 
 * Embedded WebSphere Application Server log files and web application start up errors default directory: ICC-install-directory\webapplication\profiles\<server>logs. 
 * Configuration Web Service log files: If you chose to use the embedded WebSphere Application Server during the web service configuration and want to track processing for troubleshooting purposes, set the environment variable AFU_ADVANCEDEMAILCONFIG to 1. After you have set the variable, you must restart the configuration manager. Setting this variable to 1 will lead to the creation of a log file for each script that runs during the automatic web service configuration, and also logs when the web server is started and stopped. The last configuration you saved is also logged. 
   
   All log files are written to the directory that the TEMP environment variable points to. The following naming convention is used: AdvancedEmailConfig.ConfigName.xml or AdvancedEmailConfig.ConfigName.log
