Title: IBM Collecting tcpdump traces for L2 Support - United States

Text:
tcpdump; bigfix; iptrace TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Support wants tcpdump in binary format. How do I do that? 

ANSWER
the tcpdump is normally in text format. This means it is hard to review with a good trace program. 

The way to format it so it can be reviewed in a program like Wireshark is to use the following syntax :

tcpdump -ni eth0 -s0 -w /var/tmp/capture.pcap

For AIX you can use the following link to see how to collect an iptrace file for the same reason. 

AIX iptrace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21175744] 

1. Start the trace. 

2. Recreate the issue. 

3. Stop the trace 

4. Send in the trace file for L2 Support to review.
