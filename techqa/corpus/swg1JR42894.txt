ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After applying APAR JR42280 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42280], an output text box in a coach does
   not display HTML formatting.  For example, if <b> and </b> tags
   are used to specify bold text, the actual tags are rendered in
   the coach.  The expected result is that the formatting
   specified by the tags will be displayed instead of the tags
   themselves.

   Apply the fix for JR42894 which is available from Fix Central.
   JR42894 makes changes to escape JavaScript and HTML
   configurable
   for an output text box.  An "Escape HTML And JavaScript Code"
   check box has been added to Properties > Presentation section
   in
   Process Designer for an output text box.  Checking the "Escape
   HTML And JavaScript code" check box will result in escaped
   JavaScript and HTML in the output text box.  The default
   setting
   for an output text box is to not escape content, so explicitly
   checking the "Escape HTML And JavaScript Code" check box should
   be used when content displayed is based on input that is not
   tightly controlled by the application itself; this will prevent
   unintended JavaScript from being executed.  In cases where the
   output text box is being used to display HTML, then the "Escape
   HTML And JavaScript Code" check box can be unchecked so that
   HTML formatting will render in the output text box.  To limit
   the possibility of unintended JavaScript execution when
   unchecking the "Escape HTML And JavaScript Code" check box,
   care
   should be taken that the application tightly controls what will
   be displayed in the output text box.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The fix for JR42894 is available on Fix Central for the
   7.5.1.0 level of IBM Business Process Manager.
   
   The JR42894 package available on Fix Central has two parts,
   one for the runtime (supporting Process Server and Process
   Center profiles) and one for Process Designer.  The file for
   the runtime has "BPM" in the name and the file for Process
   Designer has "BPMPD" in the name.  If the runtime fix is
   applied to an environment that supports Process Center, then
   the Process Designer fix (with "BPMPD" in the name) needs to
   be applied to every Process Designer that connects to that
   Process Center, otherwise there will be a version mismatch.
   
   
   7.5.1.0 prerequisite information and installation order:
   
   Please note that JR42576 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42576] and JR42765 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42765] are server prerequisite
   interim fixes fo rJR42894.  The Process Designer JR42894
   interim fix does not have prerequisites.
   
   Following is the interim fix installation order: JR42012 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42012],
   JR42280 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42280], JR42220 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42220], JR42232 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42232], JR42330 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42330], JR42342 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42342], JR42576 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42576], JR42331,
   JR42452 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42452], JR42765 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR42765], and JR42894.
   
   
   Installation instructions for 7.5.1.0:
   
   To install the JR42894 interim fix, follow these steps.
   1.  Backup the BPM and Performance Data Warehouse databases.
   2.  Backup a stand-alone profile or all profiles in a network
   deployment environment.  The "backupConfig" command can be
   used to backup a profile.  See the following documentation
   section:
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/ [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/]
   com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rxml_backupcon
   fig.html
   3.  Stop a stand-alone server or network deployment
   environment before applying any fix.
   4.  Install the JR42894 runtime and Process Designer interim
   fix packages using IBM Installation Manager.  Prerequisite
   fixes and other fixes in the installation order can be
   installed at the same time as JR42894.
   5.  Upgrade profiles:
   - For a stand-alone environment, follow step two in this
   section:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c
   om.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_errors.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_errors.html]
   - For a network deployment environment, follow step three in
   this section for each cluster:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c
   om.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_nd_clusters.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_upgrading_bpm_nd_clusters.html]
   6.  Run the upgrade_7x command to update the database by
   following step one in this section:
   http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r5m1/topic/c]
   om.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/upgrade/topic/upgrading_existing_dbs_751.ht
   ml
   7.  Start the stand-alone server or network deployment
   environment.
