LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Enable self-decribing agnet (SDA) support for Dashboard Data
   Provider.
   
   
   The Dashboard Data Provider installed with the Tivoli Enterprise
   Portal Server required a restart before recognizing new support
   files were installed via the Self Describing Agent feature of
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring.
   
   This enhancement enables the data provider to automatically pick
   up the new application support files without requiring a restart
   of the portal server.
