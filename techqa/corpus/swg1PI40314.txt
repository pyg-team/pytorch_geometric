   Sign-On (SSO) in WAB with ADFS/TFIM as IDP.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None available.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  WAB will provide SAML based SSO configuration as described
   below:
   
   - Designed for IdP initiated SAML. Only Active Directory
   Federation Services (ADFS) and IBM Tivoli Federated Identity
   Manager(TFIM) are the supported IdPs.
   
   - Uses Web SSO Profile for message exchange sequence. Similar to
   how the SAML interaction will happen through a browser with a
   known IdP and Service Provider (SP).
   
   - Requires both IdP and SP to use HTTP POST bindings. HTTP
   Outbound auto-submits HTML forms containing SAML responses.
   
   - SP and IdP must be trusted parties for each other. SP should
   have the public key corresponding to IdP?s private key.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This feature has been integrated into the WebSphere Portal & WCM
   Combined Cumulative Fix 06 (PI36060 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI36060]) for Portal 8.5.0.0
