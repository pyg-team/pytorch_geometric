APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A DataPower 9235 appliance may be restarted by its hardware
   watchdog due to a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)
   communications loss.   This also rarely causes a failure to
   restart successfully.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If a failure to restart occurs, the appliance needs to be
   manually power cycled by removing and then replacing the power
   cords.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This APAR resolves the situation where the 9235 appliance may
   lose communications to the Baseboard Management Controller
   (BMC).   This APAR delivers BMC version .29.
   
   To check if your system may be susceptible to this issue check
   the output of these commands:
   config
   service show component-firmware
   
   If the BMC version listed is below 0.29 we highly recommend
   upgrading to install the fix
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 3.8.1.20, 3.8.2.11, 4.0.1.8, and 4.0.2.4
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  When a hang condition is experienced, powering down and then
   back up will recover from this condition.
