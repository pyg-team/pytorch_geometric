PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Before you reinstall IBM WebSphere Integration Developer, verify that the uninstallation of IBM Installation Manager, WebSphere Integration Developer, and WebSphere Process Server Unit Test Environment is clean. 

SYMPTOM
Installation failed


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This technote assumes that you uninstalled IBM Installation Manager, IBM WebSphere Integration Developer, and WebSphere Process Server Unit Test Environment. If you did not uninstalled one of these products, for example IBM Installation Manager, then these verification steps do not apply.

When the uninstallation does not complete successfully, complete the following steps. An uninstallation that is not clean might cause problems (such as a phantom agent profile error [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v6r2mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.btools.help.monitor.admin.doc/trouble/toolkit_install_error.html]) when you try to reinstall these products.



Step 1: Installation Manager 
To uninstall Installation Manager and delete leftover directories or files, complete the following steps:  1. Uninstall the package group (WebSphere Integration Developer and WebSphere Process Server) and Installation Manager.
    
    
 2. Verify that the Installation Manager application data directory (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\IBM\Installation Manager) and the IBM Installation Manager directory have been removed. If they still exist, delete the directories.
    
    Note: If you used Installation Manager to install other products, do not delete this directory or you will lose the other product binaries. This step applies if you installed only WebSphere Integration Developer.
    
    
 3. Verify that the user-specific Installation Manager application data directory (C:\Documents and Settings\Username\IBM\InstallationManagerInstaller) has been removed. If it still exists, delete the directory.
    
    
 4. Delete the contents of the user temp directory (C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp). To determine the location of the temp directory, access the properties of My Computer, select the Advanced tab, and then click Environment Variables.


Step 2: WebSphere Integration Developer 
To delete directories or files that still exist after you uninstalled WebSphere Integration Developer, complete the following steps: 
 1. Delete your WebSphere Integration Developer home directory, for example:
    
    C:\Program Files\IBM\WID62 
    
 2. Delete the shared plug-in directory, for example:
    
    C:\Program Files\SDP70Shared\ 
    

Note: If you used Installation Manager to install other products, do not delete the plug-in directory or you will lose the other product binaries. Step 2 only applies if you installed only WebSphere Integration Developer. 

Step 3: WebSphere Process Server Unit Test Environment 
Follow the procedure in Preparing for reinstallation after a failed uninstallation on Windows systems [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v6r1mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.wps.610.doc/doc/tins_uninstall_windows.html].
