   The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load
   localization
   files!!
   One or more following problems may caused the failure
   
   Your sybase home directory is /opt/netcool/platform/solaris2.
   Check the
   environment variableSYBASE if it is not the one you want!
   Cannot access file
   /opt/netcool/platform/solaris2/locales/locales.dat
   SNMP_GATE: Fatal Error: Failed to allocate server context
   
   [2]+  Exit 4                  $OMNIHOME/bin/nco_g_snmp -name
   SNMP_GATE
   [netcool]$
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  - rename /opt/netcool/platform/solaris2/charsets and make a
   relative
   symbolic link to $OMNIHOME/platform/solaris2/syb12/charsets;
   - rename /opt/netcool/platform/solaris2/locales and make a
   relative
   symbolic link to $OMNIHOME/platform/solaris2/syb12/locales;
   
   Whith these the Gateway can start and looks like works
   fine in 7.2.1
