QUESTION
 Why is the status showing 'Error' when it should show 'Running'? 

ANSWER
ITCAM 7.1.0.3.x HTTP Server Agent Web Site status workspace in the TEPS for SSL enabled web servers showing as ‘error’, when in fact they are running.
For example, 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968181&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968181&aid=1] 

In the Web Server logs, similar errors to below will be shown,

What can be done to resolve the Web Site Status showing ‘Error’? 

 

Solution: 

The reason the Web Site status shows error is due to ITCAM APAR PM28013, which was addressed via 

http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM28013 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM28013] 

After applying the fix or if the fix is already present, you must do the following. 

Reconfigure the HTTP Server Agent and set the following to “ENABLED” 

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968181&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968181&aid=2] 

 

After making the configuration change, restart the Web Server and Agent.
