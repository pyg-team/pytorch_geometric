PROBLEM
Connections Survey's fails to load while creating a new Survey, spinning icon displays instead of loading the add questions page.

CAUSE
If the Connections server is configured to force traffic to use SSL, then the Survey properties files should contain a secure url to the servers instead of using http.

ENVIRONMENT
Connections 5.5 with Surveys installed

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM

com.ibm.CORBA.iiop.ServerDelegate.dispatch:526 ORB FFDC
00000206 SSLHandshakeE E SSLC0008E:
Unable to initialize SSL connection. Unauthorized access was denied or
security settings have expired. Exception is
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext
connection?
at com.ibm.jsse2.d.a(d.java:46)

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Changing the url in the Connections_config.properties to use SSL helped to resolve the issue.





Open the properties files located in example (linux): /opt/ibm/Forms/extensions, 

change the url to the Communities server from:
ibm.nitro.integrations.connections.Config.communityRoot=http://server
to:
ibm.nitro.integrations.connections.Config.communityRoot=https://server


Also change the url in the Builder_config.properties, if enabled to: 

 ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI = https://server
