APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After upgrading to IBM Content Navigator V3.0.3.x, when using
   the Default theme, the Entry Template date field values are
   grayed out in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox but not in
   Microsoft Internet Explorer. This does not happen with the
   Classic theme.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use Chrome or Firefox
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Using Microsoft Internet Explorer with the default theme
   enabled in ICN, the placeholder example text that displays on
   date properties displays in a dark color like property values,
   instead of light gray.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With this fix, Internet Explorer displays the date placeholder
   text in gray.
