PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In Executive Viewer an admin user is unable to copy/paste from Local Views to Shared Views. When moving to the Shared Views, other than Open View, all other options are grayed out. 

CAUSE
Item Policy is set correctly for the user (with appropriate admin role) at the correct item level, but System Policy is not set correctly.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Set the user to the appropriate admin role in System Policy. This should provide the correct permissions required to manipulate the Shared Views.
