APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you create an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) deployment
   environment (DE) by using a Microsoft SQL Server database and
   the database user name or schema name is not a regular
   identifier according to the Microsoft Database Identifiers page
   (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175874.aspx), the
   SQL file execution fails with an error like the following error
   (the invalid character in this example is '-'):
   
   com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException
   Syntax error near '-'
   
   This limitation is not documented.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard
   IBM BPM Express
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  use DB username without the '-'
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The database user name and schema name are not quoted in the
   generated SQL files for Microsoft SQL Server. Because IBM BPM
   does not support database schema names that are not a regular
   Microsoft Database Identifiers, running the SQL file fails when
   the user name or schema name contains special characters like
   the hyphen (-). This information is not documented.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The "Configuration properties for the BPMConfig command"
   (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.6/com.ibm
   .wbpm.ref.doc/topics/samplecfgprops.html?lang=en) topic will be
   updated the next time the documentation is refreshed.
   
   A fix will be available in a later release that ensures during
   initial configuration properties file validation that database
   schema names are valid, instead of failing later when the
   generated SQL files run.
