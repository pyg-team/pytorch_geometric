Title: IBM Old IBM FileNet Content Services sessions are not being removed as expected - United States

Text:
oracle inactive sessions TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Content Services sessions should be removed once they have no corresponding active database connection. On a Content Services system running on Oracle, these sessions are not being removed. 

SYMPTOM
The SESSIONTAB table or the Sessions section of the CS Explorer administration tool, will show old sessions that are no longer active.


CAUSE
The Content Services Storage Manager requires certain stored procedures to be available to complete the process of removing inactive sessions. Sometimes when a tablespace is imported into a new database instance, Oracle will not properly compile all the stored procedures.

ENVIRONMENT
Oracle database

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using Oracle's administrative tools, check to see if all of the Content Services stored procedures have compiled properly. Recompile the stored procedures that have a status of INVALID. In Enterprise Manager, this can be done by simply right clicking on the procedure and selecting Recompile.
