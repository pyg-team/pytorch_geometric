ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem following the RAD 6 Tutorial: Create and deploy the
   Temperature
    Conversion Web service from an enterprise Java bean using the
   SOAP/JMS
   transport method and WebSphere v6 run-time environment.
   When defining a reply queue, the tutorial states that you can
   use any
   name. Quote from tutorial:
   
   1. Create a queue connection factory for the reply queue:
   
   2. Go to Resources > JMS Providers > Default Messaging.
   
   3. Under JMS queue connection factory click New and enter a name
   (for
   example WebServicesReply_QCF) and a JNDI name (for example
   
   jms/WebServicesReplyQCF).
   
   4. Select the bus created earlier (WS_tutorial_Bus) as the bus
   name and
   click OK and save the changes.
   
   However, It turns out that if you use any name other than
   
   WebServicesReply_QCF it will not work.
   
   This used to be the case in WebSphere 5.1 that you could only
   use this
   exact name. According to the documentation for WebSphere 6.0 it
   says
   that you are allowed to use any name you like. However, I think
   this is
   incorrect because
   
   if you do change it it will fail.

   bm.etools.webservice.was.creation.ejb.ui.doc/tasks/tjmsserv.html
   
   The solution (if you want to use your own defined name) is to
   change the
   reference alias in the JMSServiceRouter deployment descriptor.
   This
   reference is setup by the SOAP/JMS web service generator
   wizards. Thus
   if you decide to use a different JNDI name you have to go into
   this
   project and override the default setting.
   
   So I believe the conclusion is that the documentation for both
   the
   tutorial and websphere for generating SOAP/JMS is incomplete and
   
   inaccurate.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The tutorial describing how to create a JMS server for a Web
   ser
   vice created in Rational Application Developer does not
   explicit
   ly state that the JMS queue connection factory must
   be named Web
   ServicesReply_QCF.
   The tutorial and the accompanying documentat
   ion now make
   this restriction more clear.
