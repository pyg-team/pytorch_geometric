QUESTION
 Why can't I see any policy violations in QRadar logs from Guardium Data Encryption?

I'm sending syslog to QRadar. I have configured: 
- Syslog enabled, it's checked. 
- DSM to send Syslog to QRadar. 
- Agent send Syslog to QRadar. 

The result is that I can only see login and logouts into Guardium Data Encryption in Qradar log activity. I can see nothing about policy check results / policy violations in QRadar. 

ANSWER
You don't get any policy violations sent from Guardium Data Encryption unless you configure secadmin user to log to syslog and to QRadar.
You need to configure both admin user and secadmin user to log to syslog and to QRadar to get all logs.

Policy check results / policy exceptions come from secadmin user.
Admin events, like login to DSM, come from admin user.
