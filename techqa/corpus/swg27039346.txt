When you use IBM Installation Manager and attempt to install the product on the Solaris operating system, you see a custom panel with a text field that says "Group name:" When you enter a valid group name such as root or adm, the user interface displays an "Invalid group name" error and the Next button is disabled. You cannot proceed with the installation.

Uninstalling IBM Worklight or IBM Mobile Foundation while the Worklight server is running does not always work properly (1598141) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21598141]
The uninstall process for the product succeeds. However, it does not stop the potentially running application server and cleanup all the related files. If you attempt a new installation, it fails to install into the default directory because the installation process considers that directory in use.
Version: 5.0

Installing IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation with Installation Manager into a pre-existing application server displays an empty combination box (1598143) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21598143]
When you use the option to install into a pre-existing WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, an empty combination box might be displayed for the "server name" field and then you cannot proceed. The combination box lists the existing servers.

With IBM Worklight or IBM Mobile Foundation, the Worklight Studio installation on Eclipse might fail if you use Oracle Java 7 (1598196) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21598196]
If you use Oracle Java 7 and attempt to install IBM Worklight Studio by using the Eclipse P2 Update sites with Eclipse 3.6.2 or 3.7.2, the installation process might freeze (loop or wait forever).
Version: 5.0

P2 (Eclipse Update) cannot be installed using a Java 7 JVM with IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation (1598218) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21598218]
You might notice that repeated attempts to download plugins eventually fail. A dialog box opens and indicates that an error occurred while collection items are being installed.
Version: 5.0

Unable to install Worklight Server with "Architecture Selection" set to "64-bit" on Windows 64-bit platform (1599913) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599913]
When installing the Worklight Server component using IBM Installation Manager on a Windows 64-bit platform, the dialog "Install Packages" prompts for the architecture selection, which can be either "32-bit" or "64-bit". By default the option is set to "32-bit" but when it is switched to "64-bit", a message similar to the following will appear: "The 32-bit IBM Worklight Server for IBM Mobile Foundation Enterprise Edition package cannot be installed in a 64-bit package group." Additionally, the "Next" button to advance with the install process is disabled, which prevents the installation from continuing. 
Version: 5.0

During installation on UNIX-based operating systems, unable to choose the operating system user group (1599918) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21599918]
During installation on UNIX-based operating systems, the installer asks you to enter the operating system user group, but the possible choices are not clear. This scenario results in the inability to complete the installation.
Version: 5.0

Worklight Server Installation fails because the installation directory is not empty (1600021) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600021]
When a new installation begins and points to the same location, IBM Installation Manager detects files that are left over from the previous installation, trigger an error about the directory not being empty, and the installation won't proceed. This problem is caused by a previous installation not removing all the files during the uninstall process. It might be just a single backup file, but could also be files related to the database being used. 
Version: 5.0

Unable to install IBM Worklight on the HP-UX platform with Installation Manager (1600741) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600741]
There are several forms of installation for IBM Worklight. The Worklight Studio component has an option of installing as an Eclipse Update (P2) install, but it can also be installed with IBM Installation Manager. The Worklight Server component, however, does not involve Eclipse and is limited to the single IBM Installation Manager option. The problem is specific to the installation of both components using IBM Installation Manager. This installation does not work due to a file naming issue that is specific to the install images for HP-UX. Specifically, the files display with "8+3" names (for example repository.config displays as reposito.con), and this change prevents Installation Manager from working correctly. 
Version: 5.0

IBM Worklight Server Installation Blocked with DB2 Errors (1634901) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21634901]
The IBM Worklight Server installer attempts to ensure that specific databases exist. If the database is present, but access to the database produces an error, the Worklight Server installer blocks the "Next" button. This scenario prevents the user from moving forward to complete the installation.
