APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  TADDM 7.2.1 Installer does not prompt for the correct level of
   Oracle JDBC driver.  For a fresh install, the GUI presents a
   prompt that asks user for the location of ojdbc14.jar, which
   does not work with Oracle 11 and TADDM  7.2.1.
   
   For the fresh install, the installer window that prompts for the
   Oracle driver should be changed to something that says "Specify
   the path to the correct Oracle JDBC Driver used by your Oracle
   database"   There should be help text adding that the jars are
   different for Oracle 10 to 11, or it could point to the Install
   guide which lists the JDBC drivers needed for Oracle 10 and 11.
   
   For an upgrade install, the problem is complicated by the fact
   that the older Oracle 10 JDBC driver may have worked for Oracle
   11 on 7.2, but now does not work on 7.2.1.  So, there needs to
   be a prompt and some kind of check performed of the Oracle
   driver level, to make sure it is correct for the level of Oracle
   database.  If an automated check is not feasible, then a warning
   screen with advice on which JDBC driver levels are needed for
   Oracle 10 and 11.
   
   This is a high severity defect because the upgrade installer
   will run successfully, even with a  back level Oracle JDBC
   driver, and user will not see any problems for a while.  When
   problems occur, it is very difficult to diagnose back to the
   root cause of incorrect JDBC driver level.
   
   
   
   
   The following information should be gathered to help determine
   if this defect is the cause of the issue:
   
   output from ls -lR of dist/  directory
   
   the following sqlplus command will provide the exact db version:
   select * from v$version;
   
   output ls -l $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib from Oracle database server
   (jdbc driver will be compared to that installed on TADDM)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use the same jdbc driver as found on the Oracle Server under
   $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Release 7.2.1 installer prompts user for path to Oracle JDBC
   driver, and specifies the name of the driver file: ojdbc14.jar.
   The named JDBC driver file is only appropriate for Oracle 10.
   For Oracle 11, ojdbc5.jar should be used.
   
   The installer has been changed to prompt user for "the path to
   the Oracle JDBC Driver used by your Oracle database."
   
   Please refer to Install Guide for instructions describing which
   JDBC driver to use with an Oracle database.

   Appropriate Oracle JDBC drivers can be copied to the TADDM
   server from the Oracle server in path $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib.
