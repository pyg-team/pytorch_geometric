APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The process size of an execution group, containing message
   flows with SOAPInput nodes and additional instances defined,
   continues to grow over time. The process size grows slowly when
   the load on the flows is varied, causing the additional
   instances to end during idle periods.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker using the SOAPInput or the
   SOAPAsyncResponse nodes.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The process size of an execution group, containing message flows
   with SOAPInput or SOAPAsyncResponse nodes and additional
   instances defined, continues to grow over time. The process size
   grows slowly when the load on the flows is varied, causing the
   additional instances to end during idle periods. When an
   additional instance thread ends, the memory used to store the
   HTTP headers is not being freed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere Message Broker has been modified to free the memory
   used to store the HTTP headers when additional instance
   threads end.
