Title: IBM No remote communication with BMC after power outage - United States

Text:
Power Systems bmc MAC address IP 8335 8348 GCA GTA 21C S822LC S812LC network connectivity TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 8335-GCA/GTA and 8348-21C after an unplanned power outage remote communication is lost to the BMC of the systems. 

SYMPTOM
On 8335-GCA/GTA and 8348-21C systems it has been seen that after an unplanned power outage remote communication is lost to the BMC of the system. The system will boot if you push the power button. There will be no remote access to the BMC either by ping or ipmitool. 


CAUSE
Unplanned power outage.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
When encountering this problem you will need to connect directly to the BMC via VGA monitor and USB keyboard. Use the Petitboot Bootloader interface to verify that your IP settings are correct. In rare cases we have seen that the system BMC MAC Address has been cleared out with the rest of the IP settings. This field will need special commands in order to rewrite it back. 

Follow these steps to connect to Petitboot Bootloader: 

 1. Power on your server using the power button on the front of your system. Your system will power on to the Petitboot bootloader menu.
    
 2. At the Petitboot bootloader main menu, select Exit to Shell.

     * this process takes about 1 - 2 minutes to complete. 
     * do not walk away from your system! 
     * when Petitboot loads, your monitor will become active and you will need to push any key in order to interrupt the boot process.
       
    
    
 3. Run the command
    
    ipmitool lan print 1


> ipmitool lan print 1

If the IP address data is all zeros (0.0.0.0) including the system MAC Address (00:00:00:00:00:00) you will need to retrieve the MAC address information from the label on the system backplane.
