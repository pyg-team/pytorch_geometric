Q&A 
Q: Do the managed settings require Sametime 8.5x? Or will some of them work in 8.02? 

A: Sametime 8.5.x is required. There is a hotfix available to make them work with 8.0.2. For policies, it also requires Domino 8.5x to see all of the feature/options. 




Q: Are the managed settings for the sametime stand alone client or the "embedded" one as well? 

A: Both clients support managed settings ,embedded AND stand alone. If you have the hotfix, you can apply them to the 8.0.2 embedded client as well. 




Q: What is the difference between managed-settings.xml and managed-community-configs.xml? 

A: The managed community settings is for community server type settings such as the Sametime server name. The managed settings.xml is for preferences. Examples of both are shown later in the slide presentation, available here: 
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27027054 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27027054] 

Managed-community-configs.xml is used to update and manage community configuration settings (such as host name) for the deployed user base. 
Managed-settings.xml is used to update and control client preferences for the deployed user base. Adding community configuration settings (such as host, loginAtStartup, and loginAtStartup) to the managed-settings.xml file will not have any impact. Only the managed-community-configs.xml file can be used to update the community settings of the deployed user base. 




Q: Can you use a domino desktop policy to define meeting server ip and port info? 

A: Yes, but you have to use the "custom" capability of Notes Managed Settings Also, if there is a collision between the base meeting server host name and an existing Notes key, there are details in the wiki on the exact keys that are necessary: 
http://www.lotus.com/ldd/stwiki.nsf/dx/Meeting_preferences_st852ifr1 [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/stwiki.nsf/dx/Meeting_preferences_st852ifr1] 

If it looks like only the new "meetingServerHostName" is listed, that is correct. 




Q: Can we use managed community file in ST 8.02 if we install a hotfix? 

A: Yes, the hotfix you need is CREH-8HNSQV. Then you can modify the managed-community-configs.xml. 
You will need to open a PMR and request the Hotfix from Lotus Support. 




Q: Can the managed-settings.xml exist on a server running https? 

A: Yes, you would need to make sure the login is saved on the client so the xml file is accessible without additional login. 




Q: Can you use the managed settings to change users on a user by user basis? 

A: Yes, if you assign specific users to different groups in ssc. 




Q: What is the preferred method for migrating contacts to a new Community in a new Domino Domain? 

A: If the directory is not changing then all you need is to point users to new community 




Q: It would be great if any client debugging setting could be enabled remotely for clients using managed-settings.xml. I don't think many customers will like the idea of having another server just for managed settings files. Sometimes you want to change the level of debug on one client, right now you need to visit that client to change it. It would be nice if that could be controlled with a setting administered centrally. 

A: A quick way to get a user to enable debug setting in the ISA tool is Help -> Support -> collect support data -> check the box "Enable customized tracing" -> select "Managed settings". This also could be used to turn off the debug remotely when completed. 




Q: Can we turn off the http GET after a certain period (like say 2 months) to prevent the traffic hit? 

A: Yes, if you think all users have the settings, then you can also remove the URL reference from the community configuration. 




Q: Is it ok to use managed-settings.xml to set preferences for 3rd party applications and any other plugins that are not from IBM? 

A: Yes, managed settings is just an Expeditor platform capability extended to Sametime. The same would apply to any 3rd party plugin. 




Q: Where can I change the ST notification status messages? 

A: In the community-config.xml file locally. 




Q: Managed community, where do you point to that? 

A: In the same location as the managed-settings.xml document, sametime policy elements update a URL to point to a location. If I install a third party plugin in the Sametime Client, can managed settings be used to manage these as well? 

A: Yes, it can be used for any plugin as long as the syntax is correct 




Q: Managed settings are working fine, I can control some options, but I cannot overwrite values set by user. 

A: Add isLocked=true attribute on the setting 
Managed Settings: preference settings keep returning back each restarting - Hotfix # CDLL-8MYA7F 




Q: Mobile client for ST has a requirement for proxy server, and a java requirement for full feature. Do the users need to be licensed for websphere stProxy server just to test the feature on their iPhones? 

A: Run the web browser client, which is a non-native client. You need the proxy server to point mobile devices to the server. 




Q: Are any Managed settings.xml pushout available in Smartcloud deployment of ST? 

A: Not on individual level 




Q: You can go to one place to find Notes.INI parameters, Is there something in the works where we have a comprehensive list of new INI settings for customization.INI? 

A: http://www.lotus.com/ldd/stwiki.nsf/dx/Sametime_client_preferences_st852 [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/stwiki.nsf/dx/Sametime_client_preferences_st852] 
also available on last slide of presentation 




Q: On the Wiki, the link for managed settings.xml does not go to the document that it is linked to. We would like to see a spreadsheet with settings or a database of XML settings. 

A: Good suggestion!
