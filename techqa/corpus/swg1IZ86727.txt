ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When shown in a list view, URL attachments names (the DOCUMENT
   attribute) greater than 40 characters wrap and are no longer
   hyper links.  I will add two URL attachments both with the same
   URL.  The first has a long name the second a short.  As you see
   when I go to view attachments the long version is not a hyper
   link.
   
   I know the setting for the number of characters to wrap on can
   be increased but the problem with that is that it is a global
   setting and would cause ALL the list views to get wider which we
   do not want since many of our users are in AFG with limited
   screen resolutions/real-estate.   Also, who is to say someone
   wont add a URL with a name greater than that size.  Is there a
   means via the screen XML (or other) to tell it not to wrap for a
   given column?
