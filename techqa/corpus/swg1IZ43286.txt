APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Pasted below L3 mail refrence for the Doc APAR...
   
   
   Customer used old version of metrica probe with Omnibus 7.0 on
   Solaris 8
   He will upgrade his system to Solaris 10 and Netcool Omnibus
   7.2.1 and
   is request a version of Metrica probe that will work for his new
   system.
   Netcool Omnibus 7.2.x use Sybase 15 but old versions of probes
   use
   Sybase 12 and they are not compatible.
   
   In order to resolve this issue we rebuilt the probe and provided
   the patch as a concessions to the customer.
   In order to GA it, Rajesh advised on releasing as part of the
   flex removal project but as Anand confirms that it was not
   tested from past 3 years that indicates that after the bluewash
   it was never tested.
   
   So, now we should have a GA test cycle planned to release this
   probe as we cannot release this as part of the flex project as
   it was never tested.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Following details will be added to the IBM Tivoli
   Netcool/OMNIbus Probe for Metrica Reference Guide:
   
   1. Support of the probe for Solaris 10, Sybase 15, and Netcool
   Omnibus 7.2.1.
   
   2. Properties and Command Line Options
   ===================================
   
   FifoName string,default: /tmp/probefifo
   The path and name of the FIFO.
   Commandline option: -fifo string
   
   Host string, default: localhost
   This property specifies the name of the host to connect to.
   Commandline option: -host string
   
   Port string, default: 0
   The port number to connect to. This is only required when
   reading events from a socket.
   Commandline option: -port string
   
   ReadFifo boolean , default: 0
   Specifies whether or not to read from the FIFO.
   1 - Use the FIFO.
   0 - Read events from the socket. This is the default.
   Commandline option: -readfifo Boolean
   
   StreamCapture boolean,default: 0
   Specifies whether or not to use stream capture.
   1 - Use stream capture.
   0 - Do not use stream capture.
   Commandline option: -streamcapture boolean
   
   StreamCaptureFilename string, default:
   $OMNIHOME/var/metrica.stream
   The filename to use for stream capture.
   Commandline option: -streamcapturefilename <filename as string>
   
   Timeout integer, default: 180
   The number of seconds probe waits for an event before
   disconnecting.
   Commandline option: -timeout <number of seconds>
   
   3. Data acquistion section
   ========================
   
   Connecting
   ----------
   Probe connects to a FIFO when ReadFifo property is 1. When
   ReadFifo is 0, it connects to a socket through TCP/IP
   connection.
   Event Retrieval
   Alarms are delimited by new line. Token type is specified by
   EventType1 and EventType2 properties. If it is eventtype1, then
   probe has name value pairs. If it is EventType2 then probe has
   semicolon separated values. If both of these are not true, then
   probe will try to asses token type on its own.
   
   
   4. Error/Warning Messages
   ======================

   Failed to open FIFO <FifoName>
   Failed to re-open FIFO <FifoName>
   The named pipe specified by the FifoName property could not be
   opened.
   Adjust the FifoName property if necessary and check file
   permissions.

   ProbeWatch Messages
   The probe will send out the following probewatch message to
   allow its current state to be stored in the Object Server:
   
   Socket error waiting for connection
   An error has occurred causing the probe to lose the socket
   connection.
   
   Connection Lost
   The socket connection has been closed at the server side.
   
   Connection Timed Out
   No data was read from the socket for a time greater than that
   set in the Timeout property. So the probe has closed the
   connection.
   
   The following alerts are generated from error conditions
   relating to the stream capture file.
   Unable to open file: FileX - ErrorY
   Unable to write to file: FileX - ErrorY
   Only managed to write NUM out of MAX_NUM characters
   Unable to open file: FileX  - ErrorY
