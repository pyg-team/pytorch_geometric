APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problems can occur when using the WebSphere Message Broker/IBM
   Integration Bus Mapping node with a Graphical Data Map that
   includes a Database Transform that maps a ResultSet, which
   includes columns with identical names from separate tables.
   These problems only arise when using a database system, such as
   Oracle or SQLServer that do not provide the column table names
   in the ResultSet metadata.
   
   The cause of the mapping problems that can occur in this
   situation will be that the mapping from the clashing name column
   will receive the values from all columns with that name from any
   table.
   This may lead to an incorrect output value, or a map failure due
   to a invalid type cast.
   
   
   
   Additional Symptom(s) Search Keyword(s):
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the use of identical named columns in a ResultSet cannot be
   avoided there is no local fix.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus
   who use the Mapping node with Database transforms returning
   ResultSets with same named columns.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   z/OS, MultiPlatform

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Problems can occur when using the Mapping node with a Graphical
   Data Map that includes a database transform that maps a
   ResultSet, which includes columns with identical names from
   separate tables.
   
   These problems only arise when using a database system, such as
   Oracle or SQLServer that does not provide the column table names
   in the ResultSet metadata.
   
   The cause of the mapping problems that can occur in this
   situation will be that the mapping from the clashing name column
   will receive the values from all columns with that name from any
   table. For example, if the target element is numeric the mapping
   will fail with a conversion error as the input is now
   incorrectly a space separated list of values from the clashing
   columns.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The product now correctly maps from database ResultSets
   containing same named columns from different tables when the
   database server does not provide the table names in the
   ResultSet metadata
