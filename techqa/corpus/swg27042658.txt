Title: IBM Prerequisites for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1 - United States

Text:
 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document details the system requirements for IBM Content Collector Version 4.0.1. 

CONTENT
 

Always up-to-date system requirement reports can be dynamically generated by using the Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR) tool [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html]. 

From the Content Collector product tabs below you can select detailed system requirement reports for different contexts (by Operating System, by component). Note that clicking a link will always generate a new, up-to-date report.

Important:
Because other products frequently ship fixes, updates, and new releases, testing every configuration is not possible. In general, you can install and run with updates to supported products if those updates are forward compatible.

Always check for the latest IBM Content Collector security bulletins in the IBM Support Portal and make sure to have the required fixes applied.

LEGACY RESTORE

Legacy restore provides access to documents that were archived with IBM CommonStore for Lotus Domino or IBM CommonStore for Exchange Server. Legacy restore supports the same archive systems as the CommonStore products and has the same system requirements to connect to these archive systems as the CommonStore products:

System requirements for IBM CommonStore for Lotus Domino [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010342]
System requirements for IBM CommonStore for Exchange Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27010343]

In addition, Legacy Restore also supports the archive systems IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition V8.5 and IBM Content Manager for z/OS V8.5. 

There are some limitations when using IBM Content Collector Legacy Restore instead of the CommonStore products, including the following restrictions: 

 * IBM Content Collector Legacy Restore provides read-only access to documents, but no write access. 
 * For documents that are stored in Content Manager OnDemand or Content Manager for z/OS, search is not supported. 
 * For multi-part document model item types in Content Manager 8, only the first part can be previewed.

IBM Content Collector Legacy Restore supports the same operating systems as IBM Content Collector Server.
