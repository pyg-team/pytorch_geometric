ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM), you try to Save a test
   case after setting at least one required category and adding an
   attachment. The Save button is clickable but it does not work.
   
   This only occurs when you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer
   (IE).
   
   Work arounds:
   Click on any section outside the "Attachment" section and the
   Save button works.
   Wait several minutes before clicking the Save button and it
   works.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * Steps to reproduce on (IE only not on Firefox or Chrome):    *
   * 1. Create a Test Case (Be sure it is set up to have at least *
   * one mandatory category field) Fill all mandatory fields      *
   * under "Category" and save the artifact.                      *
   * 2. Go to "Attachment" tab.                                   *
   * 3. Choose any file to be attached. Click on the Save button  *
   * - The artifact is not saved successfully because the save    *
   * button is not clickable (It 'looks' enabled, but its         *
   * clickable)                                                   *
   *                                                              *

   * refresh the Test Plans list view to trigger                  *
   * re-authentication.                                           *
