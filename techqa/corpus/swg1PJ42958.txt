PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue is caused by incorrect dojo configuration which is set
   by ICN login page. When browser locale is set to en-us, ICN
   login page do not set the locale correctly hence dojo.locale
   function returns incorrect locale. This causes problems when
   ACCE tries to set a localized string value in Content Engine
   based on client locale.
   
   Fixed in 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 and higher. This release contains
   ICN Toolkit 203 FP5 which resolves this issue.
