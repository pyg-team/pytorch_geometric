APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the reference field is set to NULL value by uncontrollable fa
   ctors, CQWeb gives the error message
   which is not quite meaningful. CQ native client didn't give the
   same error.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   1. Build a SAMPL database by using DefectTracking schema.
   2. Create self-reference field on Defect record type.
   3. Create a new record type 'RFE', and it references to Defect r
   ecord type.
   4. Drag the referenced 'defect.ID', 'defect.headline' into the R
   FE form. Upgrade the user database.
   5. Login to CQ native client to submit a new defect with one chi
   ld defect, submit a RFE linked to
   this new defect.
   6. Login to backend database to set the child defect to NULL.
   7. Login to CQ native client, the RFE form can be displayed well
   .
   8. Login to CQ Web client and the RFE form can't be popped up an
   d got an error:
   'Details: CRVSV0134E Property 'headline' is not in the proxy; cl
   ient did not set this property
   nor read this property from server.'
   
   The error message in CQWeb should be more meaningful or be consi
   stent with the CQ native
   client behavior.

   In ClearQuest Web, if the reference field is set to a NULL
   value by uncontrollable factors, the RFE form can't be
   displayed, and the error message displayed is not very
   meaningful.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available in ClearQuest 7.1.1.03.
