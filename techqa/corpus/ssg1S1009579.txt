Title: IBM Security Bulletin: A security vulnerability has been identified in GSKit shipped with IBM Spectrum Scale V4 (CVE-2016-2183) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A security vulnerability has been identified in one of the cipher suites supported by GSKit 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the in the Triple-DES on 64-bit block cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116337] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) 

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM Spectrum Scale V4.2 

 IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1 

REMEDIATION/FIXES
None

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Ensure you are utilizing a cipher supported by IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS).

IBM Spectrum Scale V4:

For environments where nistCompliance=off 

 * AES128-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA

For environments where nistCompliance=SP800-131A  * AES128-SHA 
 * AES128-SHA256 
 * AES256-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA256


In addition, IBM Spectrum Scale supports the keywords DEFAULT and AUTHONLY. When AUTHONLY is specified in place of a cipher list, Spectrum Scale checks network connection authorization. However, data sent over the connection is not protected. When DEFAULT is specified, Spectrum Scale does not authenticate or check authorization for network connections. Note: 
1. When different versions of OpenSSL are used within a cluster or in a multi-cluster setup, and when a cluster contains both V3 and V4 nodes, ensure that the ciphers are supported by all nodes. For GPFS V3: 

 *  AES128-SHA 
 * AES256-SHA

2. Starting with V4.2, newly created clusters have cipherList set to AUTHONLY. 
3. AUTHONLY is not affected by CVE-2016-2183
