QUESTION
 When running "Test Assembly" in the Hierarchical Stage, you may get some type of java.lang.NoSuchMethodError

This may look like

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/security/KeyStore;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/security/KeyStore;Ljava/security/SecureRandom;Lorg/apache/http/conn/ssl/TrustStrategy; 

or 

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
org/apache/http/client/methods/HttpRequestBase.releaseConnection() 

CAUSE
This can occur if there is a REST step in the assembly.

ANSWER
The Test Assembly feature is not enabled for the REST step in the Designer client.
You will not be able to run the Test Assembly feature if the stage has a REST step.
This is covered in the documentation for the Hierarchical Stage.

You will need to run the job to see its effect.
