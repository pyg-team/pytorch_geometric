 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Where can I download the latest Software Support Tools package for my IBM PureData System for Analytics NPS release? 

CAUSE
Starting in September 2014 with the NPS 7.2.0.0, 7.1.0.2, 7.0.4.5, 7.0.2.13, and 6.0.8.17 releases, the Netezza Software Support Tools are shipped as part of the NPS software releases and fix packs. 

ANSWER
The NPS 7.2.0.0, 7.1.0.2, 7.0.4.5, 7.0.2.13, and 6.0.8.17 releases (and later fix packs and patches in those releases) automatically install the Netezza Software Support Tools. Each NPS kit also includes a standalone Software Support Tools kit (nz-sw-support-tools-version.tar.gz) to allow you to install the latest tools without upgrading the NPS appliance release. 

IMPORTANT: The Netezza Software Support Tools are no longer available as a separate Fix Center menu download component. To install or upgrade to the latest tools, go to the latest NPS release and either upgrade NPS to that release, or download and install the separate Software Support Tools kit. 

The Software Support Tools kits support all the NPS releases in the related streams. That is, the 6.0.8 Software Support Tools kit supports all the NPS Release 6.x versions. The latest 7.x Netezza Software Support Tools kits support all of the NPS Release 7.x versions.

Your IBM account must be entitled to download the Software Support Tools kits from Fix Central. You must be able to log in to the Netezza host as nz to install the download kit.
