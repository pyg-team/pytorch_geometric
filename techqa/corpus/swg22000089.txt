Title: IBM Connection Pooling in MDM Outbound Broker - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 How does connection pooling work in Master Data Management Outbound Broker and do we have the option of turning it off? 

CAUSE
We use a third party open source library axis2c which is our fundamental network library, customized by us. There is a polling parameter defined in the properties file and after each interval, the open source call of CMPI_Ctx::Connect is executed in the broker. We can't turn off this connection pooling altogether because the open source setup doesn't allow it but the frequency can be changed using the polling parameter. 
So you might see connect/disconnect execution constantly depending on polling parameter.

ANSWER
The variable in Microsoft Windows variable is MIPollTime and in Linux or UNIX variable is pollTime. The value must be greater than 0. The default time is 3 minutes (180 seconds) and the polling time variable indicates how many seconds the Outbound Message Sender waits before trying to send more outbound messages.
