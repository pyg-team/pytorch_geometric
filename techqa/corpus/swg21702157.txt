Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in RC4 stream cipher affects TPF Toolkit (CVE-2015-2808) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 "Bar Mitzvah Attack" for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) affects TPF Toolkit. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]


DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

TPF Toolkit 4.0.x and 4.2.x

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix TPF Toolkit 4.2.x JR53501  1. Install the latest version of IBM Installation Manager. 
 2. Apply Interim Fix 4.2.4 by using IBM Installation Manager. 
 3. Update the Java installation on your z/OS or Linux on z Systems (or both) systems that the TPF Toolkit connects to. Download the latest version of Java from http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/] 

TPF Toolkit 4.0.x JR53500  1. Install the latest version of IBM Installation Manager. 
 2. Apply Interim Fix 4.0.7 by using IBM Installation Manager. 
 3. Update the Java installation on your z/OS or Linux on z Systems (or both) systems that the TPF Toolkit connects to. Download the latest version of Java from http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/] 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
For TPF Toolkit 4.0.x and 4.2.x, you can disable the RC4 encryption algorithm for the IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Version 7 that is used by TPF Toolkit and the DSTORE server on any remote systems. To disable the RC4 encryption algorithm, complete the following steps: 

 1. Close TPF Toolkit. 
 2. Navigate to the %TPFHOME%\jdk\jre\lib\security directory, and add or update the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property in the java.security file to include the RC4 encryption algorithm:
    jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4 
 3. On each remote system that hosts a DSTORE server for TPF Toolkit, navigate to the $JAVA_HOME\jre\lib\security directory and add or update the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property in the java.security file to include the RC4 encryption algorithm:
    jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4
    
    Note: $JAVA_HOME is the installation directory for Java on the remote systems. 
 4. Restart TPF Toolkit.
