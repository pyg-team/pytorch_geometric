APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  After the Convert library is used to convert files, immediately
   running actions that are dependent on the corresponding file
   (e.g. barcode recognition, where the image must be loaded by the
   engine for attempt to identify barcodes) may fail.  This occurs
   due to the ImageFile / ImageName returning a relative path,
   exclusive of the batch directory.
