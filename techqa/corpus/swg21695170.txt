VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2014-6135 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6135]

DESCRIPTION: 
IBM Security AppScan Standard could allow a remote attacker to hijack the clicking action of the victim. By persuading a victim to visit a malicious Web site, a remote attacker could send a specially-crafted HTTP request to hijack the victim's click actions or launch other client-side browser attacks.

CVEID: CVE-2014-6136 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6136]

DESCRIPTION: 
IBM Security AppScan Standard could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information due to encryption not being enforced. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain cleartext data.

CVSS Base Score: 2.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96816 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96816] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-8918 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8918]

DESCRIPTION: 

IBM Security AppScan Standard could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the improper validation of SSL certificates. By persuading a victim to visit a Web site containing a specially-crafted certificate, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to cause the victim to impersonate trusted servers
