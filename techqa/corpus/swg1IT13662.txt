APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The SOAPInput node issues a BIP3701E error message if the
   associated WSDL file does not have a target namespace.
   
   The exception generated is:
   BIP3701E: A Java exception was thrown whilst calling the Java
   JNI method
   ''method_com_ibm_broker_axis2_SoapParserUtil_getInboundContext''
    .
   The Java exception was  ''java.lang.NullPointerException''.
   The Java stack trace was  ''Frame : 0
   java.lang.NullPointerException: null|
   @:com.ibm.broker.axis2.SoapParserUtil.getInboundContext(Unknown
   Source)|''.
   Correct the error, and if necessary redeploy the flow. :
   /build/S1000_slot1/S1000_P/src/WebServices/WSLibrary/ImbSOAPPars
   er.cpp: 1771: ImbSOAPParser::createSoapShapedTree: :
   
   If ?wsdl is attempted on the URL of the SOAPInput node where the
   WSDL does not have a target namespace, then "no service data
   available" is returned instead of the WSDL.
