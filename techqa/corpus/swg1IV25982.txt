APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The LTPA token is being generated upon login with a timestamp of
   current time + 2 hrs, if there is no other LTPA token with the
   same subject, in which case that existing token will be used,
   which makes your effective token expiration what was left on the
   existing token, not 2 hrs. If there is no activity within the
   cushion timeout (the timeout set for auto regeneration of the
   token prior to its expiration) for the LTPA token, the token
   will not be auto regenerated thus expiring. At that point it is
   up to the application to deal with the expiration, either by
   sending the request to login again or by auto generating the
   token if the maximo session is still valid.. In this case
   neither is being done.. The application does not seem to deal
   with an expired LPTA token at all.
