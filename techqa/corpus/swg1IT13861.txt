APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  From MQ Fix Packs 7.5.0.6 and 8.0.0.4 the IBM MQ MFT product has
   been enhanced to support running on AIX when the xlc runtime is
   at version 13.1 or greater.
   
   Previously this combination was unsupported.
   
   At Fix Packs earlier than MQ 7.5.0.6 and 8.0.0.4,  the following
   error is seen in a javacore created after upgrading the AIX
   operating system to include an xlc runtime of version 13.1 or
   greater, and IBM MQ MFT commands fail to execute.

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of IBM MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT)
   7.5 and 8.0 on AIX who wish to use the xlc runtime at version
   13.1 or higher.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   AIX
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   A code issue in the compiler used to build IBM MQ Managed File
   Transfer meant that MFT command failed to run and a javacore was
   produced.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM MQ MFT has been recompiled using a later version of the AIX
   xlc compiler that allows MFT commands to run successfully at xlc
   version 13.1 or later.
