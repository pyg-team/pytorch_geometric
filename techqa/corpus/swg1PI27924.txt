ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  @Resource UserTransaction not injectable into CDI bean when
   called by @Stateless EJB
   
   a @Stateless @WebService class using CDI based
   @ApplicationScoped @Transactional services
   when CDI based Service gets initialized from within the
   @Stateless @WebService  will fail with the UserTransaction in
   CDI beans being null.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)    *
   *                  and Context and Dependency Injection (CDI)  *
   *                  in IBM WebSphere Application Server V8.5    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: UserTransaction cannot be used from a   *
   *                      CDI bean created in the context of an   *
   *                      EJB.                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   The injection of a UserTransaction object uses the same logic
   as lookup of a UserTransaction object.  Lookup of
   UserTransaction is prevented when it occurs within the context
   of an EJB that uses container-managed transactions, and the
   UserTransaction object returned within the context of an EJB
   that uses bean-managed transactions can only be used within
   the context of an EJB that uses bean-managed transactions.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The injection of a UserTransaction object has been
   changed to separate logic for injection, and the logic only
   applies restrictions when the object being created is an EJB
   rather than checking the current component context.
