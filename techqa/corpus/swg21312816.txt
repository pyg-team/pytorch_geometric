PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When debugging an EGL program reading a time value from IBM速 DB2速 on z/OS using IBM速 Rational速 Business Developer (RBD) v7.1, the following error appears:

"egl.core.TypeCastException: EGL0102E The 24.00.00 value of string type cannot be converted to the time type." 

SYMPTOM
When reading a time value from DB2 on z/OS using code such as: 


get xsTestTime into XsTestTime.timeValue with 
#sql{select TIMEITEM from XTEAM.XSTESTTIME T1};

record XsTestTime type SQLRecord{tableNames =[["XSTESTTIME", "T1"]]}
timeItem char(8);
end


the debugger and the generated Java code display values "00:00:00" and "24:00:00" as "00:00:00". When generating COBOL code, "00:00:00" and "24:00:00" are displayed as "00:00:00" and "24:00:00".

The following code does work in COBOL z/OS batch but fails with the above error in Java or Debug mode:


function main()
timeValue time = dateTimeLib.timeValue("24.00.00");
SysLib.writeStdout("time="+strLib.formatTime(timeValue));
end



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This is not a problem with EGL or RBD. The EGL generated code and EGL runtime are working as designed. 


There is just a difference between Java and COBOL: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) converts 24:00:00 into 00:00:00.
