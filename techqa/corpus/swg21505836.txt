Title: IBM lockfile error when using the TEM Console - United States

Text:
lockfile corrupt TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why I am getting a lockfile error when using the TEM Console? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You may be experiencing a lockfile issue if you encounter the following message while trying to deploy an action: 

 Site propagation aborted by TEM Server for the following reason: 
ERROR: Unable to acquire lock;lockfile corrupt. Please manually remove "lockfile" from propagation server 


The lockfile is created whenever an action is taken and removed when the action completes. However, if an action is aborted for any reason (computer turned off, network problems, TEM Console crashes, etc.), the lockfile can be "stranded".

The lockfile will automatically be ignored 30 minutes after the last action.

To resolve this error manually, delete or rename the existing lockfile so that the TEM Server can generate a new one. By default, the lockfile is located at "C:\Program Files\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\sitearchive\actionsite\lockfile".

If you are using TEM Console operators, you may also have to clear the lockfiles under the operator sites: (i.e., "C:\Program Files\BigFix Enterprise\BES Server\sitearchive\opsite1\lockfile" and all the other opsites that are having the problem).

Note: It is normal to see the lockfile in the folders mentioned and just because the files exist, it does not necessarily mean that there is a problem. The lockfile only needs to be cleared if you are receiving errors when sending out actions.

Note: Earlier revisions of TEM actually displayed a message of "Propagation server aborted the transaction for the following reason: Unable aquire lock; transaction in progress." (i.e. missing the "to")

Also Note: If you are getting this message repeatedly even after fixing the lockfile, or are receiving the similar message:
Unable to proceed because another user is currently propagating this site. Please try again in a few minutes. 
then please see further information on tuning your TEM Server here: [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Endpoint%20Manager/page/Performance%20Configurations] with particular attention to close unnecessarily open actions.
