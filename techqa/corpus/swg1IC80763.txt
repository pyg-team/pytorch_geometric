PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: PCOMM FTP Client users                       *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: PCOMM FTP client session with SSL       *
   *                      (MSCAPI) enabled hangs when PComm       *
   *                      Trace is off.                           *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   PCOMM FTP Client connection will fail in hand shake stage if
   MSCAPI SSL is enabled.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When a PCOMM FTP Client session is established and trying to
   make the hand shake with the server, the data sent from the
   server was not received completly by PCOMM. This will cause the
   hand shake process to fail. The PCOMM FTP client needs to wait
   for the complete data to be sent from server before processing
   security context. PCSFTP.EXE has been changed.
