PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You install IBM Rational ClearCase or IBM Rational ClearQuest. If the system does not have GSKit installed, the installation fails with the following error:

Error executing "/opt/IBM/RationalSDLC/common/IHS/bin/ihs_startup" operation (status=1). See agent output log for more information: /var/ibm/InstallationManager/logs/native/YYYYMMDD_HHMM.log 


SYMPTOM
The contents of the referenced log file contain the error:

Starting IHS...
IHS failed to start. Check log files in /opt/rational/common/IHS/logs

The contents of <install_temp_dir>/IHSLogs/ihs_start.log, where <install_temp_dir> is the temporary location the user has specified during installation will contain the error below. The default value of <install_temp_dir> is "/tmp".

Cannot load /opt/rational/common/IHS/modules/mod_was_ap20_http.so into server: ld.so.1: httpd: fatal: libgsk7cms.so: open failed: No such file or directory 

CAUSE
 During the installation, the IBM HTTP Server is started before the GSKit is installed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Note: This issue has been fixed in 7.1.1.1 

To work around this issue, download GSKit and then manually install GSKit on your system before installing Rational ClearCase or Rational ClearQuest. 

To download and manually install GSKit, take the following steps: 

1. Download and extract: GSKit.<platform>_<version>.zip from the native folder on the repository

If using ESD or DVD images, the .zip file can be found in the disks/disk1/ad/native/ directory with the name file000020. Copy the .zip file and rename it to GSKit.zip

2. Extract the GSKit.zip file using the compress utility to a folder other than the install location (for example,. /tmp).

3. Navigate to <GSKit_dir>/common/GSKit, where <GSKit_dir> is the directory where you extracted the GSKit.zip file. 

4. Run the command(s) specific to your platform to install GSKit :

Sun 5
pkgadd -a ./admin -n -d . gsk7bas

Linux
rpm -Uh --nodeps --ignorearch --force --prefix /opt gsk7bas<version>.i386.rpm

HP-UX
chmod u+x <GSKit extraction dir>/common/GSKit/gsk7bas/catalog/gsk7bas/gsk7bas/checkinstall
chmod u+x <GSKit extraction dir>/common/GSKit/gsk7bas/catalog/gsk7bas/gsk7bas/postinstall
chmod u+x <GSKit extraction dir>/common/GSKit/gsk7bas/catalog/gsk7bas/gsk7bas/preremove
swreg -l depot <GSKit extraction dir>/common/GSKit/gsk7bas/catalog/gsk7bas/gsk7bas/
swinstall -s <GSKit extraction dir>/common/GSKit/gsk7bas/catalog/gsk7bas/gsk7bas/ gsk7bas

AIX
installp -acgXd . gskta.rte

5. Install Rational ClearCase or Rational ClearQuest
