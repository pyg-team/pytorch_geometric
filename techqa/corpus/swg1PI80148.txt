   01.When a listing or source contains null characters, the
      Integrated Debugger is unable to correctly process it,
      resulting in message AQEDB0003E which indicated the listing
      cannot be found. As a result, disassembly of the program is
      displayed in the debug editor for stepping.
   02.Developer for z Systems CARMA server loops on invoking CA
      Endevor when the SHOWVIEW DD is not defined.
   03.Developer for z Systems enhancement to specify a connect
      timeout for the CARMA connection via variable
      connect.timeout in CRASRV.properties. The default is 60
      seconds, which matches the default before this enhancement.
   04.In a multi-processor environment, concurrent requests for
      CRASRV.properties data causes values to be not properly
      retrieved.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.The Integrated Debugger will handle source and listings that
      contain null characters and display them in the debug
      editor.
   02.The IBM IDz Endevor integration has been changed to make the
      SHOWVIEW DD optional instead of required.
   03.The CARMA component is being changed to allow the systems
      administrator to be able to specify a connect timeout value.
   04.Changes have been made in CARMA to provide better
      synchronization of the retrieval of the CRASRV.properties
      values.
