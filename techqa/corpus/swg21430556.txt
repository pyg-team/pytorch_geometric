ANSWER
When implementing one connection per thread, do not use static for the ContentManagerService_Port or the ReportService_Port.
If static is used, all threads modify the same variables.

Without static, each thread has a local copy of the variables.


/* public static ContentManagerService_Port _binding = null;

public static ReportService_Port reportService = null;*/

public ContentManagerService_Port _binding = null;

public ReportService_Port reportService = null;
