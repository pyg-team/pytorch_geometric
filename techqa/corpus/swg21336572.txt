Title: IBM Setting today's date in Transformer - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to set the current period to reflect today's date. There is another method documented in our support document titled 'Set the current period to reflect today's date'. Determine which method is best for your environment before proceeding. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Include a column in the Impromptu report that retrieves today's date.
For example:
now ( )
The definition of the Today function within Impromptu:
Syntax: today
Returns the current date according to the clock of the computer that you are running Impromptu on.
This can be modified to calculate dates, such as last month. For Example:
Create an Impromptu query that contains only one column with the following calculation:
month ( today ) - N
where N is the number of months to offset the current period. Save as an IQD for use as a datasource in Transformer.



This is to correct KB 59503:

Please replace references to Today() with Now() in the above KB doc.

The date generated by Today function in Impromptu will not be dynamic when saved as an IQD, it will reflect the date when the IQD has been saved (it's hardcoded into the IQD).
The select in IQD looks like this for the c2 being now(), c3 being today():
BEGIN SQL
select T1."ORDER_NO" as c1,
(sysdate()) as c2,
(DATE '2001-08-06') as c3
from "OUTDOORS"."ORDERS" T1

END SQL
COLUMN,0,Order No
COLUMN,1,now ( )
COLUMN,2,today ( )

We have to use the "Now" function to get the true dynamic date when the IQD is run.
The Now() function is being evaluated by the database, so it gives the current date on the machine where the database is running.
