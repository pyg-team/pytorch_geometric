Q&A 
Q. You stated that if an agent is making a back-end call to another database is not currently available, then that agent will hang. And that a Domino restart is the only way to fix that. Is there any way to make it so you just have to restart Agent Manager without restarting the server?  * 



Q. An Agent just locks whole agent manager and returns "agent has terminated abnormally" . Log shows that it's stopping at a database link and the only way to clear that is a server reboot, and sometimes the server crashes on the way down.  * 


Q. With our product we have the ability to issue a Run Now command but you don't see it running. Currently there is no way to go out and check the status of the agent at the console. Can that be enhanced in some way? Is there a reason technically why it doesn't display it?  * 


Q. Agent code running three concurrent agents. When I run that agent every now and then it creates a replication conflict in documents although I have the form conflict handling to merge conflict. Is there something in the agent that I could run that could remove this particular replication conflict?  * 
 * 

Q. When I was doing some code changes on my agents, when I hit attempt to place the cursor at a certain place of code, the actual code turns into a loop, the screen flickers and you can't do anything. You have to restart Designer (happens w/ Designer versions 7.0.3 or 8.5.3 client). Agent runs fine. otherwise, the problem is only when attempting to edit the code.  * 
 * 

Q. Have a few agents scheduled to run at 1AM. No issues w/ agent properties or the schedule. However, those agents just don't show up in the Agent's schedule and the agents never run.  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 

Q. I'm running into same issue with agents creating replication conflicts even though the form property is set to merge - no conflicts.  * 
 * 

Q. Occasionally we have a problem where an agent won't complete and it will terminate saying it was taking too long. Regarding the Refresh Agent Cache time and also the daytime and nighttime parameters, if an agent starts during the nighttime parameters and then continues to run into the daytime window, is it limited to the daytime runtime or do we still have the nighttime runtime/execution time available? And if it hits that refresh time, does that cause it to stop?  * 


Q. So if I've got the Agent Refresh Cache hitting at 12 AM, say I start an agent at 8 PM and it might take 8 hours. Would I run into a problem there with the refresh agent cache? How would the Agent Refresh Cache affect it?  * 


Q. What is the command to print an Agent list?  * 
 * 


Q. When the signer of an agent gets deprovisioned from the address book, does AdminP take care of removing the signer and replacing it with the Server ID?  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 



Q. Is there a command to show the entire day's agent schedule beginning at the beginning of the day and not just the remainder of the day?  * 



Q. Is there any way to get the Agmr Refresh to kick off the program document, so that you know you are getting the most fresh schedule?  * 


Q. If I make a change to the Server Tasks - Agent Manager tab, does that still require a Domino Restart? or will restarting Agent Manager be enough?  * 
 *
