ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  They got the message "Cannot invoke method toInteger( ) on null
   object"
   once dropping the ODR part on the pattern editor.
   It is an error only WCA which upgraded WCA from v1.1.1.0 GA code
   to v2.0.0.0 GA.
   When they use WCA 2.0 GA code with reset, this error does not
   occur.
   .
   Here is the steps taken during the migration from 1.1.1 GA.
   1. replace the firmware from v1.1.1.0 GA to v2.0.0.0 GA
   2. upload WAS HV 7.0.0.11 (RHEL) to WCA via
      CLI(cloudburst.virtualimage.create('local path of ova') )and
      Enabled IMP
   3. upload WAS HV 7.0.0.11(SLES) to WCA via CLI and Enabled IMP
   4. tried to create new pattern with ODR part, but failed with
      both RHEL and SLES ODR parts.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  reset the GA 2.0 firmware
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Title
   
   The On-Demand Router part is not usable in user interface when a
   WebSphere Cloudburst Appliance is upgraded to 2.0.0.0 and the
   WebSphere Hypervisor Edition with Intelligent Management Pack
   image is imported
   
   Error description
   The problematic scenario is when:
   (1) WebSphere Cloudburst Appliance is upgraded to version
   2.0.0.0
   (2) Then the new WebSphere Hypervisor Edition with the
   Intelligent Management Pack virtual image is imported, the
   license is accepted, and the Intelligent Management pack support
   is enabled.
   (3) Then when you attempt to drag and drop a  On demand router
   part onto the pattern. The pattern no longer can be displayed
   and a "Cannot invoke method toInteger( ) on null object"
   message is displayed.
   
   Local fix
   There is no workaround for this issue.
   
   Problem summary
   ****************************************************************
   
   * USERS AFFECTED:
   Users upgrading a WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance from releases
   prior to 2.0.0.0 to 2.0.0.0, who then import a new WebSphere
   Hypervisor Edition virtual image.
   ****************************************************************
   
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In previous releases of WebSphere CloudBurst appliance, the On
   Demand Router part is no included. This is actually two parts,
   an abstract conceptual part, and a specific concrete"part
   associated with a particular WebSphere Hypervisor Edition
   virtual image. The upgrade from WebSphere CloudBurst 2.0.0.0
   does not add the conceptual part to the WebSphere CloudBurst
   Appliance. WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance is unable to construct
   a consistent pattern model, and the message "Cannot invoke
   method toInteger( ) on null object"  is the result.
   ****************************************************************
   
   Problem conclusion
   The WebSphere CloudBurst Appliance 2.0.0.1 upgrade includes the
   addition of the On Demand Router conceptual part to the
   WebSphere Cloudburst appliance.
   If this upgrade is applied, the problem is resolved.
