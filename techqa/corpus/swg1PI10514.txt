PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Note: We update our information centers monthly. The following
   Version 8.5 modifications will be available in the month_year
   update to the Information Centers. To access the latest
   on-line documentation, go to the product library page at
   http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/library and
   select the version and product that is appropriate for your
   WebSphere Application Server environment.

   Problem :  Customer can launch IBM Installation Manager GUI,
   however, no text is displayed in the IBM Installation Manager
   main GUI; empty boxes are displayed without any fonts or text.
   The customer is unable to see available options, unable to
   navigate, or access other panels.
   It is determined that installing the following two X11
   filesets on the AIX system resolves this problem.  These
   filesets need to be added to the WebSphere Application Server
   information center as a requirement for AIX systems where
   WebSphere Application Server or IBM Installation manager GUI's
   are used:
   - X11.fnt.coreX
   - X11.fnt.iso_T1
   This problem can also occur with the WebSphere Application
   Server  GUIs; WebSphere customization toolbox,, profile
   management tool, or not installed.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Preparing AIX systems for installation,
   is update to include the following:
   To support the graphical user environment on AIX for IBM
   Installation Manager and WebSphere GUIs, install the following:
   
       X11.fnt.coreX
       X11.fnt.iso.T1

   Problem :  Some of the parameters for PDJrteCfg utility are
   incorrectly specified in the topic,
   com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg utility for Tivoli Access Manager
   single sign-on, The syntax documented is as follows:
   ${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java
   -Dfile.encoding=ISO8859-1
   -Xnoargsconversion
   -Dpd.home=${WAS_HOME}/java/jre/PolicyDirector
   -cp ${WAS_HOME}/tivoli/tam/PD.jar
   -Dwas.installroot=${WAS_HOME}
   com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg
   -action config
   -cfgfiles_path ${WAS_HOME}/java/jre
   -host myhost.us.ibm.com
    -alt_config
    -was
    -java_home ${JAVA_HOME}
   
   Resolution: Topic, com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg utility for
   Tivoli Access Manager single sign-on, is updated and the
   PDInteCfg utility syntax is documented as follows:
   
   Note: Before running the PDJrteCfg utility, run
   "setupCmdLine.sh and set ${TIV_HOME} and ${TAM_HOST} as system
   environment variables.
   
   ${WAS_HOME}/java/jre/bin/java
   -Djava.ext.dirs=${TIV_HOME}:${WAS_HOME}/java/jre/lib/ext
   -Dpd.cfg.home=${TIV_HOME}
   -Dwas.install.root=${WAS_HOME}
   -Dpd.home=${TIV_HOME}/PolicyDirector

   The same update is made in the V8.0 information center.

   ID: 756074
   Problem : Topic, Installing IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology
   Edition Version 7.0 using the command line, fails to remind
   the reader that  when using the imcl command to install the
   offering, the <installationDirectory> option needs to specify
   the appropriate WebSphere Application Server installation
   path.   As a result, the reader can specify the wrong
   installation path.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Installing IBM WebSphere SDK Java
   Technology Edition Version 7.0 using the command line, is
   updated to add the following note:
   
   Note: For installation_directory, specify the appropriate
   WebSphere Application Server installation path on which to
   install IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition Version 7.0.

   ID: 756128
   Problem : Customer is unable to find documentation that states
   that you are unable to
   install Plugins under the IHS_HOME directory.  Customers that
   try to do this using
   the Installation Manager GUI, found that they were unable to
   proceed
   due to a message that states:
   
   "The installation directory for the new "Plugins" package
   group must not be a parent or sub-directory of a previously
   used installation directory."
   
   The information center needs to document that you are unable
   to install Plugins under the IHS_HOME directory.
   
   Resolution: Topics,  Installing the Web Server Plug-ins using
   the command line, Installing and uninstalling the Web Server
   Plug-ins on distributed operating systems, and Installing the
   Web Server Plug-ins using response files, have been updated by
   adding the following note:
   
   NOTE: The target directory for the plug-in must be an empty
   directory and cannot be installed in a subdirectory of the IBM
   HTTP Server target directory.
   
   This update also applies to the same topics in the V8.0
   information center.
   ------------
   ID: 756310
   Problem : Topic, Storing transaction and compensation logs in
   a relational database for high availability, has vague and
   misleading documentation concerning requirements on the
   application server in the peer recovery group (cluster) and
   its use of a single datasource for logs.   This vague
   information must be clarified.
   
   Resolution: Topic, Storing transaction and compensation logs
   in a relational database for high availability, is updated
   with the following note:
   
   Important:  Each server in the cluster must be able to
   reference the datasource that a given application server
   references for its logs. That is, the datasource must be
   scoped to the cluster (or cell). This scoping allows peer
   recovery.
   
   This update also applies to the same topic in the V8.0
   informaton center.
   ----------
   ID: 756590
   Problem : Topic, Configuring client reroute for applications
   that use DB2 databases, has an incorrect statement that says
   for the following properties:
   
   Retry interval for client reroute
   Maximum retries for client reroute
   
   Attention: If you do not specify a value for these properties,
   DB2
   failover processing (client rerouting) does not occur.
   
   For V8.0 and V8.5, client rerouting continues to occur even if
   you do not specify the properties: Retry interval for client
   reroute AND Maximum retires for client reroute.
   
   Resolution:  Topic, Configuring client reroute for
   applications that use DB2 databases, is updated.  The
   ATTENTION currently documented that says, ----If you do not
   specify a value for these properties, DB2
   failover processing (client rerouting) does not occur.---  is
   removed from the topic.
   
   This update also applies to the V8.0 version of the
   information center topic.
   ---------
   ID: 756014
   Problem : he online documentation for IBM WebSphere Edge
   components is
   misleading and should be updated to prevent customer confusion
   and
   misconfiguration.  The latest versions of the Load Balancing
   Guide contains
   incorrect information and is missing vital information that is
   required
   to configure the environment.
   
   The concepts guide for Version 8.5.5 should
   be updated so as to reflect that NAT, CBR and SS is now
   supported.
   
   
    We can also add the additional note on users not needing to
   configure
   cluster address using ifconfig command in user space load
   balancer.
   
   Resolution:  The Edge plugin has been updated to reflect the
   Load Balancer 8.5.5 changes in the concepts section.
