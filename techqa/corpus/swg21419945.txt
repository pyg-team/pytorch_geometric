Title: IBM Packaging of RES execution component in JEE - United States

Text:
RES; Rule Session Factories; RES packaging TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Which RES execution component should I package in my application if I use IlrPOJOSessionFactory? 

ANSWER
In JRules 7, there are several rules session factories (IlrEJB3SessionFactory, IlrJ2SESessionFactory, IlrPOJOSessionFactory, IlrExtendedJ2SESessionFactory, IlrExtendedPOJOSessionFactory) for client application to connect to RES for rule invocations. 

In a JEE environment, if you prefer to have a simple and non-ejb approach (web application or decision service), you can make use of IlrPOJOSessionFactory APIs for rule session creation. The execution component that is required to package together with the application will be simply jrules-res-session-java.jar. This jar file can be found at <JRules_Installed_dir>\executionserver\lib folder.
