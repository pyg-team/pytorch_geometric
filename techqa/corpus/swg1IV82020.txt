APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Installing the Network Management Integration for OMNIbus 8.1
   feature fails with the following error:
   
   User: smadmin ERROR: TIPCLI_DIR does not exist:
   /opt/ibm/JazzSM/profile/../ui/bin assignNNMRoles.sh
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  The problem is that the assignNNMRoles.sh script is looking for
   tools in the JazzSM profile in Websphere (/opt/ibm/JazzSM) but
   JazzSM is actually installed in:
   
   /opt/ibm/home/ncoadmin/IBM/JazzSM/ui
   
   which is outside of the parent directory of the Websphere
   profile for JazzSM.
   
   Create a symbolic link from: /opt/ibm/JazzSM/ui to
   /opt/ibm/home/ncoadmin/IBM/JazzSM/ui
   
   i.e: $pwd /opt/ibm/JazzSM $ln -s
   /opt/ibm/home/ncoadmin/IBM/JazzSM/ui ui
   
   Result is that /opt/IBM/JazzSM/ui is linked to
   /opt/ibm/home/ncoadmin/IBM/JazzSM/ui
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * All users using NOI/SSO integration for ITNM 3.9 or ITNM     *
   * 4.1.1                                                        *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * The installer for the NOI/SSO integration pack points to a   *
   * default Jazz SM directory, not the Omnibus Jazz Sm           *
   * directory.                                                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * As the integrator exists as a separate Omnibus add-on        *
   * outside of the main ITNM application, and the issue is       *
   * install based, this cannot be addressed in a Fix Pack.       *
   *                                                              *
   * Use the published workaround to complete installation:       *
   *                                                              *

   ****************************************************************
   The issue is solved in ITNM 4.2 which is integrated with Jazz SM
   by default.
