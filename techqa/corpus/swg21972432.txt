SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 6, 7 and 8 that are used by IBM Rational ClearQuest. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2015 and January 2016 and include the vulnerability commonly referred to as "SLOTH". 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-7575 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575] 

DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow weaker than expected security caused by a collision attack when using the MD5 hash function for signing a ServerKeyExchange message during a TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “SLOTH”.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS

IBM Rational ClearQuest, versions 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x, 7.1.2.x, 8.0.0.x, 8.0.1.x, and 9.0 in the following components:


 * ClearQuest Web/CQ OSLC server/CM Server component, when configured to use SSL. 
 * ClearQuest Eclipse clients that use Report Designer, run remote reports on servers using secure connections, or use the embedded browser to connect to secure web sites. If you do not use the ClearQuest Eclipse client in this way, then you are not affected.

ClearQuest version Status 9.0 Affected only by CVE-2015-7575 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Affected 8.0 through 8.0.0.17 Affected 7.1.0.x 
7.1.1.x 
7.1.2.x 
(all versions and fix packs) Affected REMEDIATION/FIXES
ClearQuest Web/CQ OSLC Server/CM Server Component 


For ClearQuest 9.0 and 8.x 
These releases use an installation of WebSphere Aplication Server (WAS) separately installed and maintained from the ClearQuest installation. Determine the version of WAS that your deployment is using and follow the instructions at [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21883573]Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Java SDK affect WebSphere Application Server January 2016 CPU [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21975424]. 

For ClearQuest 7.1.x 
Customers on extended support contracts should contact customer support.

ClearQuest Eclipse Clients
Apply the relevant fixes as listed in the table below.



Affected Versions Fixes 9.0 Install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 1 (9.0.0.1) for 9.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042129] 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.10 Install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 11 (8.0.1.11) for 8.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042127] 8.0 through 8.0.0.17 Install Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 17 (8.0.0.17) for 8.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042125] 7.1.2.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.1.x (all fix packs) 
7.1.0.x (all fix packs) Customers on extended support contracts should contact customer support. 

For 7.1.x and earlier releases, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product. 

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
If you are unable to take the steps to fix the issue (installing the fix pack), for CVE-2015-7575, the following workaround is available for ClearQuest 9.0. This version of ClearQuest uses Java 7 or Java 8 (depending on platform). 

This change is needed on every ClearQuest Eclipse client until the fix pack is installed.

The administrator can address the issue on clients by updating the file /opt/rational/common/JAVA/jre/lib/security/java.security (UNIX) or RationalSDLC\common\JAVA\jre\lib\security\java.security (Windows) as follows (both steps are required): 

· Add MD5 to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, RSA keySize < 1024, MD5 

· Add MD5withRSA to the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property - e.g. jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DH keySize < 768, MD5withRSA 

Java 6 (used by ClearQuest 8.0 and 8.0.1) requires code changes in the JSSE component in addition to the java.security file modifications, so upgrading to the fix pack is the only solution.
