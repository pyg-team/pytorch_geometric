 RELEASE NOTES

ABSTRACT
 If a failover occurs on the node to which you are connected, the steps and swimlanes disappear from the Step Editor canvas. The Validate, Save, and Close buttons are still visible, but only the Close button works. Any changes you made since the last save are lost. 

CONTENT
To make the Step Editor operational, you must log out of Case Manager Builder and then log in again.
