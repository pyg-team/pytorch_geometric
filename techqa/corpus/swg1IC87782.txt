APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Channel authentication records of type QMGRMAP apply only to
   queue manager to queue manager channel connections, but it is
   possible to configure a set of rules whereby an incoming
   client connection is affected by a QMGRMAP channel
   authentication record.
   
   This can be demonstrated by the following:
   
   1. Issue the following command to prohibit all channel
   connections:
   SET CHLAUTH('*') type(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') +
   USERSRC(NOACCESS)
   
   2. Then issue the following QMGRMAP rule to allow remote queue
   manager connection :
   SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(QMGRMAP) QMNAME('*') USERSRC(CHANNEL) +
   ADDRESS('*')
   
   The QMGRMAP record incorrectly allows and, affects client
   application connections.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects those users that use ADDRESSMAP records to
   block channel access, and QMGRMAP records to allow channel
   access, without also using USERMAP to control client channel
   access.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Configuring channel access such that only message channels
   between queue managers are accepted, and client channel access
   is blocked, using generic ADDRESSMAP and QMGRMAP, the QMGRMAP
   record incorrectly acts upon the incoming client connection
   channel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The channel authentication record matching code has been updated
   to ensure that each of the record types match against only the
   channel types they should affect.
