APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Run of Provisioning Tasks keeps appending date and time stamp at
   end
   
   
    Problem description
   
   When a provisioning task is run in TPM 7.1.1, the default task
   name
   appends the date and time stamp at the end. After running this
   multiple
   times, the task name becomes really really long as date/time
   stamp of
   every run is appended. I discussed this with TPM development
   team. It
   is a bug and has been fixed in TPM 7.2. This PMR is being opened
   to
   replicate the fix in TPM 7.1.1 in the upcoming iFix. It should
   be a
   relatively easy thing to fix, since all the work has already
   been done.
   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  This is resolved in 7.1.1.0-TIV-TPM-IF00004 release.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Problem Description: When a task is executed, task name has
   related name plus timestamp of when it was executed. When this
   task is executed again using "Run again" option, the new
   timestamp is appened to previous task name (Which also has
   previous time stamp). This way task name becomes to long if task
   is repeatedly executed using "Run again" option.
   
   Fix Provided: Task name will have appropriate value.
