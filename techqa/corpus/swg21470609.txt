QUESTION
 Why is the Privileges button from the Database Explorer view greyed out for Classic Federation in Classic Data Architect (CDA)? 

ANSWER
From the Database Explorer view Properties are alway Read Only which is why buttons or editable fields are disabled. There are two ways to give access.
1. Open up an SQL editor and type in the GRANT statements and then run them on the server.
2. In the Project Explorer use the Properties tab to grant access to the views or tables and then generate DDL and run it on the server.
