Installation Instructions

To install this software complete the following steps:

1. Download, unzip and untar the rpm packages. For example:

gunzip <filename>.tar.gz
tar -xvf <filename>.tar

2. You must uninstall any previous versions of the rpms if any are installed. Do not uninstall rpms that you are not upgrading. To uninstall an rpm package, use the following command:

rpm -e <package name>

You must uninstall rpm packages in the following order:

rpm -e vacpp.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e xlsmp.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e xlsmp.msg.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e vac.lib-x.x.x-x

where x.x.x-x refers to the level of the rpm package installed on your system. To determine the level, use the following commands:

rpm -q vacpp.rte
rpm -q xlsmp.rte
rpm -q xlsmp.msg.rte
rpm -q vac.lib

In cases where an rpm package is required by other installed packages, e.g. XL Fortran, the shared package may not uninstall. To upgrade a shared package, specify the --nodeps option with your rpm command. For example:

rpm -e --nodeps xlsmp.rte.x.x.x-x

3. Install the packages using the following command:

rpm -ivh <package name>

You must install the rpm packages in the following order:

rpm -ivh xlsmp.msg.rte-x.x.x-x.ppc64.rpm
rpm -ivh xlsmp.rte-x.x.x-x.ppc64.rpm
rpm -ivh vacpp.rte-x.x.x-x.ppc64.rpm
rpm -ivh vac.lib-x.x.x-x.ppc64.rpm

where x.x.x-x represents the version number.


Deinstallation Instructions

To uninstall this software perform the following steps:

rpm -e vacpp.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e xlsmp.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e xlsmp.msg.rte-x.x.x-x
rpm -e vac.lib-x.x.x-x

where x.x.x-x represents the version number.

In cases where an rpm package is required by other installed packages, that package may not uninstall.
