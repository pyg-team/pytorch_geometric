   ****************************************************************
   There is no way to install a stand alone GUI + extensions, as
   the extensions require the server install.  However, there are
   files that reside on the GUI server that the extension requires.
   Therefore, when you install the stand alone GUI server as part
   of the NOI extensions, the following directories contain missing
   files:
   
   /opt/ibm/tivoli/impact/uiproviderconfig
   /opt/ibm/tivoli/impact/uiproviderconfig/properties
   /opt/ibm/tivoli/impact/uiproviderconfig/translation
   
   These files should exist on the GUI server and not the backend
   server. They do exist currently when you install a standalone
   backend server.
