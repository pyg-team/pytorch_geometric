APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The Data Import Handler configuration contains the setting:
   holdability="CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT".
   
   Oracle 12c does not allow a user to set holdability and does not
   support "CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT". Therefore, you encounter the
   SQLFeatureNotSupportedException exception when you run the index
   build utility (di-buildindex).
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  USERS AFFECTED:
       WebSphere Commerce V7 administrators that use an Oracle 12c
   database.
   
       PROBLEM ABSTRACT:
       Oracle 12c does not allow a user to set holdability
   
       BUSINESS IMPACT:
       The index build utility fails on Oracle 12c databases.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  For Oracle databases, updated the WebSphere Commerce Solr Data
   Import Handler configuration in the
   solr_home/MC_catalogId/locale/CatalogEntry/conf/wc-data-config.x
   ml file by deleting the holdability="CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT"
   setting.
