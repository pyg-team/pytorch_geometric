 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS affects IBM Cognos Command Center. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-2808 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808]
DESCRIPTION: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".
CVSS Base Score: 5
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

The fix for all affected versions is found here: http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FCognos+Command+Center&fixids=10.2.1-BA-CCC-Win32-JRE-60SR16FP3 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FInformation+Management%2FCognos+Command+Center&fixids=10.2.1-BA-CCC-Win32-JRE-60SR16FP3] 


Installation instructions for applying this fix. 

For Microsoft Windows servers where the Agent or Server component is installed.  1. Download the 32 bit IBM Java JRE (file name: ibm-java-jre-60-win-i386.zip, Size: 75 MB). 
 2. Stop the CccServer, CccQueue and CccAgent Microsoft Windows services. 
 3. For IBM Cognos Command Center 10.1 and 10.2: Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.orig 
 4. For IBM Cognos Command Center 10.2.1:Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.6.0.16.0 directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.6.0.16.0.orig 
 5. For IBM Cognos Command Center 10.1 and 10.2: Unpack the content of the ibm-java-jre-60-win-i386.zip file to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java 
 6. For IBM Cognos Command Center 10.2.1: Unpack the content of the ibm-java-jre-60-win-i386.zip file to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.6.0.16.0 
 7. Start the CccAgent, CccQueue and CccServer Microsoft Windows services. 
 8. Validate the installation by testing the connectivity to the agent using the CCC Client.



For Microsoft Windows servers where the Server or Web Client component is installed apply these additional steps.  1. Apply the Microsoft Security Advisory 2960358 titled "Update for Disabling RC4 in .NET TLS". (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/2960358.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/2960358.aspx]) 
 2. Ensure that the Microsoft Security Advisory 286875 has been applied to the server. (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/2868725.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/2868725.aspx]) 
 3. Follow the instructions described in the Microsofy Security Research and Defence Blog entry accompying security advisory 286875to disable RC4 support for the server by changing registry settings.(http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/12/security-advisory-2868725-recommendation-to-disable-rc4.aspx [http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/12/security-advisory-2868725-recommendation-to-disable-rc4.aspx], section "How to Completely Disable RC4")



For IBM Cognos Command Center 10.1 and 10.2 with above fix applied: Before upgrading your installation from 10.1 to 10.2 respectively from 10.2 to 10.2.1 please revert to original \java\ directory:  1. Stop the CccServer, CccQueue and CccAgent Windows services. 
 2. Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.cve 
 3. Rename the <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java.orig directory to <INSTALLDIR>\Common\java 
 4. Proceed to upgrade your Cognos Command Center installation to a newer version. 
 5. After upgrade to newer version is done, please reapply "Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java Runtime affect IBM Cognos Command Center (CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2015-0138)" fix starting Step 1.

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
You should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the RC4 stream cipher will expose yourself to the attack described above.
