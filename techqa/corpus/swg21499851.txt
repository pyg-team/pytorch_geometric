PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Your CICS JVM server fails to start and you receive message DFHSJ0210 with reason code JVMPROFILE_ERROR and DFHSJ0914 E. This occurs during CICS startup or when you enter CEMT SET JVMSERVER(<name>) ENABLED in an attempt to start a JVM server in CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.2. 

SYMPTOM
These are the messages you see in the MSGUSR when starting the JVM server: 
DFHSJ0210 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsj/SJ0210.html] An attempt to start a JVM for the JVMSERVER resource jvmserver has failed. Reason code: JVMPROFILE_ERROR.
DFHSJ0914 E [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r2/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhsj/SJ0914E.html]userid JVMSERVER jvmserver is DISABLED because the Language Environment Enclave was not created.

And, this is a message you see in SYSOUT of the CICS job:
*Exc*: Problem encountered on line 3 of the JVM profile jvmprofile = Illegal Java version. CICS requires Java version 6.0.1.

CAUSE
Attempting to start a JVM server using 64-bit Java V6 as opposed to the minimum level of Java which is V6.0.1.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Use IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS Java Technology Edition, Version 6.0.1 with CICS TS 4.2. You can download this from the main website for Java Version 6.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/tools/java/products/sdk601_64.html].
