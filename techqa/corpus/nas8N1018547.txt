PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The document describes what documents, at a minimum, should be gathered for a backup that did not complete. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Here is the list of documents that should be gathered when the customer has an issue with a backup that did not complete: 

1. The joblog of the actual backup job that did not complete in the form of a spooled file that is created by DSPJOBLOG OUTPUT(*PRINT). 2. A listing of all PTFS on the system obtained by issuing the DSPPTF OUTPUT(*PRINT) command. 3 If using BRMS, the BRMS flight recorders which are found in the IFS directory /tmp/brms. Refer to Rochester Support Center Knowledgebase document N1015780, Copying the BRMS Flight Recorder to a Text File: Database 'DCF Technotes (IBM i)', View 'Products', Document 'Copying the BRMS Flight Recorder to a Text File' [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/icons/doclink.gif] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1015780]. 4. Tape library or drive related failures require the tape flight recorders be collected following Rochester Support Center Knowledgbase document N1019661, QTADMPDV - XPF Tape and SLIC Tape Flight Recorders: Database 'DCF Technotes (IBM i)', View 'Products', Document 'QTADMPDV - XPF Tape and SLIC Tape Flight Recorders' [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/icons/doclink.gif] [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019661]

   Important Note: You must have a PMR created to complete these steps. 
   1. Prepare your files for transfer: 
   
   a. You should compress (if possible) each file, or multiple files, into one zip archive. This will speed up the transfer process and make the overall process easier. 
   
   b. Rename your file(s) prior to transfer. Use the following file naming convention to name your file: 
   
   Caution: The file must use this format to be associated with the PMR; this is the complete PMR record number. Using any other file name will cause the file to be deleted. 
   Enter your PMR record information and file type as follows: 
   xxxxx.bbb.ccc.yyy.zzz 
   
   where: 
   xxxxx = PMR number 
   bbb = Branch 
   ccc = Country code 
   yyy = Unique file name 
   zzz = File type or file extension 
   
   Example 
   
   12345.055.000.collector01_29_Aug_06.zip 
   
   2. From a command prompt, terminal window, or FTP client, FTP to the following site:
