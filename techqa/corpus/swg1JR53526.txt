APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Connecting from IBM Integration Designer to IBM DataPower
   Gateway fails after you upgrade DataPower Gateway to fix pack
   7.0.0.7. You see the following error:
   
   "SSL handshake on the connection to the DataPower appliance
   <host> was not successful. Contact the DataPower administrator.
   The JVM truststore file
   "<WID_HOME>/v7.5/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts" cannot be loaded
   because of I/O problems or format problems with the JVM
   truststore data. Try to create a new truststore file using the
   IBM ikeyman utility located in <WID_HOME>/eclipse/jdk/jre/bin."
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Integration Designer and Data Power Gateway cannot connect
   because SSLv3 protocol is enabled in the DataPower Gateway web
   service plug-in. Because SSLv3 protocol is vulnerable and is not
    supported by every implementation of the Java platform, it must
    be replaced with TLSv1 protocol.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available for IBM Integration Designer that replaces
   SSLv3 protocol with TLSv1 protocol in the DataPower Gateway web
   service plug-in because TLSv1 protocol is the strongest and is
   supported by every implementation of the Java platform.
