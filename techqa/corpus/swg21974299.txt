Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While importing the license file using License Key Administrator, you receive a message "You are attempting to import a floading license on a system that is not a license server". 

SYMPTOM
You get the following dialog box from IBM Rational License Key Administrator with message: 


 * 
 * You are attempting to import a floating license on a system that is not a license server. You must install the Rational License Server software in order to install a floating license. 
 * 
 * Option: 
 * 
 * Close this application and install the Rational License Server from the Rational Solutions for Windows CD. 
 * 
 * Re-open this application and then install this floating license. 
 * 
 *

CAUSE
Most likely you try to import a FLOATING license key to a system that does not have License Key Server installed. 


There are two types of licenses for AppScan Standard, FLOATING and NODELOCKED: 

 * If you have a NODELOCKED license key, then the License Key Administrator is enough to manage the license. 
 * If you have a FLOATING license key, you need to install License Key Server to manage the license. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Download and install License Key Server as described in How to download and install License Key Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21664788]. 

Then use License Key Administrator again to import the license keys.
