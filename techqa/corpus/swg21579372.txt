CAUSE
Customer had installed ClearCase 7.1.1 using the installation Manager from that install, then went to install ClearQuest and got the error part way through the installation. Switching back to using the installation Manager from ClearCase resolved the issue.


ENVIRONMENT
ClearCase 7.1.1 

ClearQuest 7.1.1 

AIX 6.1.TL5 

DB2


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Using the Installation Manager from the ClearCase installation resolve the issue. 

There may have been a difference of Installation Managers between the two installs, and how they handle a integrated install, and the symbolic links for ClearQuest.
