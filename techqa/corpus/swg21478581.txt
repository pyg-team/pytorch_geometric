Title: IBM SPSS/PASW Statistics application hangs when I attempt to create a table or chart - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have successfully installed the latest version of SPSS/PASW Statistics (Windows). I am able to launch the software and open any file. However when I attempt to run an analysis SPSS just hangs. It begins to provide results in the Output Navigator, but from there it just freezes and the only way to exit is by using Ctrl+Alt+Delete. Why is this? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem can point to a conflict with another application. Please run the System Configuration Utility by choosing START->RUN->msconfig. Choose the Startup tab and select the "Disable All" option at the bottom of that dialog box. You will be prompted to restart your machine in order for these changes to take effect. 

Next, re-launch SPSS/PASW Statistics and attempt to run an analysis or create a graph. If so, restart the machine then slowly enable (again within System Configuration Utility) the various Start up Items. Launch SPSS/PASW Statistics each time to ensure that you are still able to successfully run analyses and create charts. This way you will be able to discover the conflicting application and either uninstall it or keep it out of the Start up group.

NOTE: IBM SPSS Technical Support has recieved reports of this problem traced to a conflict with a Brother USB connected printer driver. When the USB printer is selected as the default printer, it causes problems for SPSS. Changing to another printer should solve this conflict.
