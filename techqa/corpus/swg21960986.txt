Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM InfoSphere Discovery (CVE-2015-4000) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 The Logjam Attack on TLS connections using the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol affects IBM InfoSphere Discovery. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-4000 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4000]
DESCRIPTION: The TLS protocol could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to properly convey a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite choice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to force a downgrade to 512-bit export-grade cipher. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to recover the session key as well as modify the contents of the traffic. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Logjam".
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/103294] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM InfoSphere Discovery, IBM InfoSphere Discovery for Information Integration, and IBM InfoSphere Discovery for zOS, versions 4.1.1 and 4.5 on Windows, and version 4.6 running on all platforms

REMEDIATION/FIXES
 

Product VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix All InfoSphere Discovery products 4.6 IT09528 --Apply IT09528 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Discovery&function=fixId&fixids=disc462_security_IT09528*] All InfoSphere Discovery products 4.5 IT09528 --Apply IT09528 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Discovery&function=fixId&fixids=disc45_security_IT09528*] All InfoSphere Discovery products 4.1.1 IT09528 --Apply IT09528 [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?&product=ibm/Information+Management/InfoSphere+Discovery&function=fixId&fixids=disc41_security_IT09528*] As the length of the server key size is increased, the amount of CPU required for full TLS/SSL handshake can significantly increase. Please carefully test and assess the impact to your CPU requirements to ensure sufficient CPU resources, otherwise the system availability may be impacted.

You should verify that applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. If you change the default setting after applying the fix, you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol used in TLS and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
None.
