APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When following the documentation:
   <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.
   6.0/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.custom/topics/tpc_gui_toolbars.
   html?lang=en">http://www-01.ibm.
   com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.6.0/com.ibm.odm.dcenter.
   custom/topics/tpc_gui_toolbars.html?lang=en</a>
   To customize the toolbar of the Decision Center Enterprise
   Console by modifying for example the teamserver-WAS85.
   ear\teamserver.war\custom\tableToolbar.jsp file
   from
    <teamserver:button model="#{TableToolbarBean.create}"/>
   to
    <teamserver:button model="#{TableToolbarBean.create}"
   rendered="#{ManagerBean.administrator}"/>
   The result is that when the Explorer view is first rendered
   when logged as non-administrator, the button is correctly not
   visible.
   But as soon as you click in the explorer tree, the list of
   button changes and the "New" button appears when it should not.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  If the requirement is to control the "New" button, then a good
   alternative is to implement a custom session controller with a
   checkCreate() method that for example only allows
   administrators to see and use the "New" button, and also
   prevent non-admin users to create artifacts from the Compose
   tab:
   public void checkCreate(IlrBaseline baseline, EClass eclass)
   throws IlrPermissionException, IlrObjectNotFoundException {
           if (!session.isUserInRole(IlrPermissionConstants.
   ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE)) {
                   throw new IlrModelPermissionException(
   IlrPermissionConstantsEx.PERMISSION_CREATE, IlrModelInfo.getFQN(
   eclass));
           }
           super.checkCreate(baseline, eclass);
   }
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The method used to evaluate if buttons are displayed does not
   properly handle conditional rendered value
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
