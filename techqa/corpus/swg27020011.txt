ABSTRACT
An intermittent SSL Handshake error can occur when you connect to WebSphere Application Server with the FileNet Configuration Manager or Case Management Administration and Configuration (CMAC) tool.

CONTENT
When you connect to different application servers within the same Configuration Manager or CMAC session, an SSL Handshake error can occur. Usually, once you are connected to a server, you can always connect, even after failing on a different server. 

The workaround is to restart Configuration Manager or CMAC.
