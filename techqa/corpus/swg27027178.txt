 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document provides additional information about IBM Installation Manager for the users installing IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 for the first time. 

CONTENT
IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 features a new installation process based on IBM Installation Manager, the IBM multi-platform installation and configuration management utility. IBM Installation Manager enables streamlined management of the application components and improves enterprise integration. IBM Installation Manager 1.5.0 or higher is a prerequisite for IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 installation. IBM Installation Manager documentation is available at http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/index.jsp]. 

 * Downloading and Installing IBM Installation Manager 
 * Launching IBM Installation Manager 
 * Configuring an installation repository 
 * Installing IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository


Downloading and installing IBM Installation Manager  * If IBM Installation Manager it is not already present on the system, it will be automatically installed when you launch IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services installation from the distribution disk. If you have an older version of IBM Installation Manager, you will be required to update it on as part of the installation.


 * If you do not have the disk and IBM Installation Manager is not present on the system, download and install IBM Installation Manager 1.5.0 from IBM Corp. support site (http://www.ibm.com/support [http://www.ibm.com/support]). For download location, see IBM Installation Manager documentation: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/index.jsp [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/index.jsp].


 * Depending on your system and user setup, IBM Installation Manager can be installed as for a single user, under administrator credentials, or for a user group. For more information, see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html].



Launching IBM Installation Manager 
After installing IBM Installation Manager, you can launch it in wizard or command line mode. 


Wizard mode 
Windows: Start > Programs > IBM Installation Manager or by executing <IBM IM HOME>\eclipse\IBMIM . The default installation directory on Windows is C:\Program Files\IBM\Installation Manager\eclipse. 

UNIX: By executing <IBM IM HOME>/eclipse/IBMIM. The default installation directory on UNIX systems is /opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse. 

For more information about launching Installation Manager in GUI mode, see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/m_starting_im.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/m_starting_im.html]. 

Command-line mode 
IBM Installation Manager is launched in command-line mode by executing <IBM IM HOME>\eclipse\tools\imcl -c. 

For information on IBM Installation Manager default directory locations on different operating systems, see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/r_admin_nonadmin.html#r_admin_nonadmin__installation_settings [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/r_admin_nonadmin.html#r_admin_nonadmin__installation_settings]. 


Configuring an installation repository 
After IBM Installation Manager is launched, the main screen (Wizard mode) or menu (command-line) presents the options to Install, Update, Modify, Manage Licenses, Roll Back, and Uninstall. In order to install with IBM Installation Manager, you must define an installation repository. An installation repository is location (file system or network) of packages. For more information, see http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/t_specifying_repository_locations.html [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r5/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/t_specifying_repository_locations.html]. 

Important! IBM Installation Manager repository must not be confused with IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 

To set up a repository using an installation archive downloaded from IBM Passport Advantage:  1. Expand the downloaded archive file into an arbitrary location, for example, C:\CDS50. The resulting directory structure will include the Server_Repository subdirectory with the diskTag.inf file at the root. 
 2. Configure the repository in IBM Installation Manager:

 *  In wizard mode, from the main screen, select File > Preferences > Repositories and specify the path to the diskTag.inf file. 
 *  In command-line mode, from the main menu, enter P to open the Preferences menu, followed by 1 to configure repositories, and 1 to add a repository. Specify the path to the diskTag.inf file. 


Note: Currently, IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services does not support a direct installation from IBM Passport Advantage (when a Passport Advantage URL is specified as the repository in IBM Installation Manager Preferences). This capability will be added in the future releases. 


Installing IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 
Once the repository has been configured, you can proceed to install. 
 1. On the main menu (GUI or command-line), select Install. 
 2. Select IBM® SPSS® Collaboration and Deployment Services Server as the package to be installed. 
 3. Read the license agreement and accept its terms. 
 4. Specify the package group and the installation directory.  * A new package group is required for IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository install. 
     * Specify the installation directory for shared resources. You can specify the shared resources directory only the first time that you install a package.
    
    
 5. On the feature selection screen/menu no changes are required. Make sure IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0.0.0 and Required Files are selected. 
 6. Review summary information and proceed with the installation. The application files will be installed in the specified directory. Further configuration is necessary. If you are running IBM Installation Manager in GUI mode, the option to start the configuration utility will be presented on the last panel. Configuration can also be started later by running congigTool (GUI) or cliConfigTool (command-line) in <CDS 5 HOME>/bin. 

 * 
 * C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Deployment\5.0\Server\bin\configTool.bat

If problems occur during the installation, you can troubleshoot them using IBM Installation Manager logs. The log files can be accessed from the main menu of IBM Installation Manager.
