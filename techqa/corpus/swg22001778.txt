Title: IBM IIB v10 Toolkit coexistence with previous versions when used with WTX / ITX for Integration Servers - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 It is possible for the IBM Integration Bus (IIB) 10.0.0.x toolkit / IBM Integration Toolkit (IIT) to coexist on a Windows installation with prior Toolkit version, as per documentation at:

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bh25905_.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bh25905_.htm]

However, when you also factor in the IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) / IBM Transformation Extender (ITX) for Integration Servers component, certain configurations can lead to errors, such as having the old version of WTX in the PATH variable. 

SYMPTOM
Various errors related to not finding the dtx plugin software, even after it has been installed:

org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Plug-in com.ibm.websphere.dtx.ui.me was unable to load class com.ibm.websphere.dtx.ui.me.editors.MapEditor.


CAUSE
References to older WTX / ITX versions on the same PC.

ENVIRONMENT
IBM Integration Broker (IIB) 10.0.0.x with IBM Transformation Extender 9.0.0.x on the same PC as older version / combinations, such as WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) 8.0.0.x with WTX 8.4.0.x.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Toolkit reports that it is unable to load the ITX editors, even though the correct install procedure has been followed.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Remove or obfuscate older version with modifications to the environment (renaming of scripts, editing the PATH variable, etc.) to ensure that the 'current' Toolkit is able to start without being able to reference the older versions.
