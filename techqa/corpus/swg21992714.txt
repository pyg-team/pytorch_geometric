 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You are unable to start Domino under the Domino Server Controller (as a Service) after upgrading from Domino 8.5.3 FP6 IF4 to 8.5.3 FP6 IF14. 

You see the following error in the dcntrlr.out file:

WARNING: Attempting to use AES_256, but the JVM only supports a maximum key length of 128. 
WARNING: The JVM should be upgraded to use the JCE unlimited strength jars.



CAUSE
Security updates.

ENVIRONMENT
Domino 8.5.3FP6IF14 Win64

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Upon upgrading to Domino 853FP6IF14, you can no longer start Domino as a Service. The Domino Server Service is not 'Started'. You can start Domino as an Application. 

To investigate Domino Server Controller connections, open your dcntrlr.out file located under Domino\data. You may have several listed therefore you will need to open the one that closely match the date and time of the problem.

dcntrlr.out: 


WARNING: Attempting to use AES_256, but the JVM only supports a maximum key length of 128.

Domino Server Controller exiting: Listener startup timed out. 
Please check if another Server Controller instance is running in the same data directory. 





RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure you are on the appropriate JVM version for your Domino server. You may need to apply a JVM Patch upon upgrading Domino. 

In this case we were able to resolve the problem and start Domino as a Service by applying the latest JVM Patch. For this instance we applied JVM Patch: SR16FP30. 


Type the following server console command to check your Domino JVM version: show jvm
