Enabling the new discovery capabilities 

 * Upgrade the BigFix Inventory server to version 9.2.9. For detailed instructions, see: Upgrading to BigFix Inventory 9.2.9. [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKLLW_9.5.0/com.ibm.bigfix.inventory.doc/Inventory/upgrading/c_upgrading_from_9.html]
   Upgrading the server is required due to the following reasons:  *  Problems with catalog import that occurred in versions 9.2.6 to 9.2.8. For more information, see the technote. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008565] Lack of support for the software catalog in the canoncial 3.0 format in versions earlier than 9.2.5. 
   
   
 * Upload the software catalog to BigFix Inventory. To download the catalog, run the Software Catalog Update fixlet. Then, upload it to BigFix Inventory.
