ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the Websphere Update Installer that comes with the TKLM
   install fails to install, the TKLM installer does not catch
   this and leads to problems as the eWAS fixpack 29 does not
   install and therefore, after the install completes users
   cannot login and use the GUI. To recreate this issue you can
   do the following.
   .
   1. Remove the autorun.inf file from the
   COI\DeploymentSteps\TIP_WUI\FILES\JDK\jre.pak\repository\package
   .java.jre\java\docsdirectory.
   2. Then run product install
   3. Install will complete successfully with no errors reported
   and none seen in the IA-TIPInstall-00.log or any or install
   related logs.
   .
   There are errors reported in the log file for the Websphere
   Update Installer such as:
   .
   (Feb 8, 2011 4:18:10 PM), Install,
   com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.SetExitCodeAction, msg1,
   CWUPI0000I: EXITCODE=1
   (Feb 8, 2011 4:18:10 PM), Install,
   com.ibm.ws.install.ni.ismp.actions.ISMPLogSuccessMessageAction,
   msg1, INSTCONFFAILED
   .
   This problem has been witnessed with version 2.0 of TKLM on
   windows platforms during both a fresh install and install
   migrating from version 1.x to version 2.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager packages the WebSphere Update
   Installer version 7.0.0.7. On Windows, when the WebSphere Update
   Installer version 7.0.0.7 fails, it returns an error code of
   zero (success).  The installer continues with TKLM installation.
   Upgrading to Update Installer version 7.0.0.15 returns a
   non-zero error code.  The TKLM installation fails as expected.
   
   This APAR is an installation issue.  It cannot be fixed by fix
   pack.
