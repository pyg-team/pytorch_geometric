 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® SDK Java™ Technology Edition, Version 8.0, which is used by IBM Development Package for Apache Spark. These issues are disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in July 2017. These vulnerabilities could affect the negotiation and use of certain sets of ciphers, based on DSA keys, where secure communications (SSL/TLS) have been enabled (off by default in Apache Spark).

If you run your own Java code using the IBM Java Runtime delivered with this product, you should evaluate your code to determine whether the complete list of vulnerabilities are applicable to your code. For a complete list of vulnerabilities please refer to the link for "IBM Java SDK Security Bulletin" located in the "References" section for more information.
