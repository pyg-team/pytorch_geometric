APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The MTEMS code does not examine the bit mode of the KMQ agent
   before trying to update the mq.cfg file. It only looks in the
   32-bit TEMA directory. It should look in the directory that
   matches the bit mode of the agent being changed.
   
   Environment:
     Any 64-bit Windows platform on which the 64-bit KMQ Messaging
     product is installed.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
    1. Install the MQ agent and configuration agent
    2. Create Queue Managers, named QM1 and QM2;
    3. On MTEMS (kinconfg.exe) GUI, click "create
   multiple-instance",
       and add QM1 and QM2 to "selected instances", then press OK
    4. Check the mq_QM1.cfg and mq_QM2.cfg file in TMAITM6_x64
       directory. Without the fix nothing will change, with the fix
       the new Queue Managers will be configured.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure the instances independently of each other, as single
    instances.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services Create
   multiinstance does not work for WebSphere MQ Monitoring Agent on
    the Composite Application Manager Agents for WebSphere
   Messaging image.  Create Multiinstance only supports 32-bit MQ
   agent currently.  The 64-bit agent is not supported.  The error
   occurs when a 64-bit MQ agent is installed and Create
   Mulitinstance is selected to monitor multiple queues.  The error
    exists on Windows platforms.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code updated to test for configuration file in the 64-bit agent
   directory and if found create multiinstances from that
   configuration file.  If configuration file is not found in the
   64-bit directory revert to configuration of the 32-bit agent
   instances.
