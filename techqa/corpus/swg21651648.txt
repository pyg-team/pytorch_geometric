ABSTRACT
 IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) for z/OS, V8.5.1, the next generation of business rules, provides an elegant development environment, along with a dedicated business user interface, for automating and governing frequently occurring, repeatable business decisions.

Overview:


The offering provides end-to-end, lifecycle support for business decisions invoked from Java , COBOL, and PL/I applications. This includes capabilities for decision testing and simulation within either the Rule Execution Server (RES) in the WebSphere® Application Server for z/OS or the zRule Execution Server (zRES) for z/OS environments, as well as the ability to trace the execution of how a business decision is made in the zRule Execution Server using the Decision Warehouse feature. 

IBM ODM for z/OS provides multiple, business-rule execution choices for z/OS customers who have Java , Enterprise COBOL, and PL/I applications, running as Batch, IMS™ Batch, IMS Message Processing Programs or hosted within CICS® V4.2 or CICS V5.1 regions. 

IBM ODM for z/OS , V8.5.1 is designed to provide a smoother transition than the tool used in previous releases, whether it is reusing rules across applications, operating in different language environments, expanding decision management into PL/I applications, or even moving from version to version. Also new with Version 8.5.1 is the ability to keep track of how the software is being used, on a decision basis. 

IBM ODM for z/OS and IBM Business Rules for z/OS , available as a separate product, help enable organizations in virtually every industry to improve the quality of transaction, batch, and process-related decisions that are made repeatedly within mainframe applications and to determine the appropriate courses of action for customers, partners, and internal interactions by: 

 * Automating and governing operational decision making across business processes and applications to help improve business outcomes. 
 * Helping detect opportunities and risks in real time 
 * Easily and consistently implementing changes to help meet new market demands or policy requirements. 
 * Supporting incremental modernization of existing CICS , IMS , and batch applications written in Java , COBOL, or PL/I without a complete re-write. 
 * Facilitating consistent decision evaluation across platforms, projects, and processes by allowing the reuse of business models between rule projects in z/OS and distributed applications. 
 * Detecting events and event patterns in real time to enable situational awareness and response of actionable situations. 
 * Automating the response of highly variable decisions based on the specific context of a process, transaction, or interaction. 
 * Managing and governing rules-based decision logic separately from application code in order to provide better visibility, understanding, and maintainability compared to traditional application development. 
 * Providing visibility to business users on how business decisions are made. 
 * Integrating with a number of other z/OS technologies to create comprehensive decision management solutions written in Java , COBOL, or PL/I, using CICS , IMS , or z/OS batch execution environments.
