APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  For DB2 Admin Tool processing ALC line command from panel ADB21T
   .
   1. Panels ADB26RC and ADB26LC do not handle " ? " for lookup
      correctly.
   .
      Using ALTER Table Column (ALC line command) displays panel
      ADB27C where COMMENT or LABEL values can be added or modified
        Line command   Function   Results in panel
            COM        COMMENT    ADB26RC
            LAB        LABEL      ADB26LC
   .
      Entering ? from either ADB26RC or ADB26LC fails to produce
      the desired lookup list and returns to panel ADB27C where
      column ' operation type ' shows 'UPDATE' even though no value
      was entered for either a COMMENT or LABEL.
   .
   2. If the COM or LAB line commands are entered for a column that
      is being inserted, panel ADB26RC or ADB26LC is displayed with
      no values for: Table owner, Table name, and column name.
   .
   3. Panels ADB26RC and ADB26LC allow the column name to be
      changed to a non-existent column name, resulting in rc1012
      in step CNVRT50 with msgadbc139e as shown below:
         ADBC139E INTFIN and LOADIN mismatch. Colnames not Equal
   .
   4. Panels ADB26RC and ADB26LC allow Table owner and Table name
      to be changed.
