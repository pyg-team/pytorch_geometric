PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All SA z/OS V3R1 customers.                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When an APL resource is coded as        *
   *                      external start INITIAL it is possible   *
   *                      that the APL will also be started       *
   *                      twice.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   An APL resource coded as external start INITIAL should not be
   started more than once when its parent is also involved in the
   start-up.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Automation logic deck INGLOGIC has been changed to ensure an
   INITIAL external start is honored for an APL resource.
