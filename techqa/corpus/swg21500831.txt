Title: IBM Change LDAP bind user and/or password in Federated Repository - United States

Text:
Federated Repository; bind user; bind password; ADMN0022E; LDAP 49; Helper file; wp-update-federated-ldap TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 After you configured multiple Federated Repositories in your WebSphere Portal security, sometimes you may have to change the bind user ID and/or password. For example, due to company password policy, the password must be changed every 90 days. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The ConfigEngine task "wp-update-federated-ldap" can be used for this purpose. For purposes of updating the LDAP bind user password, normally, you only need to specify/change the following three parameters in wkplc.properties, 

 * federated.ldap.id= // this parameter specifies which LDAP repository you want to update 
 * federated.ldap.bindDN= // specify the full distinguished name of the bind user 
 * federated.ldap.bindPassword= // specify the NEW password of the bind user.


It is also highly recommended to verify other parameters in the wkplc.properties and make sure they are correct. A full list of these parameters is presented at the end of this technote. 

 

After making sure the values of three required parameters are set, please, and, optionally checking the other parameters are still valid, issue the following command, 

ConfigEngine.sh wp-update-federated-ldap 

 

If WasUserid and WasPassword are not set in wkplc.properties, you have to specify them on command line. 

Note: This configuration task makes no changes to the LDAP itself, it only updates the WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Portal configurations. 

 

Some considerations 

1. The configuration task "wp-update-federated-ldap" reads the three parameters specified above, and, all of the other parameters from wkplc.properties, and commits the values of those parameters into the configuration. Therefore, If multiple LDAPs were configured in the Federated Repositories, be sure the rest of the parameters are verified and correctly set for the LDAP that is being updated, because the last added LDAP may not be the one you are trying to update here. Due to this reason, it's strongly recommended to use individual helper files for each LDAP, so they will not interfere with each other during configuration and later updates. 

2. Let's call the LDAP repository the primary LDAP where WAS primary administrative user resides. If the bind password of the primary LDAP is to be updated using the procedure in this technote, conduct the procedure to change the bind password before the actual user's password is changed in the LDAP. Otherwise, the task may fail with WebSphere error ADMN0022E and LDAP error code 49. 

3. The function of resetting the bind user ID and password can also be done by "updateIdMgrLDAPServer" in IdMgrRepositoryConfig using wsadmin tool in WebSphere Application Server. See the link in reference below.
