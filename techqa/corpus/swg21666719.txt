CAUSE
The Illegal group reference errors are thrown due to special characters like $ or # mentioned in the SAM Server username value defined in the probe property SamServerUserName.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Make sure that there are no special characters in the SamServerUserName. 

If there are, request the Alcatel SAM administrator to provide a new ASCII only username for use with the probe. 

When the new username is provided ensure that the SAMServerPassword property is updated as well as the SamServerUserName.
