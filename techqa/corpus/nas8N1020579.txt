Title: IBM Communication / Firewall settings required for BRMS - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 What types of communication does BRMS use and what firewall ports need to be open for BRMS to function properly? 

ANSWER
BRMS uses TCP and/or SNA, DDM, and DRDA. SNA will not be discussed in this document. 

For the most current detailed information on BRMS networking, please see the BRMS wiki at: 


https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Backup%2C%20Recovery%20and%20Media%20Services%20%28BRMS%29%20for%20i/page/Networking [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Backup%2C%20Recovery%20and%20Media%20Services%20%28BRMS%29%20for%20i/page/Networking]


When BRMS needs to communicate with another node in it's network it first issues a PING. If the PING fails BRMS doesn't bother taking the next step such as creating a DDM file for the remote node or making a DRDA connection. 

 

From a firewall perspective the PING is ICMP Echo and Echo Reply. These must be allowed to pass through the firewall. If this is not an option the following command can be used to configure BRMS to stop using the PING command:

CRTDTAARA DTAARA(QUSRBRM/Q1ANOPING) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(1)

For information on what ports are used for DDM and DRDA see the following link in the BRMS wiki:
