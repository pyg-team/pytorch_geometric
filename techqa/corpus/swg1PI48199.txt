APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If a a search for a group is triggered from within a project,
   AND, that group has not been created directly through Portal OR
   has never been accessed by Portal before, that search in the
   project will not find the group.
   Further, this set of actions will create an an invalid data
   structure in the Portal database.  As a result, the group will
   never again become visible in Portal, even outside a project
   and after server restart.  If you can find the group in the
   WAS/DMGR console but not in Portal - this is a sign this set of
   conditions has been met.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  A code fix for this issue is integrated into the WebSphere
   Portal & WCM Combined Cumulative Fix 08 (PI45447 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI45447]) for Portal
   8.5.0.0 available from Fix Central:

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In case the problem already occurred, it is not sufficient to
   install this APAR as there is invalid data in the Portal DB
   already. In that case, please take a backup of the portal DB
   tables (especially release.USER_DESC and release.PROT_RES_DRAFT
   and then execute the following SQL statements to delete the
   invalid data records from DB:
   
   DELETE FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC WHERE UNIQUE_ID IN (SELECT
   EXTERNAL_UID FROM RELEASE.PROT_RES_DRAFT WHERE RES_TYPE=8)
   
   DELETE FROM RELEASE.PROT_RES_DRAFT WHERE RES_TYPE=8
   
   Afterwards, when searching for the groups again and with this
   APAR installed, the group should be visible, both in project and
   outside.
