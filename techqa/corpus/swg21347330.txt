CAUSE
Invalid cache files inside Controller cache folder. 

This is located inside the end user's Windows user profile. 
More Information:
Controller stores cache and configuration files inside a 'cache' folder called 'CCR'.  * By default, this is located inside each end-user's Windows profile, in the following location:
   %appdata%\Cognos\CCR


For example, on modern versions of Windows, this translates to a folder similar to:  * C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Cognos\ccr



Under exceptional circumstances (for example, if the Controller client unexpectedly crashes due to a problem/bug) then this 'CCR' folder may contain files that are out-of-date (or contain invalid data)  * These 'invalid cache files' then can cause this error message


Specifically, this error is often caused when the two types of cache files (*.DSS and *.DSD) are mismatched. 
DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In general the trigger (root cause) for why this cache has become corrupt is typically that Controller has recently crashed unexpectedly for the end user. There are a huge possible number of causes for this crash. To identify the cause, ask the end user to record the error message that was displayed when Controller originally crashed, and search through the IBM Technotes knowledgebase for this error.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Long-Term fix: 

Upgrade to latest version of Controller, to avoid known code production issues (bugs) in the Controller software. 

 

Short-Term workaround: 

Delete the invalid cache files. 

 

Steps: 

There are several different different methods of how to clear the end user's cache files. 

 * Choose the method that is best for your environment.


Method #1 - 100% reset Cognos user profile for the end user. 
This is probably the easiest for most situations. 

 * This will reset the end user's Controller client configuration to all the 'default' options.


1. Logon to the client device (for example the end user's PC, or the Citrix/Terminal server) 
2. Browse to the end user's %APPDATA% location  * TIP: By default, this is located here: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\


3. Open the subfolder 'Cognos' 
4. Rename the subfolder "CCR" to " CCR.OLD" 

In other words, the net effect is that this folder has now been renamed to: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Cognos\CCR.OLD 

5. If the end users have any 'local preferences' then they will need to recreate them  * TIP: Follow the advice inside IBM Technote article #1347177.


TIPS:  * If you are deploying Controller via Citrix (or Terminal Server) then you will need to perform the above steps on *all* the Citrix/TS servers (that publish the Controller application) 
 * If you use 'roaming profiles, you will *also* need to perform the above steps on the location where the profiles are stored (for example: \\fileserver\share\username\...)



Method #2 - Delete only the cache files for the end user. 
Delete all *.DSS and *.DSD files in the user's Windows profile: 

1. Logon to the client PC as the affected end-user 
2. Browse to the end user's %APPDATA% location  * TIP: By default, this is located here: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\


3. Open the subfolder 'Cognos' 
4. Open the subfolder 'CCR' 
5. (Search for and then) delete all the files which end in * .DSS and * .DSD 
6. Test 

TIP: If the problem remains, also rename the file ccr.config to ccr.config.old (and re-try )  * However, doing this will mean that the end user will lose all of his/her 'local preferences', and some of their 'customised' settings. Therefore, you must ensure that all users recreate any 'local preferences' that they may need. For example, follow the advice inside IBM Technote article #1347177
