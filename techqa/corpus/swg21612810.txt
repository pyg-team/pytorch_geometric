PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The IBM Business Monitor V8.0 server is running but users are unable to connect to it via a web browser. 

SYMPTOM
The startServer.log shows that the server has started: 

ADMU3000I: Server server1 open for e-business; process id is 10943 

 

The SystemOut.log shows that a FFDC Incident was emitted during startup along with exception message: 

WSVR0501E: Error creating component com.ibm.ws.channelfw.secure.FirstChannelActions 

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibmws.process.linuxutil.ThreadUtil (initialization failure) 

 

The FFDC file shows:
FFDC Exception:java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError SourceId:null ProbeId:1011 Reporter:com.ibm.ws.runtime.component.ContainerHelper@81c1141
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.ibm.ws.process.linuxutil.ThreadUtil (initialization failure)
Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Ws60ProcessManagement (/opt/IBM/MonV8/cognos/bin64/libfreebl3.so: version `NSSRAWHASH_3.12.3' not found (required by /lib64/libcrypt.so.1))


CAUSE
The libfreebl3.so file shipped with Cognos V10.1.1 is not compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x. The IBM Business Monitor server fails to start because Cognos fails to start.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Add the following like to the .profile, .bashrc, or appropiate login initialization script for the Cognos user account: 

export LD_PRELOAD=/lib64/libfreebl3.so
