APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is a follow up to the Defect 96609 that was fixed with
   EOWIN for ODM on Cloud
   In decision artifacts tab, when you edit the DT, the  "Download
   
   ths decision table as an Excel File" leads to corrupted file
   name when the DT name is in Japanese and the DT is being
   displayed.
   To reproduce on the Business Console:
   1) In Decision Artifacts tab, create (or rename) any DT so that
   
   the DT name contains some Japanese Character, for instance
   "&#244;&#183;&#251;{&#238;&#219;DT" (you can copy-paste this name if you don't have any
   Japanese Input Method installed on your machine).
   2) Edit the table
   3) Click on the " Download the Selected decision tables as an
   Excel File" button.
   Prior to the fix for Defect 96609, the download was failing.
   Now it does perform the download, so this is a great
   improvement.
   However, the name of the file being downloaded is corrupted (
   see attachment 37959)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Instead of editing the table you want to download, select it,
   and use the "Download the selected decision tables as an Excel
   file" instead.
   This download works fine, file name is not corrupted.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  In decision artifacts tab, when editing a DT, the "download
   this decision table as Excel File" leads to corrupted file name
   when the DT name is in Japanese.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed.
