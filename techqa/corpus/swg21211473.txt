QUESTION
What versions of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server are considered a supported configuration for Lotus Notes®?

ANSWER
For information about supported configurations of Citrix products and Lotus Notes, refer to the Release Notes [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/documentation/releasenotes/] for your Lotus Notes version or the technote "Supported configurations and support policy for Citrix products" (#1098489 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=475&uid=swg21098489]). 

Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server 3.0 is a supported configuration beginning with Lotus Notes 7.0. For the Notes 6.5.x codestream, support begins with Notes 6.5.5 and later releases of 6.5x.

For Citrix Presentation Server 4.0, testing has been completed, and it is now a supported configuration for Lotus Notes, beginning with Notes 7.0.1 and 7.0.2 and Notes 6.5.5 and 6.5.6. 

The 7.0.1 release notes support statement reads as follows:

 * 1Citrix ICA stands for Citrix® Independent Computing Architecture. It is the "thin" protocol that enables Citrix to separate screen updates and user input processing from the rest of the application’s logic. When using a Citrix ICA client, all application logic executes on the server and only screen updates, mouse movements and keystrokes are transmitted via the Citrix ICA session."


Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 is a supported configuration for Notes 7.0.3 and the Lotus Notes 8 client (Basic Configuration). Support for the Notes 8 client (Standard Configuration) is available with the Notes 8.0.1 release. For additional details about the Notes client configurations, refer to "What's new in Lotus Notes 8 client?" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=475&uid=swg21264877] (# 1264877) and "What's new in Notes and Domino 8.0.1?" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=475&uid=swg21292420] (1292420) .
