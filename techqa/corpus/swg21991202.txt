Title: IBM Indexing error in Content Search Services for ICCMail2 migrated documents - United States

Text:
icc; p8; migration TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Error is reported in Content Search Services (CSS) for email documents that are migrated using the IBM Content Collector (ICC) email data migration tool. AFUI0061E No value could be extracted for the mandatory attribute 
'ICCMailboxID'. This document could not be processed and will not be

indexed. 

SYMPTOM
The following error is reported in the CSS log: 

AFUI0061E No value could be extracted for the mandatory attribute 'ICCMailboxID'. This document could not be processed and will not be indexed.


CAUSE
There may be orphaned ICCMail2 objects (i.e. objects that did not have a corresponding ICCMailInstance2 object) due to issues from running older versions of ICC.


ENVIRONMENT
ICC with email ingested to P8 4.5.1 and P8 is migrated to 5.1, 5.2 or above.
ICC email data migration has been performed.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Upgrade to 4.0.1.0-IBM-ICC-P8CSS-LA009 or later.
This upgrade is only for the ICC CSS support that was installed on the CSS server. You do not need to change the ICC server.

On the IBM Content Collector Server:

1. Open Configuration Manager.

2. Navigate to General Settings > Content Search Service Support > Support for Email > Custom Settings and add the following entries below the custom attributes and custom archive attributes:

[Settings]
*EmailProcessUnknownMimeTypes=true
*MandatoryAttributeWithoutValueAborts=false


Restart the CSS service to take effect.
