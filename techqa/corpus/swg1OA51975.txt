APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS UNREPRODUCIBLE IN NEXT RELEASE.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The original design of the RMF III support in IBM Tivoli Event
   Pump for z/OS was that the EIF probe would see an EIF event with
   the _F37=FALSE attribute and, using rules supplied by the Event
   Pump product, set up the event as a "clearing" (resolution)
   event for Netcool.
   
   When changes were made to provide better event descriptions for
   the various metrics in the set of RMF III-related EIF events,
   there was no provision for the "clearing" events.
   
   Therefore, updates need to be made to the Tivoli EIF probe's
   rules file(s) to account for these events, so that they are
   managed according to best practices.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually add logic to the Tivoli EIF probe's rules files so that
   these events are handled as required, or to best practice event
   handling.

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After a metric provided by RMF has      *
   *                      exceeded an exception threshold defined *
   *                      to Event Pump and Event Pump has sent   *
   *                      an EIF event, when Event Pump learns    *
   *                      that the exception has "cleared", i.e.  *
   *                      that metric returns to a value below    *
   *                      the exception threshold value, Event    *
   *                      Pump sends an EIF event indicating      *

   *                      exists, but the exception is not        *

   *                      changed to green color and allowed to   *
   *                      roll out of the view as additional      *
   *                      events arrive.                          *
   ****************************************************************
   When Event Pump sends an EIF event indicating that a particular
   RMF metric has gone below the configured exception threshold
   (that is, "cleared") after the metric had been above the
   exception threshold, and that EIF event is sent to an EIF probe,
   the probe, if using the rules provided in sample
   zos_rmf_event.rules, does not map the EIF event attributes to
   ObjectServer database entry attributes in such a way as to cause
   the prior exception to be "cleared" in the Netcool OMNIbus event
   viewer.  Particularly for RMF metrics that are recognized due
   to rules and other configuration Event Pump provides in
   RMF-related samples, the rules do not enable the EIF probe to
   indicate that the event was, indeed, a "clearing" event.  As
   a result, the corresponding event in Netcool OMNIbus event
   viewer is not "cleared" and appears to the user as if the
   RMF metric is still indicating a potential problem.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  Sample rules file zos_rmf_event.rules is being changed to
   map an EIF event attribute indicating that an RMF metric's
   exception condition no longer exists to attributes for an
   Netcool OMNIbus ObjectServer entry that indicate the exception
   condition no longer exists (has "cleared").  As a result, the
   entry for the event in Netcool OMNIbus' event viewer will be
   presented in a fashion to indicate the exception condition has
   cleared.
   
   Read-me file 4.2.2.10-TIV-EP-FP0010.README is being created,
   and it will describe what is being provided by the fix
   packages for this APAR, as well as provide additional
   support information.
   
   The fix for this APAR will be contained in these fix packages:
   
     4.2.2.10-TIV-EP-FP0010.zip (Windows platform)
     4.2.2.10-TIV-EP-FP0010.tar (UNIX/Linux platform)
   
   which will be available by January 19, 2018, and may be
   downloaded at that time using the "Fixes, updates, and
   drivers" link on the IBM Support web page at
   https://www.ibm.com/support. [https://www.ibm.com/support.]
   
   These fix packages are cumulative, meaning that they also
   contain all features/fixes from the prior feature/fix
   packages for IBM Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS V4R2M2.
