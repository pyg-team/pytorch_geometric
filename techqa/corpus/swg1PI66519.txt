APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  An agent log shows the error: "java.lang.RuntimeException: Error
   process plugin runtime message" and "Caused by:
   java.io.IOException: Unable to delete" for [some file
   path]/stdOut.txt.
   
   When an agent has finished executing a process step, the server
   sends a command to the agent to upload the output log file from
   the agent to the server. The server also sends a command to the
   agent to clean-up after the process step, which includes
   deleting the output log file.  The problem happens when the
   command to clean-up the process step is sent to the agent before
   the agent has finished uploading the log file to the server.
   
   In this case, the agent cannot delete the file because it is "in
   use" for the upload to the server, and the agent logs an error
   message indicating that it cannot delete a file.
