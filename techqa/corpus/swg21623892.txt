Title: IBM Portal 8 CF03 Installation Fails on 'action-start-portal-server-standard' task - United States

Text:
Portal 8 Install CF03 action-start-portal-server-standard TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
The Portal 8 installation executes a ConfigEngine script called 'action-start-portal-server-standard'. This script tries to start the server. It fails at this point - because the server is already started.

SYMPTOM
In the ConfigTrace.log the following error is seen:

action-start-portal-server-standard:
[logmsg] [01/29/13 12:57:34.444 CET] EJPCA3163I: Starting Server
"WebSphere_Portal"
[echo] 'WebSphere_Portal' seems to be stopped.

[exec] ADMU3028I: Conflict detected on port 10025. Likely causes:

[exec] ADMU1211I: To obtain a full trace of the failure, use the

[exec] ADMU0211I: Error details may be seen in the file:
[exec]
/opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile/logs/WebSphere_Portal/startServer.log
--- Exception Thrown ---


CAUSE
If the monitoring policy "Node Restart State" does not have the value "STOPPED", it fails at this point - because the server is already started.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In the ConfigTrace.log related to this install look for task 'action-start-portal-server-standard' and it will show the error:

[exec]
com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException: ADMU3027E: An
[exec] instance of the server may already be running:
WebSphere_Portal

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The Monitoring Policy - "Node Restart State" - must be disabled as follows:-
1. Log in to the DMGR
2. Navigate to Servers -> Application Servers -> WebSphere_Portal ->
Java and Process Management -> Monitoring Policy
3. Change the value for "Node Restart State". It should be "STOPPED".
4. Save changes and synchronize the node.
5. Redo the CumulativeFix install.
