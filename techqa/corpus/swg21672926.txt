PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Java Exception after system failure. 

SYMPTOM
Executing a single flow causes a crash and an exception is contained within the wtxlogger log file. 


CAUSE
After a system failure some runtime library / component is corrupted and java fails to load and initialise IBM WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender (WTX) API.

ENVIRONMENT
Running a WTX map using Sterling Integrator.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
After a system failure the wtxlogger log file contains the following error : 

com.ibm.websphere.dtx.dtxpi.MException: Function failed - Native 
function: Java_com_ibm_websphere_dtx_dtxpi_MMap_initializeAPI. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If using Resource Registry check that the .mrc and .mrn files are not corrupt. You can check this by opening the .mrc and .mrn using the command server.

If the resource registry files are not corrupt then re-install as there is some other corruption.
