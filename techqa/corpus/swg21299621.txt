Title: IBM Installing and configuring WebSphere Integration Developer on Citrix Presentation Server - United States

v61rnotes; Citrix; server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Starting with WebSphere Integration Developer version 6.0.1.1, you can install and run WebSphere Integration Developer on a Citrix Presentation Server. Multiple users can then connect remotely from their Citrix Presentation Server Clients. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Follow these instructions to install and configure WebSphere Integration Developer to run on Citrix Presentation Server: 

 1. When you install WebSphere Integration Developer on the server, ensure that you are logged on as a user with Administrator access.
    
    
 2. After installing, ensure that the install directory is read-only. This is the product directory, not the shared install directory. This step will ensure that the configuration information is written in the home directory. If this measure is not taken, all users will end up using the same location for their configuration area, which is not supported.
    
    Note: Ensure that client users are granted write permission of the following directory otherwise the UTE server status cannot be detected:
    
    <WID_install_root>\runtimes\base_v61_stub\ 
    
 3. When launching WebSphere Integration Developer from a client, the workspace is created in a directory specified by the user. 
    
    
 4. In order to use the servers in the test environment, a profile is required for each non-root user. The product installer (who can be a root/Administrator or non-root user) can grant write permission to the appropriate WebSphere Process Server files and directories to other non-root users. The non-root users can then create profiles. Alternatively, the product installer can create a group for users who are authorized to create profiles or give individual users the authority to create profiles. The following example task shows how to create a group that is authorized to create profiles.


Throughout this text, the terms "installer" and "product installer" refer to the user ID that installed WebSphere Integration Developer. 

The installer can perform the following steps to create the profilers group and give the group appropriate permission's to create a profile.  1. Log on to the WebSphere Integration Developer system as the product installer (the product installer can be a root/Administrator or non-root user).
    
    
 2. Using operating system commands, do the following:  * Create a group named profilers, which will contain all users who can create profiles. 
     * Create a user named user1, who can create profiles. 
     * Add users product_installer and user1 to the profilers group.

 4. As the product installer, use operating system tools to change directory and file permission's.

    export WASHOME=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/ProcServer
    echo $WASHOME
    echo "Performing chggrp/chmod per WAS directions..."
    chgrp profilers $WASHOME/logs/manageprofiles
    chmod g+wr $WASHOME/logs/manageprofiles
    chgrp profilers $WASHOME/properties
    chmod g+wr $WASHOME/properties
    chgrp profilers $WASHOME/properties/fsdb
    chmod g+wr $WASHOME/properties/fsdb
    chgrp profilers $WASHOME/properties/profileRegistry.xml
    chmod g+wr $WASHOME/properties/profileRegistry.xml
    chgrp -R profilers $WASHOME/profileTemplates 
    Icon indicating HP-UX platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=5] Issue the following additional command where profile_template_name is default, dmgr, or managed, respectively: 
    chmod -R g+wr $WASHOME/profileTemplates/profile_template_name/documents 
    The ownership of files is preserved when the files are copied to the profile directory during profile creation. You granted write permission to the profile directory so that files copied to the profile directory can be modified as part of the profile creation process. Files that are already in the profileTemplate directory structure prior to the start of profile creation are not modified during profile creation. 
    Icon indicating Linux platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=6] Issue the following additional commands: 
    chgrp profilers $WASHOME/properties/Profiles.menu
    chmod g+wr $WASHOME/properties/Profiles.menu 
    Icon indicating Windows platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=7] The following example assumes that the variable $WASHOME is the WebSphere Process Server root installation directory C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\ProcServer. Follow instructions in the Windows documentation to give the profilers group read and write permission to the following directories and their files: 
    @WASHOME\logs\manageprofiles
    @WASHOME\properties
    @WASHOME\properties\fsdb
    @WASHOME\properties\profileRegistry.xml 
    You might have to change the permissions on additional files if the non-root user encounters permission errors. For example, if the product installer authorizes a non-root user to delete a profile, then product installer might have to delete the following file: 
    Icon indicating Linux platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=8]Icon indicating UNIX platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=9] 
    install_root/properties/profileRegistry.xml_LOCK 
    Icon indicating Windows platforms [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299621&amp;aid=10] 
    install_root\properties\profileRegistry.xml_LOCK 
    Give write access to the non-root user for the file to authorize the user to delete the file. If the non-root user still cannot delete the profile, then the product installer can delete the profile. 
    

Result 
The installer created the profilers group and gave the group proper permission's to certain directories and files to create profiles. These directories and files are the only ones in the installation root of WebSphere Integration Developer to which a non-root user needs to write to create profiles.
