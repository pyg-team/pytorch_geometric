QUESTION
 How can you use CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) to recover most of the data sets in a large ISMF data set list, and not enter VSAMREC as a line operator against every desired data set? 

ANSWER
Use one of the following approaches: 

 * Enter the HIDE line operator or FILTER list command to temporarily "hide" the data sets that do not need to be recovered from the list. These commands do not permanently change the contents of the list. They only change what is currently displayed in the list. You can then enter VSAMREC as a list command to recover only the data sets that are displayed on the ISMF data set list. You can then enter RESHOW to add the items to the list that were hidden by the HIDE line operator, and REFRESH to add the items to the list that were hidden by the HIDE and FILTER commands. 
   
   
 * Enter VSAMREC as a list command for the entire ISMF data set list and then deselect the data sets that do not need to be recovered on the CICS VR VSAM sphere list.
