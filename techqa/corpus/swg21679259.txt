Title: IBM Single sign off for WebSEAL and Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How can I configure Single Sign Off (SSO) for WebSEAL and Dashboard Application Services Hub (DASH) so that when a user logs out from DASH it logs the user out from WebSEAL too? 

SYMPTOM
If a user logs out from DASH it does not log out the user from WebSEAL automatically. Refreshing the page let's the user log in to WebSEAL without entering a user Id and password. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The URL below partially covers this topic so take a look into this first.

Please follow steps below to resolve this issue: 

 1. Make a backup copy of file below:
    <JazzHOME>/profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications/isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF/customizationProperties.xml
    
    
 2. Edit the file and change line below as follows:
    
    <consoleproperties:console-property id="TAMJunctionName" value="" /> 
    to
    <consoleproperties:console-property id="TAMJunctionName" value="/" /> 
    
    
 3. Change line below and set the value of TAMLogoutPage to the desired logout page (eg; https://host:port/logoutoutpage) or leave it empty (""). If a logout page is specified then the logout request will be redirected to that page otherwise logout request will be redirected to default WebSEAL logout page (https://hostname:port/pkmslogout). value=""/> 
 4. Restart the DASH server. 
 5. Close Web browser windows completely and then login to the DASH server. 
 6. Test if logout works as desired. 


Following steps applies if you want to redirect the logout request to a page on a different server than the current server on which JazzSM/WebSphere is installed (by default, WAS requires that the URL for the logoutExitPage be on the same host where WAS is running). If needed then follow below steps for this configuration: 

 1. Suppose you want the logout request be directed to: https://host2.com/pkmslogout or https://www.google.com or any other external URL. Set the value for TAMLogoutPage to desired URL in the line below: value=""/> 
    
 2. Login to the Websphere Admin Console and then click on: 
    Security > Global Security > Custom Properties panel and add one of the following properties per your requirement:
    
    a). Add the following property and set its value to the desired logout page on an other host (eg; "https://host2.com/pkmslogout").
