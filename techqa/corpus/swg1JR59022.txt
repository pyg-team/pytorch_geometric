APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When an IBM Business Process Manager V8.6 Process Server
   connects to a Process Center from IBM BPM V8.5.7.0 CF2016.06 or
   earlier, it is taken offline.
   
   In the Process Center console, you see a warning message similar
   to this message:
   
   Server X was taken offline because its version 8.6.0.0 is not
   supported for online servers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None. For snapshot deploy, use offline deployment. See
   "Installing snapshots onto an offline server using wsadmin
   commands and custom installation packages"
   (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.7/com.ib
   m.wbpm.admin.doc/topics/t_installingsnapshots_custom_scripting.h
   tml).
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Process Center and Process Server can't connect if their
   versions are not comparable. As a result, online deployment is
   impossible.
   
   PRODUCTS AFFECTED
   IBM BPM Advanced
   IBM BPM Standard

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A fix is available in IBM BPM V8.5.6 CF02 that corrects the
   version comparison between Process Center and Process Server.
   
   Note: The interim fix JR59022 applies to Process Center only.
   Upgrading Process Server to latest version will not resolve the
   issue.
