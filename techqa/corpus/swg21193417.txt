PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Collecting data for Cluster RippleStart problems with the IBM WebSphere Application Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Collecting data for Cluster RippleStart problems with the IBM WebSphere Application Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support will help familiarize you with the troubleshooting process and save you time.

To improve the accuracy of complete data collection, IBM recommends you use the automated data collectors within IBM Support Assistant. Not only will the automated collector gather the equivalent of the manual process, it will also provide a secure file transfer of the collection to IBM.

COLLECTING DATA USING THE IBM SUPPORT ASSISTANT DATA COLLECTOR
 1.  
 2.  WebSphere Application Server V8.0.0.6
 3.  
 4.  (ISADC)
 5.  
 6.  ISADC
 7.  
 8.  Using the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector.
 9.  
 10. 
 11. 
 12. Using the ISA Data Collector:  * To run ISADC from command line, go to your app_server_root/bin directory and run isadc.[sh|bat]
        
        
      *  To download, install and run ISADC locally:
        > Obtain the IBM Support Assistant Data collector online ISA Data Collector site for WebSphere Application Server. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/isa/isadc/?taxonomy=ApplicationServer] 
        
        >  >  Select the option to collect from this or another system using a downloadable utility. Download and extract the zip file to your WAS_HOME directory. From a command line, run isadc.[sh|bat] or launch index.html to use the web interface.
        
        
        
        
     
     
 13.  To download and run ISADC in your browser: 
     > Obtain the IBM Support Assistant Data collector online ISA Data Collector site for WebSphere Application Server. [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/isa/isadc/?taxonomy=ApplicationServer] 
     
     >  Select the option to collect from this system using the current browser and click Start Collection.
     
     
     
 14. Select the Administration > Cluster Ripple Start Problem collector and click Start.
     
     
 15. Follow the prompts to automatically submit the collected data to IBM Support.

COLLECTING DATA MANUALLY
 1. Stop all servers and clear the entire log directory for each server. The log directory for each server can be found in the following location for each profile:
    
    profile_root/{profile_name}/logs
    
    
 2. Set tracing of the Admin component for the dmgr, nodeagent, and all cluster members for the cluster:  * If the problem is general issue with RippleStart:
       Trace setting for Deployment Manager (server: dmgr)
       
       
     * com.ibm.ws.management.wlm.*=all
       
       Trace setting for Node Agent (server:nodeagent)
       
       com.ibm.ws.management.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.management.*=all
       
       Note: You do not need Application Server traces unless you suspect a problem in a cluster member.
       
       
     * If the problem is more specific to a 'Cluster Member' during RippleStart:
       Trace setting for the Deployment Manager (server: dmgr)
       
       com.ibm.ws.management.wlm.*=all
       
       Trace setting for the Node Agent (server:nodeagent)
       
       com.ibm.ws.management.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.management.*=all
       
       Trace setting for the Application Server (cluster member)
       
       com.ibm.ws.management.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.management.*=all
       
       
     * Note:  * If the problem is with a particular node in the cluster, then traces would only be needed from that node's nodeagent and its application server plus dmgr.
          
          
        * If the problem is with a particular cluster member, then traces would only be needed from that application server plus that cluster member's nodeagent and dmgr.
          
          Make sure the trace output Maximum File Size limit is large (20 MB recommended) and the Maximum Number of Historical Files is greater than 5.
          
          
       
       
     * For addititional information on enabling tracing, see the following technote: Setting up a trace. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21254706]
       
       
       
    
    
 3. Recreate the problem by issuing the RippleStart on the desired Cluster.
    
    
 4. Run the Collector tool on all installs. See the appropriate Information Center [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/library/]for additional information on running the Collector tool.
    
    
 5. Send the diagnostic information to IBM support, using the instructions in this technote: Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21153852]

EXCHANGING DATA WITH IBM SUPPORT
To diagnose or identify a problem, it is sometimes necessary to provide Technical Support with data and information from your system. In addition, Technical Support might also need to provide you with tools or utilities to be used in problem determination. You can submit files using one of following methods to help speed problem diagnosis: 

 * IBM Support Assistant (ISA) 
 * Service Request (SR)
 * E-mail 
 * FTP to the Enhanced Customer Data Repository (ECuRep)
