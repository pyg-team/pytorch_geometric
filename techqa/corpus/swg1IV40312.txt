ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Approver Initials: mww
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   IBM Tivoli Monitoring NetApp Storage Agent v7.1.0
   
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   The agent might continually return stale data (the same value
   over and over again) if the DFM Server stops responding in the
   middle of a NetApp API call from the data provider.  This might
   occur if the NetApp Server has performance problems or is
   restarted.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   This is difficult to recreate.  Try stopping the DFM Server
   service or rebooting the DFM Server system after the inventory
   collection has begun but before it completes, which might be
   only 2 seconds.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Restarting the agent.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem will be fixed in the next release of the product.
