ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Match specification for numeric block values > 999 in 1

   fine in match specification step.  Both tests run fine in the
   Designer when executed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   When testing a match, if blocking on only 1 field and there are
   greater than 999 records in a block, an error will occur.
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When testing a match in the GUI, users need to be mindful of
   the match design.  A match with only one blocking field may
   result in large number of records in a block.  Adding a second
   column (or field) to block on can greatly reduce the number of
   records that block together.

   RECOMMENDATION:

   not cause an error
