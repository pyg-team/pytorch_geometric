PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to access Sterling Filegateway using ldap sign on. 

SYMPTOM


Users being authenticated via ldap do not have access to filegateway or myfilegateway. 

Same users do have access to SI/GIS via the ldap sign ons.

Canned SFG logons (fg_sysadmin) are not effected.

 

Error Message No errors were captured. However viewing authentication.log when logging is turned on may show something.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


Add the following to the security.properties_filegateway_ext.in file:

# sso forwards for filegateway and myfilegateway web apps on logout, timeout, validation/auth failures

## External Page for SSO when Logout (Specify the SSO Server external page for each of the cases)
security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.FILEGATEWAY.LOGOUT=/Signon/logout
security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.MYFILEGATEWAY.LOGOUT=/Signon/logout

## External Page for SSO when Timeout (Specify the SSO Server External page for each of the case)
security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.FILEGATEWAY.TIMEOUT=/Signon/timeout
security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.MYFILEGATEWAY.TIMEOUT=/Signon/timeout

## External Page for SSO on Validation/Authentication failure (SSO User Validation Failed - Page Validation)
security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.FILEGATEWAY.VALIDATION_FAILED=/Signon/validationerror<b r /> security.SSO_FORWARD_URL.MYFILEGATEWAY.VALIDATION_FAILED=/Signon/validationerror
