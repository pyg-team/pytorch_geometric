Title: IBM Unique cell names are required in an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) topology - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Environments in an IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) topology need to have unique cell names. If the same cell names exist, some communcation between the Process Center and other online servers will be inaccurate or lost. 

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The most common problem with a non-unique configuration is that the number of active instances and viewing instances in Process Designer is not accurate. To see the problem, complete the following steps: 

 1. Open the application in Process Designer.
    
    
 2. Open a business process definition (BPD). 
    
    
 3. Click Inspector and select Server A. The desired snapshot instances
    for this server are visible.
    
    
 4. Select Server B and the desired snapshot. The data from Server A is still
    visible.
    
    
 5. Close the authoring environment and then select Server B. You can see all instances from Server B.

To confirm the configuration level, compare the managed profile response file between the environments. Look for the cellName. Cell names need to be unique by environment across the entire IBM Business Process Manager server topology.

For example: 

 * Process Center (2 node)  * Node 1
      cellName=ProcCenterCell01
      nodeName=ProcCenterNode01
      
      
    * Node 2
      cellName=ProcCenterCell01
      nodeName=ProcCenterNode02
      
      
   
   
 * Runtime QA environment  * Node 1
      cellName=QACell01
      nodeName=QANode01
      
      
    * Node 2
      cellName=QACell01
      nodeName=QANode02
      
      
   
   
 * Production environment  * Node 1
      cellName=ProdCell01
      nodeName=ProdNode01
      
      
    * Node 2
      cellName=ProdCell01
      nodeName=ProdNode02
   
   



In this example, cells are unique between environments. If the cell values are not unique, communication between online environments and the process center will not show accurate data for active instances. 

Note: The only known side effects of this problem is the inability to switch between servers in the Process Designer and active instances in the process center console are not accurate. 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Information is available in the Naming considerations for profiles, nodes, servers, hosts, and cells [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_7.5.1/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/cins_naming.html] topic within the product documentation. 


The unique cell names are a requirement. For more information, see the Creating cell profiles [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.soafep.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/tpro_instancescell.html] topic. In this topic, it says: 

"Additionally, a cell name must be unique in any circumstance in which network connectivity between entities is required either between the cells or from a client that must communicate with each of the cells. Cell names must also be unique if their namespaces are federated."

For IBM Business Process Manager Standard edition, if you want to retain the data in the existing database, you can recreate the profile with an unique cell name and reuse the existing database.
