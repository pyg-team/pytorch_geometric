PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The following changes were made to five server messages:
   ANR9679W (AIX), ANR9579W (HP-UX), ANR9579W (Linux),
   ANR9579W (Solaris)
   
        - ORIGINAL TEXT:
   
             ANR9579W: command: Unable to locate file file_name.
   
             Explanation
             The specified file cannot be found. Note: PREPARE
             assumes that the volume formatting program (dsmfmt)
             is located in the same directory as the server
             executable file.
   
             System action
             PREPARE uses the following default file names in the
             plan file:
          * For the server executable the default is
            /opt/IBMadsm-s/bin/dsmserv.
          * For the volume formatting program the default is
            /opt/IBMadsm-s/bin/dsmfmt.
   
             User response
             Determine why the file does not exist; create if
             necessary.
   
        - UPDATED TEXT:
   
             ANR9579W: Command: The file file_name cannot be
             found.
   
             Explanation
             The specified file cannot be found.
   
             System action
             For the default server executable file, the PREPARE
             command uses
             /opt/IBMadsm-s/bin/dsmserv.
   
             User response
             Determine why the file does not exist and create it
             if necessary.
   
   
   The following changes were made to ANR4942E
   
         - ORIGINAL TEXT:
   
             ANR4942E: Command: Volume volume-name is not
             defined. The file name doesn't exist or has no space.
   
             Explanation
             A define volume command was issued for the indicated
             volume name. The volume name was specified without
             the FORMATSIZE parameter, but was found to either not
             exist, or to exist as a file of size 0.
   
             System action
             Volume definition fails.
   
             User response
             Either use the FORMATSIZE parameter to have the
             server pre-allocate space for the new volume, or use
             the dsmfmt utility prior to specifying the
             DEFINE VOLUME command so that the volume has
             space pre-allocated.
   
         - UPDATED TEXT:
   
             ANR4942E: Command: Volume volume-name is not
             defined. The file name does not exist or has no
   space.
   
             Explanation
             A define volume command was issued for the indicated
             volume name. The volume name was specified without
             the FORMATSIZE parameter, but was  found to either
             not exist, or to exist as a file of size 0.
             System action
             Volume definition fails.
   
             User response
             Use the FORMATSIZE parameter to have the server
             pre-allocate space for the new volume.
   
   
   Affected platforms:  AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris, Linux.
