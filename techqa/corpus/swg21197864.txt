Text:
CAMADMSALL CAMADMSDB backup restore octigate database DB2 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Here it the process for backing up and restoring ITCAM for WebSphere's DB2 Octigate Database. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Backing up the Octigate Database

backup database <databasename> user <username> using <password> to <location>

example:
db2 backup database octigate user amuser using password to /tmp/octigate

Note: The location directory has to already exist. So, if a part of the directory does not currently exist, manually create it before you execute the command. If you do not, you will get an exception like SQL2036N The path for the file or device "/tmp/octigate" is not valid

Output:
Backup successful. The timestamp for this backup image is : 20041116104855

Note: Keep the timestamp in a file. You will need it to restore the database.

Restoring the Octigate Database

restore database <database name> user <user> using <password> from <backup location> taken at <timestamp> without rolling forward 

example:
db2 restore database octigate user amuser using password from /tmp/octigate taken at 20041116104855 without rolling forward

Output
SQL2539W Warning! Restoring to an existing database that is the same as the backup image database. The database files will be deleted. Do you want to continue ? (y/n) y
DB20000I The RESTORE DATABASE command completed successfully.
