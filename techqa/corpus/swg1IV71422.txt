ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PROBLEM:
   Ordering a Catalog Offering with a GL Account specification
   gets an error.  When customer is ordering an Offering in the
   Service Catalog following error message is displayed when using
   SRM 7.2.1.6:
   
   CTGRC2601E - Validation script validation was unable to complete
   successfully. Contact the system administrador.
   
   If using SCCD 7.5.1.2:
   
   BMXAA4176E - Attribute ORGID does not exist.
   
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:  no
   
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   
   1) Go to -> System Application -> Platform Application ->Domains
   
   2) Edit DATATYPE domain adding two new rows
   
      Domain: DATATYPE
      Domain Type: SYNONYM
   
   new row:
      Internal Value: ALN
      Value: DATETIME
      Description: Date and Time
      Default? No
   
   new row:
      Internal Value: MAXTABLE
      Value: GL
      Description: GL Type
      Default? No
   
      Click on 'OK'
   
   3) In the DOMAINS application, create new Table domain called
   ACP_GLPROYT
   
      Domain: ACP_GLPROYT
      Object: CHARTOFACCOUNT
   
   4) Go to -> Offerings  (Go to -> Service Request Manager
   catalog ->  Offerings)
   
      - new Offering is created
      - classification = any
      - these setting may not matter but customer had a
   tickettemplate choosen & both the Auto Line Mgr Appr and Auto
   Fulfill Mgr Appr checkboxes marked.
   
   5) Go to -> Select Action -> Add/Modify attribute
   
   6) Create a new attribute
   
      Attribute: ACP_GLPROYTAREA
      Description: GL Account para Proyecto y Tarea
      Data Type: GL
      Domain: ACP_GLPROYTAREA
   
   7) in the Offerings application, click on Specifications tab
   and to add the new attribute as a new Specifications.   Set the
   following fields:
         - Table Attribute = GLACCOUNT
         - Lookup Name = GLNAVIGATOR
         (note that the GLNAVIGATOR value did not appear for me
   from Select Value dialog but if keyed in it will be accepted as
   it is in the lookups.xml)
   
   8) Enable Offerings and associate it to a Security Group as
   necessary
   
   9) Login into Maximo with an user with Offering privileges.
   
   10)  From Offering Catalog, open this offering and when trying
   to enter the GL account from the dialog.  Hitting OK on the
   dialog get you the validation error but there is no validation
   set on the Offering or specification.
   
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:  Order Offering gets:
   
   in SRM 7.2.1.6:
   CTGRC2601E - Validation script validation was unable to complete
   successfully. Contact the system administrador.
   
   in SCCD 7.5.1.2:
   BMXAA4176E - Attribute ORGID does not exist.
   
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   No error.
   
   ADDITIONAL INFO:
   none.
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   - SRM:  7216    or SCCD 7512  (probably all versions up to 7512)
   - TPAE:  7.1.1.12 thru 7506
