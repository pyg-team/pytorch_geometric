QUESTION
 Does IBM Water Operations for Waternamics generate license usage metrics? 

ANSWER
IBM Water Operations for Waternamics writes usage information to Software License Metric Tag (SLMTag) files. These files have the extension.slmtag and are read periodically by the IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) after it has been configured to scan for these files. You can generate reports that summarize usage. 

IBM License Metric Tool helps Passport Advantage clients determine their full and sub-capacity PVU licensing requirements. For more information, see IBM License Metric Tool [http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/licensemetrictool]. 

For more information about using IBM License Management Tool, see the IBM License Metric Tool 9.0 product documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8JFY_9.0.0/com.ibm.lmt.doc_9.0/com.ibm.license.mgmt.doc/ic-homepage_lmt.html]. 

SLMTag logging 

Each time IBM Water Operations for Waternamics starts, license management information is logged to the /opt/IBM/ioc/properties/slmtags directory. The logged.slmtag file contains usage information in the following format:
