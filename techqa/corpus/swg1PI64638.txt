PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Users Affected:
   IBM Transformation Extender 64 bits Launcher customers on
   Windows platform
   
   Problem Description:
   ITX Launcher 64 bits version abends on Windows when RUN maps
   need file related resource management. This is a memory
   corruption problem. Stack trace most likely to point to
   resmgr64!RMAddRunEntry, malloc/free heap allocation functions or
   any other function from resmgr64.dll module.
   
   Platforms Affected:
   Windows 64 bits
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A buffer that stores pointers to pending structures was not
   large enough resulting with bad memory write when RUN map has
   multiple cards that require resource management. The code was
   corrected to allocate a sufficient buffer.
