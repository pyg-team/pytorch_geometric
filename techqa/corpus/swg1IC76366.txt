APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  DESC:
   We upgraded our Lombardi Edition to v7.2 and it seems to have
   broken the Visibility and Event properties for controls such as
   Checkbox controls. For instance I have attached a twx file,
   please import it to see what we are trying to do.
   
   There are two checkboxes and it was working just fine on v7.1.
   One checkbox would become disabled (greyed out) when the other
   checkbox is selected. This is no longer working. I have tried in
   different Process Centers all on v7.2 and neither of them work
   correctly. The attached screenshot is the javascript errors we
   get in the browser.
   
   This is WebSphere Lombardi Edition v7.2 for Linux on System Z.
   
   Thanks for your help.
   
   Business impact: Visibility and Event properties do not work for
   any Process Application.
   
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT (REASON FOR HOTFIX)
   Process Applications usability features do not work as expected,
   causes inability for Lombardi coaches to process component
   controls in the manner in which they are intended.
   
   We are in a dev cycle, but I would say we are blocked by this
   issue and
   cannot move to production if the coaches do not work the way
   they are
   intended.  Not only does this cause confusion for the end-user
   when
   fields are not hidden or disabled according to coach selections,
   but it
   could cause bad or incorrect business data to be submitted on
   the
   coaches.  This type of bug can also cause unnecessary helpdesk
   support
   calls and end-user frustration.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Appears to be regression.  No work-around at this time.
