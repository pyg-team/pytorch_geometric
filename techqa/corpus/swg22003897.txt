How to find and download a FixPack for IBM SPSS Statistics software?







ANSWER
During a product version lifecycle IBM SPSS development creates a so called FixPack which is a bunch of defect fixes reported by Customers for a product version and release.
Typically a FixPack is available twice per year and product release cycle.

For SPSS Statistics 24 the last available FixPack for example is FixPack 2,
see also availability notification: SPSS Statistics 24.0 Fix Pack 2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]
Usually, on availability notification technotes, if you scroll down, you see the link to where you can fownload the FixPack for a particular platform for example for Apple Macintosh OSX.

Another option is to go to IBM Fixcentral directly
https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral] 

First, click on "Find Product" and enter SPSS or SPSS Statistics. 

If you enter SPSS a list of products will be listed on a dropdown.

As Product select IBM SPSS Statistics. As installed select for example 24.0.0.0 if you have never installed a Fixpack for this release so far or you can select 24.0.0.1 when you have installed FixOack 1 before. 

Please note : if you never installed a fixpack before it is NOT necessary to first install FixPack 1 and then FixPack 2. You can directly install the latest one (FixPack 2) as FixPacks are always cumulative and the latest one include all Fixes that were published in prior FixPacks. 

Finally, select the operating system platform where you have installed SPSS Statistics, on example below Mac OXS is used. Click on Cointinue.

If you like to download the interactive installer for Macintosh platform you would select 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-FP002. The silent installer is necessary when you like to perform a silent distribution of the FixPack to multiple Mac computer.
