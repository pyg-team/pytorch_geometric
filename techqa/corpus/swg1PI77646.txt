APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The problem occurs when putting the event message,
   because rsiMvsMQPUT assumes the opened object
   resolves to a local queue, but in this case it
   has resolved to a topic.
   This causes a value in the topic object to be
   treated as if it were the MAXMSGL field on a
   queue, leading to the put failing with MQRC 2030.

   ****************************************************************
   During processing of a SET CHLAUTH command, rsiEvent was called
   to generate any required event messages to reflect the change to
   CHLAUTH configuration.
   The event queue, SYSTEM.ADMIN.CONFIG.EVENT was opened and
   CSQMPUTW was called to put to this queue. However the queue had
   been redefined as a queue alias that resolved to a topic object.
   When this topic object was passed to CSQMPUTI, instead of a
   queue object, the maximum message length check used an invalid
   value resulting in the MQPUT of the event message incorrectly
   failing with MQRC_MSG_TOO_BIG_FOR_QUEUE 2030.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CSQMPUTW is changed to handle putting event messages to topic
   aliases.
