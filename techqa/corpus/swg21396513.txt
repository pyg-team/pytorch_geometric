PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
Some TEMA workspace views do not display data. 

SYMPTOM

The following error is seen in some views when accessing TEMA workspaces:

KFWITM217E Request Error: SQL1_OpenRequest failed rc=3000 + SQL1_DistReqError


CAUSE

History Collection has not been started for the appropriate products and attribute groups.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

Since the release of ITCAM for Transactions 7.1, TEMA workspaces get their data directly from the TEMA. 

However, History Configuration still has to be defined to create the Short Term History (STH) files on the TEMA. 

These are the files read by the TEP workspaces responsible for displaying trend and breakdown views. 

 
For example, on a T6 agent: 

[ITM_HOME]\tmaitm6\logs\History\KT6\t6txot 
[ITM_HOME]\tmaitm6\logs\History\KT6\t6appot 
etc...etc...
