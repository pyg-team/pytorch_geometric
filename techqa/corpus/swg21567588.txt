QUESTION
 Are there easy documented steps to install the JBoss server on any Unix platform? 

ANSWER
If you want to install the JBoss server, these are the steps on an AIX platform. Note that the installation is typically done on a RHEL OS (JBoss is owned by RHEL) but I've seen it work on other non-RHEL Unix platforms too. 

To see the list of officially supported JBoss versions, click here [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/tivolimonitoring/Prerequisites+for+Component+ITCAM+Agent+for+J2EE]. 

To see the steps to install JBoss, detach the zipped file attachment here from this technote, unzip it and open the document in wordpad. 

To see the steps to uninstall JBoss, look at the other document in the same zipped up file.
