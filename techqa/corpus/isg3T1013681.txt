PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How do I run a job exclusively on one host? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
How do I run a job exclusively on one host?LSF Batch provides an option -x for job submission. Then LSF Batch will put the host running your job into exclusive execution mode. 

In exclusive execution mode, your job runs by itself on a host. It is dispatched only to a host with no other jobs running, and LSF does not send any other jobs to the host until the job completes.
