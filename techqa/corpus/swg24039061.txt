ABSTRACT
 This page describes how to download IBM® Analytical Decision Management 17.0. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM Analytical Decision Management brings the benefit of predictive analytics to real business problems, allowing you to build custom applications tailored to your customers or industry. While applications are typically configured to solve very specific problems, all are based on a common set of capabilities: 

 * Automate decisions using business rules 
 * Add insight using predictive models 
 * Use prioritization, optimization, or simulation to reach the best decision based on the above


A number of packaged applications are available, tailored to solving specific business problems. Complete documentation for IBM Analytical Decision Management 17.0, including installation instructions, is available in the IBM Knowledge Center [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6A3P_17.0.0/configurableapps/knowledge_center/product_landing.dita]. 

PDF versions of the documentation are also available on the IBM Analytical Decision Management 17.0 Documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27043687] page, including the Quick Start Guide [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/DecisionManagement/17.0/en/DecisionManagement17_qsg.pdf]. 

Note that before installing the product, you must first install and configure all prerequisite software, including IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 7.0 and IBM SPSS Modeler Server 17.0. System requirements, supported application servers, databases, and environments depend on these two prerequisites. For system requirements details, see the support site [http://www.ibm.com/support/] and the documentation provided with the prerequisite software. If you purchased IBM SPSS Modeler Gold, these prerequisites are cover under the SPSS Modeler Gold license.
