QUESTION
 What is the procedure to migrate a Tivoli Integrated Portal 2.1 installation from 32-bit to a TIP 2.2 64-bit installation? 

ANSWER
There is no way to change an existing TIP 32-bit install to 64-bit. However, user defined documents from a 32-bit installation can be exported and then imported into a 64-bit install. For example you could do the following: 

 1. Export user defined objects from the TIP 2.1 system.

 2. Install the TIP 2.2 64-bit base as a separate installation.
    
 3. Import the 2.1 export into the newly installed TIP 2.2 64-bit instance.
