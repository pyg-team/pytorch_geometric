   is locked (due to another user editing the item) and if one of
   the pair is disabled then the error message returned isn't very
   friendly.. Additionally if a Syndicator is disabled during the
   item retrieval phase of Syndication, then the Syndication will
   continue however every item will fail with a 'Syndication is
   disabled' error message
