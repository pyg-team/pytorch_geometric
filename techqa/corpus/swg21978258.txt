Title: IBM LMT/BFI might incorrectly calculate PVU values on x86 systems with daughterboards. - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 In a rare case of using x86 machines with an optional daughterboard as a host for KVM virtualization without using RHEVM (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager), ILMT/BFI may incorrectly calculate the PVU per core value. This may happen only when the board is NOT physically present in the machine. 

CAUSE
 In case of using KVM technology without RHEVM, the information about available processors and sockets are retrieved from system BIOS using dmidecode utility.
When the optional board is missing, the data coming from hardware manufacturer BIOS may not reflect that the board is not attached and that the additional sockets are not physically present. 

 IBM calculates the PVU per core rating for multi-socket Intel® Xeon® x86 processors based on the number of sockets (populated or un-populated) physically available on the machine the processors operates on, therefore when the additional sockets are physically not-present but still returned by BIOS they may be used in the calculations.



ENVIRONMENT
As of now, we have seen such behavior on DELL R820 machines, on which the optional daughterboard contains 2 additional sockets, and regardless of the presence of the board the BIOS always states that 4 sockets are present.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If such situation occurs we recommend the customers to work with IBM to contact the vendors of the affected machines, and do one of the following on LMT/BFI user interface: 

- Add appropriate comments to the generated Audit Snapshots, stating this technote and the correct PVU ratings 

- Upgrade to release 9.2.3 where the issue has been resolved
