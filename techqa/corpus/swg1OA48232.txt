APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The NavBar does not function as expected on the HOD
   11.0.13 Information Center website when using the Oracle's
   JREs at or above version 1.8.0_20.
   Even adding the website URL and the underlying helps link to
   the exception list in the Java Control Panel does not correct
   the problem. All Oracle's JRE versions at or above 1.8.0_20
   throw in the same problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Host On-Demand Infocenter page. When Infocentre is launched in
   a browser an error pops up:
   "Your security settings have blocked an application from
   running with an out-of-date or expired version of Java".
   This issue occurs due to the security feature enhancement from
   Oracle Java, that, all the unsigned and self-signed jars are by
   default blocked with any security level on system JRE.
   Releases (that are in the field) which are affected by this
   APAR are
   HOD 11.0.8 (Special Build) to HOD 11.0.13.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  To resolve this issue, we signed the NavBar.jar with latest IBM
   HostOnDemand certificate, which is responsible for loading the
   contents on the left panel of the Infocenter.
   Fix set for incorporation in maintenance release of HOD 11.0.14.
