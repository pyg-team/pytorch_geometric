QUESTION
 What files require modification when updating, upgrading, moving, or migrating a System Monitor MSSQL database? 

ANSWER
The files are:


 * $CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cala_rex_srv.cfg 
 * $CENIT_ROOT/cala_rex/cala_rex_finca.cfg 


 * $CENIT_ROOT/server/cfg/db-cfg.xml 
 * $CENIT_ROOT/.prodinfo/FSM_SERVER.settings


There is a chance that a monitor could be configured to check the status of the monitor's database server, in which case the MSSQL database server name is also defined in this file: 
 * $CENIT_ROOT/cala/misc/cmdtab_merged.ctb. 


Please note: If the port, username, or password changes, they must also be reflected in the above files.
