PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have just installed CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 and are running with CA Common Services. You receive an abend 0C4 during CICS startup while loading the System Initialization Table (SIT). The CICS region still comes up and is available. 

SYMPTOM
The problem occurs after message DFHPA1101 [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhpa/PA1101.html] DFHSIT IS BEING LOADED.
You also see message IEA995I indicating that an 0C4 abend has occurred.


CAUSE
Missing maintenance for CA Common Services

ENVIRONMENT
New CICS TS V4 installation

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The dump is taken by CA ENF with this title: CA ENF Subsystem Intercept Error Routine

The problem occurs immediately after the SIT has been loaded. The TCB/RB structure shows that DFHPADM has issued a Write To Operator (WTO) request to put out message:

DFHPA1108 [https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v4r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts.messages.doc/cics_mc/dfhpa/PA1108.html] DFHSITxx HAS BEEN LOADED.

The abend0C4 occurs under the jobstep TCB. The 0C4 is occurring in CA module CASECPRM around offset x'178' on an ICM instruction (BF3F 400C) due to the contents of Reg4. Reg4 contains C6F4E2C1 or the chars 'F4SA' and is loaded from offset 4 into the Kernel stack for module DFHPADM. It appears that CASECPRM is trying to access a backward save area pointer in the CICS Kernel stack. However, in CICS TS V4.1, this offset contains the save area identifier 'F4SA'.
