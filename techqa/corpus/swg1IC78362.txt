APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Once you check the Durable Subscription on IME it would then
   constantly insert new records into LSW_DUR_MSG_RECEIVED table
   even when you uncheck it it would still write data to that
   table. You basically can't take it back (Since a NEW line is
   inserted into the EVENT table, rather than UPDATED).
   Due to this behavior - it's basically touch and go - once you've
   checked DS - you cannot undo it (You can in the BPD, but the
   system will keep saving those messages).
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Import attached process app and see the full description with
   screenshots in the doc file that is also attached.
