ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The WPS admin console panel throws the following exception
   CWSCA5003E: SCA modules can  not be deployed to more than one
   server or cluster in a cell :
   moduleURI="NinjaTurtleWeb.war+WEB-INF/web.xml"
   .
   target="WebSphere:cell=KKM_WPS7_Cell,cluster=TestDE01.Support+We
   bSphere:
   cell=KKM_WPS7_Cell,cluster=TestDE01.AppTarget
   
   
   "There are more than one containment paths for the target
   mapping which is not allowed for sca bindings."
   
   The deployment targets are valid target mappings i.e. an App
   cluster and a webserver cluster and hence the function must not
   throw an exception.
   
   
     As a result of this exception,
   If you deploy the app in a single server environment,
   you can dynamically change the MQ factory through the browse
   buttons from the admin console in the deplyed application MQ
   Export,
   .
      But if you dynamically deploy on a mult-server environment,
   you cannot change it through the browse button
   try to dynamically change the Connection, it gives an
   error when we hit the browse button
   admin console->applications->SCA modules-><app>->Manage
   modules-> MQ Export
   The Administrative Console does not allow you to
   change the Activation Spec, MQ/Connection Factory JNDI
   configurations for WMQ export
