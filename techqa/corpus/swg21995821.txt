Title: IBM Java dump files getting created every 5 minutes - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Since this morning every 5 minutes a file is created with following 
structure: core.20161018.144401.6700.0001.dmp 

CAUSE
Steps to disable the .dmp file creation:
1. Navigate to your installation path of Cognos
2. Open the \configuration directory
3. Locate the cclWin32SEHConfig.xml file and make a backup of it before
changing.
4. Locate the following line and change 2:2 to 0:0 <env_var name="CCL_HWE_ABORT" value="0:0"/>
5. Save the file
The dump files will not be created anymore but the reason
why they start appearing since this morning should be investigated.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
It seems that some Java cache was corrupt. We did the following:
- In Windows Explorer navigate to
C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\appdata\local\javasharedresources
- Delete all files in this directory
- In Windows Explorer navigate to C:\Users\<username>\appdata\local\javasharedresources
- Delete all files in this directory (do this for all users under the C:\Users directory)
- Stop / start all IBM Cognos services
After this, no more dump files were created.
