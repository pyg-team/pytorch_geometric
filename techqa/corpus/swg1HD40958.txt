ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  GSA/ SINGULARITY ERROR WITH USER DEFINED
   CONNECTION PROPERTIES OF SPRING-SMOOTH.
   .
   SCENARIO:
   1) Open CATAnalysis
   2) On the tree: Double click the both User defined
   connections
   properties Start/ SpringSmooth Middle/ Rigid End/
   Rigid
   and stiffness value are defined correctly
   3) Compute the Analysis-->Error message
   Singularity pb appear.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  GSA/ SINGULARITY ERROR WITH USER DEFINED CONNECTION PROPERTIES
   OF SPRING-SMOOTH.
   GSA/ SINGULARITY ERROR WITH USER DEFINED
   CONNECTION PROPERTIES OF SPRING-SMOOTH.
   .
   SCENARIO:
   1) Open CATAnalysis
   2) On the tree: Double click the both User defined
   connections
   properties Start/ SpringSmooth Middle/ Rigid End/
   Rigid
   and stiffness value are defined correctly
   3) Compute the Analysis-->Error message
   Singularity pb appear.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 16 GA level.
   .
   Incident Diagnosis
   The rotational stiffnesse are not equal to zero and
   are connected to 3D elements. In consequence, the
   solver raises a local singularity.
   .
   Development Request Justification
   Correction done in R16. The correction is too
   impacting to be exported in R15. There is no point
   in putting none zero values for spring rotational
   stiffnesses on 3D elements. It is now automatically
   set to zero while computing to help the user.
   .
   Answer and By-Pass
   Set the rotationnnal stiffnesse of the spring to 0.
   Delete all userdefined properties and recreate.
