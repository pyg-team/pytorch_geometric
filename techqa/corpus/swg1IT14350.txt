APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  With a large initial-connection value to DataPower mq-qm
   object, MQ reason code 2195 would be seen in the system log
   when mq-qm object is transitioning to the up state. Users might
   end up in the state of high CPU usage when mq-qm keeps shutting
   down the connection pool for failed connections and
   establishing new ones.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Configure DataPower mq-qm object initial-connections setting to
   a lower value, new connections will be established whenever
   needed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  When creating a large number of MQ connections, mq-qm may report
   MQRC 2195.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.2.0.6 and 7.5.0.0
