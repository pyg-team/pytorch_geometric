Title: IBM Reports are not Running at Scheduled Time - United States

Text:
schedule report renew credentials TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Scheduled reports are not executing at the specified time. 

SYMPTOM
The Run History detail contains the following error message:

CNC-SEC-3403 User account information invalid or missing in Content Manager.

CAM-AAA-0146 The namespace 'MHPActiveDirectory' is not available.

CAM-0055 User input is required.

CAM-AAA-0036 Unable to authenticate because the credentials are invalid.


CAUSE
When a scheduled report executes, it uses the credentials of the user who owns the report. When the credentials of the user are no longer valid, a scheduled report will fail as it will attempt to use the out of date credentials.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To correct the cause of the error, the user who owns the report must renew their credentials.

Steps:1. Log in to Cognos Connection as the user. 2. Go to My Preferences.

3. Click the Renew My Credentials link.

There will be a pop up window indicating Your crendential has been renewed with your Log on user ID and password.

Note:

For IBM Cognos ReportNet, the Renew My Credentials link is under the General tab.

For Cognos BI, the Renew My Credentials link is under the Personal tab.

4. Click OK, and then OK again.
