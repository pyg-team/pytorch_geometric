Title: IBM Tivoli Network Manger IP Edition v3.9 FP4 missing menus for WebGUI in some languages - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why are menus in WebGUI corrupted after ITNM v3.9 FP4 installation? 

CAUSE
Translations of WebGUI menu additions for ITNM were included for first time in ITNM 3.9 FP4. The translations files for ITNM are stored in ASCII format; appending them to the WebGUI menus caused the WebGUI menu file format to change from UTF-8 to ASCII format. This has no functional effect for some languages but for others - for example Japanese - the WebGUI menus are corrupted and display incorrectly.

ANSWER
This will be addressed in FP5. 

Customers affected by this issue should save the relevant file in UTF-8 format. 

The WebGUI menus files are located at: 

$NCHOME/omnibus_webgui/etc/configstore/ncwMenus/alerts.nova 

and 

$NCHOME/omnibus_webgui/etc/configstore/ncwMenus/ITNMReports.nova 

 

Note: copies of these files are also located in $NCHOME/omnibus_webgui/etc/default/configstore/ncwMenus/ 

These are default/reference copies laid down at install time, rather than the "live" menus.
