PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This document describes the meaning of System reference code C900 2AA0. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
What does System Reference Code (SRC) C900 2AA0 mean? How long should it run, and what should I do about it? 

At this SRC, the system is building a list of database objects that need to be recovered. The system attempts to recover some of the objects. One result of this step is the list of objects that can be seen with the EDTRBDAP command. The formal name of this IPL step is Damage notification and database recovery part 2.

This step can run a very long time. If the IPL has been running more than three hours, determine if the IPL is hung or in a loop. Also, collect any information about why the current IPL was performed. For example, are they trying to recover from a DASD failure, power outage, and so on.
