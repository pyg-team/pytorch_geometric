PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to launch the IBM Security AppScan Source for Analysis or AppScan Source for Development (Eclipse plug-in) user interface result in an empty white box or not showing anything. 

SYMPTOM
After entering login credentials, you may see a blank white box appear or you may not see anything happen. In either case, the UI does not launch as expected.


CAUSE
The underlying Eclipse version that AppScan Source is built on or installed to is incompatible with XULRunner version 1.9.2.26-2 or later.

ENVIRONMENT
This problem is typically seen on RHEL 5.8 and RHEL 6.3, but it can occur on any version of RHEL with a newer version of XULRunner.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Resolution for AppScan Source for Analysis version 8.6.x or earlier, and for AppScan Source for Development installed to Eclipse version 3.6 or earlier:

 * 
 * 
 *  Set MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME to the XULRunner installation location. Update LD_LIBRARY_PATH to append (or pre-pend) $MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME. 
 * 
 * 


Resolution for AppScan Source for Analysis Version 8.7.x, and for AppScan Source for Development installed to Eclipse Version 3.7 or later:
