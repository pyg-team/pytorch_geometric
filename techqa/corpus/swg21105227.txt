PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You want to know why when coding substitution variables in the CICS VSAM Recovery for z/OS (CICS VR) skeleton, you receive unexpected results. 

CAUSE
A single ampersand (&) was specified in front of the substitution variable. Therefore, it was interpreted as an ISPF dialog variable during ISPF processing.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you need to code substitution variables in the CICS VR skeleton JCL (also known as the default JCL or JOBCARD), you must include an additional ampersand (&) in front of the substitution variable. 


For example, if on the JOBCARD you wish to have TSO notification go to the userid that submitted the job, you need to code NOTIFY=&&SYSUID rather than NOTIFY=&SYSUID as would normally be coded in JCL.
