Title: IBM Identifying Windows 32-bit and 64-bit systems - United States

 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How to determine whether a Windows system is 32-bit or 64-bit. 

CAUSE
The IBM MQ V8.0 server is a 64-bit product and cannot be installed on 32-bit Windows systems.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open a Windows Command Prompt and use one of the following two methods to determine whether the Windows installation is 32-bit or 64-bit. The first uses the Windows Management Instrumentation Command [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394531(v=vs.85).aspx] interface:



 1. Check Windows using WMIC
 2. 
 3. C:\> 
 4. WMIC OS GET OSArchitecture
 5. 
 6. OSArchitecture
 7. 
 8. 64-bit




The second option examines the output of the systeminfo [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491007.aspx] command to identify the system as 32-bit ("X86-based PC") or as 64-bit ("x64-based PC"). This command might take a minute or two to complete: 

 1. Check Windows using systeminfo
 2. 
 3. C:\> 
 4. SYSTEMINFO | FIND /I "System Type"
 5. 
 6.  System Type:                 x64-based PC
    
    





IBM MQ V8.0 server cannot be installed on 32-bit Windows systems, but WebSphere MQ V7.5 and WebSphere MQ V7.1 servers can be installed on them. Although there is no 32-bit version of the MQ V8.0 server, IBM does provide a 32-bit version of the MQ V8.0 client for 32-bit Windows systems.
