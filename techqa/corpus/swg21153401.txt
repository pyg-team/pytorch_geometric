Title: IBM Setting the session timeout in ITIM - United States

Text:
session timeout web.xml websphere correctly TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Configuring the session timeout setting for ITIM in WebSphere 

CAUSE
WebSphere uses the web.xml file to set Application specific parameters.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
ITIM 5.1 and ISIM 6.0 on WebSphere 6.x, 7.x, 8.x* 

In the WebSphere Admin Console, navigate to Servers -> Application Servers -> server1* -> Session management, and change the Session timeout value to the desired value. After clicking Apply, be sure to save the changes to the master configuration and sync with all nodes (if running a cluster). The Application Server must be restarted for the changes to take effect. 

 

* "server1" is the default Application Server name, yours may be different. Also, if you are running a cluster, this must be performed for all Application Servers in the cluster. 

 

Additionally set the timeout of the ITIM application and web containers, and the LTPA tokens. 

1. In the WebSphere Admin Console, navigate to Applications -> Enterprise Applications -> ITIM -> Session management. Make sure "Override session management" is enabled at the top of the form, then set the timeout to the desired value. 

2. In the WebSphere Admin Console, navigate to Applications -> Enterprise Applications -> ITIM -> Manage Modules -> ITIM Console -> Session Management. Make sure "Override session management" is enabled at the top of the form, then set the timeout to the desired value. Repeat for the ITIM Self Service module. 

3. The default LTPA token timeout is 120 minutes, but if you want a session timeout longer than that, you will need to increase this value. The main setting is in Security -> Global Security -> LTPA (under Authentication). However, this value is overridden by the setting on the ISIM Security Domain. So you must also check Security -> Security Domains -> ISIMSecurityDomain -> Authentication Mechanism Attributes. From there, you can select whether to use the global settings, or customize the LTPA timeout for this domain. 

After clicking Apply for each of those, be sure to save the changes to the master configuration and sync with all nodes (if running a cluster). The Application Server must be restarted for the changes to take effect. 

* ITIM 5.1 is only supported on WebSphere 6.x and 7.x, while ISIM 6.0 is only supported on WebSphere 7.x and 8.x.
