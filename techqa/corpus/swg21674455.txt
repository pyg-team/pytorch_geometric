Description:
An unspecified error in Apache Struts related to the default enabling of Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) could lead to remote code execution. 

CVSS Base Score: 10

CVEID: CVE-2013-2251 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2251] 

Description:
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by an error when evaluating the action:, redirect:, and redirectAction: parameters as OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted request parameter containing an OGNL expression to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVEID: CVE-2013-2248 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2248] 

Description:
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, caused by an open redirect vulnerability in the DefaultActionMapper class. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the redirect: and redirectAction:: parameters in a specially-crafted URL to redirect a victim to arbitrary Web sites. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVEID: CVE-2013-2135 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2135] 

Description:
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by double evaluation error when evaluating parameters as OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted request parameter containing an OGNL expression to modify server-side objects and inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system. 

CVSS Base Score: 7.5

CVEID: CVE-2013-2115 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2115] 

Description:
Apache Struts could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an incomplete fix for an error related to the handling of the includeParams attribute. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted request parameter containing an OGNL expression to modify server-side objects and inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
