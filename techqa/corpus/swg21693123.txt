 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM SDK for JavaTechnology Edition that is used by WebSphere Process Server. This also includes a fix for the Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE) SSLv3 vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM SDK for JavaTechnology Edition updates in October 2014. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2014-6512 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6512] 

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component has no confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97147 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97147] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) 

CVEID: CVE-2014-6457 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6457] 

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact. 

CVSS Base Score: 4
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97148] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2014-6558 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6558] 

DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component has no confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact. 

CVSS Base Score: 2.6

CVEID: CVE-2014-3566 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566] 

DESCRIPTION: Product could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plaintext of encrypted connections. The IBM SDK for Java Technology Edition has changed the default to eliminate the POODLE vulnerability. There is a new system property com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3 It is defaulted to true so that it will not use SSLv3. If you want to take the risk you may turn SSLv3 back on with the system property: com.ibm.jsse2.disableSSLv3=false 


CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify areas that enable the SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. The most immediate mitigation action that can be taken is disabling SSLv3. You should verify disabling SSLv3 does not cause any compatibility issues.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
WebSphere Process Server 6.1.x, 6.2.x, 7.0.x 

If you are using an unsupported version, IBM strongly recommends to upgrade.

REMEDIATION/FIXES
