APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The IBM Content Collector SMTP Connector, IBM Content Collector
   Text Search Support for Content Manager, and IBM Content
   Collector P8 Content Search Services Support cannot extract the
   body text of some MIME email. For these documents, all three
   processes fail with a java.lang.ClassCastException when
   extracting the body text. As a result, the document is not
   processed.
   
   The trace files contain one of the following errors:
   
   java.lang.ClassCastException:
   com.sun.mail.util.BASE64DecoderStream incompatible with
   java.lang.String
           at
   com.ibm.icm.edc.emailconv.mime.BodyTextCollector.visit(BodyTextC
   ollector.java:70)
           ...
   
   java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.mail.util.QPDecoderStream
   incompatible with java.lang.String
         at
   com.ibm.icm.edc.emailconv.mime.BodyTextCollector.visit(BodyTextC
   ollector.java:70)
         ...
   
   java.lang.ClassCastException:
   javax.mail.util.SharedByteArrayInputStream incompatible with
   java.lang.String
         at
   com.ibm.icm.edc.emailconv.mime.BodyTextCollector.visit(BodyTextC
   ollector.java:70)
         ...
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The JavaMail API method that is used to access the content of a
   text MIME part returns the content as Java object. In most
   cases, the returned object is of type String.
   
   However, there are cases where other object types are returned,
   like com.sun.mail.util.BASE64DecoderStream,
   com.sun.mail.util.QPDecoderStream, or
   javax.mail.util.SharedByteArrayInputStream. In these cases, the
   resulting object cannot be casted to type String, and a
   ClassCastException occurs.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0.0 Fix Pack 2, the IBM
   Content Collector SMTP Connector, Text Search Support for
   Content Manager, and P8 Content Search Services Support handle
   the object types mentioned above correctly. The body text of
   such MIME email can therefore be extracted correctly.
   MIME email for which the JavaMail API method returns other
   object types might still return errors when IBM Content
   Collector attempts to extract the body text.
