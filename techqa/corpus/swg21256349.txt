PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 This technote explains a possible reason for a database of unknown origin error message that can occur when trying to update schema repository connection properties in IBM® Rational® ClearQuest®. 

CAUSE
The first part of the error message is a known defect and does not relate to the issue. The second part could indicate the problem or it may also be irrelevant:

An error was encountered with the database. You may have specified a
database of unknown origin or a ClearQuest user database instead of a ClearQuest Schema Repository. Please specify a valid ClearQuest Schema Repository


Database Error Messages: 

The connect options specified for this database will use "long" datatypes, but the database was made with Oracle-8 "clob" datatypes. You must use Oracle 8 client and server software to access this database. Also, ensure that you have *NOT* specified the connect option "LOB_TYPE = LONG".

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, check the back-end database privileges for the ClearQuest schema owner. They might have been changed from what ClearQuest documentation states. 

Note: For Oracle databases, they can ONLY have Connect and Resource privileges.
