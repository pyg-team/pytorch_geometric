APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using external application authorization, racf administrator
   has defined a series of applications in racf which have been
   defined to the nvas system.  The appls have a racf appl def
   which allows the users of that external group to have read
   access to those applications.  None of the applications have
   previously been defined to the group via the nvas adminstration,
   they have only been defined to the nvas system via admin option
   4.  When a user attempts for the first time to logon to this
   group by filling in the nvas userid, password and group name on
   the application selection panel, the user hangs and nvas goes
   into a high cpu loop.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Define at least one of the applications that have been defined
   to this group using the nvas assign an appl to a group admin
   panel.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All NV/AS users.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The logon to NVAS, using an external    *
   *                      group, hangs and NVAS loops when the    *
   *                      external group has not applications     *
   *                      associated.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: APPLY THE PTF FIXING THIS APAR               *
   ****************************************************************
   At logon time, the used group is checked to get the associated
   applications.
   The processing starts a scan of the related control blocks
   but when there are not applications the logon hangs and the
   NVAS address space loops.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code now checks the rigth scan of the involved control
   blocks.
