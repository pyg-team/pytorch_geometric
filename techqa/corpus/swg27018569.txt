These instructions assume that you have a clustered or a non-clustered setup. If you are using a mixed configuration environment, then you may need to adapt these instructions to suit your setup. 
In a mixed configuration environment you must adhere to the following rules to prevent the upgrade from failing. 
 * All JavaÂ® Virtual Machines (JVMs) in the installation that are being upgraded should be stopped. 
 * If your installation has a managed profile, the Deployment Manager should be running when you apply the Fix pack. If this is not possible you must manually call the upgrade script (BPMProfileUpgrade.ant) after receiving the appropriate error messages. See the Recovering from profile update errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=2307&uid=swg27018027#recoverFailure] section for details. The only exception to this rule is for managed profiles hosted by the same installation as their Deployment Manager profile. The upgrade script contains special case code for this scenario. 
 * If your cluster has Business Process Choreographer configured you must stop all members at the older version before you start any of the upgraded members. After an upgraded member has been started you must no longer start members of the 'old' version.
