APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some un-exportable objects are allowed to be exported. This may
   result in the following errors on re-import:
   
   Generated Policy:__gp_1448468681_0014
       The object is of a class that cannot be modified
       === Line 5: generated-policy __gp_1448468681_0014
       *** Unknown command or macro
       === Line 6: reset
       *** Unknown command or macro
       === Line 7: admin-state enabled
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually deselect all Generated Policies when exporting from
   the above versions.
   
   If exported the objects and error messages are benign and can
   be ignored.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Affected is Configuration Export.
   
   Some un-exportable objects are allowed to be exported. This
   would cause an error on reimport of the    invalid Generated
