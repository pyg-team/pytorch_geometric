Title: IBM Unable to edit page layout - United States

Text:
Edit Page; pencil; missing; editpage TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You are unable to edit a page via the theme and/or the Manage Pages administration portlet. The latter may be missing the Edit Page Layout button ("pencil" icon) or clicking such button may simply refresh the current page. 

No errors exist in the System*.logs.


CAUSE
There are four pages under the "Page Customizer" label: Content, Appearance, Locks, and Wires. Each page contains the relevant portlet that provides the administration function. These pages and/or the Page Customizer label can become inactive and cause the problem behavior.



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
1. Login to the Portal as the Administrator.
2. Navigate to Administration=>Manage Pages=>Content Root
3. Find "Page Customizer". Confirm the status of the Page Customizer label is "Active." 

4. Select Page Customizer and ensure that all the pages shown below appear in the table and they are all listed as "Active".

The Page Customizer label and all the pages under this label must be active in order for the Edit Page function to work correctly.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If the status of the Page Customizer label shows "Inactive", then note that it is not a clickable link. You must activate the label via XML import by utilizing either XMLAccess or the administration portlets. 


Example of using administration portlets to reactivate Page Customizer label:

- Click the "Export" icon for the page/label showing as "Inactive" in the Manage Pages portlet. 
- Click "No" in the browser pop-up when asked whether you wish to export all descendants.
- Save the XML output file to a known location. 
- Edit the XML file and search for the inactive page by unique name.
- Modify the value for the "active" attribute to "true". For example:

<content-node action="update" active="true"
content-parentref="Z6_000000000000000000000000A0" domain="rel"
objectid="Z6_CGAH47L0083E20I7QB3V3I00F6" ordinal="1600" type="label"
uniquename="ibm.portal.Page Customizer">

- Save the modified XML file.
- Navigate to the Import XML portlet under Administration=>Portal Settings.
- Click "Choose File" and locate the XML output file.
- Click "Import".
- Once the import completes, navigate back to the Manage Pages portlet and verify you can now edit the page layout for a page.

If the status of one or more pages under Page Customizer (such as "Content") shows "Inactive", select "Inactive" to toggle the status back to "Active."
