 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Monthly File Transfer Activity report fails 

SYMPTOM
Engine log error:
<----------------- executeQuery - Exception Info - Begin --------> 
executeQuery - SQL Exception msg : ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000 
executeQuery - SQL State : 42000 
executeQuery - SQL Error Code : 1795 
executeQuery - SQL cmd :null 
<-----------------executeQuery - Exception Info - End ---------> 


CAUSE
There in excess of 1,000 servers in the rule's criteria and Oracle has a limit on expressions of 1,000. The customer had over 1,000 servers in the "Servers" criteria or there was a server group used that expanded to a list of over 1,000.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
SQL Exception msg : ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Revised the rule's criteria to eliminate the Servers and/or Server Group entries and ran the report. 

An alternative solution is to create server groups for reporting purposes, each containing less than 1,000 servers. The number of servers per group will be dependent on how many other criteria are defined for the report.
