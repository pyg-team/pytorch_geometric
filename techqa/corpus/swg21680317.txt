QUESTION
 What application servers are supported by ITCAM for J2EE agent v7.1.1? What has changed if compared to the previous version of this product? 

ANSWER
These application servers and J2SE applications are supported:
- Apache Tomcat 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x 
- JBoss 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
- Oracle WebLogic Server 9.x, 10.x, and 12.x; Oracle WebLogic Portal Server 9.x and 10.x
- SAP NetWeaver 7.0 (2004s), 7.1, 7.3, and 7.4
- J2SE applications

JBoss EAP versions 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 support has been introduced starting from 7.1.1.0-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE-IF0003

Support for versions highlighted in boldface is new in release 7.1.1

Support for versions highlighted in italics had already been introduced starting from 6.1 FP6 and later interim-fixes (typically 6.1.0.6-TIV-ITCAMfJ2EE_MP-IF000x, see their readmes for details).
In fact J2EE v6.x has gone out of support at this point, so you will have to upgrade to v7.1.1.0.x to use a supported version.

Java 7 support has been officially introduced in version 7.1.1.
Java 8 support has been introduced starting from 7.1.1.0-TIV-ITCAM_J2EE-IF0003

The following application servers are not supported anymore in the J2EE agent 7.1.1:

- Oracle/BEA Application Server
- Sun JSAS
- WebSphere Application Server Community Edition
