PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When attempting to install or upgrade IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook via the installation manager, the installation fails with a message of 'Windows Installer command failed' 

CAUSE
When installing via the i2 Analyst's Notebook Installation Manager, if you are missing a prerequisite for the software as outlined on the Prerequisites step of the installer, when running the installation you will not get a message to explain that the prerequisite software is not installed, and the software will fail to install.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that you have installed all of the prerequisite software first before attempting to use the installation manager to install the software.


If you use the provided .msi file to install your software instead, this will provide you with a message to explain what prerequisite you are missing.
