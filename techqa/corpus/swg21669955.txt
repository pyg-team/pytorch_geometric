QUESTION
 Several Windows computer systems have same UUID. Is there a way to configure TADDM in order to avoid unexpected merges when discovering them? 

CAUSE
In the standard TADDM configuration, Windows computer systems having the same UUID are considered as the same target and are merged. 

ANSWER
By default, TADDM consider the following UUIDs as fake UUIDs, so avoiding unexpected merges: 

 * 
 * 
 * - all the UUIDs identified by a string containing only 'f', 'F' and '-' characters


Anyway, it is possible to configure TADDM in order to choose a different set of fake UUIDs by setting the following property: 
com.collation.windows.UUIDToBeIgnoredRegex

In case you have only one possible fake UUID value, set it to this value. For instance, in case the fake UUID is 00020003-0004-0005-0006-000700080009 the property will be configured as:

com.collation.windows.UUIDToBeIgnoredRegex=00020003-0004-0005-0006-000700080009

In case you have a set of fake UUIDs 
(for instance, the value above and 0345FA1A-FD1A-05F4-1AFD-F4051FFFE503 as well), you can configure the property by putting the fake UUIDs in sequence, separated by '|', then enclosing the string in brackets with a leading '^'. In our example the configuration will be:

com.collation.windows.UUIDToBeIgnoredRegex=^(00020003-0004-0005-0006-000700080009|0345FA1A-FD1A-05F4-1AFD-F4051FFFE503)
