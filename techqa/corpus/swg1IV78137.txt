APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This is a performance issue.
   
   ENVIRONMENT:
   IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.17
   Tivoli's process automation engine 7.5.0.4 Build 20130129
   ICD/SCCD 7510
   Server OS   Windows Server 2008 R2 6.1 build 7601 Service Pack 1
   Server DB   Microsoft SQL Server 10.50 (10.50.4000)
   
   
   PROBLEM:
   Deployed Software tab in Software Catalog application works
   very slow, sometime takes 25 seconds  to load sometimes even
   longer.
   
   HISTORY OF ISSUE: See PMR
   
   LOGS REQUESTED: No error in logs
   
   LOCATION OF LOGS: N/A
   
   STEPS TO RECREATE:
   First  Import data on one of our test machines (eg we used
   orangevm2).
   1 login to orangevm2  as maxadmin, password is maxadmin
   2 Go to Administration -> Deployed Assets -> Software Catalog
   3 Hit Enter to list softwares
   4 Click on a software (for example on this test machine acl)
   5 Now click on Deployed Software Tab
   It will take 25 seconds or more to load data (notice in this
   example it returned only 36 rows)
   
   
   L2 RECREATE NOTES:
   L2 able to reproduce the issue on lab machine orangevm2
   
   L2 ANALYSIS:
   We also noticed that performance does not change even if
   "deployed
   Software" tab has more or less data in it.
   When we directly ran the SQL in database client it runs very
   quickly (1
   sec or less).
   
   QUESTIONS/REQUESTS FOR L3:
   Why ICD/SCCD is taking 25 seconds to load data ?
