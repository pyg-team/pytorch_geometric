QUESTION
 How do you optimize big scans in IBM Security AppScan Standard? 

CAUSE
Scans with big number of URLs and tests take a long time to scan. Besides, big scans can hit memory limits by showing error "Memory exceeded a predefined limit".

From a security perspective, big sites (sites comprised of over a couple hundred individual pages) are very rare. If your scan goes over 500 visited URLs, you should ask yourself, "did the developers of this application really write 500 individual pages" (JSP/ASP/PHP files)? Actually, often you will encounter sites that contain tens of thousands or even a million pages. There is no way that a development team no matter how large wrote a million pages.

AppScan Standard does not have a limit of Visited URLs or limit of tests. However it has a limit of memory. Performing scans with a big number of Visited URLs or tests can hit the memory limit and result in error "Memory exceeded a predefined limit".

ANSWER
In AppScan Standard version 9.0.3 there was a new feature introduced called DOM Filtering. This feature make obsolete the technique #1 and #2 described below. DOM Filtering was discussed in an OpenMic session recorded at Scanning with DOM Filtering in AppScan [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DP833toFnI]. 

Try the following options: 

 1. Optimize the scan by running the optimizer (Explore Optimization Module)
    The optimizer (Explore Optimization Module) is included in AppScan Standard version 8.0 and later.  * Information on how to run the optimizer can be found in AppScan Help. 
     * Complementary information can be found in How to use the Optimizer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506913]. 
     * See video Optimize scans using Optimization Module [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMyzTbsDUok]
       
       
    
    
 2. Tune the scan manually 
    If after using the optimizer, the scan is still big, try to minimize the scan by tuning the Scan Configuration, for example:  * Lower the Redundant path limit (default is set to 5) - consult technote 1612674 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612674] 
     * Optimize manually URL-rewriting - consult technote 1317594 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317594] 
     * Optimize "Redundancy tuning" for non-navigational parameters - consult technote 1612914 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612914] 
     * Uncheck the "Treat all paths as case-sensitive" option if this apply. 
       
       
    
    
 3. Split your scan into two or several scans 
    If the scan is still big after optimizing it manually, then splitting my be the only option once its optimized as far as we can go without potentially compromising coverage. 
    Technote 1299939 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21299939] describes the splitting operation. You may also try to exclude some of the big files and scan them separately. 
    
    
 4. Complete the big scan
    In some cases, when you get the memory limit error and the scan is near to be completed, you may try several iteration of restarting AppScan Standard as follows:  * save the scan 
     * restart AppScan Standard and reopen the scan 
     * continue "Full Scan".
