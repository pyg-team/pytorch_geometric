APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a storage area becomes offline or unavailable, ingested
   documents are created unfiled and with minor version number.
   
   This is occurring because the Content Engine (CE) Client
   (WorkplaceXT (WPXT), etc) is not able
   to delete or remove the document after an unsuccessful call to
   the document.setContent(...) method due to no storage area being
   available.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * Using ICC or WorkplaceXT for document ingestion with 5.1.0.2 *
   * or prior.                                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When using ICC or WorkplaceXT for document ingestion, if the *
   * target storage area happens to be unavailable (due to        *
   * hardware, network issues, etc) the applications would create *
   * minor versions of documents without content, not the         *
   * expected major versions with content.  These minor versions  *
   * could not be deleted until the storage area was back online, *
   * making it impossible for the ingestion applications to       *
   * correctly clean up their incomplete work.                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to Content Engine 5.1.0.3 or later, and upgrade the  *
   * ingestion application to a version that implements cleanup   *
   * of incomplete documents.                                     *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code fix in Content Engine 5.1.0.3 or later will allow the
   ingestion applications to clean up incomplete ingestion in this
   case.
   Note that the ingestion applications me require modification to
   actually perform the cleanup.
