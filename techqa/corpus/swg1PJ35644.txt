ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ***PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION
   THIS FIELD IS REQUIRED.***
   Description of Problem (full details)
   During the login process, when the warning window pops up
   informing a user that a password is about to expire, they
   should be able to click on OK and have a window pop up to
   change their password. This works correctly when triggered by
   home.asp.  However, when the login process is triggered by a
   direct call to docview.asp, the password change window fails
   to open after clicking OK.
   How long has the problem been occurring (recent changes)? :
   Since creation of IS 4.0 SP5
   Does this occur on more than one station / server? :
   All workstations
   Is there a workaround? :
   Update password from home page
   What is the impact to the customer/system? :
   Customer normally opens images directly, not by navigating
   from home page.  Causes problems when password is due to
   expire.
   Can the problem be replicated on an internal system?  Y or N  Y
   By Who (L3, Support, etc..)
   L2 Support
   Steps to Reproduce:
   1  Configure user so password is due to expire within 30 days.
   2  Call image directly in browser (ex:
   http://hacssfn007/idmws/DocView.asp?Library=DefaultIMS:HACIMAGE
   0:FileNet&ID=76260836 [http://hacssfn007/idmws/DocView.asp?Library=DefaultIMS:HACIMAGE0:FileNet&ID=76260836]
   3  Login window pops up.  Enter login and password.
   4  Password expiration warning window pops up. Click on ok.
   Actual Results:
   Warning window closes, but password change window does not
   open.  Web Services proceeds as it normally would after a
   successful login, so user can not change password.
   Expected Results:
   Password change window should appear, allowing the user to
   change their password.
   Are there any similar or related Defects? If Y provide ECMDB #s
   No

   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   * Upgrade to IDMWS 4.0.2 FP 5.                                 *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Users sometimes open images directly, not by navigating from
   home page but E-mailed URL link. After applying IDMWS 4.0.2
   FP5, when password is due to expire, the password change
   window is opened after clicking OK and password is changed
   properly.
