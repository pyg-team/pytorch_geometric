Title: IBM Enabling weak cipher suites for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus is NOT recommended - United States

Text:
 FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 With the recent attention to RC4 “Bar Mitzvah” Attack for SSL/TLS, this is a reminder to NOT enable weak or export-level cipher suites for Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus 

CONTENT
Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus by default disables the RC4 stream cipher. If you enabled the RC4 stream cipher you are exposed to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.
Configure the OMNIbus server components to use FIPS mode that will disable RC4 by default. FIPS mode configuration is described here: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0/omnibus/wip/install/concept/omn_con_fips_configuringsupport.html?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0/omnibus/wip/install/concept/omn_con_fips_configuringsupport.html?lang=en]
