APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  PE client does not show all the active threads and issues the
   message :
   ***
   The area for the output data is too small. The output data
   is truncated.
   ***
   
   The reason is that an internal buffer of PE Server used for
   receiving DB2 data per IFI READS request gets overflow with
   enormous DDF/RRSAF rollup records (IFCIDs 147/148)

   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Enormous number of DDF/RRSAF rollup records coming inside
   IFCIDs 147/148 may overflow the DB2 IFI READS internal
   buffer being used by OMEGAMON collector to hold current
   snapshots coming from the DB2 subsystems. This may prevent
   gathering of whole snapshot data in the 1MB/4MB size limited
   buffer.
   
   PROBLEM CONCLUSION:
   The solution given allows to eliminate DDF/RRSAF rollup
   records coming within IFCIDs 147/148 with DB2 snapshots
   and littering the DB2 IFI READS Return Area by useless
   data. The filtering process takes place when OMEGAMON
   collector is running and users of Performance Expert
   Client or ISPF Monitoring dialogs are performing one of
   the following functions:
   - Thread Summary when at least one condition of the
     INCLUDE / EXCLUDE filter is set;
   - Thread Details
