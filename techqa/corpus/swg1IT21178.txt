LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   This issue affects users of the MQ classes for Java and MQ
   classes for JMS who utilise the Advanced Message Security (AMS)
   component of IBM MQ.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   MultiPlatform
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   In previous releases of the product, AMS support in the IBM MQ
   classes for Java and IBM MQ classes for JMS has been dependent
   on support provided by the IBM implementation of the Java
   Cryptography Extensions (JCE).
   
   As of IBM MQ version 9.0, the AMS support in the IBM MQ classes
   for Java and the IBM MQ classes for JMS were updated to utilise
   the open-source "Bouncy Castle" package instead of using the IBM
   JCE as provided by the IBM JRE, thereby providing support for
   AMS when using non-IBM JREs.
   
   The necessary Bouncy Castle jar files are included as part of
   the IBM MQ classes for Java and IBM MQ classes for JMS
   installation package.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  New versions of the Bouncy Castle jar files have become
   available to be shipped by IBM MQ, and the code change
   associated with this APAR updates the version of the Bouncy
   Castle jar files from:
   
     bcprov-jdk15on-152.jar
     bcpkix-jdk15on-152.jar
   
   to
   
     bcprov-jdk15on-157.jar
     bcpkix-jdk15on-157.jar
