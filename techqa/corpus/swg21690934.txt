Text:
relnotes; visualizations TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When a more recent version of a visualization bundle is available, Cognos administrators should update the visualization bundle in their Cognos BI environment. While existing visualization bundles continue to work in IBM Cognos Business Intelligence, version 10.2.2, they do not run optimally nor have the latest features unless they are replaced with updated visualizations. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
You can obtain your visualization bundles from IBM Cognos Analytics Community [http://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/cognos-analytics-blog/cognos-business-intelligence-cognos-analytics-all-visualizations-deployment/]. Then, re-import them in Cognos Administration. You can download a deployment of all new visualizations to save time. 

If your visualizations were customized, obtain the latest version of the Visualization Customizer from the IBM Cognos Analytics Community. Open each visualization in Visualization Customizer and click Upgrade visJSON and Upgrade Definition. Save the visualizations and re-import them in Cognos Administration.
