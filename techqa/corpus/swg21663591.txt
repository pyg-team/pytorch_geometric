QUESTION
 What is the latest Systems Director agent (D9) version? 

ANSWER
The most current release of the Tivoli Monitoring Agent for System Director (D9) is the 6.2.2 FP2 release.

This agent has not had a newer version released, the information in the Information Center or Tivoli Monitoring guides is incorrect to indicate there is a 6.2.3 version of the agent.


The part numbers for the 6.22 FP2 package to download from Passport Advantage are 

CZF82EN : IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent for IBM Systems Director base Multiplatform, English

CZH3NEN : IBM Tivoli Monitoring Agent for Systems Director base Support Files V6.2.3, Multiplatform, English (CD)

CZF84ML : IBM Tivoli Monitoring Systems Director base Language Pack Multiplatform, Multilingual

6.2.2 FP2 level of the agent does not support Self Describing Agent (SDA) feature because SDA feature was introduced first in Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.3 release.
