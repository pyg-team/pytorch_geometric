ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Abstract:
   
   Running Prepare for Deployment to generate the EJB deployment
   code will generate the ibm_ejbext.properties and
   ibm_pmbab.properties in both the Java source folder and the EJB
   Deploy output directory.
   
   Problem:
   
   1. Open menu File ? New, select EJB ? EJB Project
   2. Pick a name like TestEJB, pick EJB module version and click
   Next.
   3. Add another source folder ejbdeploy, change the output folder
   to classes and click Next.
   4. Clear the option to create the EJB Client JAR and click
   Finish
   5. Select the EJB project, open the context menu, select New
   Enterprise Bean (1.x-2.x), select CMP, specify a name and click
   Finish
   6. Select the EJB project, open the context menu, select
   Properties, select tab EJB deployment, choose ejbdeploy and
   click OK
   7. Create a backend for Derby 10.1 from JavaEE with Top-Down
   mapping
   8. Select the EJB project, open the context menu, select Java EE
   ? Prepare for Deployment.
   
   Expected Result:
   ejbModule\META-INF\ibm_ejbext.properties does not exist
   ejbModule\META-INF\backends\DERBY_V101_1\ibm_pmbab.properties
   does not exist
   ejbdeploy\META-INF\ibm_ejbext.properties does exist
   ejbdeploy\META-INF\backends\DERBY_V101_1\ibm_pmbab.properties
   does exist
   
   Actual Result:
   ejbModule\META-INF\ibm_ejbext.properties does exist
   ejbModule\META-INF\backends\DERBY_V101_1\ibm_pmbab.properties
   does exist
   ejbdeploy\META-INF\ibm_ejbext.properties does exist
   ejbdeploy\META-INF\backends\DERBY_V101_1\ibm_pmbab.properties
