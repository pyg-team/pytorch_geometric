LDAP Purescale DB2 user TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to connect with a newly created LDAP user to Purescale on my IBM Pure Data Systems for Transactions I get Error SQL30082N Reason Code 24 

SYMPTOM
This problem only applies to users created not with the workload console. 

SQL30082N Security processing failed with Reason Code 24
"USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD INVALID " 

In the db2diag.log file the following message may be seen

2014-07-21-22.14.42.248900+000 I3863974E490 LEVEL: Warning

CAUSE
LDAP allows user names to consist of uppercase and lowercase characters.

So even if the newly created LDAP user is working on OS level you get an error from DB2 if the username contains uppercase characters.

For DB2 there is a restriction for LINUX that usernames must be lowercase.




RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Only use lowercase characters when creating users for Purescale on your IBM Pure Data Systems for Transactions.
