APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The process of stopping a snapshot/app remains stuck. After
   clicking "Stop" for a given snapshot the process admin console
   keeps displaying "Stopping" for the snapshot endlessly
   . This state remains even after restarting the
   server which prevents me from undeploying the snapshot (or
   activating again).

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Applying JR43190 fixes the problem.
   
   The Install/Dependency information is available in the
   readme.txt on FixCentral.
   
   When the user goes to the download files page in FixCentral the
   readme will be available with the fix package as a seperate
   download.
   
   Note:
   After applying this fix, the Process Applications that were
   showing "Stopping" status will show a blank status and the
   applications will need to be stopped again using the stop
   button.
   After a server restart it causes the BLA to automatically
   start back and hence the application that was stopped will
   return to stopping state.
   To change the behavior post restart, please apply JR44282 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR44282].
   See JR44282 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR44282] for more details.
