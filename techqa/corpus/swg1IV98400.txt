   Service Portal's help says IE10 is supported when it is not
   supported for use with Service Portal.
   Service Portal is incompatible with IE 8, 9 and 10.
   The Service Portal help link says IE10 is supported:
   https://<hostname>:3000/portal/default/self-service/unsupportedb
   rowser.html [https://<hostname>:3000/portal/default/self-service/unsupportedbrowser.html]
   
   
   PERFORMANCE ISSUE:  no
   
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   Open Service Portal help link and see what it says:
   https://<hostname>:3000/portal/default/self-service/unsupportedb
   rowser.html [https://<hostname>:3000/portal/default/self-service/unsupportedbrowser.html]
   
   CURRENT ERRONEOUS RESULT:
   It says IE10 is supported
