Feature Description Upgrade Impact Agent or Integration Servers to support only TLS 1.2 protocol for secure communication 

IBM plans to enable TLS v1.2 protocol on agent and integration server JVMS by default, which cannot be overridden.

Yes 

IBM does not recommend the use of older versions of TLS protocol. Customers are expected to validate that their implementation is coded for TLS 1.2 support and fix, if there are any issues. After the upgrade, if any code that is implemented does not support TLS 1.2 protocol, the specific integration will fail.
