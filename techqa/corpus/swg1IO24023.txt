APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer has raised an issue with IBM Support stating that when
   they open a Word Document which contains Italian Characters in
   Preview Mode that the information presented is garbage
   characters. Now what is interesting is if the customer opens
   the document using Daeja Viewer Virtual there is no issue.
   
   When we try to load the document into a WebSphere App Server
   deployment there is no issue so it seems that this issue is
   exclusive to WebLogic in HTML Preview Mode.
   
   This has not been reproduced by IBM as all our VMs are
   WebSphere App Server deployments but we did verify the issue is
   not present on this App Server.
   
   Here is how the document looks when there is no Encoding
   problem (i.e. viewed from a WebSphere App Server Deployment
   preview)

   Here is the same document when there is an Encoding problem
   (i.e. viewed from a WebLogic App Server Deployment preview)

   Researching Wellspring for this issue we discovered an
   identical issue for another customer who also uses a WebLogic
   App Server and the special characters behave the same as they
   do in this instance. In fact in this other case customer has
   deployed Navigator on Websphere as a test and the encoding
   issue disappears thus verifying once again that this issue is
   exclusive to WebLogic

   In the above CRM Ku Chang mentioned that they discovered a way
   to force the OutsideIn module to use UTF-8 by default but they
   needed to clarify it with development. I think this will be
   helpful and kindly request the same work around to be shared
   with this customer urgently
   
   ***Important***
   if customer opens a doc with italian characters which do not
   encode correctly we can click the source code of the preview
   and see that the charset is windows 1252
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Dev/Engineering provide a code fix via a test module which
   forces the OutsideIn Module to force the usage of UTF-8
