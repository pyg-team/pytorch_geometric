QUESTION
 How to optimize the time it takes for a new compute host to join a cluster and start an already queued task? 

ANSWER
In the configuration file ego.conf on compute host, there is a property named EGO_DYNAMIC_HOST_WAIT_TIME, it specifies the waiting interval of LIM on compute to send join request to Master host. the value of this property takes the following format: first try interval e.g. 1, the rest of try interval till the 20th attempts e.g. 60. in second..
In the ego.conf on master host, a property named EGO_RESOURCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL, it specifies how frequent Master host checks a new host or unavailable host in the cluster.

Lowering the values of these two parameters will make new compute host join the cluster faster. But in real life, the scenario for changing these two parameters can be different: EGO_DYNAMIC_HOST_WAIT_TIME on compute host, set EGO_DYNAMIC_HOST_WAIT_TIME=1, 60 can always be recommended without a big concern, as it only impacts the individual compute host. 

However, EGO_RESOURCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL on master host, when lower the value, it will increase the frequency for master host to check the hosts status among the cluster. This can have a impact to the cluster's performance.

If in your environment, there are many compute hosts frequently join, remove, re-join the cluster and the the cluster and the time that compute host takes to join the cluster is a big concern, lowering EGO_RESOURCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL on master host can be an option, we recommend to perform enough test for all typical business scenarios with typical workload before make this change on production.
