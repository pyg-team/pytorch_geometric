PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You receive the following message in your CICS Transaction Server region: 

DFHSR0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'B0E' in program DFHECID. 

CAUSE
The startup GRPLIST contains a duplicate definition for program DFHECID with specification EXECKEY(USER).

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The failure occurs in program DFHEIN01 on the LM instruction (98F0 2030) at offset x'AE2' with an invalid Reg2. DFHEIN01 is the main program within module DFHECID. At the time of the abend 0C4, DFHEIN01 is about to call trace program. The instruction fails because DFHEIN01 is running in USER key instead of CICS key. The PPT entry for DFHECID shows USER (see field PPTE_CICS_EXEC_KEY).

In the startup GRPLIST, there was a second definition for program DFHECID with EXECKEY specified as USER. The definition for DFHECID is shipped with EXECKEY(CICS).

You can use the CEDA transaction to display any groups that contain definitions for DFHECID with the following command:

CEDA EXP G(*) PROG(DFHECID) 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Ensure that your program definition for DFHECID specifies EXECKEY(CICS).
