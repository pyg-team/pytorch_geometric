QUESTION
 How to restrict your search result against a specific content in Watson Explorer? 

CAUSE
In Watson Explorer Engine, the indexed documents are made up of multiple content nodes put together or in other words, multiple contents make up a document. By default, a search is performed against all the content nodes; therefore, all the contents are taken into account while searching.

ANSWER
If you want to restrict which content you are searching using a normal query, you could achieve it by doing the following: 

1) Go to the associated source of the collection by clicking on the 'live source' link found below the live crawling section in the search collection's overview tab. 

2) In the source, go to the 'form' tab and click edit next to the 'vse source form' to edit the 'Field mappings' under 'Searching and Ranking'. 

3) Click on the modified radio button and enter the field\content that you want to search against. For example, a mapping as query|title,author would map a normal query to the title and author contents. 

 4) Click on 'OK ' to save your new setting. Now, the search will be done only against the content that you have specified in your source. 

Note: You can determine the different contents available in your document by clicking on debugging in your search results page.
