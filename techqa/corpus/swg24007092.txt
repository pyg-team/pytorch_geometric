ABSTRACT
 The IBM Message Service Client for C/C++ offers C/C++ users an Application Programming Interface (API) that is consistent with the Java™ Message Service (JMS) API. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
The IBM Message Service Client for C/C++ ("XMS C/C++") renders the Java Message Service (JMS) API in the C/C++ languages. It brings the benefits of JMS -- a standard, abstracted messaging API for pub/sub and point-to-point messaging, as well as externally administered objects - to the non-Java world. 

Applications created in this way can be used to exchange messages between other Message Service Client applications, JMS applications or native WebSphere MQ applications and can easily be migrated between WebSphere MQ, WebSphere Business Integration Message Brokers and WebSphere Application Server messaging environments with little or no rework.

Possible Uses
The XMS Clients create new integration possibilities by extending WebSphere messaging to customers who have, for example, standardized on C/C++ as their client platform, or who want to use messaging to integrate with new .NET or J2EE applications.

Skill Level Required
To use this SupportPac you need the following skills, knowledge, and experience:
