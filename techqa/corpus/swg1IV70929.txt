PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Add autonomous EIF support for the Monitoring Agent for IBM i
   OS.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Autonomous EIF support for the Monitoring Agent for IBM i OS has
   been added.  Private situations can be sent directly from a

   Please refer to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide,
   Version 6.3 Fix Pack 2, Chapter 15 Agent-based Services at the
   following URL for details on topics related to the definition
   and configuration of autonomous private situations,
   specifications, and examples:
   
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com
   .ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/adminuse/agentautonomy_intro.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/adminuse/agentautonomy_intro.htm?lang=en]
   
   The following instructions are for configuring private
   situations on the Monitoring Agent for IBM i OS.  The agent and
   these situations will run independently of the Tivoli Enterprise
   Monitoring Server and will not attempt to connect to the server
   using this configuration.
   
   1.  Set the following environment variables in the
   QAUTOTMP/KMSPARM environment file as follows:
   
      KDC_FAMILIES=SNA USE:N IP.PIPE USE:Y PORT:1918
   
      CT_CMSLIST=
   
   2.  Private situations are defined using a XML specification in
   the following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_situations.xml
   
   The IFS directory path is created during agent installation.
   The user creates the a4_situations.xml file or the file can be
   downloaded from your Centralized Configuration Server (refer to
   the ITM6.3FP2 Administration Guide for more details).
   
   3.  EIF event destination server or servers and their
   configurations are defined using a XML specification file in the
   following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_eventdest.xml
   
   The IFS directory path is created during agent installation.
   The user creates the a4_eventdest.xml file or the file can be
   downloaded from your Centralized Configuration Server (refer to
   the ITM6.3FP2 Administration Guide for more details).
   
   4.  An optional EIF event mapping file configuration XML file
   can be used to customize the EIF events that are generated.  If
   no event mapping file is provided, events are formatted by
   generic mapping.
   
   User defined event mapping files are stored in the following
   location:
   
         /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/localconfig/a4/a4_eventmap.xml
   
   The IFS directory path is created during agent installation.
   The user creates the a4_eventmap.xml file or the file can be
   downloaded from your Centralized Configuration Server (refer to
   the ITM6.3FP2 Administration Guide for more details).
   
   5.  Private situation definitions are saved during an uninstall
   or upgrade in a save file format in the following IFS location:
   
      /QIBM/UserData/IBM/ITM/ConfigData/eifpsit.sav
   
   The eifpsit.sav file containing the private situation
   definitions, if it exists, is restored when an agent is
   installed or upgraded.
   
   6.  Sending private situation events by using TLS/SSL
   communication is not supported.
