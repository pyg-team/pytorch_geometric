WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
As a workaround until the fix has been applied, you can disable the conversion of documents by removing the convertor entries in the file convertors.xml. 


Please follow the steps below to implement the workaround:


 1. Stop the Portal Server. 
 2. Find convertors.xml  * for Portal version 6.1 check:
       <portal_server>/shared/app or<portal_server>lwo/preq.odc/shared/app 
     * for Portal version 7 and 8 check:
       <portal_server_root>/wp_profile/PortalServer/dcs
    
    
 3. Backup this file to restore it after the fix has been applied. 
 4. Remove all <input> and <output> entries inside all <convertor> tags in the convertors.xml file as shown in the following example.
    
    Find all sections like this:
    <convertor>
    <input>application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document</input>
    <input>application/msword</input>
    <input>application/vnd.lotus-wordpro</input>
    <input>application/html</input>
    <input>application/rtf</input>
    ...
    <output>application/vnd.ibm-odcrte.zip</output>
    ...
    <property name="class" value="com.ibm.wps.odc.convert.text.Stellent2RTE"/>
    </convertor>
    
    and change them like this:
    <convertor>
    <property name="class" value="com.ibm.wps.odc.convert.text.Stellent2RTE"/>
    </convertor> 
 5. Restart the portal server.
