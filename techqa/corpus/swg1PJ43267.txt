APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ACCE: Unable to display lifecycle policies with duplicate
   display names in
   Document class properties pane pulldown control. The grid that
   shows
   the lifecycle policy uses display name as an index. An error
   occurs when
   you have a duplicate index.
   
   Examination of the FireBug log shows one error:
   Error: dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore: The json data provided by
   the
   creation arguments is malformed. Items within the list have
   identifier:
   [name]. Value collided: [<display name>]
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
         1 Create document lifecycle policies with duplicate
   display names in FEM.
         2 Attempt to display any document class's properties in
   ACCE
   
   Actual Results:
          Endless waiting icon spins as it tries to populate the
   pulldown for default lifecycle policy on the first tab
   Expected Results:
          Successful display of document class properties
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set unique values for the document lifecycle policy display
   names.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fixed in 5.2.0.4-P8CPE-FP004 and 5.2.1.3-P8CPE-FP003 and higher.
   This error was caused by default document lifecycle policy drop
   down widget which uses the display name as an index property.
   Now index property is changed to Id property which is always
   unique. Now ACCE shows the Document class General tab when there
   are duplicate Lifecycle Policy display names.
