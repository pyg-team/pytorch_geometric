   01.In Rational Developer for System z - RDz - v9.1.1.2,
      attempts to save a PDS member fails with error: command
      C_RESET_MVS_FILE_SYSTEM is not available There was a timing
      issue in the initialization of mvs file subsystem. That
      causes some command information not passed to client in
      heavily loaded environment.
   02.When a file with more than 16kB is being uploaded and it
      ends with an abend by some reason, server does not send the
      abend code information in the error response message to
      client. Client shows the incorrect message , "Operation
      failed: file input output error" even if it has a different
      special message for the abend code D37-4 and E37-4.
   03.Server code is updated to send ABEND information to the
      client while opening a member.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.RDz server is updated to pass client required command
      information in heavily loaded environment.
   02.RDz server code has been updated to send the abend code
      information to client.
   03.Server code is updated to send ABEND information to the
      client while opening a member.
