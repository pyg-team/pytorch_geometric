Title: IBM EG hangs after mqischangeproperties to set WTX Resource Registry properties - United States

Text:
MRC MRN corrupt hang Execution Group EG Resource Registry TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Corruption of the .MRC and .MRN files is possible if not edited with the GUI provided leading to hangs in the WebSphere Message Broker Execution Group. 

SYMPTOM
When opening the .MRN file with Notepad for example, it may be saved with an additional 3 byte encoding sequence (also known as the 'Byte Order Mark') which will render the file unusable by the execution engine. 

This could result in non substitution of the Resource Registry variables - or at worst - a hang of the execution environment, be that Command Server, Launcher or the Execution Group of the WebSphere Message Broker for example.



CAUSE
Using non-standard tools to edit the .MRC and .MRN files



ENVIRONMENT
Windows



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Open the files in a Hex editor to review additional 3 bytes at the beginning of the file.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Open the files using the standard Resource Registry editing tools, and re-save.
