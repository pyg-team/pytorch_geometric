ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  03/17/2010 - Mhurvitz - I think there is some confusion here.
   Prior to 8.0.x
   we used an agent to invoke the OOO UI dialog.  In 8.0.x we moved
   an agent to
   invoke the UI to an action and the UI was changed from a dialog
   to
   form/document.  So for 8.0.x using the agent is unsupported
   configuration from
   our perspective if using an 8.0.x or 8.5.x mail template.  If
   you are using an
   older mail template 7.x or older and this does not work then
   this should be
   re-assigned to the designer team.  Thank You
   
   When you run the (EditOfficeProfile) agent from Designer, the
   Out of Office
   Profile is not displayed fully and you cannot edit the profile
   fields.
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   Needed:  8.x Designer client/Mail application based off of 8.x
   standard mail
   template
   
   1.  Open Designer
   2.  Open a mail file and navigate to the agents view
   3.  Right-click on the (EditOfficeProfile) agent and select
   run
   
   RESULT:  You will see very little of the profile (see screen
   shot below)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Changing the sizeToTable parameter of the dialogbox method to
   False resolves
   the issue
   
    nSuccess =
   uiws.dialogbox("OutOfOfficeProfile",True,True,True,False,False,F
   alse,strWindowTi
   tle,m_officeprofile,True,True) =>
    nSuccess =
   uiws.dialogbox("OutOfOfficeProfile",True,True,True,False,False,F
   alse,strWindowTi
   tle,m_officeprofile,False,True)

TEMPORARY FIX

COMMENTS
 *  This APAR is associated with SPR# OIHZ7T6L4K.
   Per development: Unsupported configuration -   Prior to 8.0.x
    we used an agent to invoke the OOO UI dialog.  In 8.0.x we
    moved from an agent to invoke the UI to an action and the UI
    was changed from a dialog to a form/document.  So for 8.0.x,
    using the agent is an unsupported configuration from our
    perspective if using an 8.0.x or 8.5.x mail template.
