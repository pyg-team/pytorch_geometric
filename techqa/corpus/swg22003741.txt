Title: IBM How do I set the Geolocation global parameter for web applications on iOS devices? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 My web application (dashboard) no longer supports the Refresh geolocation event action to set the Geolocation global parameter on my iOS device. Why is this occurring and how do I remedy this situation? 

CAUSE
Geolocation restrictions for security purposes in iOS 10 and later. 

ANSWER
To enable Geolocation functionality for your web application (dashboard) for iOS devices (iPad, MacBook, iPhone, etc.), complete one of the following actions: 

 * Enable HTTPS instead of HTTP. This solution is preferable for public web applications because it provides a secure connection with content encryption.

 * If your application is under development and enabling HTTPS is not an option, use Google Maps Geolocation API and enter the following code:

 * var url = "
 * https://www.googleapis.com/geolocation/v1/geolocate?key=
 * <your_google_api_key>";
 * 
 * var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
 * 
 * var response = '';
 * 
 * request.open('POST', url, false);
 * 
 * request.onreadystatechange = function() {
 * 
 * if (request.readyState === 4) {
 * 
 * response = request.responseText;
 * 
 * if (response != '') {
 * 
 * var json = JSON.parse(response);
 * 
 * changeGlobalParameters('Geolocation_Global_Param"' + '('+json.location.lat+','+json.location.lng+')');
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * request.send(null);



By using this script, you can set a global parameter from geolocation values.
