ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Using specific fonts in reports when exporting them in Excel
   2007 format, the fonts are replaced by the default font. With
   the PDF format, if the fonts are embedded there is no issue, if
   not the following message in Adobe Reader is displayed  :
   "Cannot extract the embedded font 'EDLZWL+<fontname>'. Some
   characters may not display or print correctly."
   
   There is no problem in HTML or Excel 2002 formats.

COMMENTS
 *  This is not a Cognos product issue, rather an issue with the
   ParisineTTSymboles font supplied.
   The ParisineTTSymboles font only contains 24 glyphs which is not
   enough for substitution of all characters in a text. IBM Cognos
   rendering engine for Excel 2007 defaults to Arial font if no
   substitute glyph's found.
   When running in HTML format, or rendering in PDF, the browser
   and Adobe PDF reader only use characters the ParisineTTSymboles
   font has substitute for.
