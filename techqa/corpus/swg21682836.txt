QUESTION
 How to automate the removal of an instance of the SQL agent? 

CAUSE
The 'Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services' window is used to remove an instance, but this can not be used to perform this silently, using command line (kinconfg).

ANSWER
To remove an instance of the SQL agent use a command like this from the TEMS machine:
tacmd removeSystem -m <instance:hostname:MSS>

Use this command also on the node itself, but the prerequisite is that you must have the 'Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions' (UE component) installed on this node.
You must be logged on beforehand to the TEMS using the 'tacmd login' command.

In case this concerns a cluster, the agent is removed on the active node, and not on the passive node. The reason for this is the 'tacmd removeSystem' command tries to contact the TEMS to know which system to uninstall the SQL agent instance from. At that time the agent on the 'active' node is actually connected to the TEMS whereas the 'passive' agent has no connection to the TEMS, so only the 'active' agent is removed.
