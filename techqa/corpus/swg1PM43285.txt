   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: CICS Explorer requests fail to connect  *
   *                      to the CICS region via the CICS         *
   *                      management client interface when any of *
   *                      the following LOCALCCSID values are     *
   *                      used:                                   *
   *                                                              *

   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: After applying the PTF that resolves this    *
   *                 APAR, all CICS regions that connect to the   *
   *                 CICS Explorer through the CICS management    *
   *                 client interface must be restarted to pick   *
   *                 up the new code.  Note that the restarts do  *
   *                 not need to be done at the same time.        *
   ****************************************************************
   When LOCALCCSID is set to a non-English character set the data
   (XML) returned over a CMCI connection is translated into the
   non-English character set, which results in XML similar to the
   following:
   <???? ???????="1.0"?>
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Modified DFHWUIPG (Restful Interface URI Analyzer) and DFHWUWEB
   (Restful Interface Web Output Processor) to add the
   HOSTCODEPAGE parameter to the following EXEC CICS commands:
    EXEC CICS WEB SEND
    EXEC CICS WEB RECEIVE
    EXEC CICS DOCUMENT CREATE
    EXEC CICS DOCUMENT INSERT
   
   HOSTCODEPAGE specifies the name of the host code page that the
   data being added is encoded in.
