InfoSphere Information Analyzer, Version 8.1.2: 


Component APAR number Description Information Analyzer JR32723 Primary key analysis: Columns containing all Null values cause multi-column primary key analysis to behave unpredictably. Information Analyzer JR33172 Data sample: data sample has a restriction of the sample size to be between 1 - 999,999. Information Analyzer JR33286 Changes done to Domain & Completeness screen:
1. Minimum/Maximum range value can be set to a value that does not exist in the FD table.

2. User can enter either Minimum or Maximum or both or None fromText Box Controls, and hit ENTER on any text box, or click reload, to cause the new value to be accepted.

3. Minimum/Maximum values can be unset by the user from both the Minimum/Maximum text box controls and from the Frequency Distribution grid drop down.
