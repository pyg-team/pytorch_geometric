ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Rational Developer for System z - RDz - 8.5.1.4
   A RDz client running RDz v7.6 connects to a RDz host that is
   running v8.5.1.4.  A disconnect from this client appears to
   never end on the host when using the RDz display clients
   command.
   
   F RSED,APPL=D c
   MODIFY RSED,APPL=DISPLAY CLIENT
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Cancel the userid on the host using the RDz command
   
   F RSED,APPL=C U=userid
   MODIFY RSED,APPL=CANCEL USER=userid

   ****************************************************************
   01.Daemon utilizes ZosSystemMiner finish() method to know the
      client's disconnect. But RDz 7.6.x client does not issue
      activate-miner command for ZosSystemMiner.
   02.RSE always creates a null-sized fekfivpd.log file in the
      daemon.log directory on startup, even if the daemon IVP is
      not executed.
   03.audit.log.mode=RW.R.R caused a wrong message, ERROR
      LogHandler: audit.log.mode has an invalid mode specified:
      input=RW.R.R.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Now, the connect information will be cleared even when the
      user connects via RDz 7.6.x.
   02.Now, fekfivpd.log file is created only when a IVP is
      invoked.
   03.Now, audit.log.mode=RW.R.R is accepted.
