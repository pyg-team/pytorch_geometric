Title: IBM Considerations when configuring AQ inbound module using WebSphere Oracle E-Business Suite Adapter - United States

Text:
Multiple advanced queues; Oracle E-Business Suite Inbound Adapter; JMS-120 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 1. Multiple advanced queues cannot be selected during the configuration of the Adapter (Inbound)
2. When JMS dequeue mode is used to dequeue messages from the advanced queue, there is a difference in the Adapter's behavior based on the version of the aqapi.jar used. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1. Multiple advanced queues cannot be selected during the configuration of the Adapter (Inbound) 

This is by design. A given inbound module with an Adapter instance can only be configured to retrieve messages from a single advanced queue. User is not allowed to select more than one advanced queue when configuring the Adapter using the inbound AQ feature. 

 2. When JMS dequeue mode is used to dequeue messages from advanced queue, there is a difference in the Adapter's behavior based on the version of the awapi.jar used. 


The behavior of the JMS dequeue operation is found to differ based on the version of aqapi.jar used. The aqapi.jar file from the Oracle database version 11i appears to have stricter validations on the message header during the dequeue operation. The aqapi.jar file from Oracle E-Business Suite 12.x having Oracle database version 10g has more relaxed restrictions during the dequeue operation. The dequeue errors from the aqapi driver (JMS-120) indicate the behavior of the driver version used. Recheck the version of aqapi.jar you are using and retry with aqapi.jar from the Oracle database version 10g.
