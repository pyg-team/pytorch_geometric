APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Bigfix Inventory 9.2.6.  I am trying to add a certificate and
   private
   keyfile, and I keep getting a message that the certificate does
   not
   match the key file.  I have an external certificate.  I am
   trying to
   use the same certificate files I used for Bigfix Web Reports.
   
   As per customer, the steps outlined in the document link below
   are not correct
   Even though the document says BFI 9.5 version....it should work
   for BFI
   9.2.6 version.

   update from customer
   ====================
   I was able to get the certificates working.  I will tell you
   how, but
   first I want to say that the documentation needs a lot of
   improvement.
   
   It turns out that the same certificate and private key created
   for
   Bigfix Web Reports can be used for Bigfix Inventory.   I had to
   use the
   external certificate in pem format with a private key in pem
   format with
   no password.
   
   In the console for the two fields, I used the following.
   
   Certificate - externalCAroot.pem
   Private key - nopwdkey.pem
   
   Someone should take the certificate documentation from Web
   Reports,
   Bigfix Inventory, and Bigfix Self-Service portal, and put them
   into one
   very clear document rather than three unclear documents that are
   each
   written completely differently.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Document needs to be updated
