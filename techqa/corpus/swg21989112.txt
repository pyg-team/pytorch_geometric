Title: IBM How to troubleshoot when action status of client is "Not Reported" but the last report time is the latest on console? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Why the action status is always "Not Reported" though the last report time is the latest on console? 

SYMPTOM
When running an action for a computer, I found the action status remains "Not Reported" but the last report time of the client is the latest on console.
In this situation, why the action status remains "Not Reported"?


CAUSE
This problem may be caused by console cache is outdated or FillDB is overloaded.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Check if there is such sentence in the besclient log(BESClient installation folder\__BESData\__Global\Logs): 

GatherHashMV command received
If no, then UDP may be blocked in client side so that it couldn't receive the UDP notification from server. 

2) If UDP is not blocked, please run this sql command to see if the action status has been sent to database:
select * from BFEnterprise.dbo.fixletresults where id =<the problematic action id> and computerid=<the problematic client computer id>
3) If the action status has been written to database, then something may be wrong with console. You will need to clear console cache. Please click on "File"->"Preferences" and click on "clear cache", then re-open console to see if the action status will change.
4) If the action status is not written to database, then please check if FillDB is overloaded by inputting the link http://127.0.0.1:52311/relaydiagnostics<⁄font> in the web browser of its higher level relays and bigfix server. If the FillDB File Size Limit and FillDB File Count Limit under "Relay Status Information" are over 100%, then the additional client reports will be discarded.
