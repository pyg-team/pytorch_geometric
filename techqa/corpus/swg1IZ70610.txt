 *  Tested in Maximo 7.1.1.4 Out of the Box and also on 7.1.1.6
   
   Went into the classification application and brought up
   classification 7
   
   Made sure it had Attributes and that the USE with ITEM was
   entered as a row
   
   Tried to Delete the USE WITH ITEM option received the following
   Error
   
   BMXAA0201E - This classification must have its Items flag
   selected because it is currently being used to classify one or
   more Items. <--- so far this is correct
   
   Clicked on OK and Saved my changes
   
   Went to create a ITEM DENISETEST
   Went to classify and selected 7 as my classification in the
   specification Tab
   
   Notice that none of my Attributes came over to my newly created
   ITEM, i cannot add the USE with ITEM in the classification cause
   it is still there

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  <The problem is fixed. In classifications app, although it did
   not let delete of the Use With Item because the classification
   is used by items, it incorrectly deleted the ClassSpecUseWith
   records for the ITEM object.  User can verify that in clicking
   on the icon Use With Object Detail in the Attributes table
   window.  This is why the user could still see the
   classification but attributes did not come over, because the
   Use With Object details records were gone. Fixed by not
   deleting the classspecusewith records when there is a problem
   in deleting the Use With object.>
