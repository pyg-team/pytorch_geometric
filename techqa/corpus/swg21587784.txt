QUESTION
 Getting new jobtask attributes to show up on a workorder. Existing jobtask attributes are set up to be copied but not new jobtask attributes. 

ANSWER
Information can be copied from a new Jobtask attribute to a corresponding value on workorders (WOACTIVITY) using a crossover domain. 
1) Create a new crossover domain with the following information:

Object: JOBTASK 
Validation Where Clause: jobtaskid=:jobtaskid 

Define the fields you want to crossover from JOBTASK to 
WORKORDER in the Crossover Fields table. 
Save your new crossover domain. 

2) Assign your crossover to a database field:
Go to Database Configuration. 
Bring up the WOACTIVITY object. 
On the Attributes tab, bring up the JOBTASKID attribute. 
In the domain field enter your new crossover domain you created above. 

3) Save and Configure the database. 

Now go to the Work Order application and enter a jobplan containing 
jobtasks and now you will notice your fields crossing over from jobtask 
to the woactivity. 

This solution is for manually generated Workorders using a jobplan but not for workorders generated via the Preventive Maintenance application.
