APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  We have finaly migrate our WCM content from 5.1.0.4 to
   6.0.1.5.CF8
   
   We found existing migrated content documents which can not be
   edited
   anymore. These documents contain images within the richtext
   editor. It
   is also not possible to open and close (without save) these
   documents.
   When we open and close such a document. We get following error
   message:
   
   
   
   In the SystemOut.log we found the following exception:
   [3/4/09 9:12:05:820 CET] 0000004e AbstractComma E   <Null
   Message>
   
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
   Invalid ICC Profile Data
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  test fix provided and solved the problem
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Unable to render specific images
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In the SystemOut.log we found the following exception:
   [3/4/09 9:12:05:820 CET] 0000004e AbstractComma E   <Null
   Message>
   
   java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
   Invalid ICC Profile Data
   
   Issue was due to invalid image being uploaded to WCM, however
   WCM was failing in an unecessary way rather than reporting
   the exception and skipping the image.
   
   The image file itself was to blame, had to do with invalid
   format for web images.
