QUESTION
 Can I use a DB2 HA solution in a VM (virtual machine) env? 

ANSWER
Yes, you can use HADR and HA across multiple VMs. A best practice is to ensure that the HADR Primary & Standby VMs are on separate physical hosts/server to ensure availability in the event of a physical host/server failure. For HA, recommendation is to use TSA instead of HACMP, a.k.a. PowerHA, as it is integrated into DB2 via the db2haicu utility.
