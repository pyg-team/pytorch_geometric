The issue is documented at Oracle 's JRE Update Release Notes [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u25-relnotes-1955741.html]. 



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Host On-Demand 11.0.8 cumulative refresh pack does not support Oracle's JRE 1.7.0_25. 

The highest Oracle's JRE supported by Host On-Demand is 1.7.0_21.
