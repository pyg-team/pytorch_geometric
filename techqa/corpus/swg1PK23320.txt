APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This customer has configured a CICS RAR resource at the node
   level.  The servers on this node are part of a cluster.  When he
   deploys his application at the cluster level he sees that the
   select box for map "resource reference to resources" is not
   populated with the resource that was defined at the node level.
   Customer has to manually update the resource information.  He
   feels that he should be able to use the select box to choose the
   proper resource.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All users of WebSphere Application Server    *

   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The WebSphere for Application Server    *
   *                      for z/OS drop down box for "map         *
   *                      resource reference to resources" is not *
   *                      populated with the resources defined at *
   *                      a node scope while the application is   *
   *                      selected to be deployed at a cluster    *
   *                      scope.                                  *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   To add flexibility to the panel allowing "map resource
   reference to resources". The selectbox showing the resources now
   display resources defined at the nodes where the cluster
   members has been defined.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The issue has been resolved by making code changes which
   populates the select box for resource references  to contain
   resources defined at cluster scope as well as resources
   defined at nodes at which cluster members are defined.
