APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM Developer for z Systems (IDz) v14.0.0.1, the code
   coverage report of a COBOL program with multiple sections does
   not include coverage for its paragraphs.
   
   The same issue can be reproduced using IDz 14.0.0.5.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
   * COBOL Code Coverage users running with Debug Tool V13 host,  *
   * or RDz 9.0.1.x or RDz 9.1.1.x Integrated Debugger            *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *
   * When there are sections and paragraphs or nested programs in *
   * the COBOL program, code coverage will not display the        *
   * correct hierarchy and all of the entries. The line numbers   *
   * of the entries may be incorrect.                             *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A tree structure has been added in the code coverage results to
   show parent and child relationship. All sections and paragraphs
   with same names will now be displayed correctly. The line number
   of the entries are also corrected.
   
   This is fixed in v14.0.0.7, v14.1.2:
   IBM Debug for z Systems
   IBM Developer for z Systems
   IBM Developer for z Systems Enterprise Edition.
