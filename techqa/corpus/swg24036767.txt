HOW CRITICAL IS THIS FIX?
After u51 update from Oracle for Java 7, the TEP browser and Java webstart clients will be prevented from running due to the lack of the permissions attribute in the jar file.



PROBLEMS SOLVED
This fix pack adds the permissions attribute to the appropriate jar files to satisfy the added security introduced by u51.
