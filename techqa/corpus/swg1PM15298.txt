ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Problem description:
   When a hook is in process for a long time, an error message pops
    up saying 'Request is taking more than 360000 seconds. Cancelli
   ng your request.'
   *The error message and time taken to have the error pop up varie
   s with different session timeout setting
   -if CM server session timeout setting is 1800, when hook runs fo
   r more than 6 min, error pops up showing
   'Request is taking more than 360000 seconds. Cancelling your req
   uest.'
   -if CM server session timeout setting is 3600, when hook runs fo
   r more than 9 min, error shows
   'Request is taking more than 540000 seconds. Cancelling your req
   uest.'
   
   Steps to recreate the error message
   1) in CQ designer, create a value change hook in a dropdown list
   , when the drop down list value is changed, set a value to 'test
   Field' textbox.
     perl script:
     sleep(420);
     $entity-?SetFieldValue('testField','testMessage');
   2) make sure the CM server session timeout is set to 1800
   3) in CQ web, change the value of the dropdown list to fire the
   hook
   
   Observe:
   About 6 min after the hook is fired, an error saying 'Request is
    taking more than 360000 seconds. Cancelling your request.' pops
    up.

   When a hook is executing for a long time in the ClearQuest
   7.1 Web Client, an inaccurate error message pops up saying
   "Request is taking more than 360000 seconds. Canceling your
   request."  It should say 3600 seconds.
