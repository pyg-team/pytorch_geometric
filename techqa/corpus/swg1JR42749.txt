APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCA and CEI messaging engines start with exceptions during
   Standalone profile creation with SQL Server database when SQL
   Server authentication is used.
   If a Standalone profile creation was created using SQL Server
   database and if the SQL Server authentication was used the
   messaging engine settings for SCA System Bus, SCA Application
   Bus and CEI Bus would result in exceptions during the server
   start. This iFix resolves the issue by fixing the settings. If a
   profile is already created with the wrong settings, the existing
   profile needs to be deleted and database needs to be cleaned
   before applying the iFix and regenerating the profile.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Fixed in BPM v8.0 as concurrent iFix.
