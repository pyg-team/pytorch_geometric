ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITIM Server Release: 4.5.1
   Notes Agent: 4.5.5 (4.4.1033) on Windows 2003 Standard and
   Enterprise
   
     Un-install functionality
   
   I have tested this function on Windows 2003 standard edition and
   Windows
   2003 Enterprise Edition and it failed to un-install so I could
   re-create
   your error. As a result I will need to raise and Apar and take
   this
   forward.
   
   
   Problem
   Un-install function of ITIM agent does not work correctly.
   NT's native un-install application does not function properly
   with this
   agent as well.
   Desired behaviour
   
   is for it to un-install using the Tivoli utility, or
   the Microsoft un-install application.
   
   Can you re-create the problem?
   I have re-created the customers problem in command line mode and
   using
   Windows Explorer and it still does not Un-install.
