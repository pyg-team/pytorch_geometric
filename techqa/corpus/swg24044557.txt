ABSTRACT
 This document describes how to download IBM MQ for HPE NonStop V8.0.2 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
IBM MQ for HPE NonStop V8 uses the IBM continuous delivery (CD) support model to ensure that all key function that is provided in IBM WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server V5.3.1 will also be made available in IBM MQ for HPE NonStop Version 8.0.x. A long term support model for V8 is not available. Clients who adopt IBM MQ for HPE NonStop V8.0 must follow the continuous delivery support model, which includes the installation of subsequent Version 8.0.x modification level updates to keep their IBM MQ environment current. Once Version 8.0.x achieves functional parity with Version 5.3.1, IBM intends that long term support with defect fixes provided via fixpacks will then be made available.
