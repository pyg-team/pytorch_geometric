 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are IBM Security Infrastructure products impacted by the 2016-12-31 leap second? 

CAUSE
There will be a leap second on 31 Dec 2016 UTC. See the Space.com article [http://www.space.com/33361-leap-second-2016-atomic-clocks.html] on the subject for additional information.

ANSWER
The impact of the leap second on each product is described below:


Security Network Protection (XGS)


 * NTP users are unaffected as the time will be updated by the NTP server. 
 * The following updates add support for the leap second on the XGS sensor: 5.3.3.1, 5.3.2.5, and 5.3.1.11. Running earlier firmware versions will result in event time stamps showing one extra second after conversion from system time to local time. The sensor will experience no other functional impact from the leap second.

Security Network Intrusion Prevention System (GX) 
 * NTP users are unaffected as the time will be updated by the NTP server. 
 * There is currently no patch to adjust the time for non-NTP users. This will result in event time stamps showing one extra second after conversion from system time to local time. The sensor will experience no other functional impact from the leap second.

Security Network Active Bypass 

This system is not impacted by the leap second. See the information that is provided in Technote 1903782: Network Active Bypass support for Leap Second [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903782]. 

Security SiteProtector System 

Support for the leap second occurs at the operating system level. See Microsoft's Support for the leap second [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2722715] article for further information.
