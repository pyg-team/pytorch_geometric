Title: IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) V7.5 installation fails during an IBM DB2 express installation - United States

Text:
install; db2 express; password; BPMADMIN; bpm7.5 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 An IBM Business Process Manager V7.5 installation fails if you do not provide the appropriate password for the IBM DB2 administrative user, which is bpmadmin. 

SYMPTOM
A Typical IBM Business Process Manager V7.5 installation fails to install DB2 express with the following message :
Error during "install" Phase: 

Installation of DB2 Express has failed. 

Log location c:\IBM\BPM7.5\logs\db2install.logs


CAUSE
A typical installation installs DB2 Express if an existing database is not specified. DB2 Express is available only for Microsoft Windows and Linux 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The user must be the administrator or root user and must not have another DB2 product installed on the same server. 

An DB2 Express installation requires a DB2 administrative user on the operating system. During the typical installation you have to provide the DB2 administrative user ID and password. See the following screen shot:

[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21503268&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21503268&aid=1]

The default user ID and password is bpmadmin and bpmadmin1 respectively. If the bpmadmin user does not exist on the operating system, the installer attempts to create the user. If the password does not match the security password policy set for the operating system, the DB2 installation fails.


ENVIRONMENT
DB2 Express is selected to be installed during IBM Business Process Manager V7.5 or IBM Integration Designer V7.5 test environment installation 

 


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
To see this issue, open the BPM_7.5_installation/logs/db2install.log file. 

 An error exists that is similar to the following message:

1: ERROR:The installation program has been unable to create the user "bpmadmin" on computer "wsds12387ehkhfe" because the password specified is too short. 


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, complete the following steps: 

 1. Clean up the product directories which might have been created during the failed installation.
    
    
 2. Restart the installation process.
    
    
 3. During the installation process when the wizard requests the database administrator user ID and password, use the appropriate password that matches the requirement of the operating system rules. 
    
    
 4. If the DB2 administrator user ID that you select already exists on the operating system, make sure to use the correct password.


For a Typical Install, you do not see the prompt to enter a DB2 user and password. You have to chose the custom install option if you have restrictive password requirement to create new users. RELATED INFORMATION
