Title: IBM Stlinks enabled apps will change standalone Sametime client's status to Away when left idle for 10 minutes - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM
You are using Stlinks to enable awareness in your applications

CAUSE
When you log in to the Sametime server with your client, the server maintains a login session for that client logon. When you log in to Quickr, stlinks gets its own login session. 

When you minimize the web page stlinks has a timeout to change the status to away for the stlinks login session. Since this happens the client login session has been set to away by the server, not it's own Auto-Status mechanism. Since the client's Auto-Status mechanism wasn't started you either have to manually set yourself to Available or bring up the Quickr web page and mouse around on the page.




DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The client is behaving as designed. In the client's vision of what is happening, it was set to Away "manually". When the client is set to any status manually it has to manually be changed back to Available or any different status message.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
As a workaround you can disable Auto-Status in stlinks so it never changes to Away. 

On the Sametime or Quickr server (whichever one you are using for awareness within Quickr) open the C:\lotus\domino\data\domino\html\sametime\stlinks\stlinks.js using a text editor.
Find the following line:
var g_isAutoawayRunning = true;

Change the value to false.

This will turn off Auto-Status changes for your applications that use stlinks from that server. It will not prevent users from changing their status manually.
