PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to login to CI we get a generic error: https:// secure site. SSL related.
We had recently updated to platform 3.4.1.2 and running CAD integrator 12.1.1. We have taken a patch to 12.1.2.1 to get the option for Always Trust SSL Certificates. That did not resolve our login issue.



SYMPTOM
When attempting to login to CI it is reporting a login failure. 

2016-02-20 12:42:16,855 ERROR [com.tririga.ci.login.LoginServiceImpl](pool-1-thread-6) Login failed: org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for 
"https://FRONT_END_SERVER:443/pc/ci/dispatch":peer not authenticated; nested exception is
javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated 
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated 


CAUSE
Incorrect version configuration for TLSv1


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
We requested that the customer provide us with a Must Gather summary for our extended team to review the Websphere configuration. Following the link below and the instructions for Collecting Data Manually we were able to identify a disconnect in the version of TLSv1. 

The SSL trace shows:
[3/25/16 9:27:01:186 EDT] 000000bf SystemOut O WebContainer : 0, fatal error: 40: Client requested protocol TLSv1 not enabled or not supported javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:

Looking at the security.xml file for the node, we can see that it is set to use TLSv1.2 exclusively. Therefore it is not able to accept the SSL handshake from the client because it is trying to use TLSv1.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this issue, it is necessary to either configure the client to use TLSv1.2, or configure the server to allow TLSv1.
