QUESTION
 I have a live/active workflow instance but am unsure of the original source workflow definition/map that the live workflow instance was launched from. How can I find out? 

ANSWER
1. Use IBM FileNet P8 Workplace or WorkplaceXT to bring up "Process Administrator". 

2. Find the F_WobNum value of the workflow instance. 

3. On the IBM FileNet P8 Process Engine server, start "vwtool". 

4. Optionally issue "hardcopy" to persist the commands/output to a file. 

5. Run "wobquery". 

6. Specify the query criteria for wobquery. Following is an example: 

 

 * Queue or roster name: ABC_12
 * 3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Selective query? (y/CR=n): y
 * 
 * Index name (? for help, CR = 'F_WobTag'): F_WobNum
 * 
 * Value of field 'F_WobNum', type=WorkObjectNumber, (CR=none): 9004FC33E6D48F429EEF2E4CD8500DE6
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Filter condition (SQL expression):
 * 
 * Display work objects, invocations, or roster records (CR=w, i, or r):
 * 
 * Display size? (y/CR=n): 
 * 
 * Verbose output? (CR=y/n): 

7. In the wobquery output, locate the field "F_SourceDoc" whose value has the format of <value1>:<value2>:<value3> 

where 

 * 
 * 
 * <value2>: GUID of the Version Series ID of the workflow map which is a versioned document. 
 * <value3>: GUID of the version that was used to start/create the workflow instance.


8. Use IBM FileNet P8 Enterprise Manager (EM) to search from the table "Document" using criteria Column="Version Series", Condition="Equal To", Value=<Version Series GUID> from F_SourceDoc <value2> in step 7. 9. The EM search resultset should include all the versions of the workflow definition. Double-click any of these versions to bring up the Properties page. 

10. Click the Versions tab. 

11. Scroll to and select the "Released" version. 

12. Click "Display Property Page". 

13. On the Properties page of the released version, click "All Properties". 

14. Scroll to the "Folders Filed In" and select "1 - [Object (Worfklow Definition)]" (assuming there is only 1 folder). 

15. On the Properties page of the folder, click the "Properties" tab to review detailed information about the folder where the workflow definition is filed in. 

16. Use Workplace/WorkplaceXT to browse to the folder from step 15 and view/edit the workflow. Note that the version that was used for launching the given live workflow instance is not necessarily the latest or "Released" version or even the most recently transferred workflow version. For example, 

 * 
 * 
 * b. Then version 2.0 was modified and saved as version 3.0 and was transferred to PE. 
 * c. Then version 3.0 was modified and saved as version 4.0.


In this example, the live workflow instance was launched using version 2.0, but the next new workflow launched will be using the transferred version 3.0; however the latest "Released" version is version 4.0 which has not been transferred to PE. To view/edit a particular version such as version 2.0, 

 * 
 * 
 * b. Click on "Versions". 
 * c. Click on the row that has "Major Version" 2 and "Minor Version" 0.
