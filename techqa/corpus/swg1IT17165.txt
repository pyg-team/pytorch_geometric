APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  HTTP/1.1 POST or PUT requests not containing any message body
   and not having the Content-Length header explicitly set to 0 get
   rejected with 411 "Length Required". This is in conflict with
   the specification, which assumes the content-length is 0, when
   it's not explicitly present, invariant to the HTTP method used.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use "Content-Length: 0" with empty requests.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Incoming HTTP/1.1 requests that use the POST or PUT method, but
   contain no message body without explcitly specifying
   "Content-Length: 0" will incorrectly get a "HTTP/1.1 411" error.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 7.0.0.16, 7.1.0.13, 7.2.0.10, 7.5.0.4,
   7.5.1.3 and 7.5.2.1
