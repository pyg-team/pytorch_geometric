Title: IBM Sentinel RMS License Manager service fails to start on Windows 2012 R2 Server - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You have installed the Sentinel RMS License Manager to Windows 2012 R2 Server. After installation you notice that the LicenseManager service has not started. You attempt to start it manually and that fails as well. 

SYMPTOM
License Manager service does not start


CAUSE
From the Windows server event Log: 

"The Sentinel RMS License Manager service is marked as an interactive service. However, the system is configured to not allow interactive services. This service may not function properly." 


ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2012 Server, Windows 2012 R2 Server



DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You review the Windows Event log to find out why the service is not starting



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

Windows Server 2012 no longer allows interactive services, by default, which makes the Interactive Services Detection service unnecessary.

If you must run a legacy application that installs an interactive service on Windows Server 2012, you may sacrifice server stability for compatibility by changing the following registry value from the default of "1" to "0".

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows
NoInteractiveServices

After doing so and rebooting, the Interactive Services Detection Service will start. RELATED INFORMATION
