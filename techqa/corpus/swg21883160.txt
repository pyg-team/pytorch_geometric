ENVIRONMENT
APMUI 7.7.0.1


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
In order to be discovered by APMUI, the IIB monitoring agent must be at 7.1 or higher version. 


For example, if the agent (product code qi) is at 07.01.02.00 version, then the agent is not discovered in APMUI. On the other hand, if the agent is at version 07.10.01.03, then it is discovered by APMUI when applications for IBM Integration Bus are added.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Find the IIB monitoring agent (qi) version using commands 'cinfo -i' on UNIX, or 'kincinfo -i' on WINDOWS. Upgrade the agent to V7.1 or higher version.
