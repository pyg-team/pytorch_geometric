QUESTION
 How do I enable the "Sticky" feature and behavior for fingerprint processing when using Verify in IBM Datacap Navigator 

ANSWER
The Purchase Order Line Reconciliation ( POLR )and Sticky Options are additional task profiles that are not used by all customers. In order to avoid the confusion for those who do not use these additional task profiles, they can now be enabled or disabled by configuring the settings within the application workflow Verify task profile in Datacap Navigator . 

To enable these features perform the following steps: 

 1. Log into IBM Datacap Navigator Administration 
 2. Select and edit the application workflow Verify task profile 
 3. From the Advanced tab, go to the "Rulerunner settings" section 
 4. In the "Additional task profiles" setting, change the value to "Find Details,Calculate 
    Blank,POLR:2:0,Sticky:0:0,ReRecog:0:0" to enable POLR and Sticky feature 
 5. Save the settings
