Title: IBM How to collect STAP debug information on the Database Server (Unix/Linux). - United States

Text:
stap; s-tap; debug TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 If the STAP fails to start on the Database server, you may need look for the cause of the failure in existing log files and/or collect additional debugging information. 

ANSWER
First, you should look at the standard STAP log files: 

 * 
 * /tmp/guard_stap.stdout.txt
 * 
 * /tmp/guard_stap.stderr.txt


If the information in these files does not help to solve the problem, you may need to collect additional debugging information. 

Log in with root credentials, make sure STAP is not running and start STAP in debug mode: 
 * /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_stap \ 
 * 
 * /usr/local/guardium/guard_stap/guard_tap.ini 4 \
 * 
 * > /tmp/stap_debug.log 2>&1
 * 
 * 

This command will start STAP in debug mode level 4 and will redirect stdout and stderr to a file. 

Note: this command assumes you have STAP installation and guard_tap.ini file in the default directories.
