APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest Nodes, if the remote
   server does not specify a content length for the reply to a HEAD
   request then the request will timeout.
   In this particular instance the HTTP specification mandates that
   the remote server MUST NOT return a message body therefore even
   in the absence of no content length in the HTTP headers the node
   should not attempt to read a message body.

   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   When using the HTTPRequest or SOAPRequest Nodes, if the remote
   server does not specify a content length for the reply to a HEAD
   request then the request will timeout.
   In this particular instance the HTTP specification mandates that
   the remote server MUST NOT return a message body therefore even
   in the absence of no content length in the HTTP headers the node
   should not attempt to read a message body.
   
   There are a number of resource name changes between WebSphere
   Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0. For details

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  IBM Integration Bus has been modified so that it no longer
   attempts to read the body of HEAD requests and therefore the
   timeout no longer occurs.
