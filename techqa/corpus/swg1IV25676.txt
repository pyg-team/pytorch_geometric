APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ENVIRONMENT:
   SAP 620 IF0014
   
   
   ERROR DESCRIPTION:
   We have System_Down situation (situation name
   dbk_aldown_gsa2_mysap)
   running for both SAP Instances (cf. tacmd listSit/viewsystemlist
   output).
   The situation only fires once, indicating that Application
   Instance
   PPA-ppaappl1_PPA_25:Ins is down. The situation does not
   fire another System_Down Alert, even though both SAP Instances,
   inlcuding the Central Instance PPA-ppaci_PPA_25:Ins
   have been down for several hours. So the issue is that up to now
   we
   never have seen any System_Down Alert indicating that the
   Central Instance is down.
   
   
   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
   1. Create a Single SAP system(single SAP ID) having multiple SAP
   instances nodes (:INS)
   2. Start Agent to monitorthis SAP Server
   Select
   R3_Alert_System_Up situation under until clause of
   R3_Alert_System_Down
   situation
   3. Stop SAP instance. An R3_Alert_System_Down alert appears on
   one node.
   3. Start the SAP Agent.R3_Alert_System_Up alert fires.
   4. The R3_Alert_System_Down should get cleared when
   R3_Alert_System_Up alert has arrived, but it did not, because
   this one is associated to a different subnode.
