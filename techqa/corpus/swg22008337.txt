PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When the IBM Transformation Extender Advanced (ITXA) also known as IBM Standards Processing Engine (SPE) support team needs to review debug / troubleshooting logs they will ask you to enable logging based on how ITXA is invoked. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
There are several types of logs that can be generated when troubleshooting ITXA issues. These are listed below and the logs needed vary based on how you invoke ITXA: 

 * General ITXA Debug logs for all situations 
 * ITXA Version Information [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22007234] 
 * ITXA Database logs 
 * ITXA User Interface logs 
 * Sterling B2B Integrator logs 
 * IBM Information Bus logs 
 * IBM Transformation Extender SPE Adapter tracing 
 * IBM Transformation Extender Advanced Data Dump



General ITXA Debug logs for all situations: 
Edit the customer_overrides.properties file, located in the ITXA installation directory and uncomment the wtxlogger, spelogger, systemlogger and txlogger entries so that the respective sections are similar to:  * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *

ITXA Database logs: 
Edit the dbprops.cfg file, located in the ITXA installation directory and uncomment the openjpa entry so that it has an entry similar to: 
openjpa.Log=File=OpenJPA.log, DefaultLevel=WARN, Runtime=INFO, Tool=INFO, SQL=TRACE 


If the File= value does not contain a path, the specified File= value will be saved to the tpuiserver\usr\servers\defaultServer (Windows) or tpuiserver/usr/servers/defaultServer (UNIX) subdirectory of your ITXA installation. 

This log is useful to analyze database activity between ITXA and the database. 





ITXA User Interface logs: 
Enabled by default, ITXA generates a messages.log, trace.log and console.log file. These logs record activity between the core ITXA product, the database and the user interface and are saved to the tpuiserver\usr\servers\defaultServer\logs (Windows) or tpuiserver/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs (UNIX) subdirectory of your ITXA installation. 




Sterling B2B Integrator logs 
If ITXA services are invoked from Sterling B2B Integrator (B2Bi), go to the B2Bi dashboard and proceed to Operations - System - Logs and enable the following logs: 
SPEServices 
System 
To enable these logs, select the [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22008337&amp;aid=1]icon and then set the respective Logging Level to On and click on the Save button. 

Once the issue is reproduced attach the SPEServices, System log and the BP's Status Report to your PMR. 





IBM Information Bus logs If an IBM Information Bus (IIB) node invokes an ITXA service: 

Enable an IIB Service Trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21177321] 
Enable SPE Nodes Debugging by editing the speiib.properties file located in: 

 *  %SPE_INSTALL_DIR%\speiib.properties (Windows) 
   ${SPE_INSTALL_DIR}/speiib.properties (UNIX) 

and set the SPENode.ConsoleLevel property to DEBUG. The default value is INFO. 
These DEBUG entries will be written to the IIB integration nodeâ€™s console.txt file that you can include with the PMR. 





IBM Transformation Extender SPE Adapter tracing 
If an IBM Transformation Extender map invokes the SPE adapter, enable the SPE adapter trace with either the -T, -T+, TE, -TE+, -TV or-TV+ options when using the data harness functions [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVSD8_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.dtx.adapspe.doc/references/r_Data_Harness_Command_Syntax.htm] in a map rule using the GET/PUT functions, if it's invoked from a maps Input (Source) / Output (Target) card using the Standards Processing Engine option or with input/output card aliases [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVSD8_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.dtx.adapspe.doc/references/r_Command_Aliases.htm]. 



IBM Transformation Extender Advanced Data Dump 
In instances where an IBM Transformation Extender map is being invoked and you are asked to show the data that is being passed into ITXA, you can set the environment variable WTX_DUMP_DATA=true.  * set WTX_DUMP_DATA=true
 * 
 * 
 * export WTX_DUMP_DATA=true
 * 
 * 


If enabled and the wtxlogger is enabled, the input data that is passed to the map is also included in the wtxlogger log file. This can be useful for situations where you need to see the actual input data to the ITX map, however, it can cause the log file to become very large, depending on the amount of data that is passed. 


In all instances, the application that invokes ITXA must be restarted for these logging features to be enabled.
