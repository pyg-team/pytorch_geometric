CVEID: CVE-2016-5547 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5547]
DESCRIPTION: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Libraries component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service resulting in a low availability impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/120871] for the current score

CVEID: CVE-2016-2183 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183]
DESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the DES/3DES cipher, used as a part of the SSL/TLS protocol. By capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between the SSL/TLS server and the client, a remote attacker able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability to recover the plaintext data and obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is known as the SWEET32 Birthday attack.
CVSS Base Score: 3.7

You can install the OMOD patches for Optim Data Privacy Application (a.k.a, ModApp) using one of two methods: 
 1. Using the OMOD iFix that is found on FixCentral. 
 2. Follow the instructions in this Technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21997922] to use IBM Installation Manger to directly download the iFix from IBM and apply it. This method requires an external internet connection on the host machine containing Installation Manager and the Optim Data Privacy Application.
