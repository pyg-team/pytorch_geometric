APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SUA 9.1 dashboard
   
   The "Software Use Analysis v9" dashboard in the BigFix Console
   displays erroneous SCM warnings
   
   
   There are problems with this:
   
   1) SCM warnings should not be displayed in a SUA dashboard;
   2) The warnings state the SCM and SCM Exception Management
   dashboards, and SCM Web Reports will be superseded by Security
   and Compliance Analytics.  The SCM Exception Management
   dashboard is being used by the BigFix Optic (i.e., DHS
   CyberScope) reporting utility.
   3) Clicking on the "Remove Old SCM Reporting Tools" button
   would break the ability users to setup SCM exceptions.
   
    SCA and SUA are only related in as much as a code base goes,
   not actual BigFix functionality.  So having SCA "warning" in a
   SUA dashboard does not make any functional sense.
   
   In addition, removing the "older" SCA reporting dashboards will
   break the new BigFix Optic/DHS CyberScope reporting
   functionality dev is currently preping for GA.  The BigFix
   Optic functionality is specifically automated through the older
   SCA reporting dashboards.
