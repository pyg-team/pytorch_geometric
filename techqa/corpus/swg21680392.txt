PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 While connecting to WebGUI through a SOCKS connection on a Linux client java applets like the AEL load. However, when the connection is made through a windows SOCKS client the AEL and other java applets do not load. 

SYMPTOM
The windows SOCKS client java console will report timeouts while attempting to download the jar files used by the java applet. If you use the jar file url reported in the client side java console and paste it into a browser the request will also timeout. The normal case would be that the browser would prompt you to download and save the jar file.


CAUSE
This is a known issue caused by the windows SOCKS client.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
From the windows SOCKS client you will have to first make a connection to the local WebGUI network to a terminal server or CITRIX server. From that server you will be able to load java applets.
