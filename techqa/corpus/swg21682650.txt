Title: IBM nco_confpack fails "Unable to convert group id" - United States

Text:
nco_confpack; group id; to name TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 nco_confpack fails to export data from the Object Server with the error "Unable to convert group id". 

SYMPTOM
Errors received in nco_confpack output
Unable to convert group id, 2000, to name for tool Add to Task List 
Unable to convert group id, 4000, to name for tool Assign Action 



CAUSE
The bi-directional Object Server gateway is transferring security data between the Object Server, but not tool data. The groups were deleted in the Primary Object Server, the gateway removed the groups from the Backup Object Server security tables, but the tool references were left intact.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve this problem, add and delete the group IDs in the Backup Object Server to remove all references.

To prevent the problem in the future, configure the bi-directional gateway to replicate tools data as well as security data. To configure the gateway, uncomment the entries in the gateway .map and two .tblrep.def files for the tools database tables.
