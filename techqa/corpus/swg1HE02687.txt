   5. Launch SMARTEAM Editor again and login with admin
     -> Password expiration warning is displayed then if enter
   short string which does not meet the policy,  we cannot login
   the  DB

   error
   6. Select Admin/Admin console
   7. Launch Password as follows and if enter short string which
   does not meet password policy, we can succeed the password
   without error
