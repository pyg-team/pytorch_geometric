PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When testing WebSphere Adapter for Siebel Business Applications Universal Test Client (UTC) on Rational Application Developer, the error "no input integration object hierarchy found.(SBL-EAI-04398)" occurs. Also, the UTC cannot construct the child business object for a Siebel business object that contains a child business object if the parameter value of the child business object is not set to be "Objects". 

SYMPTOM
After running the J2C wizard on Rational Application Developer V7.5.1 and starting the UTC to test the Business Service function of the adapter, you will see an error like following: 

javax.resource.ResourceException: No input integration object hierarchy found.(SBL-EAI-04398)

Also there are no effects on the child business object on the enterprise information system (EIS) side, even if the child business object is defined when invoking the adapter. 

CAUSE
When testing the adapter using Rational Application Developer V7.5.1 Universal Test Client(UTC), you can define a child business object by UTC and select the type of that business object. The child business object can be displayed on the client interface, but UTC cannot construct the child business object and pass it to the adapter in the run time.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
When defining a child business object using the UTC, always select "Objects" as the value for child business object. In addition, you can invoke the adapter with either JSP or EJB which will ensure the adapter run time works appropriately.
