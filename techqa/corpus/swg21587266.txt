QUESTION
 How do I enable timer in the engine logs? 

ANSWER
There are different methods to enable the engine timer logs that are dependant upon your version. 
For versions 7.5 - 9.0 you will modify the engine.properties file and change the MAD_TIMER=0 to MAD_TIMER=1.

9.2 and above in the log4j.xml file you will need to change the following lines from:

<logger name="com.initiatesystems.hub.logging.TimerLog">
<!-- set level=[OFF|ALL] to disable/enable custom Initiate TIMER level logging -->
<level value="OFF"/>

to:

<logger name="com.initiatesystems.hub.logging.TimerLog">
<!-- set level=[OFF|ALL] to disable/enable custom Initiate TIMER level logging -->
<level value="ALL"/>

A restart of the engine will need to be performed in order for the change to take place. Timer will remain on until the above changes are reverted back and the engine is restarted.

If you would like to turn on timer for a short period of time without having to stop and restart the engine this can be done through Hub Manager (7.5 and older) or through Workbench (8.0 and above). For more information on how to utilize this functionality please refer to the "Initiate Workbench User Guide" for your version.
