Title: IBM Excel ODBC Import Error "Table 'xxxxx' has no columns and will not be shown" - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I'm using ODBC to import an Excel spreadsheet into SPSS for Windows. At the 2nd step of the Database Wizard, when I grab the worksheet I want to bring over from the 'Available Tables' box and start to move it to the 'Retrieve fields in this order' box, I get an Error Message pop-up that says 
"Table 'xxxxxx' has no columns and will not be shown." 

I know that's not true, and I can open the file in SPSS using File->Open->Data and selecting the .xls file directly. What's wrong? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The following issues are known to cause this error message.

1) The spreadsheet file itself is buried in a deep directory structure (e.g., seven subdirectories away from the root). How deep is too deep seems to vary from installation to installation, but try moving the file closer to the root, and then re-configure your Data Source Name to follow the new path and import again.

2) There's at least one period in the name of the spreadsheet file. Filename.xls is fine - file.name.xls is not. This is actually a problem with the Microsoft driver itself and not SPSS. For instance, if you were to try importing a table from this file into Access using ODBC, you would encounter the same error. Rename the file to remove the extra period (underscores are fine). Re-configure your Data Source Name to fit the new file name and try again.

3) The version of Excel specified in the Data Source Name configuration does not match the version in which the spreadsheet file was saved. Either re-save the spreadsheet out of Excel in the proper version, or re-configure the Data Source Name to match.
