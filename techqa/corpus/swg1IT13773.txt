APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When using the Graphical Data Map Global Cache Transforms inside
   the nested Return of another transform, and/or including
   conditional If/Else within the Return the map can report
   unresolved connections after saving. Error markers such as the
   following will be shown on the Map in the Toolkit.
   
   The Cache Put input or output object $record2 could not be
   found. Test_LoadCache.map /CacheExample Map Problem
   
   In some conditions the map might not show an error marker, but
   will fail in the runtime with an error like the following:
   
   'IXJXE0797E: [ERR 0712][ERR XPST0008] No binding was found for
   the external variable 'record2'.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  It might be possible to avoid some issues by reducing the level
   of nesting and/or replacing If/Else with a Custom XPath
   transform.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of IBM Integration Bus who use the Mapping node with
   Global Cache transform contained in nested Return transforms.
   
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows on x86-64 platform, Linux on x86-64 platform

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The Graphical Data Mapping editor is corrected so that Global
   Cache Transforms can be used in nested maps and will deploy and
   execute correctly.
