APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the number of custodians in scope are large , Currently
   there is no way to release all the people in scope with out
   traversing page by page .
   For example If the scope has 90k custodiads, then the
   attorney/paralegal has to traverse 90 pages to select all 90k
   custodians.
   This is more manual work and it can break as well.
