SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Before you deploy IBM® StoredIQ for Legal, verify that you meet these prerequisites: 

 * At least one physical server with sufficient processor, RAM, and hard disk configuration for the planned management project. 
 * VMWare ESX or VMWare ESXi on CD/DVD or USB drive. 
 * IP addresses, cables, and physical switch ports for the VMWare ESX or VMWare ESXi interface. 
 * A virtual machine (VM) with at least 4 vCPUs, a memory of 14 GB, and a storage of 250 GB. 
 * A network connection. The ports 9443, 9043, 443, and 22 are needed for a connection between the administrative workstation and the VM. The connection to directory server, email server, and IBM StoredIQ server will be configured in StoredIQ for Legal. You can use the ports that fit your environment requirements. 


For detailed information about hardware and software compatibility, see the detailed system requirements document [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.plan.doc/p_sysreq.htm]. 

INSTALLING STOREDIQ FOR LEGAL
If you download the product from IBM Passport Advantage®, follow the directions in the download document at http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043874 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043874].

For installation instructions, see the topics in the section about deploying and configuring [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.deploy.doc/d_deploy.htm]in the StoredIQ for Legal documentation.

For upgrade instructions and additional migration information, check the section about upgrading [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZL2P_2.0.3/com.ibm.biq.deploy.doc/d_upgrade.htm]. 

ISSUES, LIMITATIONS, AND WORKAROUNDS
ISSUES
At the time of publication, the following issues were known:

Although the final upgrade status shows completed, one or more individual configuration steps might have failed
Although the last entry in the upgrade log file shows upgrade completed, check the complete log file for errors, especially the sections for the SSL and SSO configuration steps. To avoid the most common configuration errors, make sure the following information is available prior to upgrading the system:


 * The value of the certificateAliasFromKeyFile configuration setting in the /home/was/certs/upload/input.cfg file must match the alias of the certificate referenced in the metadata file. 
 * The /siq/conf/saml2-idp-metadata.xml file must exist.


The upgrade log files might show SQL errors although the upgrade was completed successfully 
During the upgrade (specifically during schema initialization), the SQL errors SqlSyntaxErrorExceptionand SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException might be written to the log files. These error messages can be ignored. 

The global hold reminder overview lists released custodians until the next reminder cycle starts 
A custodian who is released from all hold notices that participate in the current global hold reminder 
cycle will still show up on the Global Hold Reminder Overview page with the status the custodian 
had before being released from the last hold notice. However, no further follow-up messages to the global 
hold reminder will be sent to the released custodian. As soon as the next reminder cycle starts, the list of custodians is updated to reflect only those custodians who have active hold notices participating in the global hold reminder. 

LIMITATIONS
At the time of publication, the following limitations were known:

ASCII based sorting in upgraded clients
Although the new StoredIQ for Legal 2.0.3.2 client uses case-insensitive lexical sorting, clients migrated from 2.0.3 which were themselves migrated from 2.0.2.1 or earlier, will continue to use case-sensitive sorting based on the numeric character value.

Existing backup files can no longer be used after upgrade
Because of changes to the internal keystore settings, backup files created with earlier product versions cannot be used to restore data in StoredIQ for Legal 2.0.3.2. Therefore, create a new backup file as soon as you completed the upgrade.

Message editor limitations 

 * When underlining text and modifying the text color, sometimes the color is not applied to the underline. 
 * No user-specific formatting style is applied to the system variables. 
 * In Mozilla Firefox, system variables cannot be selected via keyboard operations. 
 * In Microsoft Edge, when you paste within the contents section of an interview, a hold notice, or the respective templates, the cursor jumps to the end of the page and back to the pasted text. 

WORKAROUNDS
The following workarounds to known issues are available:

Imported workflow and report definitions, import mappings, and data request forms might not work
If you import workflow and report definitions, import mappings, and data request forms that were created on a system with a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3.1 into a system with a later StoredIQ for Legal version, these definitions and forms might not work. 

Starting with Version 2.0.3.1, the names of newly created custom attributes internally are prefixed with "ca_". When defining custom attributes in a system with a later StoredIQ for Legal version with display names that you used for attributes referenced in definitions and forms in a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3.1 and reuse these definitions and forms in later versions, the names will not match. To fix this issue, edit the respective .json, .csv, .bpmn, or .rtpdesign file and update the attribute names to match the new naming scheme.

The Db2 configuration settings might not be updated during the upgrade
When upgrading from a StoredIQ for Legal version before Version 2.0.3, the Db2® configuration parameters might not be updated to the new settings. Some transactions might fail due to the limited transaction log size. As a workaround, change the settings manually by running the following commands:

runuser -l db2inst -c "/home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using logfilsiz 4096"
runuser -l db2inst -c "home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using logsecond 100"
runuser -l db2inst -c "/home/db2inst/sqllib/bin/db2 update db cfg for ilgdb using locktimeout 40"

Restart the StoredIQ for Legal server after changing the settings.

The upgrade to StoredIQ for Legal Version 2.0.3.2 might fail because of a docker container start error
During the upgrade, an error like the following might occur:

2017-03-10 09:12:10 Container ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst not running -> starting... 
Container ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst not running -> starting... 
Error response from daemon: open /dev/mapper/docker-253:1-134317184-14cf1dfbc32c1f986fc931782bc06ba747fd4d8baa8d9b9c3b5c9cf0f23f6c73: no such file or directory
Error: failed to start containers: ilg_sol_plugin_db2inst

In this case, the upgrade fails.
As a workaround, restart the upgrade process.

When a custodian is added to a recurring interview, the status shown on the overview page might be misleading
When a custodian is added to a recurring interview, the status of the custodian is immediately shown as Response pending - Initial even if the initial interview hasn't been sent yet. 

To determine whether the initial interview has been sent already, check the Initial interview column in the custodians list. If this column is empty, the initial interview hasn't been sent yet. If the Initial interview column contains a date, the initial interview has been sent already.
