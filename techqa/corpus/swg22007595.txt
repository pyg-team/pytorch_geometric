PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Receiving a javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure error in IBM Rational Publishing Engine (RPE) when attempting to download a schema or generate a document from applications in the IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) suite. 

SYMPTOM
In the rpe.log file, you may see an error like the one below: 


javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
com.ibm.rational.rpe.common.utils.conn.ConnectionException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
...

...



CAUSE
The CLM environment is configured with an IBM HTTP Server (IHS) reverse proxy and none of the ciphers included in IHS configuration are supported by RPE.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check the IHS logs. In the error.log, you'll see an entry that says: 

SSL0222W: SSL Handshake Failed, No ciphers specified (no shared ciphers or no shared protocols)


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
In the IHS httpd.conf file, ensure that the following ciphers are listed: 



TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (cipher shortname is 2F)
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (cipher shortname is 3C)
