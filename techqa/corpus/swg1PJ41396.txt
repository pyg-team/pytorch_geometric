APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  This issue was raised by the IBM Content Collector (ICC) team
   during testing for their
   Legacy Content Search Engine (LCSE) to Content Search Services
   (CSS) migration scenarios.
   
   If you create two Property Templates having the same display
   name but different Symbolic Names, Filenet Enterprise Manager
   (FEM) inconsistently creates the Property Definition from the
   wrong template.
   
   1.  Create two Property Templates:
     - Display Name: ICCFrom, SymbolicName: ICCFrom
     - Display Name: ICCFrom, SymbolicName: ICCFromSV
   
   2.  Note the Property IDs from the two templates created.
   
   3.  Run the Add/Remove properties dialog from a selected class.
   
   4.  Select the first ICCFrom property in the Available list box.
   Note the ID of the selected property.
   
   5.  Select OK to apply the changes.
   
   6.  From the Property Definitions tab, select the newly added
   property and then the Edit button.
   
   7.  Note the Primary ID may not be what was selected above.
