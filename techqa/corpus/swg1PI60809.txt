APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You have successfully installed and licensed IBM SPSS Modeler
   18.0 to use Concurent User Licensing on a remote Sentinel RMS
   License Manager  (or so you think).  Still each time you launch
   the product, you are met with the same Welcome Screen telling
   you
   you have X many days left in your Trial period and you are
   offered the chance to license you product (again... and again).
   
   WORKAROUND:
   This comes down to the fact that, while the LAW successfully
   updates the DaemonHost value in spssprod.inf, it does not
   disable the the trial license.
   
   To do so, simply rename the license file in your product
   installation directory.
   For example:
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\18.0\lservrc
   to
   C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\18.0\lservrc_bak
   
   Alternatively, you could use the "#" character to 'comment out'
   the license string(s) within "C:\Program
   Files\IBM\SPSS\Modeler\18.0\lservrc"
