ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  APAR Type:            Field
   Approver Initials:    Prajith P Kumaran
   Severity:             2
   Reported Release:     610
   Compid:               5724C04VP
   ABSTRACT:      VIOS agent fails to get HMC information from
   lssvc.
   If the agent fails to get HMC information from lssvc, it will
   try to get HMC IP
   from lsrsrc and the order in which lsrsrc gives HMC IPs are
   unpredictable,
   hence VA may try to contact wrong HMC.
   
   RECREATE INSTRUCTIONS:
   
   1. Connect a CEC to 2 HMCs and install a ITM VA 06.10.01.00
   agent on one LPAR (note that, other levels of va agent won't
   expose this problem)
   2. Configure the VA to connect to the 2nd HMC lsrsrc shows:
   
   My case :
   # lsrsrc -dx IBM.ManagementServer Hostname ManagerType
   "192.0.2.2":"HMC":
   "192.0.2.1":"HMC":
   
   # /usr/ios/cli/ioscli lssvc ITM_premium
   MANAGING_SYSTEM:192.0.2.1
   HOSTNAME:192.0.2.10
   RESTART_ON_REBOOT:TRUE
   #
   
   BTW, I don't know what's the order in which lsrsrc shows HMC,
   for this we suppose to contact respective team. But in ITM we
   are using lsrsrc only if we fail to get HMC details from lssvc.
   In my local setup its always shows in one particular order.
   
   3. Establish SSH connection from the LPAR to the configured HMC.
   Also make sure that the SSH connection is NOT established from
   the LPAR to the first HMC (the HMC not used to configure va)
   showing by the lsrsrc, here it is HMC 192.0.2.2.
   
   4. Start the va agent and we could see that its prompt for
   passwd to reach the HMC not configured, here it is 192.0.2.2.
