QUESTION
 Command Line configuration for J2EE DC is not working as expected when trying to enable MS or TT features. 

CAUSE
Interactive CLI configuration is not supported with ITCAM J2EE 7.1.1, including last available level 7.1.1.0.4.

ANSWER
Supported methods are GUI and silent configuration. 

Also, silent configuration fully works both on UNIX and Windows platforms only at level 7.1.1.0.4.
Before this maintenance level there were issues and limitations with Managing Server and Transaction Tracking integration. 

 

Support Command Line configuration for J2EE DC will possibly be added in some future patch via Request For Enhancement.
