APAR STATUS

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  1. The /ifor/LS/Bin has got i4blt and other exe files.
   These        files can only be run by Administrator by default.
      How will a user be able to check what licenses
   are               avaiable/used? - may be this is a question for
   LUM               support....
   2. What is the equivalent of V4 catlicst in V5? So that licenses
       locked by CATIA can be released.
   .
   Above problems are coming from the following situation :
   Concurrent License server is a SGI UNIX box. CATIA does not
   start in the NT box as NT user because Licesne not available.
   The Administrator is able to start CATIA.
   The user is not able to check the avaialable licesnes
   by running i4blt.exe because by default a NT user can't run this
   application.
   Administrator changes the properties of the i4blt.exe so that it
   can be run by all users.
   Now the NT user is able to grab license and start CATIA. When a
   normal exit is done from the CATIA the license is still locked
   up as checked by running i4blt commant by the user. i4blt -C is
   not able to release the license (because its locked up by
   catia).
   Hence equivalent of catlicst is needed.
   
   1. Yes, license are not released even with a normal exit
   of         catia.
   2. Isn't there a need for 'catlicst' like command, needed in a
      variety of situation. This is a basic need and is not an
      enhancement.
   3. The time to wait 30 minutes (less/more?) is too much. How can
      a machine be down for around 30 min. There must be
   a             mechanism to clear up licenses by entering a
   command.
   4. The item 1 in my original note could be more a lum question.
