CONTENT
For a list of new features in this Fix Pack of IBM Analytical Decision Management, see the topic "What's new" in the online help or PDF documentation. 

System requirements and limitations

IBM Analytical Decision Management Fix Pack 1 (7.0.0.1) supports IBM® SPSS® Collaboration and Deployment Services 4.2.1, 5, or 5.0.0.1, and IBM® SPSS® Modeler Server 15 or 15.0.0.1. 

We recommend installing all Fix Packs to take full advantage of new features added in 7.0.0.1. 

Note that Microsoft Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 are only supported with IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0.0.1. They are not supported if using IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 4.2.1 or 5. 


For 7.0.0.1 installation instructions, see the Download Document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033675] and then refer to the installation documentation available here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036175].

Known issues 

 * IBM Analytical Decision Management may not work with the latest versions of Firefox or Chrome. Use Internet Explorer, or older versions of Firefox or Chrome.
   
   
 * If using Internet Explorer, cluster model results and model tree viewer results may not display properly in IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage. You must install the free Microsoft Silverlight [http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/] to resolve the issue.
   

 * After installing the Fix Pack, be sure to restart your web browser if you had IBM Analytical Decision Management open while the Fix Pack was being installed. Some fixes won't be applied until you restart your browser.
   

 * Previously, rules that used timestamp literals functioned incorrectly due to the way time zones were processed. This problem has been corrected. After installing this Fix Pack, existing timestamp literals will be off by a number of hours based on your timezone relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You must edit any existing rules with timestamp literals so they have the correct date and time.
   

 * Coincidence matrix charts in IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage will fail on a numeric target if the IBM SPSS Modeler Fix Pack (15.0.0.1) was not applied to both the IBM SPSS Modeler Server and the IBM SPSS Modeler Collaboration and Deployment Services Adapter. When applying the IBM SPSS Modeler Fix Pack, be sure to update both the server and the adapter.
   

 * For certain non-English languages, if using the JBoss Application Server, some evaluation results in IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage may display incorrect characters. This is due to a JBoss URL encoding issue. If you encounter this issue, to fix it you must stop JBoss and edit the JBoss file server\default\deploy\jbossweb.sar\server.xml. We recommend using a simple text editor. Add URIEncoding="UTF-8" to the Connector section, then restart JBoss.
   
   <Connector port ="8080" URIEncoding="UTF-8" />
   

 * When using IBM Analytical Decision Management with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, we recommend setting the limit on the number of open files allowed to the application server process to a minimum of 4096. On RedHat Linux, consider modifying the system limits.conf file, otherwise refer to your operating system documentation.


Other information

 * Each user guide includes an Appendix called "Sharing streams" that contains important information about modifying models (stream files) in IBM SPSS Modeler and IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage or another IBM Analytical Decision Management application. 
   Note that models adhering to the format described in the Appendix can be viewed, edited, scored, and refreshed using IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage. Other models can also be scored in IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage, but may not display properly and cannot be refreshed.
   

 * The Appendix also says "If deployment type is Scoring Only, the Score tab may also be available, provided the scoring branch starts with a single data source node of a type supported by IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage or IBM Analytical Decision Management (no merged data sets)." 
   This is basically saying that most source types supported by IBM SPSS Modeler are also supported by IBM SPSS Modeler Advantage and IBM Analytical Decision Management as long as there is only one source node in the stream (no merged data sets). Note that IBM Analytical Decision Management does not support the source types Fixed File, Data Collection, or User Input.
