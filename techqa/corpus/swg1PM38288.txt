APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When you request chi-square statistics in Crosstabs for a table
   larger than 2x2 in SPSS Statistics 19.0 or 19.0.0.1, the Exact
   Test results are incorrect if run on Windows 7 or Mac OS.   The
   Fisher Exact  test in the Crosstabs procedure incorrectly
   reported an Exact Significance (2-sided) of 1.0. Significance
   levels for the Pearson and Likelihood Ratio chi-squares will
   also be incorrect. These errors do not appear when run on
   Windows XP or for 2x2 tables on any platform. The defect is
   scheduled to be corrected in the 19.0.0.2 FixPack.
