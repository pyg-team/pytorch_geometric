PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You made two small changes to your CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.1 region and after cold starting the region, you receive the following:

DFHRM0001 An abend (code ---/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'01C6' in module DFHRMXN4
DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control 
IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT 555 
SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0C2 REASON CODE=00000002 

SYMPTOM
An abend0C4 in CAKSRD64 caused by incorrect offset to a control block.


CAUSE
Missing fix for CA-Top Secret

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
You made two minor changes to your CICS region: 

 * Added //DFHJOUT DD SYSOUT=(&RDRC,INTRDR) to the startup JCL. 
 * Deleted two TCPIPSERVICE definitions for unused ports 5560 and 5561.


Then after restarting the region code, it abended with the following messages: 
DFHRM0001 An abend (code ---/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'01C6' in module DFHRMXN4 
DFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control 

IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT 555 
SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE= 0C2 [http://publibfi.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/iea2h780/2.175?SHELF=&DT=20070427225855&CASE=] REASON CODE=00000002

PSW AT TIME OF ERROR 078D1000 983478C4 ILC 4 INTC 02 
NO ACTIVE MODULE FOUND 

In order to get the region back up, you had to back out the 2 changes and auto start the region. The dump shows the running task is the CSXM task #00004. It had received an abend 0C4 program check with the following registers and PSW: 

PSW: 070C0000 9A1090DE IL 6 IC 04 
0-3 00000000 00000000 0000002C 7F5BD000

C-F 0005D680 00016940 1A0F31D0 2116A530 

The PSW is pointing to a MVC instruction: D203 10C0 A162 in CA module CAKSRD64 at x'1298'. The abend is occurring because Reg1 is zeros. The previous message for this CICS job is: 

TSS6002I - TSS/CICS Initialization Phase 2 Started. 

You contacted CA for further assistance with this abend and referencing APAR KGF7455 for the release of Top Secret. They provided the following response: 

"KGF7455 has been published as QO83020, which has a description of: CTS 3.1 ABENDS AT STARTUP, S0C4 IN CAKSRD64. At times during the startup of CTS 3.1 region there could be an abend with S0C4 in CAKSRD64. Error was caused by invalid offset to a control block." 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Apply CA APAR QO83020. If you need additional assistance contact [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21267440&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies [http://www.ca.com/].
