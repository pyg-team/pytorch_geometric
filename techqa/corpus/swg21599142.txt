Title: IBM InfoSphere Business Glossary Enable Workflow is Taking Too Long to Complete - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Cannot enable workflow in IBM InfoSphere Business Glossary. Server becomes unresponsive. 

SYMPTOM
Process is taking too long or hanging, server becomes unresponsive


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Enabling workflow can take a long time, even hours, depending on the size of the glossary and the hardware. 

There are some settings that should be checked including the maximum heap size value configured in WebSphere and the following timeout values. Also, try enabling the workflow by increasing the maximum heap size (double the current value) and change the timeout values to 6 hours. Please make sure that there are no users on the system while doing this.

Log into WebSphere Application Server (WAS) console as administrator (i.e., wasadmin)

Example WAS server link: https://your_was_server:9043/ibm/console/login.do<⁄font>


 1.  Main Menu Tree: Servers > WebSphere application servers > server1 > Configuration Tab > Click Session management link > Session timeout: No timeout 
 2.  Main Menu Tree: Security > Global security > click LTPA link > LTPA timeout: 21600 
 3.  Main Menu Tree: Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server1 > Runtime Tab > Transaction service > Total transaction lifetime timeout : 21600 
 4.  Main Menu Tree: Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server1 > Transaction service > Information required Maximum transaction timeout : 21600


Log into the InfoSphere Information Server (IIS) console: 

Example IIS server link: http://your_iis_server:9080/ibm/iis/console<⁄font> 

Administration tab > Session Management > Active Sessions > Global Session Properties > Inactive Session Timeout:: 21600 

In addition, check if there have been any changes to default settings in WAS/DB configurations - like max number of connections in connection pool etc. 

Log into WebSphere Application Server console. 

Main Menu Tree: Resources > JDBC > Data sources > Default Datasource > Connection pool properties under Additional Properties section > Maximum connections under "General Properites" section. 

If issue still persists please collect Information server collector, database collector, and Health check report from ISALite after reproducing the issue and contact support.
