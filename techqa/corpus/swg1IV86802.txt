   6.    Go to -> Contracts -> Purchase contracts -> NEW
         Create a purchase contract with line item created in #4 ,
         approve the contract
         Contract: C1046, Type: PRICE, Vendor Company:  CVENDOR
         #Also enter an END DATE 31 MAY 2017

   7.    Purchasing Requisition
         Purchasing -> Purchasing Requisition -> New
         PR: PR100, CONTRACT REFERENCE:  C1046
         THIS AUTOPOPULATES THE VENDOR, STOREROOM REMAINS BLANK
   
          PR Lines tab -> CONTRACT Items button -> ITEM01
          CHOOSE STOREROOM: CENTRAL
   
   9.    PR line will have the GL debit account value as created
          in #1
         PRLINE.GLDEBITACCT has value 6300-100-000 at this point
         Change Status -> Approved
   
   10.   Purchasing -> Purchase Orders -> Advance Search
         Vendor: CVENDOR
         PO: 1101 comes up
   
         GL Ddebit Account: blank
         POLINE.GLDEBITACCT
   
   CONCLUSION:  When creating a Purchase Requisition with a
   Contract Reference, the subsequent Purchase Order does not
   contain a GL Debit Account.
   However if in the PR the Vendor and Storoom is also populated,
   then the PO does have a GL Debit Account.
