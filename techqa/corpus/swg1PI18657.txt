APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Prior to CF11, a user and group based config could be specified
   using ephox.config.properties in the EditLive EAR. This
   functionality was removed when EditLive 9 was integrated in
   CF11.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use if statements in the JSP to provide separate configs to
   users and groups.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Prior to CF11, a user and group based config could be specified
   using ephox.config.properties in the EditLive EAR. This
   functionality was removed when EditLive 9 was integrated in
   CF11.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Below is an example of specifying configuration files based on
   the current user or user group.
   
   A default configuration file can also be specified for
   unspecified user/groups using config.default=.....
   
   Note #1: This properties file must be stored in the following
   location (create the ephox folder if it doesn't already exist)
   eg: wp_profile/PortalServer/wcm/shared/app/config/ephox/ephox
   .config.properties
   
   Note #2: All custom configuration files (including the default
   configuration) must then be stored in the same location as this
   file
   eg: wp_profile/PortalServer/wcm/shared/app/config/ephox/config
   .xml.jsp
   eg: wp_profile/PortalServer/wcm/shared/app/config/ephox/custom1
   .xml.jsp
   eg: wp_profile/PortalServer/wcm/shared/app/config/ephox/custom2
   .xml.jsp
   
   Note #3: Groups resolve in the order they appear in the file
   e.g. if the user is in two groups listed in the file, they
   receive the config specified in the first mapping
   
   
   ENABLEMENT: To enable user and group based configuration for
   EditLive 9
   1. Ensure the ephox.config.properties file and all the relevant
   configuration files are copied to the ephox directory:
   eg. wp_profile/PortalServer/wcm/shared/app/config/ephox/
   2. Execute the following ConfigEngine task:
   configure-wcm-ephox-editor-custom-configuration
   3. Restart the server
   
   Note: If changes are made to any of the above properties or
   configuration files, then the ConfigEngine task
   configure-wcm-ephox-editor-custom-configuration needs to be run
   again in order to reapply the updated changes. Restart the
   server when the task completes.
   
   
   TO DISABLE THE USER/GROUP BASED CONFIGURATION:
   1. Execute the ConfigEngine task:
   remove-wcm-ephox-editor-custom-configuration
   2. Restart the server
