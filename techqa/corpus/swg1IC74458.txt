APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Message Service Client for .NET v2.0.0 application using
   WebSphere MQ v7 client throws the following exception, while
   sending  messages using multiple threads.
   
   Invalid Destination Exception CWSMQ0082E and Unknown Object
   Name 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME)
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   All users of WebSphere MQ running multi-threaded XMS .NET
   Client ( Managed mode ) applications where each thread sends a
   message to a different queue manager (with different queue
   names)
   
   Platforms affected:
   Windows
   
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   Access to shared objects containing the connection names were
   not synchronized correctly between different threads. As a
   result, the connection information was being changed by
   different threads causing a 2085 exception.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  WebSphere MQ was modified such that the connection information
   does not get shared between multiple threads, thus eliminating
   the cause for 2085 error.
