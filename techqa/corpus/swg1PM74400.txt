APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If there is a time delay in obtaining Dmgr connection or
   communication, RMI communication threads from Managing server
   pile up causing excessive creation of threads.  An optimization
   is required in JMXDelegate to eliminate the periodic
   conversation with Dmgr as this is done only in a cluster
   environment to obtain the cluster name.
   
   
   
   Users Affected: Potentially all WebSphere platforms running
   ITCAM for Application Diagnostics.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   DESCRIPTION:
   ITCAM Data Collector connects to the Websphere Deployment
   manager to get the status of cluster members and also to obtain
   the statistics like Database connection pool max size.
   
   This connection sometimes causes the Managing server
   communication RMI threads to hang if the Dmgr is not reachable.
   
   This APAR removes the logic to contact Dmgr and obtains the
   necessary data through other means.
