Title: IBM Testing Teradata database connection fails: QE-DEF-0285 The logon failed - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to connect to Teradata via ODBC on AIX 

SYMPTOM
QE-DEF-0285 The logon failed
QE-DEF-0325 The logon failed for the following reason:
RQP-DEF-0068 Unable to connect to at least one database during a multi-database attach to 1 database(s) in: testDataSourceConnection

UDA-SQL-0569 Unable to load the driver manager library ( libodbc.a(odbc.so) ).
UDA-SQL-0571 The operating system returned an error message ( No such file or directory ).


CAUSE
AIX Environment variable LIBPATH not correctly set for the Teradata ODBC libraries

ENVIRONMENT
Cognos 8 MR2
Teradata ODBC
AIX

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
1) Make sure the LIBPATH environment variable points to the teradata driver and lib directory.

e.g.

setenv LIBPATH $LIBPATH:/home/dbclient_aix/teradata/7.0/odbc/drivers
setenv LIBPATH $LIBPATH:/home/dbclient_aix/teradata/7.0/odbc/lib

2) Make sure the LIBPATH environment variable also includes the Cognos 8 "bin" directory. The bin directory is located at the root of the product installation.

e.g.

setenv LIBPATH $LIBPATH:<Cognos 8 intall location>/bin

3) Make sure the environment variable, ODBCINI, is defined to point to the location of the odbc.ini file

e.g.

setenv ODBCINI /home/odbc/odbc.ini

Note: The odbc.ini file must have an entry that points to the teradata driver

e.g.

[Teradata]
Driver=/opt/odbc/lib/<teradata>.so
...
