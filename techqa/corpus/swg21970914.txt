TAM TAMeB FIPS 140-2 compliance FLASH (ALERT)

ABSTRACT
 As of the end of 2015 IBM Global Security Kit version 7.0 will no longer be able to claim NIST FIPS 140-2 certification. 

CONTENT
This flash is to notify all IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business customers about changes regarding the NIST FIPS 140-2 certification statement made against the IBM Global Security Kit version 7.0 component. These changes take effect at the end of 2015.


As of the end of 2015 IBM Global Security Kit version 7.0 will no longer be able to claim NIST FIPS 140-2 certification.


The NIST FIPS 140-2 standard is under constant review and refinement. From time to time, NIST changes the standard and impacts the FIPS status of IBM products. 

As of the end of 2015, non SP 800-90A compliant Random Number Generators (RNG's) will be disallowed retroactively. Consequently, previous validations with non-compliant RNG's will have their FIPS certificate revoked. The following SP 800-131A statement specifically lists the revocation date: 

"The use of the RNGs specified in FIPS 186-2, [X9.31] and ANS [X9.62] is deprecated from 2011 through December 31, 2015, and disallowed after 2015"

Full details can be found on page 8 of the NIST SP 800-131A guidance published at the following URL:
