 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION

ABSTRACT
 This document provides the information for configuring IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository to run on JBoss EAP 6.0 (currently not covered in SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 installation and configuration guide.) Support for JBoss EAP 6.0 was introduced with SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services 5.0 Fix Pack 1.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN 

Before installing SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0.0.1 to run with JBoss EAP 6.0, make sure the application server is installed and configured properly. For information about installing and configuring JBoss EAP 6.0, see https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html-single/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html [https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html-single/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html].

Notes 

 * When installing JBoss EAP 6.0 to be used with SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services on Red Hat Linux with the IBM JVM:  * Use the jboss-eap-6.0.0.zip.
   
   or  * If using JBoss EAP 6.0 JAR installer, select the option not to install native libraries.
   
   If JBoss EAP is installed with native libraries, SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services will not start. For more information about the JBoss defect, see JBPAPP-9178 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-9178) [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-9178].
   
 * On Solaris, SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository is only supported in 64-bit mode. To use SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository with JBoss EAP 6.0, the application server must be configured to use a 64-bit JVM. For example, this can be accomplished by modifying the environment variables in <JBOSS_HOME>/bin/ standalone.conf configuration file:
   
   #
   # Specify the location of the Java home directory. If set then $JAVA will
   # be defined to $JAVA_HOME/bin/java, else $JAVA will be "java".
   #
   JAVA_HOME="/usr/jdk1.6.0_23/bin/sparcv9"
   
   #
   # Specify the exact Java VM executable to use.
   #
   JAVA="/usr/jdk1.6.0_23/bin/sparcv9/java"
   
   


RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS  * SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0.0.1 only support standalone JBoss servers. JBoss domains are not supported. 
 * There is no support for using the IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Scoring Server functionality with JBoss EAP 6.0. IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository running on JBoss EAP 6.0 will not communicate with a remotely-deployed Scoring Server and Scoring Server deployment on JBoss EAP 6.0 is not supported. 
 * SPSS Statistics 21 adapter cannot be used with Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository running on JBoss EAP 6.0 application server. 
 * Only SPSS Modeler 15.0.0.1 adapter or above can be used with Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository running on JBoss EAP 6.0 application server.
   


INSTALLING SPSS COLLABORATION AND DEPLOYMENT SERVICES REPOSITORY 5.0.0.1 WITH JBOSS EAP 6.0  1. Perform a regular installation of SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 using IBM Installation Manager, but do not run the configuration utility. 
 2. Apply the 5.0.0.1 fix pack as described in the installation instructions in the Download Document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24033614], but do not run the patch command. 
 3. Run the configuration utility (configTool or cliConfigTool) in <repository home>/bin , specifying JBoss EAP 6.0 as the application server. For more information, see the repository installation and configuration guide.

STARTING THE REPOSITORY 

 * The startserver command from the <repository_home> \bin directory can still be used to start the repository. 
 * If not using the provided startserver script, you must set up the environment variables (for example, PATH, LIBPATH, JAVA_HOME, etc.) before attempting to start the server. Actual command issued from within the startserver script is different from the command for previous versions of JBoss. Example of new start server command (Windows):  * 
   
   

SECURITY AND SINGLE SIGN-ON 

The instructions for JBoss application server single sign-on setup [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/spsscads/v5r0m0/topic/com.ibm.spss.cads.config.doc/jboss_sso.htm] provided in the corresponding chapter of the SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository 5.0 Installation and Configuration Guide remain valid for JBoss EAP 6.0. 

Notes 

 * JBoss EAP 6.0 the Kerberos login module is defined in <jboss-eap-6.0 home>/standalone/configuration/cds_server.xml . 
 * For IBM JVM, the Kerberos login module is defined as folows:
   
   <login-module code="com.ibm.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule" flag="required">
   <module-option name="credsType" value="both"/>
   <module-option name="principal" value=#YOUR SERVICE PRINCIPAL#/>
   <module-option name="useKeytab" value=#FULL_PATH_TO_KEYTAB_FILE#/> 
   </login-module>
   
 * For Sun JVM, the Kerberos login module is defined as folows:
   
   <login-module code = "com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule" flag = "required">
   <module-option name="storeKey" value="true"/> 
   <module-option name="useKeyTab" value="true"/> 
   <module-option name="doNotPrompt" value="true"/>
   <module-option name="debug" value="false"/>
   <module-option name="realm" value="#YOURDOMAIN.COM#"/>
   <module-option name="principal" value="#YOUR SERVICE PRINCIPAL#"/>
   <module-option name="keyTab" value="#FULL_PATH_TO_KEYTAB_FILE#"/> 
   </login-module>
   
 * When configuring single sign-on with IBM Kerberos login module, jboss.security.security_domain module option (enabled by default) must be disabled. This can be done by setting the system property -Djboss.security.disable.secdomain.option to true when starting JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or by using the web-based Management Console. For more information see https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html-single/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html#Configure_Authentication_in_a_Security_Domain [https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6/html-single/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/index.html#Configure_Authentication_in_a_Security_Domain].
   
   


JDBC DRIVER DEPLOYMENT SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services includes a set of JDBC drivers for major database systems, such as IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle. These JDBC drivers are installed by default. It may also be necessary to deploy additional third-party JDBC drivers for accessing data sources (for example, Teradata or GreenPlum) in Enterprise View, BIRT reports, or jobs. 

To deploy additional third-party JDBC drivers with SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository running on JBoss EAP 6.0: 

 1. Install the drivers as JBoss core modules. For more information, see https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide?_sscc=t#DeveloperGuide-InstalltheJDBCdriverasacoremodule [https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide?_sscc=t#DeveloperGuide-InstalltheJDBCdriverasacoremodule]. 
 2. Register the JDBC modules as global modules (modules accessible to all deployments) in <jboss-eap-6.0 home>/standalone/configuration/cds_server.xml, for example:

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


LOGGING  * SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services Repository logging configuration settings for JBoss EAP 6.0 server are defined in <jboss-eap-6.0 home>/standalone/configuration/cds_server.xml. 
 * The log files are located in <jboss-eap-6.0 home>/standalone/log.
