 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Where can a list of the session parameters which can be used in Report Studio be found? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The user-specific information available through session parameters depends greatly on the type of namespace the user belongs to. The best way to know which session parameters are available for a namespace is to open a Framework Manager project, login to the namespace in question, and select Session Parameters under the Project menu.
