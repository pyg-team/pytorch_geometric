APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS FIXED IF NEXT.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Excel file exports are no longer formatted as they were.
   Previously exports would have formatting such as a bold query
   name on the first line, wider columns, text wrap, etc.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  NA
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Need to add formatting to match old xls format with new xlsx
   export method.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  When exporting excel files from report manager, the title and
   header row are now in bold font, and the column widths are
   adjusted to fit all values in each column. If a cell value is
   too big, the value will be word-wrapped. Also, the gridlines
   have been removed again, to resemble the look from releases
   prior to 3.5.1.
    This is targeted to the 2h2016
   mod release as well as the 3.5.1.3 fix pack.
