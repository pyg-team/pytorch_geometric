APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A Pureapplication System device configured with an externally
   attached SAN Volume Controller (SVC) can issue Call Home
   events and generate IBM Support problem management reports
   (PMRs) when the external SVC has issues that cause it to
   generate events.  This will cause a unique Call Home PMR per
   each external SVC event.
   
   The external device should not be triggering the
   PureApplication System Call Home processing.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Disable the specific event type coming from the SVC from
   triggering Call Home processing.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  PureApplication System Call Home problem reports should
   not be generated when the external storage is having issues.
   Call Home events should be for internal PureApplication
   System issues.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A code fix is being provided to disable these events in
   PureApplication System version 2.0.0.1 interim fix 2 and version
   2.1.0.0.
