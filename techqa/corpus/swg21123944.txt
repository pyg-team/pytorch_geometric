PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Rational Rose RealTime or Rational Suite DevelopmentStudio - RealTime on Windows has become corrupted and will not uninstall completely when using Start > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs.

Failure to completely uninstall previous versions of IBM Rational software can prevent installation of the 2003 and later releases of IBM Rational software. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
If you suspect that your installation of Rose RealTime has become corrupted and will not uninstall correctly, follow the steps below to clean-up your system before attempting a fresh installation. 

Cleaning the File System 

1. Make a backup of all your customized files such as:
· configuration management scripts
· RRTEI scripts
· TargetRTS source files
· DefaultStereotypes.ini
· RoseRT.ini
· License files
· any other files you do not want to lose 

2. Click on Start > Settings > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs and uninstall Rational Rose RealTime (and Companion Products, if you have release 2002 or earlier). 

3. Delete the Rose RealTime installation directory. The default install location on Windows is C:\Program Files\Rational\Rose RealTime. 

Note: To install the 2003 and later releases, it is necessary to uninstall/delete all pre-2003 Rational products, not just Rose RealTime. 

 

Cleaning Environment Variables 

1. Click on Start > Settings > Control Panel > System and select the Environment or Advanced tab. (The exact location of the Environment Variable dialog depends on which version of Microsoft Windows you are running.) 

2. Delete the following system environment variables: 
· ROSERT_HOME 
· ROSERT_HOST. 

3. Delete "%ROSERT_HOME%\bin\%ROSERT_HOST%" from the PATH system environment variable. 

 

Cleaning the Windows Registry 

WARNING: Care must be taken when editing your registry as it can seriously affect the operation of your Windows operating system. If you are unsure about editing your registry, you should consult your system administrator before proceeding with these steps. 

1. Click on Start > Run, and type "regedit" (without the quotes) to open the Registry Editor. 

2. Open the "Registry" menu and select "Export Registry File". It is recommended that you make a back up of your registry file before making any modifications to it. Give the registry file a name and then "Save" the file. 

Note: This file will be several megabytes and can be deleted after successfully installing the new Rational software. 

3. Delete the "My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rational Software" directory. 

Note: If you are re-installing the 2002 release of Rose RealTime, you should only delete the "Rose RealTime" directory under the "My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rational Software" directory. 

4. Delete the "My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rational Software" directory. 

Note: If you are re-installing the 2002 release of Rose RealTime, you should only delete the "Rose RealTime" directory under the "My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rational Software" directory. 

5. Close the Registry Editor, close all of your Windows applications and re-boot your Windows workstation.


After Uninstalling

Install Rose RealTime following the instructions in the Rose RealTime Installation Guide. 

After you test the new installation, restore any of the files and/or customizations saved earlier. Rebuild any customized TargetRTS libraries you may have and rebuild your model(s).
