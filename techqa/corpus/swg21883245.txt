Title: IBM Security Bulletin: Multiple Vulnerabilities in IBM Notes, iNotes and Domino (CVE-2014-8917, CVE-2015-1902, CVE-2015-1903) - United States

Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 IBM Domino contains two image parsing buffer overflow vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute code or crash the Domino SMTP server. In addition, IBM Notes, iNotes and Domino are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the IBM Dojo Tookit. Refer to the links below for fix downloads. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

CVEID: CVE-2014-8917 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8917]
DESCRIPTION: IBM Dojo Toolkit in Notes, iNotes and Domino is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99303 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99303] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

CVEID: CVE-2015-1902 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1902]
DESCRIPTION: IBM Domino is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking when parsing BMP images. By sending a specially-crafted bitmap image, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

CVSS Base Score: 10

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
 Notes, iNotes, and Domino Dojo vulnerability (CVE-2014-8917 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8917])
The dojox/form/resources/upload.swf, dojox/form/resources/fileupload.swf, dojox/av/resources/audio.swf and dojox/av/resources/video.swf are subject to XSS vulnerability.
Any IBM Web application using IBM Dojo Toolkit in Domino and providing those files might be subject to XSS.

Note that IBM Notes, iNotes and Domino do not use these files so workaround this vulnerability by removing the files listed above. The solution for applications will be to either stop using the incriminated files and delete them or to upgrade to one of the fixed releases listed above or to any subsequent releases as they will also include the fixes. 

Those files are typically used when the application is either: 

 * using directly or indirectly the dojox/form/Uploader.js module or the dojox/form/FileUploader module in "flash" uploadType. 
 * or using directly or indirectly the dojox/av/FLAudio.js module or dojox/av/FLVideo.js module

If the application is not using one of those, the .swf files can just be deleted to avoid the issue without having to upgrade to the fixed Dojo version. GET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS
