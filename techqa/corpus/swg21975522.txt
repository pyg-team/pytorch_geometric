32-bit IBM Installation Manager version 1.4.4 was previously installed.
Upgraded Installation Manager to 64 bit 1.8.2 version; 
RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Uninstall the Installation Manager [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.8.0/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/r_uninstall_cmd.html] 


Note: Remove any folders that was created by the Installation Manager

Then reinstall using the installation media found in the 5.2.6.1 media will allow you to over come the observed error.

Note: If you have not backed up your installation directory and database, this is a good time to back up your resources.

During install, the installation will ask where do you want to install Sterling B2B Integrator (SB2BI), please select the current SB2BI install directory. It will detect that an older edition is there and will update it to 5261. 

As an alternative it is possible to upgrade the existing 32bit IIM to a 32bit IIM version 1.8.2 or higher.
