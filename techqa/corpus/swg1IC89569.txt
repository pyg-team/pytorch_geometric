 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When Sharing Conversation option is set and quiesce operation
   was
   invoked in MQ front side handler while DataPower seding a
   request to the backend, then
   after the backside response is returned, a timeout error
   happens in MQ front side handler.
   
   "The get call timed out before receiving any message
   (Reason Code 2033)"
   
   Also the response message wasn't in the MQ queue. The
   transaction is not completed in spite of quiesce.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  DataPower Appliance customers who quiesce MQ Front Side Handler
   with sharing conversation are likely to see this problem.
   
   After quiescing MQ Front Side Handler, PutQueue of MQ Front Side
   Handler for the ongoing transaction would fail if MQ Queue
   Manager of MQ Front Side Handler is using sharing conversation.
