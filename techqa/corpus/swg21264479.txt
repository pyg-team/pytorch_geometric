QUESTION
 How can you uninstall the IBM速 Rational速 ClearCase速 Remote Client (CCRC) software from a Linux速 host? 

ANSWER

In a case where you wish to remove CCRC from a Linux host where it is no longer being used, the ClearCase Remote Client can be uninstalled by executing the uninstall binary following the steps below: 

 

 1. Login as root and run ls /opt/IBM/Rational/ClearCase/_uninst
    
    In that directory you will find the following directories:
    
    uninstall.bin
    uninstall.dat
    uninstall.jar
    
    
 2. While logged in as root run /opt/IBM/Rational/ClearCase/_uninst/uninstall.bin and follow the steps as outlined below.
    
    Note: If you are running a GUI desktop like KDE or Gnome, then the uninstaller will run and ask questions. If you are running the uninstall from a telnet session, you will need to add the switch -console to run in command line mode. 
    


Example (telnet session): 


[root@host1 _uninst]# ./uninstall.bin -console

WARNING: could not delete locked file /opt/IBM/Rational/ClearCase 
WARNING: could not delete locked file /opt/IBM/Rational 
WARNING: could not delete locked file /opt/IBM


Note: The above warnings can be safely ignored as you are sitting in a directory that it was trying to delete. The warnings can be avoided during the uninstall by calling the path from outside /opt/IBM/Rational/ClearCase/_uninst, then the first 2 directories can be deleted by the uninstall process. 






In a case where you need to perform a manual cleanup if the uninstaller fails, the CCRC client can be removed as follows: 
# rm -rf /opt/IBM/Rational/ClearCase701 

# rm -rf /etc/IBM/CCRC701 

 

If no other components are installed, you can also remove the parents: 

# rm -rf /opt/IBM 

# rm -rf /etc/IBM 

 

Links to the desktop (Gnome in this example on RHEL) can be found with:


# find /usr/share -name *Rational* -print 

/usr/share/gnome/apps/IBM Rational 

/usr/share/gnome/apps/IBM Rational/Rational ClearCase Remote Client V7.0.1.desktop 

/usr/share/applications/Rational ClearCase Remote Client V7.0.1.desktop 

/usr/share/applnk/IBM Rational 

/usr/share/applnk/IBM Rational/Rational ClearCase Remote Client V7.0.1.kdelnk 

 

Thus, a manual uninstall is fairly simple and should be completed if the uninstaller fails and you are trying to move to a later version.
