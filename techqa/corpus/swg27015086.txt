ABSTRACT
 This teleconference will give you a better understanding of the features shipped with CICS Transaction Server for z/OS that affect CICS DB2 performance. Highlights include extensive support for DB2 group attach, DB2 V8 restart-light support, enhanced purge support, and exploitation of the CICS open transaction environment (OTE) for threadsafe applications.

Speaker: John Tilling, Senior Software Engineer, CICS Technical Planning and Strategy

Developed for: CICS application managers, CICS systems managers, CICS system administrators, CICS developers, performance administrators

Technical level: Intermediate - advanced

Description: 

 * Would you like to save costs on your CICS and DB2 applications? 
 * Are your applications straining with DB2 data that has gone through the roof? 
 * Are you fed up with system bottlenecks caused by high TCB switching? 
 * Would you like to blow the dust off CICS and DB2 applications and make them fly?


You can reap more rewards from your CICS and DB2 environment by tuning your CICS to DB2 interfaces, connections, and interactions to get the most from your tried and tested applications. Not only can this provide significant performance improvements for applications issuing large numbers of EXEC SQL requests, it can also go a long way toward reducing your software bills. 

John discusses optimizing DB2 performance for various application configurations, threadsafe standards, and the benefits of threadsafety. The session also covers how exploitation of threadsafe and OTE can help: 
 * Boost performance 
 * Reduce machine cycles 
 * Reduce TCB switching 
 * Reduce bottlenecks


This presentation was given before CICS TS V4.1 and higher became available, but the concepts of threadsafe CICS-DB2 programs applies equally to newer releases of CICS and DB2. There are further enhancements in CICS TS V4 that are described in the latest version of the IBM Redbooks publication Threadsafe Considerations for CICS [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246351.html].(publish date 5 April 2012). In addition, CICS TS V5 has further enhancements for CICS Java applications accessing DB2 as documented in the CICS TS V5.1 information center under Removal of TCB switch for Java applications accessing DB2 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v5r1/topic/com.ibm.cics.ts.whatsnew.doc/task_switch/dfhe4_overview.html].
