APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  ITM Oracle Extended Agent (RZ) requires Enterprise Edition
   Oracle WITH "Diagnostic Pack License" and
   "STATISTIC_LEVEL=TYPICAL/ALL"  to support gathering of Top SQL
   data with "KRZRDB TOP SQL" attribute group.
   The Oracle requirements are needed to populate Oracle DB tables
   - dba_hist_snapshot and dba_hist_sqlstat.
   In addition to Oracle requirements for underlying database
   tables that SQL queries are issued against, the RZ agent also
   requires defining Situations / Historical collections against
   the "KRZRDB TOP SQL" attribute group under the "Oracle RDBMS"
   application to define the SQL queries to be issued against these
   Oracle tables.

   The ITM Situation / Historical collections defined against
   "KRZRDB TOP SQL" - KRZ.KRZTOPSQL must specify valid values for
   the four filter criteria:
   "Begin Hour Before Current" -  KRZ_RDB_TOP_SQL.BEG_HOUR
   "End Hour Before Current" - KRZ_RDB_TOP_SQL.END_HOUR
   "Order By" - KRZ_RDB_TOP_SQL.ORDERBY
   "Row Order" - KRZ_RDB_TOP_SQL.ROWORDER
   
   ITM RAS1 diagnostics are not able to capture the details of
   the SQL queries used to get information from the Oracle
   dba_hist_snapshot and dba_hist_sqlstat tables.
   .
   RZ agent user's guide should document prerequisite environment
   needed to populate Top SQL attributes and provide example SQL
   queries that can be run externally to verify data is possible
   to be gathered from Oracle.
