APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  6.1.3 Mobility Client on Windows XP
   The Mobility Client is configured to authenticate to an Active
   Directory on a Microsoft Windows Domain Controller
   
   Scenario:  When a user attempts to log in to the enterprise
   network he will get a message:
   
   "Your password has expired on the secondary authentication
   server. You have been connected to your account using a
   restricted connection. Click OK to continue with the Windows
   logon.  You must change your Windows password."
   
   If the user clicks the OK button they never see the Windows
   dialogue prompting them to change their password.  If, in some
   circumstances the user allows 7-10 seconds to pass this dialogue
   message will go away on its own, and the Change Password
   dialogue is then presented allowing the user to change their
   Domain Password, then log back in to the Connection Manager.
   
   On other devices no matter how long a user waits the message
   from the Mobility Client does not go away nor does clicking OK
   allow the user to change their password.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  We have seen some instances where waiting a few seconds allows
   the 'Click OK' message to go away and the Windows Change
   password dialogue is presented.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: Users of the Windows Integrated Logon        *
   *                 feature (GINA) who logon to a Windows        *
   *                 Domain Controller and periodically are       *
   *                 requried to change their password.           *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Change password to Domain Controller    *
   *                      fails when user is forced to change it. *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the fix.                               *
   ****************************************************************
   The Windows Integrated Login code
   was allowing the password change
   request to occur prior to the
   initialization of the virtual IP
   interface. This prevented
   communication to the Domain
   Controller for the change password
   function.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code has been modified such that the change password
   function will not be started until the virtual IP interface
   has been initialized.
   
   A formal fix for this problem will be included in all product
   releases AFTER 6.1.3.  Until that time a temporary fix may be
   obtained from the IBM Lotus Mobile Connect Support Center.
