APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A message may be written out-of-order to the error log with
   respect to the times of other messages. The delay in writing
   that message may be up to 10 seconds.
   
   This may occur intermittently. For timing reasons, message
   AMQ8024 may be one such message that can be affected by this
   problem.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   USERS AFFECTED:
   You may be impacted by this problem if you are reading an MQ
   error log and expect messages to be in time order.
   
   Platforms affected:
   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)
   ****************************************************************
   PROBLEM SUMMARY:
   The out-of-order writing is caused by a queueing effect within
   the error logging process. There is a timing window where the
   processing of a queue can stall for up to 10 seconds, even when
   there are messages queued to be written to the error log.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The timing window in the queued processing of error messages has
   been eliminated.
   
   Please note however that in general there is no guarantee that
   message times in an error log will be strictly in time order.
   There may be rare occurrences of an out-of-order time stamp, for
   example due to slow CPU processing of a thread which has
   prepared a message, including its timestamp, but which has yet
   to actually issue the write of that message to the error log.
   That could allow a later-timestamped message to be written
   before that delayed message.
   
   The AMQ8024 message composition has been corrected to ensure
   that it includes the queue name.
