QUESTION
 Why am I getting the message ""Error detecting SCC tool or no SCC tool installed"? 

ANSWER
When you install an SCC-compliant CM tool, a tool-specific DLL is installed on your PC. When invoking a CM operation, Rhapsody looks for an entry for this DLL in the system registry. If it finds one, it loads the DLL and performs the CM operation with that tool. If Rhapsody cannot find the DLL for the correct SCC tool, it generates the error message. The error may also get displayed when a non-supported CM tool is being used. 


The ProviderRegKey value of the SourceCodeControlProvider key in the system registry (under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE) stores the location of the DLL for the default CM tool. It is possible to have multiple SCC-compliant tools installed on the same system. In this case, there are multiple entries under the InstalledSCCProviders key. 

 

(under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SourceCodeControlProvider ). 

 

For example: 

PVCS Dimensions : REG_SZ: Software\SQL Software\PcmcScc 

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe : REG_SZ: Software\Microsoft\SourceSafe 

ClearCase : REG_SZ: Software\Atria\ClearCase 

 

If the ProviderRegKey value does not correspond to the CM tool you want, do the following: 

1. Select one of the installed SCC-compliant CM tools using a registry editor (for example, regedit ). 

2. Edit the ProviderRegKey value of the SourceCodeControlProvider key with the information from InstalledSCCProviders for the SCC tool you want to use. 

 

For example, to use PVCS Dimensions, edit the ProviderRegKey value with the following string: Software\SQL Software\PcmsScc
