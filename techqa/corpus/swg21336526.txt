Title: IBM ORA-01795 maximum number of expressions in a list is 254 - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Unable to select all items in a prompt. 

SYMPTOM
ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 254

This error occurs when you are selecting all items in a prompt.

ORA-00920--Invalid relational operator

Cause: A search condition was entered with an invalid or missing relational operator.
Action: Include a valid relational operator such as =, !=, ^=, <>, >, <, >=, <=, ALL, ANY, [NOT] BETWEEN, EXISTS, [NOT] IN, IS [NOT] NULL, or [NOT] LIKE in the condition.


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
For error ORA-00902:
This is a limitation of Oracle that is fixed in Oracle 8.0 and above. In pre-8.0 versions you cannot use more than 254 values with the IN operator. Contact Oracle to get a patch or a release that doesn't have this limit. Please note that IBM Cognos ReportNet and IBM Cognos 8 BI do not support Oracle pre-8.1 releases.

Otherwise, within Impromptu, create a new Type-in prompt to select the 'ALL' value or individual data items :

EXAMPLE:

( numcli In (?ClientNumber?) Or 'ALL' = ?AllValues? )
which generates the following WHERE clause :
WHERE ( numcli IN ('') OR 'ALL' = 'ALL' ) in that case 'ALL' = 'ALL' will be always verified whatever numcli IN (...)

or

WHERE ( numcli IN ('1', '2' ...) OR 'ALL' = '' ) in that case 'ALL' = '' will never be verified and numcli IN ('1', '2' ...) will be evaluated.

For error ORA-01795:
Try using a hotfile instead of the IN operator, the hotfile can be joined within the catalog or by using a natural join from within the filter itself.
