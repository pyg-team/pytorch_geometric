Title: IBM DST considerations on i5/OS and Domino for Nordic countries - United States

DST TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
In the Nordic countries it is not sufficient to change the systemvalues Qhour and Qutcoffset; the time is still one hour ahead. How can the Domino server be set up for Daylight Saving Time (DST) 

ANSWER
Note: Relative to the new DST rules for 2007, it is suggested that any relative i5/OS updates be installed to ensure that the operating system and other applications function as expected. For additional information on the required PTFs, refer to the following document: System i Daylight saving time (DST) Information [http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/software/globalization/dst.html].
When configuring or changing your Domino server using CHGDOMSVR choose a time zone (CET in Europe) and select *yes for Daylight Saving. This will set the following notes.ini parameters:


 * 
 * 
 * 


In the Server document, verify that the server uses OS time. When the time is changed to summer time (last Sunday in March), you need to change the following system values: 
 * 
 * 
 * 


You will observe that the time is still one hour off, but if you wait one week it will be correct again. Therefore, Domino i5/OS must be using U.S. settings when changing to summer time. There is no problem when returning to winter time. 

If you add DSTLaw to your notes.ini it works: DSTLaw=3,-1,1,10,-1,1 

When you go back to winter time, you only need to change QHour and Quctoffset. 

Supporting Information 
With the exception of i5/OS systems, the notes.ini parameter DSTLaw cannot be used to control the DST rules Domino 6.0 and later obeys. Note: Future Notes/Domino releases may be revised such that they rely directly on the operating system.
