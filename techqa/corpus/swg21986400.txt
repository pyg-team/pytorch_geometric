 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 A vulnerability in Open Source GNU glibc affects IBM OS Images for Red Hat Linux Systems. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-5277 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5277]
DESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system, caused by a heap corruption error in the nss_files backend for the Name Service Switch. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
CVSS Base Score: 5.9
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108484 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108484] for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

REMEDIATION/FIXES
The deployed Red Hat Linux-based virtual machines on IBM PureApplication System types are affected. The solution is to apply the following emergency fix to the deployed virtual machines.

https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=glibc_patch_Feb_2016&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0 [https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=glibc_patch_Feb_2016&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0]

1. Import the fix into the Emergency Fix catalogue.
2. For deployed instances, apply this emergency fix on the VM. The glibc library on the IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems will be updated to contain the fix. 
3. Restart the deployed instance after the fix is applied.

Optionally, the operating system vendor provides a glibc fix. The fix can be applied by running the command “yum update glibc” within the deployed virtual machine to upgrade to the latest glibc version.

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.
