APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Event ages are not updating on logical Views
   
   
   L2 have tried multiple actions:
   
   - Checked that the customer had auto refresh checked
   - Occurs on all events (sampled and Pure)
   - Issue found with JWS (only client customer uses)
   - Customer has upgraded to FP02 in the course of the PMR problem
   still
     remains
   - TEMS has been manually cleaded of events, new events came in
   and had
     same problem
   - We have set the tracing to check it was not a channel problem
     and we have not found anything conclusive from the logs.
   - The below was set
     "KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_MAX=20", "KFW_EVENT_ASSIST=N",
     "KFW_AUTHORIZATION_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30" all without any
   change to
     the issue
   
   
   
   Sp...
   
   Age column in Situation Event Console does NOT update on LOGICAL
   view
   
   Age column in Situation Event Console DOES update on PHYSICAL
   view.
   
   
   Clicking on the refresh button has no effect on event ages, the
   only way
   to refresh on Logical SEC view can be achieved by switching to
   an
   alternative workspace and back again to the SEC view.
   - this then shows the correct Situation ages.
   
   
   
   The customer requires that Situation Agent value of the SEC on
   the
   logical orkspace, refreshes WITHOUT having to switch to a
   different
    workspace, just clicking "refresh" in the TEP client.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The Age column in the situation event console for the Tivoli
   Enterprise Portal client does not update. When trying to call
   the getTime method against the Java Calendar object it was
   returning a null value.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Added exception handling around this method call so the event
   age can be properly set in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal
   situation event console.
