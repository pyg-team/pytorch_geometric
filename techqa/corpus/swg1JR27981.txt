   *                      an integer is one of the multipart      *

   ****************************************************************
   When an application has a multipart message with primitive
   integer parts on the interface and such an interface is
   invoked via remote calls through an Service Component
   Architecture (SCA) EJB binding, the payload of the primitive
   integer value will unpredictably change to a random value or
   the maximum integer value. This happens WITHOUT a visible
   exception or warning.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  This issue was addressed by correcting the logic, where
   primitive type were not handled correctly in all the paths of
   the code.
