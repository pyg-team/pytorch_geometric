QUESTION
 SNMPv3 traps : Why are traps not parsed as expected? 

CAUSE
 IV15415 comes in two parts - The MTTrapd probe must be at least probe-nco-p-mttrapd-14 and Netcool/OMNIbus 7.3.1 must be at least Fix Pack 5

ANSWER
 

There was a bug fix implemented in both the MTTrapd probe and the Netcool/OMNIbus library: 


IV15415 - V731:GSKIT LIBNCRYPT CAUSES SOME SNMPV3 TRAPS TO BE DISCARDED BY
THE MTTRAPD PROBE 

Although the README for the probe mentions probe-nco-p-mttrapd-12:


PATCH probe-nco-p-mttrapd-12
============================
REVISION 1:
-----------
IV15415 - Fixed Mttrapd probe not able to receive SNMP v3 traps on Omnibus 7.3.1 (GSKit 8) 


The actual GA product release with bug fix in is probe-nco-p-mttrapd-14, released in November 2012.

Therefore for the bug fix to be implemented both Netcool/OMNIbus v7.3.1. fix pack 5 and the probe-nco-p-mttrapd-14 need to be installed.
