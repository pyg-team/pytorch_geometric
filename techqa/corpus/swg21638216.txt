QUESTION
 How do you convert a C++ language package unit to ADA language package unit in IBM Rational Rhapsody? 

CAUSE
You would like to use C++ package unit for Simulation and use ADA for code generation

ANSWER
Currently there is no direct method to convert a C++ package to a ADA package. However,
you can apply the following steps to achieve your requirement:


 1. Copy & Paste the *.sbs file that you wish to add into the ADA model to the ADA project location
    
    
 2. Right click on the *.sbs and open in Edit mode
    
    
 3. Change the entry for from C++ to Ada in the first line as shown below:
    
    
    I-Logix-RPY-Archive version 8.7.1 C++ 5093211 to
    I-Logix-RPY-Archive version 8.7.1 Ada 5093211
    
    
    
 4. Save and Close the file
    
    
 5. Use Add to Model option and the *sbs file as a Unit
    
    


Now you would be able to generate Ada code for the package  

Alternatively, you can also raise an Enhancement Request for direct changing of language from C++ to Ada from within Rational Rhapsody using the IBM RFE Community [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/support/rational/rfe/.]
