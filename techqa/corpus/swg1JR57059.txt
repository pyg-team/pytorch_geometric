APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Invoking IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) REST APIs that
   return process or task details might cause out-of-memory
   exceptions if the process or task data contains business objects
   that contain a property that refers to the business object
   itself, creating a recursive data structure. A heap dump
   analysis includes call stacks that show recursive invocations of
   com.ibm.bpm.json.util.JSONUtil.TWObjectToJSON, for example

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  While serializing the data structure to JSON in the REST API
   response, IBM BPM might not stop the recursion in time before
   the available memory is used when a business object refers to
   itself.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  A interim fix is available on request from BPM level 3 support
   for IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.06
   
   A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   that introduces a detection mechanism for a self-referencing
   data structures. In general, such data structures should be
   avoided in process models, but if the IBM BPM runtime
   environment encounters such data the serialization stops
   recursively serializing the business object.
   
   To determine whether the IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12
   is available and download it if it is, complete the following
   steps on Fix Central:
   
   1. On the Select product tab, select WebSphere as the product
   group, IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from the
   WebSphere options, All as the installed version, and All as the
   platform, and then click Continue.
   2. In the Text field, enter "cumulative fix", and click
