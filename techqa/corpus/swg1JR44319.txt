ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the Process Portal Inbox, executing a saved search or quick
   search fails to display process instances if a date field in the
   instance data returned by the search (from the database)
   contains a null value.
   
   With Internet Explorer as the browser, the following error
   message is displayed in Process Portal (instead of the search
   results):
   
   [object Error]
   
   With Firefox as the browser, an error message similar to the
   following is displayed in Process Portal (instead of the search
   results):
   
   Error: Unable to load
   /portal/jsp/tiles/AdvancedSearchResultsContent.jsp?dojo.preventC
   ache=134 9388168669 status: 500
   
   In addition (regardless of browser), an exception similar to the
   following is written to SystemOut.log (on the server or cluster
   where the Process Portal is deployed):
   
   00000036 servlet       E
   com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.servlet.ServletWrapper service
   SRVE0068E: Uncaught exception created in one of the service

   ****************************************************************
   Date fields in process instances returned by a saved search
   were not being checked for null values by a method that was
   sorting the set of instances by date field.  This resulted in
   a NullPointerException that, in turn, was not being properly
   caught in a calling method, resulting in the "masking" error
   message reported in the error description.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Adding checking for null date fields in the sorting method
   resolved the issue.  Instances with null values in the date
   field are sorted to the end of the list of instances.
