APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  SCENARIO:
   1. Start CV5.
   2. Go to Tools / Options / Infrastructure / Product
   Structure / Cache Management and activate the
   cahce system.
   3. Go to Tools / Options / Mechanical Design /
   Drafting and set the View generation mode to
   approximate in the View tab.
   4. Start CV5 again.
   5. Open the provided CATProduct.
   6. Go to File / Desk.
   >>> Note that no part is loaded (all listed in balck).
   7. Create a new drawing.
   8. Select the Front View command.
   9. Go back to Main_Product.CATProduct window.
   10. Select Shape_002 side as shown in the
   Plane_selection.jpg image.
   11. Click in the Drawing sheet to launch 2D
   generation.
   12. Go back to the desk window.
   .
   CONCERN:
   Plate_001.CATPart has been loaded, or sometime it
   loads all the SR1 data.
   This has a huge impact in terms of memory
   consumption when working with a big amount of
   data and prevents the customer from generating
   his drawing.
   .
   EXPECTED RESULT:
   SR1 document should not be loaded.
   If you replay the above scenario with normal
   CATParts (instead of SR1 data) then behavior is OK.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ON CATIA VERSION
   5 RELEASE 19 SP05 LEVEL.
   Correction Explanation
   Some code in structure were triggering the Part to
   be loaded in order to find the body to prject.
   Exchange the body to a Rep, so, the search of this
   Rep doesn't affect the VisuMode.
