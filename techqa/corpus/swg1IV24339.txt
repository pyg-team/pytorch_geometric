APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Environment:
   Windows NT 64-bit agent only on Windows 64-bit platform.
   
   Problem Description:
   Kincinfo scans both the TMAITM6 and TMAITM6_x64 directories
   looking for agents. If only the 64-bit NT agent is installed
   then the scan of the TMAITM6 directory fails, but the code
   assumes at least one agent is present and creates an invalid IN
   component entry.
   
   Recreate Instructions:
   Windows only and does not occur on all machines.
   1. Install 64-bit NT Agent only on target machine. Select no
      other component manually.
   2. Run the install
   3. After the install completes, from HOME\InstallITM directory
      launch kincinfo -o. On some machines there will be an
      incorrect IN component listed. Once the APAR is present, the
      incorrect IN component is no longer listed.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  None. The entry can be ignored. It should not cause any
   incorrect processing even if called during Remote Deploy.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  KinCinfo returns incorrect entry for component IN.
   
   On some Windows machines, when only 64-bit Agents are installed,
   the command "KinCinfo -o" shows a phantom IN component as
   installed but not running.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Code always scanned the HOME\TMAITM6 (32-bit agent install
   location) and when only 64-bit agents were installed a phantom
   IN component would appear to be not-running from the TMAITM6
   directory.  Fixed the code to skip the TMAITM6 directory if no
   32-bit agents are installed therein.

   packages:

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  The message can be ignored and should cause no harm or
   degradation to processing.
