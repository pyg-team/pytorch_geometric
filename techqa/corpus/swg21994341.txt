Title: IBM MDM - WAS Secuirty LDAP setup - user id limited to 20 characters - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 WebSphere uses a fully qualified user name eg 317836260@devmaple.devfg.abc.com instead of a short one 317836260. If the short name is used then the same ID can have a collision with other domains and this does not meet our requirements.



We need the userID@domain.com LDAP value to support the many different domains we have within the enterprise such user ID@saifg.abc.com, we need a proven solution to support this configuration. 

CAUSE
This is by design and is the default.

ANSWER
To accommodate larger strings, you may increase the length of this and other columns to a higher value from the database level. This wouldn't be approved as a defect, you could open an enhancement for future consideration, but the best way forward would be to increase it in the database directly.
Future upgrades and patches will not restore the default and you will not lose any data. Let me know what you think and how you would like to proceed.

We don't have documentation or scripts for doing so. IBM Services helps with customization, not IBM Support, but your DBA may be able to scan the database schema and onto the tables/index and then columns to identify last_update_user.
