APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A CICS region is restarted, however the BUNDLE installation
   fails because the JVMServer isn't available at that time.
   
   There seems to be a timing issue during a CICS warm start when
   installing a JVMServer and it's associated BUNDLES.
   
   
   The joblog shows the following sequence of messages:
   ----------------------------------------------------
   DFHSJ1109 06/12/2016 05:25:16 An attempt to determine the
             highest semantic version of the OSGi bundle with
             symbolic name BUNDLE zzzzzzzz to install into
             JVMSERVER xxxxxx has failed with reason code
             JVMSERVER_NOT_ENABLED.
   
   DFHSJ0915 06/12/2016 05:25:18 JVMSERVER xxxxxx is now
             enabled and is ready for use.

   * RECOMMENDATION: .                                            *
   ****************************************************************
   A CICS bundle is being installed in an OSGi (non-Liberty) JVM
   server which uses the versionRange attribute for an included
   OSGi bundle resource. The JVM server and the CICS bundle are
   both being installed at the same time, either explicitly or
   during a warm start. The result is that the OSGi bundle
   resource with versionRange is attempting to be installed while
   the JVM server is enabling. This leaves the bundle in an
   disabled state.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  CICS has been changed to defer the installation of a CICS
   bundle with versionRange attribute until the JVM server has
   completed its own initialisation.
