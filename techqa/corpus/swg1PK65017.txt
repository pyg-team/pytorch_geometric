APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  'WebSphere v6.x Application Client' Run Launcher always defaults
   under the Arguments and ClassPath Tabs
   
   a) Arguments Tab : VM Arguments refer to the default profile for
   the Websphere Ruintime from the Application tab, instead of the
   specific server and its profile selected with :
   [x] Enable application client to connect to server
   
   Editing/changing this manually is not acceptable and error
   prone.
   
   b) ClassPath Tab:
   - Bootstrap Entries are set to the first Websphere
   Application Server V6.x JRE installed
   - User Entries properties folder and lib jars are also set from
   the first WebSphere Application Server V6.x runtime installed.

   ****************************************************************
   The Websphere v6.1 Application Client Launcher can only uses
   the VM arguments and classpath of the default WebSphere runtime
   (usually the pre-existed runtimes of RAD, or the first added
   runtime in AST), even if you change the "WebSphere runtime" in
   the Launcher dialog, or the default runtime isn't valid any
   more (such as the runtime has been uninstalled, or manually
   removed from file system). If the users are not able to change
   the VM arguments and classpath, they can not run the client
   against the desired run-time. Most importantly, if the default
   runtime has been removed, the client will be running against
   invalid VM arguments and classpath. The execution will fail
   over some runtime errors, or ClassnotfoundException. Manually
   edit these value in the Launcher dialog is tedious job and
   error-prone.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  With the fix to this APAR, the user should be able to change
   the VM arguments and classpath of websphere v6.x Application
   Clients by switch the "WebSphere runtime" in the Launcher
   dialog. The launcher will use the vm arguments and classpath
   of the selected WebSphere runtime.
   
   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in
   the WebSphere Application Server Toolkit fixpack 7.1.1.7 and
   Rational Application Developer fixpack 7.0.0.7.  Please refer
