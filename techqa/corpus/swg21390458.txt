PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 How does one redirect the GC output to a specific file? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To redirect the GC file or the GC output, you have to do two things: 

1. During configuration of the DC one of the screens provides a checkbox to "Redirect the Garbage Collection output"
If you choose this option, then the GC logs are redirected to the file "itcam_dc_gclog.log" (or any other name that you may specify.) If you do not check this box, then it goes into the standard WAS server log file named native_stderr.log. 

2. To redirect the "itcam_dc_gclog.log" log file, just create a link to point to your new location and make changes to the -Xverbosegclog argument in the JVM Generic Arguments section for the WAS server.
Preferably, this should be done via the WAS Admin console 

Restart the WAS server and all future logging will now point to your specified path.
