APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The behavior of deactivated snapshots is not clear in regard
   running or starting BPD instances.
   
   The infocenter mentions this line:
   "Deactivating a snapshot allows all existing business process
   definition process instances to complete, but no new process
   instances can be started."
   
   Although this is not exactly true. After applying JR48205 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR48205] the
   behavior is more consistent with the above statement but not
   exact.
   
   After this fix.
   New BPD instances are blocked for BPDs started with Javascript,
   REST, or Webservice APIs. Although UCA and Process Designer
   started instances would not be blocked.
   
   
   There were also new flags introduced that modify this behavior
   further.
   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21622725 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21622725]
   These flags impact both starting new instance and running
   instances on a deactivated snapshot.
   block-deactivated-snapshot-task-progression - This flag blocks
   the starting or progression of task based services like human
   tasks.
   
   block-deactivated-snapshot-favorite-progression - This flag
   blocks the starting of task-less services.
   
   In newer versions some of these flags are enabled by default.
   They may need to be disabled if you wish to have running
   instances complete on a deactivated snapshot.
