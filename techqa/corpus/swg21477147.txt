Title: IBM License code for Smart Viewer? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I've installed SPSS and now I want to install Smart Viewer but it's asking me for a license code, what shall I enter? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Smart Viewer comes automatically when installing SPSS. It is the SPSS output interface. It's on the program CD separately in case only Smart Viewer is wanted to be installed. It would require a separate license code
