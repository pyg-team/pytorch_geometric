APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When customer runs with CICS TS 5.2 during the logon process,
   if the password is invalid , the info is collected
   by SMF 80.
   But the Terminal netname doesn't appear
   in the SMF 80 record as it used to appear when they
   run with CICS 4.2.
   Messages issued are :
   DFHSN1102 22/07/2015 12:05:28 ABCCICS Signon at netname nnnnnn
   user uuuuu has failed. Password not recognized.
   .
   DFHXS1201 22/07/2015 12:06:22 ABCCICS The password supplied in
   the verification request for userid uuuuuu
   was invalid. This occurred in transaction CESN when userid uuuu
   was signed on at netname nnnnnn.
   .
   These messages are the same but after APARs:
   PI21866 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI21866]
   "This change supports the Enhanced Password Algorithm
   implemented in the RACF APAR OA43999 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1OA43999] which applies to z/OS 1.12,
   1.13 and 2.1.
   If these APARs are installed CICS will call a new
   callable service IRRSPW00 to for password authentication.
   This service will be used for basic authentication requests,
   VERIFY PASSWORD, VERIFY PHRASE and SIGNON requests.
   "
   ...the terminal netname no longer is passed by CICS
   to RACF for inclusion in SMF80.

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  ****************************************************************
   * USERS AFFECTED: All CICS Users with PI21865 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI21865] applied.         *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: RACF SMF 80 record no longer contains   *
   *                      the terminal netname.                   *
   ****************************************************************
   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
   ****************************************************************
   Following CICS APAR PI21865 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI21865] when a signon fails message
   DFHSN1102 is issued which indicates that the signon failed at
   netname for that userid. The problem is that when RACF is called
   doing a RACROUTE VERIFYX to verify the password, only the userid
   and password are included. Other information, such as netname,
   is not sent and so the RACF SMF 80 record which is recording
   that invalid password attempt, does not include the netname.
   This is the port of entry and is required for auditing reasons.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  UI22614  UI25260 UI31713
   
   CICS modules DFHUSAD, DFHXSPW and DFHXSSB have been changed to
   ensure that a port of entry is included on the RACROUTE VERIFYX
   call, so that the CICS netname can be included in the SMF 80
   record for a password failure.
