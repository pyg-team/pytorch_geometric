   This fix adds support to CICS Batch Application Control
   to run with CICS TS V5.2
   
   Three documentation changes are made to the CICS BAC User's
   Guide as described below:
   
   Documentation changes to the CICS TS 5.2 Information Center
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   Info Center, change 1
   ---------------------
   In the CICS TS 5.2 Information Center;
   CICS Batch Application Control for z/OS V1.1.1;
   User Guide -> CICS BAC system requirements -> Software
   requirements;
   
   Additional text is added to the second bullet point. Add the
   following after the existing text:
   
   "or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 5 (5655-Y04)."
   
   The "Software requirements" section should now read:
   
   The following are the minimum software requirements for CICS
   BAC:
   
   - OS/390(r) Version 2 Release 10 or above, or z/OS Version 1
     Release 1 or above
   
   - CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 Version 1.3 (5655-147);
     or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 2 (5697-E93);
     or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 3 (5655-M15);
     or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 4 (5655-S97);
     or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 5 (5655-Y04).
   
   Info Center, change 2
   ---------------------
   In the CICS TS 5.2 Information Center;
   CICS Batch Application Control for z/OS V1.1.1;
   User Guide -> Implementation and customization -> Setting up and
   starting the CICS component -> Preparing CICS regions for CICS
   BAC -> CICS BAC program and mapset definitions;
   in the notes below Figure 4 "CEDA commands to define the CBK
   programs and mapset in your CSD":
   
   Additional text is added to note 1.
   At the end of the second sentence, add the following text:
   
   "or 69 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.2 region."
   
   The note should now read:
   
   1. In the CEDA commands shown in Figure 4, replace cbkgroup with
   any character string allowed by the CEDA transaction that meets
   your installation standards. Replace the nn in the program names
   CBKFSXnn and CBKSPXnn with 53 if you are installing CICS BAC in
   a CICS TS 1.3 region; 62 if you are installing CICS BAC in a
   CICS TS 2.2 region; 63 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS
   TS 2.3 region; 64 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS
   3.1 region; 65 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 3.2
   region; 66 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.1
   region; 67 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 4.2
   region; 68 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.1
   region; or 69 if you are installing CICS BAC in a CICS TS 5.2
   region.  You can also define the programs for all these CICS
   releases if you want to.
   
   Info Center, change 3
   ---------------------
   In the CICS TS 5.2 Information Center;
   CICS Batch Application Control for z/OS V1.1.1;
   User Guide -> Implementation and customization -> Setting up and
   starting the CICS component -> Preparing CICS regions for CICS
   BAC -> CICS BAC control file definition;
   in the notes below figure 5 "CEDA command to define the CICS BAC
   control file in your CSD":
   
   Note 1 below figure 5 should be removed, the reason being that
   it is a misplaced duplicate of note 1 below figure 4.
   The existing note 2 below figure 5 should then become note 1.
   
   Documentation changes to the CICS BAC User's Guide PDF manual
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   The same three changes are to be made in the PDF manual;
   CICS Batch Application Control for z/OS User's Guide V1R1M1,
   SC34-6321-06
   
   PDF manual, change 1
   --------------------
   Chapter 2, "CICS BAC system requirements";
   section "Software requirements", on page 7.
   
   Add text to the end of the second bullet point:
   
   "or CICS Transaction Server for z/OS, Version 5 (5655-Y04)."
   
   PDF manual, change 2
   --------------------
   Chapter 3 "Implementation and customization";
   section "Setting up and starting the CICS component";
   sub-section "Preparing CICS regions for CICS BAC";
   sub-section "CICS BAC program and mapset definitions";
   in the notes below Figure 4 "CEDA commands to define
   control file in your CSD", on page 13.
   
   Remove note 1.
   Existing note 2 renumbered to become note 1.
   
   User Action:
   
    1. This PTF adds 2 new load modules to the SCBKLOAD library.
       Before applying the PTF you should ensure that the SCBKLOAD
       library has at least 9 directory blocks.
   
    2. There are two new programs CBKFSX69 and CBKSPX69 for which
       program definitions are required in the CICS region where
       CICS BAC runs.
       The resource definitions for these programs are in member
       CBKPROGS in the SCBKSAMP library.  They are marked with the
       APAR number PI17232.
       Please ensure that you add these additional resource
       definitions to your CICS system.
       Although these new programs and definitions are only
       required in a CICS TS 5.2 environment, you are advised to
       add the definitions to CICS regions running other releases
       of CICS TS so that they will be available if and when you
       migrate the regions to CICS TS 5.2.
