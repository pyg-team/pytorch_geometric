Title: IBM Restrictions for using SHA-256 self-signed certificates in SiteProtector - United States

Text:
SP; SHA; 256; Strict TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Are there any compatibility issues when using SHA-256 self-signed certificates in SiteProtector? 

ANSWER
The following agents support the use of SHA-256 when communicating with SiteProtector: 

 * Security Network IPS (GX) 
 * QRadar Network Security/Security Network Protection (XGS)

Other agents do not support communication with SiteProtector when using SHA-256. 

Notes:  * It is possible to manage incompatible agents in a SiteProtector site that uses SHA-256. However, these agents must be registered to SiteProtector with the Authentication Level setting configured as trust-all. This will allow communication to occur by skipping certificate validation. 
 * SHA-256 is also used when SiteProtector is installed in Strict mode [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETBF_3.1.1/com.ibm.siteprotector.doc/security/sp_t_nist.htm?lang=en].
