ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product
   Information Management Version 10.0.0 FP1, the pencil icon
   appears even when no changes have been made to that item in the
   single edit view. This happens only if an editable date
   attribute is present. These items appears in a modified state
   (the pencil icon is displayed) if clicked on options button in
   new User Interface.
   
   
   Here are the generic reproduction steps:
   
   1. create a catalog with a Primary Spec containing for example,
   these 3 attributes: pk, name and current_date (type date)
   
   2. create a catalog view with 2 Attribute Collections, AttrCol1
   (containing attribute current_date only); AttrCol2 (containing
   pk and name) and 2 tabs; first tab with AttrCol1 and second tab
   with AttrCol2
   
   3. create a few items
   
   4. open an item and click on the "option" button
   
   Result:
   The icon on the right hand corner will change to the pencil icon
   even though no changes have been made to this item
   
   Analysis:
   This happens only if there is an editable date attribute in a
   tab. The date field is highlighted/marked even though user had
   not changed anything.
