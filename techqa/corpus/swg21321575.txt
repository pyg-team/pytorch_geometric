PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You notice slow WebSphereÂ® Portal initialization with messages WTRN0006W and WSVR0605W. 

SYMPTOM
When starting and before WebSphere Portal is open for e-business, the SystemOut.log shows entries such as follows: 

[9/15/08 21:08:28:590 CDT] 00000010 TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction 0000011C68E8A2EE000000010000002C0EC39F5011D20FAA40E11448C7

CAUSE
This problem occurs when a hostname lookup causes a JVM slow response during the Manage Search portlet initialization.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
If you capture a Javacore, it shows the slow thread "server.startup : #" as follows: 

3XMTHREADINFO "server.startup : 1" (TID:0x331F5700, sys_thread_t:0x33CAC7AC, state:CW, native ID:0x0015F011) prio=5
4XESTACKTRACE at java/net/Inet6AddressImpl.getLocalHostName(Native Method)
4XESTACKTRACE at java/net/InetAddress.getLocalHost(InetAddress.java:1461)
4XESTACKTRACE at com/ibm/lotus/search/siapix/imp/LightPersistenceService.getKey(Bytecode PC:0)
