QUESTION
 How does IBM FileNet Process Engine use F_SeqNumber? 

ANSWER
In Process Engine 3.5 or older, the F_SeqNumber is reset to 0 every second. 

In Process Engine 4.5 or newer, the F_SeqNumber is not reset to 0 every second. It is now an ever-increasing value. This is an intended change. 

F_SeqNumber is an internal value in Process Engine and can be used to put events that happen in the same second into the correct chronological order. F_SeqNumber is generally used in an "order by" clause such as in "order by F_Timestamp, F_SeqNumber" 

However, an "order by F_Timestamp, F_SeqNumber" is not at all the same ordering as "order by F_Timestamp + F_SeqNumber". For example, consider these four events: 

F_TimeStamp F_SeqNumber 

100 0 

100 1 

100 2 

101 0 

If adding the F_TimeStamp and F_SeqNumber values, the event with TimeStamp 101 and SeqNumber 0 would appear to be before the event with TimeStamp 100 and SeqNumber 2, even though it happened after that event. 

It has never been valid to add F_SeqNumber to F_TimeStamp.
