QUESTION
 After I deploy a pattern with a 'Call Processing Rule' or 'SLM' action, why does the action reference the wrong artifact? 

CAUSE
When you deploy a pattern, you specify the service name. This name is the prefix to all new objects that the deployment process creates. 

 * For a Call Processing Rule action, you can reference a processing rule or a variable. 
 * For an SLM action, you can reference an SLM policy or a variable.


When you deploy the pattern, the appliance does not recognize that the values of these properties are references and does not update them to point to the new processing rule or SLM policy that has the service name prefix. 
ANSWER
Access the configuration of Call Processing Rule and SLM actions. Update their configuration to use the correct reference. You must update these actions only when they use a direct reference to an existing configuration (rule or policy). When the reference is with a variable, no change is required.
