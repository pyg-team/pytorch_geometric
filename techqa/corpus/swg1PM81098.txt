ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  You would like to know if you can install IBM SPSS Statistics 21
   on a Macintosh operating system 10.6 (Snow Leopard). The
   installation instruction PDF on IBM SPSS Statistics 21
   Documentation webpage :
   
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024972 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024972]
   
   says that 10.6 is a supported operating system for release 21:
   -----------
   IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac OS Installation Instructions (Single
   User)
   System Requirements for IBM SPSS Statistics:
   
   The minimum hardware and software requirements for IBM&#65449; SPSS&#65449;
   Statistics are as follows:
   Operating System
   - Mac OS X 10.6 or higher (32- or 64-bit).
   ---------------------------------------------
   
   However, on the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports on
   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.js [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.js]
   p
   
   you can click on 'select a product and get the list of supported
   operating systems' and create a report for Statistics 21
   Then you will see that only Mac 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain
   Lion) are listed as supported OS for Statistics 21 on Macintosh
   and not 10.6 (Snow Leopard) any longer.
   
   This was reported to IBM SPSS Development. The portion in the
   installation PDF about system requirements was correct, whereas
   the
   information on the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports
   above was incorrect.
   Release Statistics 21 is supported on Macintosh 10.6, 10.7 and
   10.8.
   Please also refer to technote 1507587:
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507587 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507587]
   
   For future releases it is expected to have consistent
   information about system requirements on installation manuals
   and IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports.
