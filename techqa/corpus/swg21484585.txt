Title: IBM Error 7001 Symptom 18 after saving a manually created lservrc file from Outlook - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am using Statistics 17 was sent a licence file (lservrc) by Technical Support/Licensing to correct a license error.

After saving this file to my Statistics installation directory, starting Statistics will result in error 7001 symptom 18.

I tried right clicking on Statistics then "Run as Administrator" but I still receive the same error. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The workaround is to turn off "Hide extension for known files types", then rename lservrc to it's correct state.

For Windows XP - Open "My Computer" > "Tools" > "Folder Options"
For Windows Vista - Open "Computer" > "Organise" > "Folder and Search Options".

Once extensions are viewable, open the Statistics 17 installation directory, default being: C:\Program Files\SPSSinc\Statistics17 or \PASWStatistics17.
Right click the file 'lservrc.txt' / 'lservrc.dat' and rename it to just 'lservrc'
You should now be able to restart Statistics
