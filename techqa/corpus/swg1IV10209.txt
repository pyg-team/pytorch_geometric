   Needs correcting to
   
   explanation for the port should as below correctly : >
   
   CORRECTION SHOULD BE:
   
   snmpget(hostname, OID, community) - use default port 161.
   snmpget_p(hostname, OID, community, port) - use port as
   specified by
   port parameter.
   
        __
   
   
   WHY:
   It is needed to alter to be Above ... so its correct.
   as currently page 11 is incorrect - (mentions port 162 ) under
   the section titled "Rules file " -where it currently mentions
   port 162 incorrectly.

   P        roblem description
   
   Question: Is the following statement about port 162 accurate in
   the
   SNMP Probe PDF (page 11), under the section "Rules files"
   ----------------------------------------------
   SNMP GET:
   The snmpget and snmpget_p functions allow the rules file to
   retrieve
   SNMP
   variables from an SNMP agent.
   Note: The probe only supports use of the snmpget function on
   SNMP V1
   traps.
   The snmpget and snmpget_p functions always use the default SNMP
   port
   162,
   regardless of the Port property setting.
   ------------------------------------------------
   i ask because an snmpget is typically performed on port 161.

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The -SNMP GET- topic will be updated as follows:
   
   The existing note relating to snmpget port settings will be
   removed and replaced with the following text:
   The probe only supports use of the snmpget function on SNMP V1
   traps. The snmpget function uses the default port number 161 and
   the snmpget_p function uses the port number specified by the
   Port property.
   
   The -SNMP SET- topic will be updated as follows:
   
   The existing note relating to snmpset port settings will be
   removed and replaced with the following text:
   The probe only supports use of the snmpset function on SNMP V1
   traps. The snmpset function uses the default port number 161 and
   the snmpset_p function uses the port number specified by the
   Port property.
