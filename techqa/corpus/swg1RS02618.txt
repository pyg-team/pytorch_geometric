   engine.runtime.EngineData' in a body of type 'com.ibm.rules.
   generated.EngineDataClass'
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  An easy workaround is to initialize the value in the ruleflow.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The problem is due to the value used in the initialisation of a
   variable in a variable set. The value itself is a b2x
   expression which is not recognized during the ruleset
   compilation
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
   
   
    
   
   

TEMPORARY FIX
 *  Replace the reference to b2x variable with an actual value
