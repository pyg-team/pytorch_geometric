 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 
A Microsoft (MS) Word document is submitted to be published on IBM FileNet P8 Rendition Engine (RE) from IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine (AE) Workplace or IBM FileNet P8 WorkplaceXT (XT). You select the document from within AE or XT and right click on it to select the publish option. This is submitted to the RE to be published to a PDF file.

This doesn't happen when you submit a MS Powerpoint file; ppt; or a MS Excel .xls spreadsheet to the RE. They publish everytime.
