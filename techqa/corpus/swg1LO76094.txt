ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Background:
   - Timeout LTPA Token expiration in the case for a form, which
   only can be accessed by authenticated users.
   - the form application is integrated via a Portlet in a Portal
   environment
   - no matter which browser is used
   Behavior if the Form is opened via Feb:
   -The user starts the form
   - the session expires
   - the user tries to interact with the form (call a service)
   - the interaction fails because his session timed out
   - a window pops up, the user has the possibility to log-in again
   - the user is able to interact with the form after a successful
   log-in
   Behavior if the form is opened via the Portlet in our portal
   environment with SSO configured:
   -The user starts the form
   -the session expires
   -the user tries to interact with the form (call a service)
   -the interaction fails
   -no further interaction is possible the form is in a undefined
   state
   -the user has to log into the Portal again and reload the
   Portlet
   This is how you can reproduce the described behaviour:
   Setting up the environment:
   1. Create a Form that only can be accessed by authenticated
   Users
   2. The Form should contain a webservice call on a button onClick
   event.
   3. Set up a portal environment with SSO enabled and configured.
   4. Create an new portal page, add the FEB Portlet and set the
   created form as reference.
   Reproduce the behaviour:
   FEB:
   1. Start the form application in the FEB
   2. click the Button with the service call bound on.
   3. Open Firebug or Web developer tools and delete the LTPA token
   and JSession Cookies
   4. Click on the service button again.
   5. The log-in dialog pops up.
   Portlet:
   1. Start the form application in the Portlet
   2. click the button with the service call bound on.
   3. The service call works as intended
   4. Open Firebug or Web developer tools and delete the LTPA token
   and JSession Cookies
   5. Open your Console Tab.
   6. Click on the Service Button again.
   7. The log-in dialog doesn't pop up, as you can see in the
   network tab the browser tries to GET it but fails.
   Possible solutions
   - opening the log-in popup by the FEB application
   - be able to recognize that behaviour by JavaScript. If so the
   developer would be able to reload the whole page, to force a
   relog-in
