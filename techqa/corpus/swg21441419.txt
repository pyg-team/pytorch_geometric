PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Attempts to build a model in IBM Rational Rhapsody results in linker error "Can't find file: crt0.o". 

SYMPTOM
Steps to reproduce: 

 1. Launch Rational Rhapsody which is integrated with Wind River VxWorks v6.8
    
    
 2. Open a project
    
    
 3. Click Code > Build > Build Entire Project
    
    
 4. During the build process, you notice the following error message:
    
    dld: error: Can't find file: crt0.o
    make.exe: *** [TcpTest.vxe] Error 1


CAUSE
There exists differences between the rules.rtp files provided in the Wind River versions 6.8 and 6.7



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To resolve the issue: 

 1. Navigate to the Rational Rhapsody installation directory 
    
    C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\Rhapsody\7.5.1
    
    
 2. Add the following values to Rhapsody properties file
    
    Metaclass VxWorks6diab_RTP
    Property LinkSwitches String "$OMLinkCommandSet -WDVSB_DIR=$(WIND_BASE)/target/lib"
    end
    Metaclass WorkbenchManaged_RTP
    Property LinkSwitches String "$OMLinkCommandSet -WDVSB_DIR=$(WIND_BASE)/target/lib"
    end<\code>
    
 3. Add the link switch -WDVSB_DIR=$(WIND_BASE)/target/lib to diab RTP applications
    
    
 4. Save the property file
    
    
 5. Restart Rational Rhapsody
    
    
 6. Perform the build operation
