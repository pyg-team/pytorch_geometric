Title: IBM Empty XOM when deploying ruleapp - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The zip file containing the XOM is empty when the box Deploy XOM is checked in Rule Designer when deploying a Ruleapp to Decision Server 

SYMPTOM
The error message "!MESSAGE GBRSE0448E : Exception while making zip file for XOM deployment" is seen in the workspace log file.



CAUSE
Presence of source code control related files in the folder containing the XOM class files.

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Check if the source code control tool has inserted files in the folder containing the XOM classes. For example if the XOM classes are in the bin folder, check if it also contains a .svn folder

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
The folder containing the class files should not contain any additional files. Since this folder is generated when the project is built, it should not be checked in to source code control.
