QUESTION
 Can a TCP/IP attached printer be defined to and used by CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS)? 

CAUSE
CICS printers that had been defined as SNA are now being defined as TCP/IP.

ANSWER
Printers can be defined to TCP/IP, and the corresponding VTAM resources can be acquired and used by CICS just like any other VTAM printer LU. No additional software beyond z/OS is required. CICS TS talks indirectly through TCP/IP Telnet to print to a TCP/IP attached printer (or a TCP/IP attached PCOM terminal.) The printer communicates with TCP/IP Telnet so CICS sends the printout to the Telnet LU and the TCP/IP Telnet passes it on to the printer.

Therefore, you should define the printer as a regular VTAM LU just like you did when using SNA, except the LU name will be one of the LUs in the pool of TCP/IP Telnet LUs. CICS does not know that it is communicating to a TCP/IP attached printer. It does not even know it is talking to TCP/IP Telnet. To CICS, it is just a VTAM luname. See Associated Printer Function in section 2.2.1.4.12 Advanced LU name mapping topics [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/F1A1B3B1/2.2.1.4.12?SHELF=f1a1bkd1&DT=20120119110606] of the z/OS V1.13 Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide (SC31-8775-20) for more information on how to define the printer.

Printing to a TCP/IP attached printer can also be accomplished by using printing software. If, for example, you use the IBM Infoprint Server [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/1.0?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] printing software you could use NetSpool [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/3.4?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] to simulate a VTAM printer and write the printing output to the MVS job entry system (JES) SPOOL. Then you could use IP PrintWay [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/3.5?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] product to send the print output from the SPOOL to the TCP/IP printer.

NetSpool and IP PrintWay perform complementary functions. NetSpool converts print requests from VTAM applications into S/390 line data and creates output data sets on the JES spool, using information in a NetSpool print-characteristics data set created by the installation. IP PrintWay can transmit data sets created by NetSpool from the JES spool to printers in a TCP/IP network.
