APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  A security vulnerability in ChangeCipherSpec processing allows
   intermediate nodes to intercept encrypted data and decrypt them
   and can force the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients
   and servers.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the
   use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. This
    can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the
    attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked
   client and server. The attack can only be performed between a
   vulnerable client *and* server.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Fix is available in 5.0.0.15, 6.0.0.7, 6.0.1.3 and 7.0.0.0
