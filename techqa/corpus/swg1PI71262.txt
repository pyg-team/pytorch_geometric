APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Rational Developer for System z (RDz) v9.1.1 host and ACF2,
   error feedback fails when unexpected messages are issued during
   the allocation of a workfile. This problem may be  observed
   during a remote syntax check or zunit testing. Here is an
   example of what may be recorded in FEKLOGs:
   
   ACF0C038 ACF2 LOGONID ATTRIBUTES HAVE REPLACED DEFAULT USER
   ATTRIBUTES
   
   The same issue exists in RDz host versions 9.5.0, 9.5.1 and IDz
   14.0.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  To prevent unexpected messages from being created you can add
   the line below to the fekferrf.rex command file on the host,
   which by default can be found in USS directory
   /usr/lpp/rdz/bin/fekferrf.rex  (for v9.1) or in
   /usr/lpp/zexpl//bin/fekferrf.rex (for RDz 9.5.1):
   
   Address TSO "PROF NOWTPMSG"

   01.In Rational Developer for System z (RDz) v9.1.1 host and
      ACF2, error feedback fails when unexpected messages are
      issued during the allocation of a workfile. This problem may
      be observed during a remote syntax check or zunit testing.
      Here is an example of what may be recorded in FEKLOGs:
   
      ACF0C038 ACF2 LOGONID ATTRIBUTES HAVE REPLACED DEFAULT USER
      ATTRIBUTES
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  01.Because ACF2 generates an additional informational message
      during a data set allocation request as RACF generates no
      messages,RDz server appends this message after the allocated
      data set name. RDz client assumes server only send data set
      name string as a normal response. If more messages exist in
      the response, RDz client treats it as an error. RDz server
      is updated not to append additional messages to the
      response, if the response comes from fekferrf.rex, the
      module to process the data set allocation request, and no
      other error condition is detected.
