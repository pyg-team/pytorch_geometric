Title: IBM Pushback of binning node does not fall back to file-based caching when in-database caching fails - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am working with Clementine 12.0.4 or Modeler 13.0 and import a SQL database. I have only read access to this database and no write priviledges. Under user options I have enabled database caching. My stream contains a binning node. However, when I execute the stream I get an error message and the stream execution is interrupted, why is this? 
I have used the correct ODBC drivers (SPSS OEM 5.3 SQL Server Wire Protocol). The error message is:

37000[262] [DataDirect][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]CREATE TABLE permission denied in database 'xxxDB'. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
This problem has been reported to SPSS Development - Workaround Available. It is resolved with the Modeler 13.0.1 Patch.
The reason for this behaviour is that pushback of binning node does not fall back to file-based caching when in-database caching fails because you may have no write permissions to the default database. As a workaround please enable a cache on an upstream node which gracefully falls-back to file based caching and that then prevents the pushback of the binning node and so avoids the error. With the workaround you will get a warning "Failed to create table for in-database caching. Using file cache instead." but execution of your stream will not interrupt. We apologize for any inconvenience
