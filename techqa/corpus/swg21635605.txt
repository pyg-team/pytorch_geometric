PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 A slowdown in performance is experienced when using the IBM Datacap 8.0.1 Rulerunner (Quattro) service, compared to using the thick client application with "page ocr_s" action. 

SYMPTOM
In Datacap 8.0.1 FP3, when Rulerunner is configured to run tasks, they run significantly slower than when run through the Datacap Taskmaster Client.


CAUSE
The Quattro service is configured to use a roaming profile user, but this user has never physically logged into the machine and therefore has never created a local profile.

ENVIRONMENT
Datacap Server
Windows 2008 64bit Enterprise SP2
Windows regional settings set to English (United Kingdom), short date is
20/09/2012 and long date is 20 September 2012

SQL Server
Windows 2008 64bit Enterprise SP2
SQL Server 2008 SP3 (10.0.5500)
Windows regional Setting set to English (United Kingdom), short date is
20/09/2012 and long date is 20 September 2012
SQL for SQL Server: language is English (United States) and
CurrentDateTime is 2012-09-20 10:42:41.827

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Once the user with the roaming profile logs into the machine, a local profile is created and performance improves immediately.
