 PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

ABSTRACT
 IBM is pleased to announce a new support option that is available to you when your software reaches End of Service (EOS). IBM will offer Continuing Support limited to InfoSphere Replication Server (under Product ID 5724-N98) and InfoSphere Data Event Publisher (under Product ID 5724-N99), specific to v9.7 releases only. This offering will provide you with continued access to the same knowledgeable global Support team that you are working with today. 

CONTENT
Under your IBM Passport Advantage agreement's (International Passport Advantage Agreement or International Passport Advantage Express Agreement) Software Subscription and Support (S&S) terms, you receive comprehensive cross-platform technical assistance from a team of highly skilled Support experts. Additionally, you get flexible upgrade protection, access to the latest software versions and releases, remote technical support, 24x7 support for business-critical outages, online self-help resources, and unlimited electronic and voice access (where available) to world-class global IBM Software Support Centers.

Continuing Support Option

Continuing Support extends support for your software beyond its EOS date.

· Unlimited number of technical support incidents. 
· Access to documentation, technotes and other online product material. 
· Access to existing available fixes created before the product's EOS date to correct known defects.

The Continuing Support offering does not include:
