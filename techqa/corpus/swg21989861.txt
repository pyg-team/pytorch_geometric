Title: IBM Select statement may receive SQL0727N after drop and create the same named nickname - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 Why does select statement receive SQL0727N after drop and create the same named nickname? 

CAUSE
This is an known expected behavior of current DB2.

ANSWER
Here is an example scenario. 

0. A federated database enabled and a nickname created.
1. drop nickname
2. create nickname
3. select static SQL via nickname
==> received -727 at db2diag.log

This is an known expected behavior of current DB2.

The -727 error is there because we didn't find the object. After the drop of the 
nickname, the package becomes invalid. We didn't find the object because we did a 
conservative rebind when doing an implicit rebind. During conservative rebind some
objects need to have a timestamp older than the create timestamp of the package.

Only those objects in the SQL path that were defined before the last explicit bind 
time stamp are considered for resolving references to any objects.

It can be worked around by running bind/rebind manually.

Note:
This behavior might be changed without notice in the future. We can confirm whether this technote
is valid or not by following the above scenario.
