PROBLEM SUMMARY

   * USERS AFFECTED: All users                                    *
   ****************************************************************
   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The new historical collector (PDSV2)    *
   *                      loads module KPDCSVG repeatedly in      *
   *                      several programs but never delete's     *
   *                      it. The result is that, although the    *
   *                      module is really only loaded once and   *
   *                      occupies a single place in storage,     *
   *                      the use count continues to be           *
   *                      incremented and is never decremented.   *
   *                      The storage agent will now load         *
   *                      KPDCSVG only once when the product      *
   *                      starts. All subsequent uses will        *
   *                      simply get the saved address of the     *
   *                      module and branch to it.                *
