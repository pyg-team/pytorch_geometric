Title: IBM "A fatal error has occurred" when starting Statistics 18 on a 32-bit Vista machine - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I have recently purchased the PASW Statistics 18 Graduate Pack. After installing and licencing this program, when I start this application I receive the following:
"Fatal Error has occured"
I have no choice but to click on 'OK', but then Statistics 18 shuts down and I am not able to use this application. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Initial installation was not run as an Administrator as it was executed when the DVD was inserted into the Vista machine.
To resolve this problem, please follow the steps below:
1) Remove Statistics 18 through the Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program
2) Restart your machine
3) Insert the PASW Statistics 18 DVD. Instead of running the autoplay, open Computer and navigate to: \Windows\PASWStatistics\win32
4) Right-click the 'setup.exe' file and choose 'Run as Administrator'
5) Complete the rest of the wizard and when the License Authorisation Wizard appears, click on 'Cancel'.
6) Click on Start (Windows Logo) > Programs > SPSS inc > PASW Statistics 18
7) Right-click on 'License Authorisation Wizard' and select 'Run as Administrator'.
8) Complete the rest of the licencing process and restart Statistics 18
