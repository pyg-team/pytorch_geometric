VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVE-ID:CVE-2015-3194 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3194]

Description:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a NULL pointer dereference when verifying certificates via a malformed routine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using signature verification routines with an absent PSS parameter to cause any certificate verification operation to crash.

CVSS Base Score:5.3
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108503]for the current score
CVSS Environmental Score:*Undefined

CVE-ID:CVE-2015-3195 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3195]

Description:OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain CMS data and other sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score:5.3
CVSS Temporal Score:Seehttps://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108504]for the current score

CVE-ID:CVE-2015-3196 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3196]

Description:OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a race condition when PSK identity hints are received by a multi-threaded client and the SSL_CTX structure is updated with the incorrect value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to possibly corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score:3.7
