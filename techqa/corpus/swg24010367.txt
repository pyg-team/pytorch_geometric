ABSTRACT
 The WebSphere MQ SSL Wizard is a utility designed to ease the administration of a basic TLS/SSL channel. 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Notice: This SupportPac has been moved to withdrawn state. It can be found on GitHub [https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-tls-ssl-wizard]


The WebSphere MQ SSL Wizard takes input in series of entry panels and then generates a set of instructions to enable the user to define and start a TLS/SSL channel. The instructions generated include both the platform specific commands for creating the certificates (e.g. using RACF or GSKit) and the MQSC commands used to define and start the WebSphere MQ channel. 

The WebSphere MQ channel can either be an MCA channel between two queue managers or a client connection channel to a queue manager. Sample source and binaries are shipped with the WebSphere MQ SSL Wizard for clients written in C, Java and JMS. 

The WebSphere MQ SSL Wizard generates instructions for z/OS, UNIX and Windows, although some instructions (e.g. MQSC) may be run on other platforms.

Possible Uses
The WebSphere MQ SSL Wizard can be used as a learning tool for users new to WebSphere MQ SSL or as an administration assist tool for more advanced users.
