ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  The bug is seen in marketing emails that the customer sends
   from a
   MailChimp server.  These emails are not rendered properly in
   Notes 9 on
   Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10.  Even if sent to the Notes
   client
   via POP3 from a non-Domino SMTP server they still are rendered
   wrong.
   They look even worse when selecting the "Disable embedded
   browser for
   MIME mail" in the Notes client preferences.
   
   However, the emails are rendered properly in gmail, yahoo,
   earthlink
   and even within Traveler on Android. This tells us that the
   messages
   are received at the Domino server just fine but the Notes
   client and
   iNotes both fail to render them properly.
   
   The problem can be seen when viewing the messages.  See attached
   yahoo.png screenshot.  The big red "Give Feedback" button in
   the middle
   of the message is what is at issue.  Note that this is just one
   example
   of the problem; the customer has many marketing emails with
   many more
   red buttons.  The red button shows in every mail reader we've
   found -
   except Notes and iNotes.  See the attached notes.png screenshot
   showing
   that in Notes, while the hotlink is present, there is no big
   red button
   surrounding it.  That's the problem.
   
   I do notice that the page source in the Notes client is
   different than
   in other mail programs.  See attached text files showing the
   difference.  In Notes, the content is shown in
   "quoted-printable"
   encoding.  I don't know whether that has anything to do with the
   rendering bug or if that is just how the page source displays
   it.
   
   To summarize out testing, the MailChimp marketing emails are
   correct
   in:
   
   Gmail account viewed in browser
   Yahoo account viewed in browser
   Yahoo account viewed via POP3 in Android mail app
   Earthlink account viewed via POP3 in Android mail app
   Domino account in Android Verse (Traveler) app
   
   The MailChimp marketing emails are NOT rendered correctly in:
   Domino iNotes (browser) account
   Domino account in Notes 9 Standard on Windows 8 or 10
   Domino account from another organization in Notes 9 Standard on
   Windows
   7
   Earthlink account via POP3 in Notes 9 client on Windows 7
   
   I am also attaching an eml file to provide complete page source
   of two
   examples of this type of MIME mail that both are not rendered
   completely in Notes and iNotes but are rendered completely in
   Traveler.
   
   We just want Notes and iNotes to work as well as Traveler with
   respect
   to rendering these MIME emails.
