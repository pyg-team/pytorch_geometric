   read-only destination, errors are reported.
   
   For example,
   
   WPADMIN:MVS126:/WebSphere/1/AppServer/java#>bin/java
   -Dfile.encoding=ISO8859-1 -Xnoargsconversion
   -Dpd.home=/WebSphere/1/AppServer/java/PolicyDirector -cp
   /WebSphere/1/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar
   com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg -action config -cfgfiles_path
   /WebSphere/1/AppServer/java -host pdoglinux.raleigh.ibm.com -was
