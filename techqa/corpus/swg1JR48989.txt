ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In Process Portal, inconsistent styles are applied to the
   standard task list (accessible via Work > My Tasks) and the
   standard Team Performance and Team Task dashboards.
   
   On the task list, the popup that appears after claiming a task
   is in a "blue" theme.  In Team Performance and in Team Task,
   however, the popup that appears has a different theme instead.
