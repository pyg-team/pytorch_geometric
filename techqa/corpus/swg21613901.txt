ANSWER
ITCAM for Transactions version 7.3 introduced the ability to monitor the TCP interactions in a network environment. This new functionality allows the administrator to quickly visualize the TCP based application protocols and dependencies present in their production environment along with performance characteristics of these interactions.

The term “AgentLess” in ITCAM for Transactions materials and documentation refers to the ability of this TCP-monitoring to occur :
- without having ITCAM for Transactions agents installed on the TCP endpoints themselves (through the use of a spanned port for example).
- without knowledge of the application protocols being used on top of the TCP transport layer.

The Web Response Time agent monitors TCP interactions on a network interface (in local or appliance / promiscuous modes).

Aggregated TCP status data from all agentless enabled Web Response Time agents are rolled up by the Transaction Reporter agent, where it is consolidated, and reporting and visualization workspaces are available.

In order to allow the monitoring of the TCP activity of these network based components, the 7.3 and later version of the Application Management Configuration Editor contains a new component navigation tree that allows the user to create, edit or delete component monitoring definitions. Each component contains one or more protocol definitions, which define which ports on which IP addresses will be monitored for particular protocols used by the component.

The Web Response Time configuration panels were re-designed in version 7.3 to provide better usability in addition to new properties specific to TCP monitoring, mainly "Monitor TCP Traffic" configuration option.
