Title: IBM How can I view the lift for multiple generated models on one evaluation chart in Clementine? - United States

Text:
 TECHNOTE (FAQ)

QUESTION
 I have Neural Net, C5 and CHAID models in my stream that I would like to analyze the lift for each. I have tried to connect all three to one Evaluation node so that I can see the lift stream for each on the same graph, but I can not connect all four to one Evaluation node. I've tried to do a Supernode, and I get the error "Cannot determine where to insert connectors." Is it possible to do what I'm trying to do? 

ANSWER
If you have the Classification Module licensed in Clementine 11.0 or newer you can accomplish this using the Binary Classifier node. The Binary Classifiers node allows you to create and compare models for binary outcomes (Yes/No, Churn/Don't, etc.) using Neural Net, Decision
Tree (C5.0, CART, QUEST, and CHAID), and Logistic Regression algorithms. To evaluate the lift in particular, follow the steps below.

1) Attach the Binary Classifier node to your stream from the Model palette.
2) In the Expert Tab of the Binary Classifier node, deselect any models that you are not interested in. You can then execute the stream.
3) From the results window select the models you would like to see on the evaluation chart by checking the Generate column.
4) From the menu at the top click on Generate -> Evaluation Chart. In this case you would want to select Lift from the next window and click OK.

For more information regarding the Binary Classifier node please refer to the Clementine Node reference guide found in the Documentation folder within the installation location.
