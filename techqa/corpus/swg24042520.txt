Tivoli Storage Manager; IBM Spectrum Protect DOWNLOADABLE FILES

ABSTRACT
 This document describes how to download installation images for IBM Spectrum Protect™ for Virtual Environments Version 7.1.6.x Interim fixes 

DOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION
Tip: Beginning with Version 7.1.3, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments is now IBM Spectrum Protect™ for Virtual Environments. Some applications such as the software fulfillment systems and IBM License Metric Tool use the new product name. However, the software and its product documentation continue to use the Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments product name. To learn more about the rebranding transition, see http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963634. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21963634]


WARNING: If you are updating to 7.1.6.5, the File Restore UI may not work properly if the mount proxy is at a lower level. Additionally, if a mount proxy is updated to 7.1.6.5 level but the UI is at a lower level, the File Restore UI may not work correctly. The solution is to update all Data Protection for Virtual Environments components (the GUI, data mover, mount proxy, recovery agent) to 7.1.6.5 or higher level.

Note: Data Protection for VMware 7.1.6.2 delivery was repackaged to include the V7.1.6.2 Backup-Archive Client. This V7.1.6.2 Backup-Archive Client includes the APAR fixes of IT15769 [IT15769] and IT15975 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT15975].
