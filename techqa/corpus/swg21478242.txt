Text:
 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 I am viewing the documentation (Sentinel LM Helpfiles) on the Sentinel License Manager which is utilized by IBM SPSS products for a network installation. The documentation mentions a file called wrcommute which allows for the remote setup of a commuter license. I could not find this wrcommute file installed with my IBM SPSS product. Am I missing something? 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
IBM SPSS has not included the option for remotely setting up commuter licenses within its products using wrcommute. To set up a commuter license for your network version product, please view Resolution #59826
