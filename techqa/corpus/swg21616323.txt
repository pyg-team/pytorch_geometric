Defect: ECM00180343 says that development has reviewed this issue and was not able to reproduce in the default location C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\SPSS\Concurrent Licensing Tools\9.5.0\License Manager.
However, if they specify C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Concurrent Licensing Tools\9.5.0\License Manager then it is reproducible.

Even with this issue, the Sentinel License Manager is installed and running. The customer should be able to attain a license using: licenseactivator.exe <AUTHCODE>. Then they can add the license either by copying to the lservrc file where lservnt.exe was installed or using wlmadmin add license option.

The LSERVRC was created manually. 

Tried to start the license server but there is no service to start it.


CAUSE
User doing the install did not have enough permissions

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The license install log shows: 
Error 1402.Could not open key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE32\SOFTWARE\Rainbow Technologies\Sentinel RMS License Manager. 
System error 5. Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your support personnel


RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Install Sentinel License Manager as Administrator and not an altered version of Administrator. 
On Windows Vista or 7, you must launch the installer as Administrator. When instructed to launch an installer file, right-click the file and choose Run As Administrator.
