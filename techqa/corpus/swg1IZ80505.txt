APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Impact Cluster is configured with 4 Impact Servers installed
   over 4 Linux servers. When all four Impact Servers are started,
   each server can be accessed by the web admin tool, and each
   server correctly points to IMP_A as the primary server.
   
   However, when IMP_A is stopped, the other 3 servers fail to
   select a new primary, and instead still point to IMP_A as the
   primary.
   
   I have repeated this test many times, and once they correctly
   failed over, setting IMP_D as the primary, However when I
   stopped IMP_D, the remaining 2 servers continued to point to
   IMP_D as the primary.
