TB million zeroes 000 000000 zeros TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 User clicks "Group - Reports - Trial Balance with Drilldown". The window "Reports - Trial Balance with Drilldown" opens. User fills in many/most of the selections. User clicks the browse ("...") button next to "Company" to choose their company. An error occurs. 

SYMPTOM
Screen: 

 

 * 
 * 
 * No company is available in the popup list
 * 
 * 
 * 


In addition: 
As a side-effect of this defect, the current 'culture' will change to English.  * Depending on the customer's environment (their Regional Settings), this can cause incorrect date formatting and 'extra zeros' to appear in some screens inside Controller..


Also, an additional side-effect is that during the 'save to file' phase Controller stores the cache in memory - this will intermittently cause the 'Out Of Memory' ( System.OutOfMemoryException) problems due to Windows memory fragmentation. 
CAUSE
There are several potential causes for this error: 

 * For example, recent structure updates require the end user(s) to clear their local cache. See separate IBM Technote #1347355 for more details.


However, this IBM Technote shall concentrate on the scenario where the problem is intermittent, and the cause is a code production issue (APAR PM48803) in Controller. 

More Information 
The bug is triggered when Controller's 'structure' cache is very large (for example in one customer's case it was 25Mb). 
ENVIRONMENT
Customer has large/complicated accounting structure.



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Fix: 

Upgrade to Controller 10.1 IF4 (10.1.364) or later. 

 

 * 
 * TIP:
 *  If currently using Controller 8.5.1 IF15 (8.5.1560) or earlier, then it is possible to upgrade to a later version of Controller 8.5.1.x instead This is known as Controller 8.5.1 IF16 (8.5.1567). 

Workaround: 

The user should clear their local cache files by clicking "Maintain - Special Utilities - Clear Local Cache", 

 * If this does not fix the problem, then exit Controller, re-launch Controller, and re-try.
