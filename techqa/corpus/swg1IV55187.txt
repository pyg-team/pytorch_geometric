APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When averaging on the contributions from individual CPUs, in
   order to determine the statistical utilization metrics for the
   'aggregate' CPU, also disabled cores are taken into account.
   Such utilization metrics, User CPU (Percent), System CPU
   (Percent), Idle CPU (Percent), Wait I/O (Percent) and CPU Busy
   (Percent), are always zero for disabled cores, so these values
   are biasing the averages.
   
   Affected Platforms / Versions:
   
   This issue affects only the UNIX OS agent running on HP-UX or
   Solaris.
   
   On AIX, the aggregate CPU is independently calculated, it's not
   an average across the individual cores, and it is not impacted.
   
   Diagnostics:
    set KBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:stat_daemon ALL) (UNIT:vm_stat ALL)
   
   Example:
    TBD
   
   Initial Impact:
   Medium, the agent is incorrectly reporting some metrics
   
   Additional Keywords:
   UNIXCPU
   SMP_CPU
   CPUBUSY
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use User CPU (Percent), System CPU (Percent), Idle CPU
   (Percent), Wait I/O (Percent) and CPU Busy (Percent) attributes
   in the System Attribute Group, instead of their aggregate data
   in the SMP CPU Attribute Group.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The UNIX OS Agent reports incorrect aggregate CPU attributes
   when running on HP-UX or Solaris.
   
   
   The Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS reports incorrect aggregate CPU
   attributes when running on HP-UX or Solaris.  On the HP-UX and
   Solaris platforms the User CPU (Percent), System CPU (Percent),
   Idle CPU (Percent), Wait I/O (Percent) and CPU Busy (Percent)
   attributes of the 'aggregate' CPU in the SMP CPU attribute group
   are calculated as simple averages across individual CPUs'
   contributions.  In doing this the agent does not take into
   account that some CPUs could be disabled and should be excluded
   not to bias the final average.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Only CPUs in the on-line status are now considered for the
   averages.
