APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS DOCUMENTATION ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  OpenPages REST API does not currently have a way to support a
   mixed-mode authentication as described for some users using
   LDAP, some using OpenPages native database user registry
   authentication.
   
   They will need to access the API using users that are in their
   LDAP directory (possibly they can provision a 'real user' from
   their LDAP to have as much Administrator permissions in
   OpenPages as would be needed to use REST API in their use case
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Use a different OpenPages ID

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  See technote
   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21997747 - We do
   not support mixed mode authentication.  We will review this in a
   future release and see if we can add this to our API.
