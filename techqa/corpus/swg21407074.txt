PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 You are having a business rules problem in WebSphere Process Server. You would like to know what documentation you must collect (MustGather) so that the WebSphere Process Server Support team can diagnose your problem. If you gather this documentation before contacting support it will expedite the troubleshooting process, and save you time. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Collect the MustGather information for problems with business rules in WebSphere Process Server. Gathering this information before calling IBM support helps in understanding the problem and saves time when analyzing the data. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=3455&uid=swg24020510]



Setting the trace string Set the following trace strings, then reproduce the problem. For instructions, see the main WebSphere Process Server MustGather document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239895#instructions].

Note: Enabling the trace might slow down your system. This delay can lead to transaction timeouts and errors. 

Required diagnostic information 
Gather the following information and files: 

General diagnostic information  * Problem description 
 * Environment description 
 * Server logs: All files from the following directories:
   profile_root/profile_name/logs/server_name
   profile_root/profile_name/ffdc 
 * Project interchange (PI) or enterprise archive (EAR) file from the relevant applications


IBM Support Assistant Automated data collectors are available in IBM Support Assistant to improve accuracy of complete data collection. Use ISA Lite to automate the gathering the needed log files. 

Note: In addition, gather a detailed problem description, environment description, and other requested materials, such as a PI file, when using ISA Lite.
