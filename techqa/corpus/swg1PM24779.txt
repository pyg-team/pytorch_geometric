ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Customer is using a Windows machine, Word 2003, and RQM 2.0.1. I
   was able to reproduce the problem on my windows XP SP3, Word
   2007, and RQM 2.0.1 ifix4.
   
   When you copy a sentence or word from Microsoft word document
   (the customers document included, and one of my own documents)
   on to a RQM testcase, in description, once saved the word starts
   to shows the encoding. The customer is copying the sentence from
   the document 'Enter a CD for a CMIA cash deposit'.
   
   If I take that sentence from a word document, and copy and paste
   it to a text editor, and then to descriptions field in RQM this
   problem does not occur.
   
   Thanks
   
   I have included the document the customer is using, and one of
   my document, screen shoots of both before the save, and of both
   after saving.
