PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When using different IBM Clarity Server features in an Internet Explorer version that is not fully compatible with your IBM Clarity Server version, they might not work properly, displaying different error messages, according to the specific feature that is being used. 

SYMPTOM
Not all Clarity features will work properly in Internet Explorer 9 and above.


CAUSE
IBM Clarity Server versions 7.0.x, 7.2.0, 7.2.1 are not compatible with Internet Explorer 9. We do not have an official list with known IE 9 issues, but here are the most common issues encountered so far: 

 * Start page display issue (OWC does not resize to the full length of the Clarity window) 
 * Issues installing the Clarity ActiveX 
 * Script errors when opening Hierarchy Security 
 * Script errors in Workflow Administration 
 * Script errors in templates and reports page options

ENVIRONMENT
 

IBM Clarity Server 6.x 

IBM Clarity Server 7.0.x 

IBM Clarity Server 7.2.0 

IBM Clarity Server 7.2.1 FP1 

IBM Clarity Server 7.2.1 FP2


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
Different error messages are displayed when using Clarity with IE9 or above: 

 * ActiveX control cannot be loaded 
 * Object doesn't support this property or method 
 * Failed to create Microsoft Office Spreadsheet component

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
 

 * For IBM Clarity Server versions 6.x and 7.0.x the following IE versions are supported: 6, 7, 8 on 32 bit. 
 * For IBM Clarity Server version 7.2 the following IE versions are supported: 7, 8 on 32 bit. 
 * Fix Pack 1 for IBM Clarity Server 7.2.1 fully supports Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 
 * Fix Pack 2 for IBM Clarity Server 7.2.1 fully supports Microsoft Internet Explorer 10


To get passed these error messages and display issues it is recommended to downgrade Internet Explorer to the supported versions or add the site in Compatibility view (Microsoft Internet Explorer Tools >>Compatibility view Settings).
