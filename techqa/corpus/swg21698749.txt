CVE-2015-0138; CVE-2014-6593; CVE-2015-0383; CVE-2015-0410 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 5 and 6 that are used by IBM Rational ClearCase. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in January 2015. This bulletin also addresses the “FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
CVEID: CVE-2015-0138 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0138]
DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in various IBM SSL/TLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain SSL/TLS connections. An IBM SSL/TLS client implementation could accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
