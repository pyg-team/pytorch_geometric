APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Some of the SQL queries that the Tivoli Storage Manager
   Monitoring Agent issues can cause a performance problem. The
   symptoms may seem similar to APAR IC63755 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC63755], but the cause of the
   performance degradation is different. Both APARs will need to be
   applied.
   Initial Impact: Low
   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected: All Reporting and
        Monitoring
   Additional Keywords: TSM zz61 zzrm61 ITM TCR hang perf IC63755 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC63755]

   .
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Set the KSK_SCHED_ON to zero (ex:  KSK_SCHED_ON=0) in the
   agent's configuration file. The default locations for these
   files are located:
   .
   /opt/tivoli/tsm/reporting/itm/config/sk.ini on UNIX
   C:\IBM\itm\tmaitm6\KSKENV_<instance_name> on Windows
   .
   The KSK_SCHED_ON option turns off the schedule attribute group.
   This is the same as stopping data collection for the schedule in
   the Historical Configuration window. The "Schedule" workspace in
   TEPS will still work.
