CVE ID: CVE-2013-4286 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286] 

Description: Apache Tomcat is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling, caused by an incomplete fix related to the handling of malicious requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91426] for the current score

CVE ID: CVE-2014-0033 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0033] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286] 

Description: Apache Tomcat could allow a remote attacker to hijack a valid user's session, caused by an error even when disableURLRewriting is enabled. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted link and log into the application, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account and possibly launch further attacks on the system. 

CVSS Base Score: 4.3 
CVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91423 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/91423] for the current score
