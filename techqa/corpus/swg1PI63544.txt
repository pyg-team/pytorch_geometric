APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When a RuleApp is deployed to RES, it includes the XOM URIs
   that it requires.
   But it seems that the order in which the XOM URIs are published
   is not taken into account once on RES.
   In other words, it seems that even if I specify a specific
   order for the XOMs to be used (to avoid class conflicts when
   the same class might show up more than once for example) it is
   ignored by the deployment process and the order on RES may be
   different than the one configured in RD.
   In some cases this may cause issues with the projects.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  Manually check (and correct) the order of the RES URIs in order
   to make sure the order is the right one on RES in order to
   avoid issues.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  The extraction from Rule Designer does not take into account
   when creating the xom library to be deployed
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  The code is fixed
