Title: IBM Why are the IBM Datacap Rulerunner services generating multiple batches in pending mode? - United States

Text:
Received a stop command. Rule Runner Services TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 The Taskmaster Datacap Rulerunner is generating multiple batches and is placing the batches in pending mode with no images within the batch. 

CAUSE
The Rulerunner service is unable to read the retry interval setting within the Windows registry. 

ENVIRONMENT
Datacap TaskMaster 8.1 
Window 2008 Server

DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The Rulerunner log contains the message "Received a stop command" 
Rule Runner is able to start the service, however it lacks the credentials to read the registry entries to restart at 14400 seconds. The Rulerunner service retries every 3 seconds, causing batches to be created in a pending stage.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Adding the Rulerunner Services account to the local administrator account resolved registry accessing issue.
