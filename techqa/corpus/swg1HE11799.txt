APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine password that is used for
   the IBM FileNet P8 connection in IBM Content Collector is
   changed, the configuration of the P8 connection cannot be
   updated. As a result, the password that is used to connect to
   FileNet P8 in IBM Content Collector cannot be changed.
   
   The following error message is displayed:
   
   Error: The application cannot log onto the P8 domain.
   Problem: Failed to log into the P8 domain and fetch an instance
   of the Entire Network object.
   Solution: Ensure that the P8 Content Engine server is running
   and accessible and that your supplied P8 credentials are valid.
   See event log for more details.
   
   The same error occurs if the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine
   server is not available.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX
 *  N/A
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  IBM Content Collector requires a working connection to the IBM
   FileNet P8 Content Engine to save the configuration of a IBM
   FileNet P8 connection. If the connection is not possible because
    the server is down or because the password has been changed,
   the configuration cannot be changed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 3.0 Fix Pack 4, the problem
   has been fixed.
