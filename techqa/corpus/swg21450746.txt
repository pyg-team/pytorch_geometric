DataStage TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 When trying to install DataStage Fix Pack on version 8.x Windows Client one of the following errors were received: 

jre\bin\java.exe -jar updater.jar
Unhandled exception 
Type=Segmentation error vmState=0x00040000 
J9Generic_Signal_Number=00000004 ExceptionCode=c0000005

Target=2_30_20090706_38445_lHdSMr (Windows XP 5.1 build 2600 Service Pack 3) 

The install window comes up for a split second then disappears, then it outputs the core dump files. We have attempted this several times, uninstalling and re-installing the entire client, but we can't seem to get it to work. We have successfully installed the fix pack on other PC's in our group. This seems to be isolated specifically to this one client.

Another error that may be received:

C:\IBM\InformationServer\ASBNode\apps\bin\jre\bin\java.exe -jar C:\IBM\InformationServer\updater.jar
JVMDG217: Dump Handler is Processing Signal 11 - Please wait.
JVMDG303: JVM Requesting Jave core file
JVMDG304: Jave core file written to C:\<your path>\javacore.yyyymmdd.nnnnnn.nnnn.txt
JVMDG215: Dump Handler has Processed Exception Signal 11

Looking in the java core file the following is found:

1XHEXCPCODE Exception code: C0000005 Access Violation
1XHEXCPADDRESS Fault address: 07E36AF3 01:000D5AF3 
1XHEXCPMODULE Fault module:

CAUSE
Before applying the Fix Pack, there was an incompatibility between the Java run-time engine (JRE) and the version of Windows. This incompatibility affected the native GUI framework of the JRE and caused the error when the JRE was used to run the update installer (updater.jar) in GUI mode.

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
To work around the problem the Fix Pack should be installed in console mode. For information on installing in console mode please refer to the installation instructions for the particular Fix Pack. 

After the Fix Pack is successfully installed then future Patch or Fix Pack installs using the Update Installer should be able to be installed in GUI mode.
