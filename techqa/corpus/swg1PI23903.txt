ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  Your CICS region experiences an outage such as CICS going short
   on storage above 16M (DFHSM0133).  You have to perform an
   emergency warm restart  (START=AUTO).   When CICS comes up, you
   receive the following messages associated with your pipeline:
   DFHPI0701 I PIPELINE pipename has been created.
   followed by:
   DFHPI0501 CPIH The CICS Pipeline Manager cannot proceed as the
   pipeline is unusable. The pipeline is disabled.
   The dump will show the pipeline status as UNKNOWN.
   CICS will be altered so that if a pipeline resource is in
   initalizing status, it will be enabled again for this
   situation.

   *                      PIPELINEs are in INITING state. When    *
   *                      CICS restarts, the PIPELINEs are        *

   PIPELINE resource are being installed in CICS. Meanwhile
   SOS happened, pipeline resource were left in INITING status.
   After that, CICS is EMERGENCY STARTED. PIPELINE resource stored
   in GCD is checked to perform install again. Because PIPELINE
   resource are in INIT status, procedure considered to install
   PIPELINE resource in DISABLED status.  At last, PIPELINE
   resource are left in DISABLED status.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  In DFHPIDM, routine pidm_get_next_loop has been changed so that
   PIPELINEs in pipeb_initing state are ENABLED.
