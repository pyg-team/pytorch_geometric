Ask the Experts session 
27 August 2014 

Time Questions asked 00:00 Silence 00:01 General introduction 02:48 Technical introduction 04:39 How to troubleshoot web services performance problems? 08:23 How to troubleshoot web services connectivity problems? 14:36 What is IP caching in web services? 18:09 How to troubleshoot JAXB Performance problems in your JAX-WS applications? 28:03 What is the purpose of com.ibm.websphere.webservices.WSDL_Generation_Extra_ClassPath custom property? 33:58 What are some of the tips to reduce/minimize connection latency in troubleshooting Web Services problems? 39:25 Using a third-party JAX-WS web service, how to configure for performance?

See Third party WebService Engine links in Related Information section below 43:52 Is there a minimal tracestring to show the outbound/inbound connections? 

Answer provided by the presenter: 
com.ibm.ws.webservices.trace.*=allcom.ibm.ws.websvcs.trace.*=all 44:57 Slide 10 shows a trace view of the connection pooling. How do you enable that trace?

See MustGather link in Related Information section below. To enable trace you can follow the steps under "collecting manually" Appendix A. 45:46 If a target web service has multiple methods, is it advisable to enable timeouts from the application, rather than use a WebsSphere timeout like "com.ibm.websphere.webservices.http.SocketTimeout"? 47:20 What is the concept of eclipse in WAS? 48:12 How do you configure the default WS-Security policy set, including service provider bindings, to perform request authentication using signed X509 certificates? Is there a decent tutorial/article on developer works perhaps? 

See Configuring a policy set, Tutorial #1 and Tutorial #2 links in Related Information section below. 51:48 What is purpose of org.eclipse.* in plugin directory? 52:29 Is there a minimal trace string to turn on to find out what caused a timeout and 504 problem? Minimal trace to find the source IP address of a HTTP request? 55:11 Is there a default policy set and where can you define a new one? 57:09 If we increase the thread pools in WebSphere, does the response of the webservices increase? 58:29 How to do capacity plan for Async WebSphere in sense of thread pool vs connection pool ?

See Capacity planning with respect to thread and connection pool links in Related Information section below. 1:00:46 If we have 50 webservices requests(REST or SOAP) in application, how do we find out which service is killing the performance of the application? If one service is creating a problem does it impact the remaining services response time as well? 1:07:42 For jax-ws, HTTP transport custom properties for web services applications,the following link http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/rwbs_httptransportprop.html#http_field15 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/rwbs_httptransportprop.html#http_field15]. talks about a read timeout property 'timeout' and its not qualified and this says that it can be set as JVM customer property and also talks about HTTP transport policy. I am interested in that one. 1:11:02 Summary 1:12:53 Closing remarks 1:13:10 End of Call
