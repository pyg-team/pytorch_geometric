Text:
 SECURITY BULLETIN

SUMMARY
 There are security vulnerabilities in versions of Mozilla Firefox that are shipped with versions 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7 of IBM SONAS 

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
IBM SONAS is shipped with Mozilla Firefox. There are vulnerabilities in certain versions of Mozilla Firefox shipped in certain versions of IBM SONAS. These vulnerabilities concern the potential ability of a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7792 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7792]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, when viewing a certificate in the certificate manager if the certificate has an extremely long object identifier (OID). By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVEID: CVE-2017-7791 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7791]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using iframe content and the ''data:'' protocol to spoof the origin of a modal alert.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVEID: CVE-2017-7787 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7787]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using iframes and page reloading to bypass same-origin policy.
CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVEID: CVE-2017-7786 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7786]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking when the image renderer attempts to paint non-displayable SVG elements. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVEID: CVE-2017-7785 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7785]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking when manipulating Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes within the DOM. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.
CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVEID: CVE-2017-7784 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7784]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after free with image observers. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

CVEID: CVE-2017-7779 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7779]
DESCRIPTION: Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by memory safety bugs within the browser engine. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using unknown attack vectors to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system or cause a denial of service.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS
IBM SONAS 

The product is affected when running code releases 1.5.1.0 to 1.5.2.7

REMEDIATION/FIXES
A fix for these issues is in version 1.5.2.8 of IBM SONAS. Customers running an affected version of IBM SONAS should upgrade to 1.5.2.8 or a later version, so that the fix gets applied.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS
Workaround(s) :
Normal operation of IBM SONAS does not require or call for customers to use Firefox to access the Internet. Although IBM recommends that you install a level of IBM SONAS code with a fix, you can avoid these vulnerabilities by not using Mozilla Firefox within your IBM SONAS system to access the Internet.

Mitigation: None
