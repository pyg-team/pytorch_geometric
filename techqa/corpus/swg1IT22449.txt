APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  When I try to import our rules and action, the sequence of the
   rules
   was not the same as the other server who I have exported the
   rules.
   
   So on the new server I must change the possition rule by rule
   and I
   have 156 rules.
   
   Why the export import does not keep the sequence ?
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  Description of issue:  Imported Rules via the web console do not
    preserve exported rule priority.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Description of fix: Added check box option, "Preserve exported
   priority",  to web console import Rules panel to allow the user
   to specify if they want to keep the rules in the exported order
   or not.  This option will only show on the import rules web
   console if the rules were exported by an IBM Control Center
   instance that has this fix applied.  This is because the rule
   exporter had to be changed to save the priority to the exported
   zip file in order for the importer to know the original
   priority.
