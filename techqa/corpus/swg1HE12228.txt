APAR STATUS
 * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.
    
   
   

ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  If the language that is set on the Notes client is not English,
   Content Collector Search in the Lotus Notes search bar does not
   return any documents that were found in the repository that
   match the search criteria. Only documents that were not archived
    by Content Collector are returned.
   
   
    
   
   

LOCAL FIX

PROBLEM SUMMARY
 *  If the language that is set on the Notes client is not English,
   the date of the documents that are found in the repository is
   not in the English default date format (MMM dd, yyyy, hh:mm:ss
   a) that Content Collector Search expects. As a result, no
   documents in the repository match the search criteria and no
   search results are displayed.
   
   
    
   
   

PROBLEM CONCLUSION
 *  Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0.3 LA003 and 4.0.1, the
   date of documents returned from the repository will always use
   the default English date format irrespective of the Notes client
   language that was set.

   documents in the repository match the search criteria and no
   search results are displayed.
   
   Starting with IBM Content Collector 4.0.0.3 LA003, the date of
   documents returned from the repository will always use the
