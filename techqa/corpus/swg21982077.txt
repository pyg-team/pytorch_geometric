 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 Reports are failing intermittently with Error: DPR-ERR-2056 The Report Server is not responding. 

SYMPTOM
When we execute Reports in distributed environment intermittent failures observed with error: DPR-ERR-2056 The Report Server is not responding. 

The cogserver.log of one of the dispatcher will show below errors:

Ensure that the process with a process ID 4915570 is started. If the cause of problem cannot be determined, increase the logging level for the target service in the IBM Cognos Administration tool and reproduce the conditions that caused the error. If the problem persists, see the problem determination information on the IBM Cognos Support Portal page at http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Information_Management/Cognos [http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Information_Management/Cognos]


CAUSE
While executing a report, cognos will try loading the module: <cognos install dir>/bin/RSBIBusPlugin.cpi. This is dependant on library files RSReportService.so and libRSRequest.so.

In this case, the file <cognos install dir>/bin/libRSRequest.so was missing.


ENVIRONMENT
Unix



RESOLVING THE PROBLEM
Steps to resolve the issue :- 

1. Copy the library file: <cognos install dir>/bin/libRSRequest.so from a working dispatcher. It is fine to copy the file while the dispatcher are in running state. 

 

2. Place the copied file into <cognos install dir>/bin/ directory belonging to the dispatcher where this file is missing. You can copy the file even if the dispatcher is in running state. There is no need to stop the Dispatcher service. There is also no need to rebuild the p2pd.ear file just incase if Cognos is deployed on WAS or any other Application server. 

 

The missing Library file is automatically picked up during the next report execution.
