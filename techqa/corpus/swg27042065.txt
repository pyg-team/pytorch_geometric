This refresh pack is a cumulative maintenance package for a specific product and applies to all distributed operating systems. It is a single package that bundles a number of individual fixes.

V8.5 Refresh Pack 5 is intended to be used on IBM Business Process Manager Express, IBM Business Process Manager Standard, IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, and IBM Business Process Manager Advanced - Process Server installations.

By installing V8.5 Refresh Pack 5, you will raise the fix level of your product, either IBM Business Process Manager Express, IBM Business Process Manager Standard, IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, or IBM Business Process Manager Advanced - Process Server, to Version 8.5.5.

Note: You can roll out maintenance incrementally in an IBM Business Process Manager installation that consists of a Process Center and multiple Process Servers. This approach allows you to continually run production applications during the upgrade and regression test period. See [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=matt&product=was-nd-mp&topic=trun_svr_conf_backup] Performing a rolling upgrade [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.5/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/tmig_rolling_upgrade.html] in the product documentation.

Upgrading the Process Designer 

After you update your Process Center with a fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, you must update the Process Designer to the same level. To make the updates, download the Process Designer file again and run the installation. Only the fixes or changes are applied.


About this task
When you install the fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, the IBM Process Designer.zip file is updated also. You must download it and install the updated Process Designer to the directory where you already installed Process Designer.


Procedure 

 1. Open the Process Center.
    
    
 2. Click the IBM Process Designer Download option. 
    
    
 3. When you are prompted, save the IBM Process Designer.zip file to your file system. This file contains everything that you need to install and run IBM Process Designer. Depending on your network connection, the download might take several minutes to complete.
    
    
 4. Extract the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file to a temporary directory on your file system.
    
    
 5. Open a command window and change to the directory where you extracted the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file. 
    
    
    Important: If you are running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008, right-click the command prompt and select Run as administrator.
    
    
 6. Run one of the following commands to update the Process Designer. Use the same command that you used to install the Process Designer.  * Default location (C:\IBM\ProcessDesigner\v8.5)  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat 
        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat
          
          
       
       
     * Different location  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat install_location 
        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat install_location
          
          
       
       If the location has spaces in the directory name, put the whole location in quotation marks. The following examples show how to install to a different location.  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat D:\IBM\PD 
        * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat "D:\Process Designer\"
       
       
    
    


Results 
IBM Process Designer is updated. Only the fixes or changes are applied. Installation messages are recorded in the %TEMP%\IBMProcessDesignerInstall.log file, where the %TEMP% variable is typically set to C:\Documents and Settings\current_user_name\Local Settings\Temp.
