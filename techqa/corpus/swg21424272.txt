Performance recommendations for compacting databases: 

 * Do execute when the database is off-line. 
 * Do not run during peak operational hours. 
 * System databases, such as events4 and admin4, should be compacted only when the server is offline.
   

For more information, refer to the technote Compacting in-use system databases [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=899&uid=swg21244011].
