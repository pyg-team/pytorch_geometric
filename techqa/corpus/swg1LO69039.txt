ERROR DESCRIPTION
 *  In the customer's environment, SiteMinder is used for
   authentication.   The customer has IHS/WebSphere servers acting
   as reverse proxy servers, sending requests to
   Domino.   The servers are not using WebSphere authentication,
   however they are still including websphere authentication
   headers in thehttp requests.  Domino returns an error 400 when
   receivingthese requests, and throws the error "Request contains
   an HTTPheader that does not contain a colon".   If
   "HTTPEnableConnectorHeaders=1" is enabled on Domino, the
   requests are processed, however, this is not a viable solution
   for the customer as (1) they are not using these headers for
   authentication and (2) customer believes that enabling this
   setting presents a potential security risk.
   
   Customer expectation is that they should be able to use IHS
   servers as proxy servers, without using Websphere
   authentication, but this error is preventing that.
