 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)

PROBLEM(ABSTRACT)
 mbatchd cannot start with the error: createThreadedChild: socketpair() failed, Too many open files. 

RESOLVING THE PROBLEM


mbatchd cannot start up with the message "mbatchd: createThreadedChild: socketpair() failed, Too many open files." 

 This occurs because mbatchd has reached the threashold of the open file limit and cannot open any new files.

 To resolve this issue, increase the open file limit for the mbatchd process. Because mbatchd is started by sbatchd, this must be done for sbatchd as well.

 1. Run "badmin hshutdown" on the master machine to shutdown the sbatchd daemon.
2. Run "badmin mbatchdrestart" to shutdown the mbatchd daemon.
3. Change to the root user and check the limit. If the limit is too small, use the system command limit or ulimit to increase it first.
4. Run "badmin hstartup" to start the sbatchd and mbatchd daemons again.
5. Monitor the cluster and see whether the problem still happens.
