   STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

   preview as follows:
   
   1 Create a new Security group called TEST and save. By default
   it will grant access to Start Center.
   2. Create a new MM group, that has DMMAXGROUP,
   3. Create new MM record with the group and use sql where to pick
   groupname TEST
   4. APPROVE, Create package, distribute Target
   5. Upload and deploy (you can use preview mode)
   
   You will receive the following error:
   
   "Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.applicationauth'
   with unique index 'appauth_ndx1'. The duplicate key value is
   (TEST_SC, STARTCNTR, SHOWPORTLETDETAILS).
   com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Cannot insert
   duplicate key row in object 'dbo.applicationauth' with unique
   index 'appauth_ndx1'. The duplicate key value is (TEST_SC,
   STARTCNTR,SHOWPORTLETDETAILS).
   
   This is due to the introduction of the Start Center signature
   security option SHOWPORTLETDETAILS to address APAR  IV54674 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV54674].
