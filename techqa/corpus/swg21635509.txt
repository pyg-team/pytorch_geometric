QUESTION
 How do I enable logging for TaskMaster Web in Datacap TaskMaster Capture 8.1? 

ANSWER
These are the steps to turn on logging for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Web versions 8.1 or higher. Although there are logging configuration options that can be used for different levels of logging, these steps are specific to providing maximum logging to troubleshoot Taskmaster Web issues when they occur. If desired, logging may be left on continuously for a test or development system, but should be set to minimum on a production server, as it will negatively impact performance.
Enabling Taskmaster Web Logging


 1. Enable logging.  1. Navigate to the \Datacap\tmweb.net folder and edit server.ini. 
     2. In the [General] section, set the following:  * WriteLog = 1
        
        
     3. In the [Log] section, set the following:  * Path = C:\Datacap\TaskRun\tmweb.log (or other valid path and filename) 
         * Overwrite = 1 
         * ShowTime = 1 
         * FlushBuffer = 1
        
        
     4. Save the file.
    
    
 2. Restart IIS. 
 3. Open a browser, run Taskmaster Web and generate the error or perform the action for which logging information is needed. 
 4. The log file will have the name tmweb.log.X.log where X is the log sequence number and will be located in the C:\Datacap\TaskRun folder, or the folder specified in the Path configuration setting. 
 5. Taskmaster Web also contains an error log that is always enabled. Should the web page itself error out, there will be a file called pacuerr.log located in the C:\Datacap\tmweb.net\App_Data folder.


Additional Information 

Taskmaster Web logging can be turned off by changing WriteLog to 0 and restarting IIS. In the Server.ini file, the Severity option uses 0 for most details and 9 for fewest messages. Additionally, ignore the comment line above the Path setting as the option is obsolete and no longer used.
